        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Can it evolve? Holding his throbbing head, Liang Qu didn't have time to examine it carefully, and hurriedly surfaced to catch his breath, panting heavily for half a minute before his body felt a bit better.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the domination can't be used recklessly, as overusing it might turn me into an idiot, and failure would be even more dangerous."</p><p></p><p>However, the evolvability given by Ze Ding piqued Liang Qu's curiosity. The two-meter-long Tahua alligator was almost the limit, could it evolve further?</p><p></p><p>Communicating again, Ze Ding shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>[Can consume 80 points of water essence to evolve the Tahua alligator into an Angle Wood alligator.]</p><p></p><p>80 points? Is that a lot or a little?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had no concept of it, and moreover, he didn't have a single drop of water essence on hand, so he could only give up for now.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, he went back into the water, eager to examine the suspected precious lotus rhizome, the main harvest of this trip.</p><p></p><p>Prying a piece from the mud, Liang Qu let the Pig Witch Dragon come close and eat a piece.</p><p></p><p>The Pig Witch Dragon came paddling over, shaking its head and gulping it down greedily.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt the cheerful emotions through the spiritual connection with the Pig Witch Dragon, and combined with the traces of the lotus rhizome being gnawed on the ground, he was sure the lotus rhizome was a good thing, not poisonous, and the alligator lying here was no coincidence.</p><p></p><p>After the verification, he no longer hesitated, tearing off a piece and wiping off the mud, controlling the water flow so it wouldn't spill into his mouth and nose, then taking big bites.</p><p></p><p>After such hard work tonight, a steamed bun had long been digested, and his stomach was rumbling again. If it weren't for the slight improvement in his physical fitness from the infusion of the Ze Ling, he would have become a flickering candle in the wind again.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't want to experience that kind of suffering again.</p><p></p><p>Hunger is the most unbearable thing in the world.</p><p></p><p>The lotus rhizome from the deep water didn't have the same amount of mucus and fiber as ordinary lotus rhizome, with a faint watery aroma, and the texture was vastly different from ordinary lotus rhizome, crisp like an apple, unexpectedly delicious, and he could finish a section in just a few bites.</p><p></p><p>And once it entered his stomach, it turned into a warm current, and the three fingers he had cut while dominating were actually healing at a visible speed! It really is a precious plant! Liang Qu was overjoyed, but this precious plant seemed to be more of a healing type, and since he didn't have any serious injuries, the energy went to make up for the deficiency left by the long-term hunger.</p><p></p><p>Even without a mirror, he could still feel the improvement in his spirit and vitality, no longer looking as haggard and emaciated as he was at the beginning, avoided by everyone.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity that there's no more detailed understanding, perhaps its uses are not limited to this? [Water Essence +0.1]</p><p></p><p>Water Essence!</p><p></p><p>Is this the Water Essence? Liang Qu stared wide-eyed at the prompt in front of him, unable to believe that the long-awaited Water Essence had been so easily obtained.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that obtaining the healing-type precious plant was already a pleasant surprise, but the surprises didn't end there.</p><p></p><p>Wait, one piece of lotus rhizome is 0.1, so if he eats it all, wouldn't that be several?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was overjoyed, and dug out a few more pieces, eating them all in one go, but the results were not as he had hoped.</p><p></p><p>The Water Essence could indeed be obtained repeatedly, but not all lotus rhizomes had it, only the ones near the Pig Witch Dragon's location had it, and the farther away ones didn't.</p><p></p><p>The truly useful ones were about twenty-three sections, and adding the two sections he had eaten, it was equivalent to 2.5 Water Essence, but unfortunately, the amount of each lotus rhizome was not small, and he had already eaten a few and couldn't eat any more.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try how much the fusion degree can increase with 0.2 Water Essence." Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>From what he could see, the Ze Ling Water Monkey had been of great help to him, becoming so powerful after just being infused, changing from a flickering candle in the wind to no longer worrying about food, and after reaching 100% fusion, what else could it do? As for the Pig Witch Dragon's evolution into a fierce water beast, while it was good to be able to evolve, compared to the lotus rhizome, Liang Qu realized how exaggerated 80 points of Water Essence was, it was completely inadequate, and he could only seek opportunities in the future.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, Ze Ding suddenly trembled, and a few faint blue light dots floated up.</p><p></p><p>A illusory water monkey appeared behind him, the light dots seeming to have found their direction, flowing into it.</p><p></p><p>[Furnace Master: Liang Qu]</p><p>[Refine Ze Ling: Water Monkey (White) (Fusion Degree: 5%â†‘)]</p><p>[Water Essence: None]</p><p>[River Favor Degree: None]</p><p>[Water Beast Domination: Tahua Alligator (Can Evolve)]</p><p>[Evaluation: The Ze Ling Water Monkey originates from the great Huaizhou Lord, but its potential is not fully tapped, the small person is weak in spirit and body.]</p><p></p><p>"Didn't it increase immediately?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked at the arrow on the fusion degree, frowning slightly, but at least he could feel that he was more at home in the water environment, so the fusion time shouldn't be too long, which was somewhat satisfactory.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The acquisition of the essence of the wetlands is simpler than imagined. As long as you can obtain it, there's no need to panic, you'll be able to fill it up sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Shun, the "white stripe in the waves", can stay underwater for seven days and seven nights. Is it too much for this water monkey to stay for three days and three nights? Thinking about this, Liang Qu's anxiety about coming to this parallel world has largely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In the previous world, no matter how indifferent it was, if someone was about to starve, a couple of steamed buns wouldn't be a big deal. But here, being indifferent to the scarcity of resources is the norm, and without family or friends around, it was truly bewildering and unsettling at first.</p><p></p><p>A certain famous centenarian once said that the purpose of living is to find peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his water skills, Liang Qu has now gained the capital to settle down and make a living.</p><p></p><p>After taking a breath while floating on the water, Liang Qu looked at his new subordinate - the Pig Dragon!</p><p></p><p>Though its thick skin and tough flesh were hit hard by the stones, it suffered no real damage. At the moment, it was lying still in the water, no different from a domestic dog, and even more human-like through the spiritual connection.</p><p></p><p>Evolution is impossible, the 80 points of wetland essence are too much, but after all, it's a Pig Dragon, it must be a good hunter!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sluggish movements of the Pig Dragon, Liang Qu suddenly slapped his forehead: "Oh no, it's really going into hibernation!"</p><p></p><p>Success or failure, it's all the same.</p><p></p><p>The new subordinate, due to the cold weather, had sluggish blood flow and slow movements, transmitting a listless mood. It's not that it couldn't burst out, but this was its normal state. Helping to catch fish would be a challenge.</p><p></p><p>"You can't move in the cold, so from now on I'll call you 'Can't Move'. Well, just keep lying here and be a watchdog, bite any small fish or shrimp that tries to sneak in!"</p><p></p><p>The Pig Dragon got its name, burrowing into the mud and wagging its tail. When the mud and water became calm, this place looked exactly the same as before, and no one would guess that a treasure was hidden underneath.</p><p></p><p>On the shore of the wetlands.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu surfaced, looked around to make sure no one was there, and picked up the yellow fish to head home.</p><p></p><p>The yellow fish from the wetlands are not like the sea fish of the previous world - they don't die immediately when taken out of the water. Liang Qu used reed leaves to tie their heads and tails, a fishing technique to keep them fresh for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the road, Liang Qu felt cheerful, feeling that what he was carrying was not just a fish, but a heavy load of copper coins.</p><p></p><p>It seems that to get by, one really needs a bit of a "golden finger". Just a few hours ago, he was still lonely and bewildered, but now he feels that life isn't that bad after all, at least better than most of the common people in Yixing City.</p><p></p><p>80 coins is not a small amount, but with winter coming, he needs two sets of clothes, as his current ones are all tattered. There's also salt, rice, soap, stools, pots, and bowls... Liang Qu suddenly felt that 80 coins might not be that much.</p><p></p><p>But with his abilities, his life will only get better.</p><p></p><p>The key problem now is - no boat! A person without long-term planning will have immediate worries.</p><p></p><p>After refining the water monkey's wetland spirit, his underwater ability has greatly improved, and he can catch good goods even without a boat. But without a boat for cover, it would be suspicious if he did this too often.</p><p></p><p>Even if you have extraordinary fishing talent and know the movement of the fish schools, you can't be that exaggerated, right?</p><p></p><p>Without even a boat, is he going to have to rely on diving to fish in the cold winter from now on?</p><p></p><p>Originally, there was a boat at his home, but unfortunately it was snatched away by a local ruffian named Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Zhang is notorious in Yixing City for his bullying and arrogance, relying on the few days of martial arts training he received at the dojo. After Liang Qu's "father" died, the family's biggest asset - a black-canopy boat - naturally caught Zhang's eye. He used the excuse of Liang's father asking him to drink before his death to take the boat as debt repayment.</p><p></p><p>A fishing boat is the lifeline of a fisherman, they practically live and sleep on it, while the home is just a mud-walled shack. Who would borrow money from a ruffian to drink? Damn it, no one dares to offend Zhang for the sake of an orphan like him.</p><p></p><p>What's even more infuriating is that Zhang came back later, saying the boat wasn't enough to pay the debt, and robbed him of the only three dou of rice he had left!</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just a special way of "eating up the last of the family"?</p><p></p><p>All the dire straits were forced upon him by this scoundrel!</p><p></p><p>"I have to find an opportunity to get the stuff back. That would make it easier to cover up my 'golden finger'. Once I've saved up enough money, I'll go to the town to learn martial arts, see what's so special about those martial arts masters, and having a good identity will make things much simpler."</p><p></p><p>As Liang Qu was pondering, he unknowingly arrived at his doorstep, only to find someone waiting for him there.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, how have you considered the matter?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With long ape-like arms, a slender wasp-like waist, and mantis-like legs, in other words, he had long arms and legs, a slim waist, and broad shoulders. Coupled with the thick leather belt around his waist, it tightly bound his clothes, revealing his figure, making Liang Qu appear tall, upright, and extraordinary, like a long spear.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong praised loudly, "Good, this is the vigor of youth!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, my title of the most handsome is about to be replaced!" </p><p></p><p>Cao Rang sneered, "Senior Brother Xu, you can just give up, it's always been me, right?"</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the eldest senior brother is not here, he has the most money and can definitely give the best gifts, who knows, maybe some miraculous elixir."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Master, have you notified the eldest senior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong nodded, "I wrote the letter last night, but haven't sent it yet. I'll send someone later, it should get a reply in about a month, and he will definitely make up for it then."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liang Qu's puzzled look, Xu Zishuai explained, "The eldest senior brother has joined the Western Army, and is now a battalion commander. I heard he's about to be promoted again, so it's inconvenient for him to come back, that's why you haven't seen him."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu understood.</p><p></p><p>The group chatted for a while, mostly asking about Liang Qu's living situation.</p><p></p><p>After about half an hour, the third senior brother, Lu Gang, proposed to take his leave, as he was not good with words and preferred forging, already wanting to go back and design some long spears.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, just come to my house tonight. You go straight from the entrance of the Yang residence, you'll see a grain shop called Xu's, there's a lane next to it, go in and keep walking, you'll see a big anvil, that's my house."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I remember. Third senior brother, take care."</p><p></p><p>After Lu Gang left, the rest chatted for a while, feeling it was about time, and one by one they left, until only the three youngest disciples remained.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong took a sip of tea, "Little Nine, how thick is the qi in your chest now?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't want to lie about his cultivation, as that would ultimately harm his own interests, and honestly said, "About the thickness of my index finger."</p><p></p><p>At this, Hu Qi and Xiang Changsong were both shocked: "Senior brother, you've only been cultivating for a month, how come your progress is so fast? I haven't seen you take any pills!"</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, I caught another precious fish." Liang Qu scratched his head, "It was an eel, vermilion red all over, with a cow's tail at the end. I was overjoyed at the time and just cooked and ate it. After eating, my whole body felt hot, and I kept punching, and after that, the qi in my index finger became as thick as a chopstick."</p><p></p><p>"Vermilion red eel, with a cow's tail?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi and Xiang Changsong fell into contemplation, as they couldn't recall any such precious fish in their memory.</p><p></p><p>"Master Yang, do you know what kind of fish this is?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either, but the wilderness of the Jianghuai region is so vast, there are too many unknown fish species to be surprised about." Yang Dongxiong concluded.</p><p></p><p>Not knowing is right, I just made it up.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was about to say he had also caught a cow-horned bream, which he thought was the best effect fish in his knowledge, but then he realized that this fish couldn't directly make his qi grow to the thickness of an index finger either, so he just made up another story.</p><p></p><p>There are all kinds of unknown species in ancient rivers and lakes, let alone modern ones.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are red-blooded bass that weigh one to two catties, and cow-horned bream that weigh two catties, so naturally there must be other precious fish that weigh ten or even a hundred catties, the effects of which would not be strange at all.</p><p></p><p>"But senior brother, to be able to cultivate to the thickness of a chopstick in just a month without taking any pills, your natural talent is really good. Master, when you have time, maybe you can help senior brother assess his innate qualities, see how his talent is. Bone-reading can only reveal so much."</p><p></p><p>Innate qualities?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu silently chewed on this new term, not understanding its meaning.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to see Liang Qu's confusion, Hu Qi said, "This 'innate qualities' does not mean one's predestined fate, but rather one's natural talent. Senior brother, you can understand it this way, the specifics will be clear once the assessment is done."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Yang Dongxiong shook his head, "I don't have any incense ashes left, the tools are not complete, the assessment of the innate qualities will have to wait for a while."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu asked, "Master, earlier I heard Senior Brother Hu say that as long as the qi in my chest is as thick as my little finger, I can break through the skin barrier. I didn't know how to break through before, and forcefully pushed it to the thickness of my index finger, will there be any problems?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about that, there's no difference. After breaking through the skin barrier, you still need to continue accumulating the qi in your chest, the little finger thickness is just the minimum requirement to break through, having it at index finger thickness will only make it easier."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt relieved. He had indeed been worried before, as he had never encountered this before, and the novels he had read were definitely not to be taken as facts, the imaginary and the real were bound to be different, so he couldn't help but feel anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Your injury hasn't healed yet, you can wait until it's healed before cultivating. For now, just follow Hu Qi, he has experience in the training hall, and..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll teach you myself, and also let him give you some common knowledge and key points. Then I'll have Xiangchang Song take you to the Changchun Medical Clinic to get familiar with the place, so it'll be more convenient for you to get medicine in the future."</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong settled the matter in a few sentences. He was taking Liang Qu as his disciple, but Liang Qu's realm was really too low, so there was no need for him to teach personally. Letting Hu Qi do it would be the same.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, can you read?"</p><p></p><p>"I can read a little, but not much."</p><p></p><p>"Then you'll have to make time to learn to read at the private school every day. I'll arrange a teacher for you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>By the time Yang Dongxiong finished explaining everything, it was 9 o'clock in the morning. Liang Qu and the two senior brothers did not linger, and went together to the Changchun Medical Clinic.</p><p></p><p>The Changchun Medical Clinic was the largest clinic in the entire Pingyang Town. The main hall alone had four or five doctors sitting behind the counter for consultations, and there was a long queue at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi and the others had no intention of queuing, and led Liang Qu into the main hall.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, Xiangchang Song shouted at the counter, "Shopkeeper Chen, this is the ninth disciple my master has just taken in, my shidi. Come and introduce him to the place."</p><p></p><p>The gray-haired shopkeeper hurriedly left the counter and came forward to greet them. He looked at Liang Qu and complimented, "So this is the Ninth Young Master, isn't it? The Ninth Young Master is truly a talented person, unforgettable at first sight. You all come and call the servants, be quick about it."</p><p></p><p>A few busy little servants put down their work and came forward to greet him, but they didn't call him "Ninth Young Master", they called him "Ninth Master".</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember clearly?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, shopkeeper, we remember clearly."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go back to work." Shopkeeper Chen turned around and said, "As per the usual rule, as long as you come, it'll be a 50% discount."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Shopkeeper Chen."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome, your coming is an honor for us."</p><p></p><p>After a simple chat, the three of them were about to leave the clinic. Before leaving, Hu Qi grabbed three more packages of medicine, but the shopkeeper simply didn't take the money, treating it as a celebration for Yang's acceptance of another good disciple.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, basking in the compliments, thought of the IOU he had left with Chen Qingjiang when he went to the clinic to get medicine, and felt a sense of wonder. </p><p></p><p>This was truly a meteoric rise.</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the martial arts hall, Hu Qi began to explain to Liang Qu how to break through the realms.</p><p></p><p>The method is very simple, just to agitate the blood qi, that is, the long qi in the chest, let the long qi circulate and dissolve, stimulating the entire skin.</p><p></p><p>When stimulated to a certain degree, the skin will have a leap-like increase in strength, as tough as cowhide.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation has certain dangers, it's best to have someone guide you. When we get back to the martial arts hall, I'll demonstrate it for you again."</p><p></p><p>"After the skin, flesh, bone, and blood four realms, there are seven more, divided into galloping horse, wolf smoke, hunting tiger, reaching elephant, soaring dragon, furnace, and rainbow transformation."</p><p></p><p>"At the galloping horse realm, the peak can pull dozens of galloping horses without moving.</p><p></p><p>At the wolf smoke realm, the blood qi is like wolf smoke, billowing dozens of feet high, like a celestial being, the power unleashed is terrifying.</p><p></p><p>At the hunting tiger realm, the blood qi surges like the tide, the power unleashed, common people seeing it will be as fearful as a weak rabbit facing a fierce tiger, their liver and gall will be shattered.</p><p></p><p>At the reaching elephant realm, with a wave of the hand the earth trembles, mountains crumble and rivers are dammed, one can become a great general.</p><p></p><p>At the soaring dragon realm, one becomes a heavenly dragon, can break free of the constraints of heaven and earth, leap three thousand feet into the clouds, becoming a martial saint of the nation.</p><p></p><p>As for the furnace and rainbow transformation, I don't know much, only heard that rainbow transformation can turn one's physical body into a flying rainbow, transcending to the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Is the martial dao in this world really so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was not sure if the description contained any exaggeration, but it did sound incredibly impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Then what realm is my Master at?"</p><p></p><p>"Hunting tiger."</p><p></p><p>"Hunting tiger!?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's pupils contracted, a hunting tiger expert in the small Pingyang Town? Could the martial dao really be so easily broken through, like picking cabbages? Hu Qi laughed and said, "Shidi, do you know there are three martial arts halls in Pingyang Town?"</p><p></p><p>"I know."</p><p></p><p>"The other two are staying in Pingyang Town because they can only open a hall here. Master Yang is staying in Pingyang Town because this is his hometown."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly understood, it's just the difference between a hundred points and ninety-nine points, isn't it? The martial dao in this world is much stronger than he had imagined, and he became even more eager to break through the realms.</p><p></p><p>As for the Damocles sword that had once hung over his head, the old fart Zhao, what a loser?

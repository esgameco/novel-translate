        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The three fish baskets full of catch were unloaded from the boat, attracting the attention of the surrounding fishermen, especially when the most conspicuous spotted fish appeared, sparking some discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Whose boat is this? Did they come across a school of fish? They're so lucky, oh, and there's a spotted fish too!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't recognize it, it looks familiar, but the skilled hands at the dock are just a few, this boat doesn't seem to be theirs."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the small boat of that Ashui? That scabby one who insisted on changing it."</p><p></p><p>"Who's Ashui?"</p><p></p><p>"You forgot, he's the young man from the Liang Dajiang family, the good-looking one."</p><p></p><p>"He's still alive? Wasn't he an orphan?"</p><p></p><p>"Shh, he's doing well, don't talk nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the fishermen present were somewhat surprised, obviously not expecting an orphan to be able to survive on his own, which was quite rare.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk tsk, he's a poor child, but at least it seems he can support himself, not easy."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like our dock is about to produce another skilled hand! Too bad he's not my son, he's useless."</p><p></p><p>The fishermen sighed and discussed a bit enviously, and after the fish baskets were carried into the fishmonger's stall, they all dispersed.</p><p></p><p>It was rare for an orphan to survive on their own, but since it didn't concern them, they were just curious, not expecting the boy to amount to much in the future.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Lin Baosong weighed the fish and did the accounting: "Including the spotted fish, it's a total of 132 wen, how about 135 wen for you?"</p><p></p><p>"Give me one tael of silver shards plus 10 wen."</p><p></p><p>"One tael of silver shards?" Lin Baosong fell into thought.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, the price level has been stable, and the official price is about one liang of silver for a thousand copper coins, but silver holds its value, so a thousand copper coins are definitely not enough for one liang of silver, it would take 1,100 or 1,200.</p><p></p><p>125 wen exchanged for one tael of silver shards would be a slight profit.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Lin Baosong agreed, taking back the handful of copper coins he had taken out and exchanging them for one silver shard plus 10 copper coins.</p><p></p><p>"Take care."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>After leaving the fishmonger's stall, Liang Qu habitually went to the foot stall to eat, still the same old three dishes, eating and pondering.</p><p></p><p>"I already have two liang and three qian, still lacking four liang and seven qian to gather enough money to go to the martial arts school. If I can save 100 wen every day, it will only take two months, but it's too conspicuous, I need to do it gradually."</p><p></p><p>With the help of the fat catfish, Liang Qu's daily catch was higher than the average fisherman, but a few days ago it was only 30 wen per day, suddenly spiking so high was suspicious, it needed some time to adapt.</p><p></p><p>As for why he suddenly sold more than 100 wen today, who doesn't have the luck to come across a school of fish sometimes?</p><p></p><p>Just like catching yellow croaker, one or two times doesn't matter, but when it happens frequently, you need a proper excuse.</p><p></p><p>"And the autumn tax is coming up soon, the tax money is also a problem, two months is not enough at all, if I can't pay the tax I'll be arrested for forced labor, damn this feudal society."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had a clear plan for his future, he must go learn martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Not only to come and see how big the world is, but also because there is a Zhao family hanging over his head.</p><p></p><p>Damn that old bastard, like the Sword of Damocles.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu angrily cleaned up the last bite of rice, paid the bill, and went back home, lying down on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"If only I could catch a precious tiger-headed spotted fish like that."</p><p></p><p>He thought about how someone on the neighboring dock had caught a five-jin tiger-headed spotted fish the previous month, which was bought by a martial arts teacher for the high price of three liang and five qian of silver.</p><p></p><p>This kind of fish has a miraculous effect on cultivating the body, one fish can save a martial artist a month's worth of effort, and it may be even more precious than the lotus root he discovered.</p><p></p><p>Just as Liang Qu was thinking about whether to have the six-whisker catfish look for it, a noisy commotion suddenly came from outside, but it soon subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, another family quarrel."</p><p></p><p>In this small place, whenever a household argued loudly, the neighbors would hear it clearly.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought that when he had money in the future, he would definitely buy a big courtyard, with ten rooms in and out, and ten beautiful maids, slender-waisted and long-legged, fair and beautiful, serving tea in a coquettish manner, living the life of a lord.</p><p></p><p>"Knock, knock knock."</p><p></p><p>The knocking sound interrupted his fantasy, and Liang Qu got up in surprise, wondering if it was Zheng Xiang again.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me."</p><p></p><p>The visitor was a bit wordy, but Liang Qu hurriedly got up and opened the door, he was too familiar with this voice to forget.</p><p></p><p>Opening the door, Liang Qu saw Chen Qingjiang shoving a small cloth bag at him with a gloomy face, then turning and leaving without a word.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen! This is...?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't even chase after him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The silhouette had already returned home, so he had no choice but to open the cloth bag, only to find that it was full of rice, a substantial amount of about five or six catties.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he understood everything. To earn a little more money, Uncle Chen had to walk over ten miles to the town every day to sell fish, and he was also a simple-hearted person, probably completely unaware that he now had the ability to support himself, still thinking that his life was still difficult.</p><p></p><p>"This is unnecessary."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sighed. He dared not forget the kindness of that one meal.</p><p></p><p>Without that one meal, he might have starved to death at home long ago, only because of his martial arts training, the autumn taxes required silver, and he never had the chance to do anything.</p><p></p><p>Presumably the recent argument was between Uncle Chen and his wife?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt very ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang returned the rice to his home, and the atmosphere in the house remained silent.</p><p></p><p>His wife Adi sat in the corner of the room, sulking by herself, not even looking at her husband, only burying her head and mending the threads. If it were an ordinary day, she would not have refused to accept the rice, but their younger son had been ill recently, the savings were gone, and there were still taxes to be paid after the autumn - that was the tax for three people!</p><p></p><p>This was not just putting on a brave face.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the two of them faced each other in silence.</p><p></p><p>The flickering candlelight in the room cast a dim reddish glow on the walls.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Chen Qingjiang suddenly got up, the wind from the movement pressing down the candle flame, causing it to sway and almost prick Adi's hand. She angrily looked up, but to her surprise, her body suddenly felt light.</p><p></p><p>Adi's mind went blank, blushing with embarrassment: "What are you doing again?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang hugged his wife, lowered his head and blew out the candle, speaking in a muffled voice: "Sleeping!"</p><p></p><p>"The two older children are sleeping!"</p><p></p><p>"Those two little pigs, what are they afraid of?"</p><p></p><p>Adi's mind went blank, her face flushed, and the previous irritation was gone.</p><p></p><p>When dealing with women, this is the way to do it.</p><p></p><p>At the door, hearing the commotion from inside, Liang Qu withdrew his hand that was about to knock on the door, feeling embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to go and apologize, thinking that the quarrel between the husband and wife was not good for him, but ended up witnessing this awkward scene.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the bag of rice, Liang Qu could only take it back home and wait until another day to speak.</p><p></p><p>For the next half month or so, Liang Qu was selling fish at the dock, gradually increasing his daily fish catch.</p><p></p><p>From forty coins, it gradually increased to eighty coins, portraying himself as a young and capable fisherman.</p><p></p><p>The average fisherman's daily income was around sixty to seventy coins, and only experienced fishermen like Chen Qingjiang could earn eighty coins, with only a few exceptional ones earning over a hundred coins.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, at fifteen or sixteen years old as an orphan, achieving this level amazed all the fishermen on the dock.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he gained a bit of fame and received a lot of admiration and envy.</p><p></p><p>But there was one thing that was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, Liang Qu wanted to go to Uncle Chen's house to return the rice, but he couldn't find anyone there several times. It seemed that the whole family had gone out to work as soon as it was daylight, perfectly missing him every time. This was puzzling.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it shouldn't be like this. Could it be that Sister Adi had also gone out to work? Were the children being taken along since no one was home? Liang Qu walked to the dock with these thoughts, only to unexpectedly see someone he didn't want to see.</p><p></p><p>The matchmaker had been successfully attracted by Liang Qu's recent performance and came to his house several times to try to arrange a marriage!</p><p></p><p>"I've already said that I have no plans to get married for the time being."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu quickly jumped onto the boat, untied the ropes, and quickly sailed away.</p><p></p><p>The silhouette had a somewhat hurried air about it, and the fishermen on the shore thought Liang Qu was embarrassed, teasing him one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Don't bully Ashuai, he's still a virgin!"</p><p>"Looks like he still doesn't understand the charm of women!"</p><p>"What a pity, why don't you introduce him to me?"</p><p>"Go away, you old bachelor!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't expect that after displaying his "fishing talent" on the dock, he would become a hot commodity in the marriage market. He had to keep avoiding the dock until he finally felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the lotus root water area, he used the boat oar to slap the surface of the water.</p><p></p><p>The huge sow dragon slowly emerged from the water, seeing the boat it swished its tail, placing its claws on the boat's edge.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around and saw no one, so he took the fishing net and the inflated pig bladder and submerged himself in the water.</p><p></p><p>The man and the beast searched the water for the appearance of Afei.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's daily maximum fish catch was around 150 coins, but he could only openly show 80 coins, so the remaining time was spent searching for the precious fish, especially the fat catfish, which he had no time for.</p><p></p><p>But the precious fish were hard to find, and he hadn't found them for several days, until just now when Afei's spiritual connection transmitted a message - they had found the precious fish!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

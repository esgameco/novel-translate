        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flowing water crashed against the stone wall, and the constant sound of rushing water seemed to turn into the ghastly laughter of the skeleton.</p><p></p><p>It was quite eerie.</p><p></p><p>The space was too cramped, only about two or three square meters, and upon entering, one would be face-to-face with the skeleton's skull.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu crouched down and did not see any written information, only this crystal-clear white bone that was far from ordinary, and the entire skeleton was broken, certainly not a normal death.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown how long it had been dead.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary people would turn into white bones within about 300 days after death, and even faster in a damp environment, but warriors were not ordinary people, and Liang Qu had not seen any systematic discussion of the decomposition time of different realms, so he had no reference.</p><p></p><p>The water centipede swam to the side of a thick leg bone and crawled out from the hole.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying you ate the stuff inside the bones?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu picked up a leg bone, and it was completely hollow inside, suddenly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>The corpse had already rotted away before Awei came, and even the ligaments between the bones had been, held together by vines, or Awei would only have eaten the powdery substance inside the bones.</p><p></p><p>As if worried that Liang Qu would leave, or as if his intrusion had disturbed the delicate balance between the vines and the corpse, the skull that had been hanging from the vines suddenly fell, scattering the entire skeleton and exposing the rock wall behind it.</p><p></p><p>In the dim light, Liang Qu glimpsed the words under the vines, most of them blurred, but a small part could be recognized.</p><p></p><p>"I am the vanguard general of the Great Qin Navy. I was defeated and unable to resist, severely wounded, drifting to this place. I am ashamed of the imperial grace and have cut myself off here."</p><p></p><p>A vanguard general of the former Great Qin Dynasty? He must have died quite a few years ago, at least sixty years.</p><p></p><p>But was there a battlefield relic around where he drifted to?</p><p></p><p>Although it was not a martial arts manual that disappointed Liang Qu, the information revealed was not entirely useless.</p><p></p><p>There should be some great generals at the battlefield relic, Yao Long dared not imagine, but Shuhuo and Zhenxiang should be there, right? Their armor and weapons couldn't be bad, right? Good weapons sinking in the water for a hundred years would still be well-preserved, especially for a naval army.</p><p></p><p>He must be careful.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu kept this in mind, as he had once wanted to find sunken ship treasures and make a fortune.</p><p></p><p>But the Jianghuai wilderness was too wide, and the docking value of Yixing City was not high, and there were no good ships nearby, only rotten fishing boats.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were, it would be difficult to find them, with the development of modern radar and detectors, finding these things was a real challenge.</p><p></p><p>He alone, plus a few water beasts, would be even less likely.</p><p></p><p>As for the battlefield, with such a large area, there might be some hope.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, although you didn't give me anything, I'm a good-hearted old man, I'll take you out of here and bury you under my lotus root field, just to rest in peace."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu patted his hands, to rest in peace, it was all decomposition, and decomposition was the same wherever it was.</p><p></p><p>Whose grave didn't have grass growing on it? Grass growing was a good thing, indicating that the earth energy was strong and the feng shui was good, and the growth of precious plants would be even more remarkable, thriving even more.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to set aside a piece of land, and the lotus roots that grew out in the future would only be used as rewards for the four beasts.</p><p></p><p>Although there was actually no problem, he still felt a little disgusted psychologically.</p><p></p><p>Sliding out along the rock crevice, Liang Qu used a stone shard to cut off the water fungus, leaving only the root stem, so that it could continue to grow.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the stone knife and hesitated for a while, cutting off one-third, then dividing one-third in half, one-half of that.</p><p></p><p>One-sixth would be the inviolable reward, and the remaining two-twelfths would be the reward for the fat catfish and the fist.</p><p></p><p>As for the newly joined Awei, seeing the remaining root stems, he was heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>So many had been eaten by the water centipede, why divide them up?</p><p></p><p>After dividing the water fungus, he just ate it raw.</p><p></p><p>The water fungus was only called water fungus, and it was not as hard as lingzhi, with a texture more like mushrooms.</p><p></p><p>【Water Marsh Essence +21.6】</p><p></p><p>Whew, refreshing! Liang Qu's spirits were lifted, the unit value of the water fungus was higher than the crab roe he had eaten before.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, it would be used again to enhance the fusion degree, and after the enhancement was completed, he would only be 30 points away from the complete fusion of the Marsh Spirit.</p><p></p><p>I wonder how the Azure Marsh Spirit is doing?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's heart was filled with joy, and his stomach began to heat up. The energy of the water spirit mushroom surged forth, and he didn't hesitate to start practicing.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Liang Qu's entire body turned as red as a cooked shrimp, and he exhaled a puff of white air, stretching his muscles and bones.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood in his chest had already grown to be two inches thick and one foot long. If it expanded another half inch, he could begin refining his flesh.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that he was blossoming on both land and water, advancing side by side.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the River God's sacrifice, he would go to the martial arts hall to find his senior brother Hu and fill in the gaps in his fighting techniques, becoming a truly formidable warrior, not just one with physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had been just over ten days, and the weapon forging on Senior Brother Lu's side was already at a critical stage, so he should go take a look.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked forward to the future, and the Zeding suddenly shone brightly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【The fusion of the Water Monkey and the Zeling has exceeded halfway, unlocking the innate talent skill - Water Leap, and with the river's favor, it may evolve into the divine ability - Water Walk a Thousand Miles.】</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was overjoyed, as his premonition had come true - the fusion had indeed undergone a transformation!</p><p></p><p>Inspired, a wondrous sensation surged in Liang Qu's heart, and he jumped into the water to activate that marvelous feeling.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the surrounding water environment underwent an extremely drastic change. </p><p></p><p>The water resistance in front of him seemed to have suddenly disappeared, while the water flow on both sides and even behind him acted like giant hands supporting his body, propelling him forward.</p><p></p><p>The light and shadows changed rapidly, and when Liang Qu regained his senses, he had crashed hard into the rock wall at the bend.</p><p></p><p>"Cough!"</p><p></p><p>In excruciating pain, Liang Qu choked on some water and quickly climbed back into the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>The Water Leap turned out to be a movement skill that consumed physical strength! After using it, a portion of his strength abruptly vanished, and before his nerves could fully react, he had already crossed a distance of ten meters and crashed into the rock wall.</p><p></p><p>Estimating it, the consumption of physical strength was about one-fifth, so if he fully activated the Water Leap, he could teleport fifty meters in the water? Liang Qu's heart pounded as he looked at the so-called divine ability - Water Walk a Thousand Miles.</p><p></p><p>Could it really mean traversing a thousand miles in an instant? That would be too amazing, like going from the Northern Sea to Cangwu in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>The concept of the river's favor became clear for the first time. In the past, it had only been displayed on the Zeding interface, and Liang Qu had never known its purpose or how to obtain it.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally understood its use, but how to acquire it was still a mystery, leaving him scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his strength was still not enough, and he couldn't reach the level required for the river's favor.</p><p></p><p>After all, to have a river favor him, it wouldn't be enough to just do some minor tasks.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily suppressing his excitement, Liang Qu checked his other abilities. The water flow control had increased by three hundred, reaching eight hundred jin, a dramatic leap.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>The Unmoving One only needed twenty-eight points to evolve, the Fatty Catfish needed thirty-two points, and the Fist didn't need to be checked, as it was still far away.</p><p></p><p>Wait, something didn't add up.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was puzzled. He vaguely remembered that the last time he checked, the Unmoving One needed over forty points.</p><p></p><p>Could it be natural growth? After pondering for a while, he couldn't find a clear answer, so he could only attribute it to that.</p><p></p><p>In any case, being able to reduce the evolution points was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took one last look at the stone cave. This was an excellent shelter, not too far from the lotus root field, which he could use as a base in the future and gradually improve.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he needed to move the bones out and bury them in the lotus root field, as they were quite unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Where he rested, no one else should sleep, not even white bones!</p><p></p><p>After completing this task, Liang Qu's strength had recovered considerably, and he tried a full-powered Water Leap.</p><p></p><p>The water flow supported him, the resistance disappeared, and he traversed fifty meters in an instant. However, his physical strength seemed to have been instantly drained, leaving him completely exhausted, without even the strength to swim. Luckily, the Unmoving One was there to lift him up and onto the boat.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he would have to be cautious in using this skill in battle, or else he could become easy prey.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the skill, Liang Qu rested for a while and then took Awei back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

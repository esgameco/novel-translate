        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Zeding emitted a spiritual light, and the fresh blood scattered in the water congealed under a mysterious force, slowly etching onto the smooth back of the six-barbel catfish.</p><p></p><p>The river-shaped water symbol emitted a bloody glow in the dark waters, and the struggling six-barbel catfish instantly froze.</p><p></p><p>A powerful spiritual force thundered into his brain, and Liang Qu only felt as if his occiput had been struck by a heavy hammer, making him dizzy and disoriented.</p><p></p><p>He felt a warmth in his nasal cavity and realized that blood was gushing out. This time, commanding the six-barbel catfish was more perilous than controlling the pig-nosed dragon!</p><p></p><p>Although the two were similar in size, the hibernating pig-nosed dragon's willpower was far weaker than the six-barbel catfish's.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after a tense struggle lasting over a dozen breaths, the spiritual will in his mind rapidly declined.</p><p></p><p>The river symbol sank beneath the catfish's skin and disappeared, and a completely different spiritual connection appeared in Liang Qu's mind.</p><p></p><p>It's done!</p><p></p><p>The exhausted Liang Qu revealed a look of delight, tinged with a hint of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>The six-barbel catfish's resistance was so strong, and his success with the pig-nosed dragon had been mere luck.</p><p></p><p>But since it's done, it's done. With the spiritual connection established, life and death are now under his control, and there is no possibility of betrayal.</p><p></p><p>Luck is also a part of one's strength.</p><p></p><p>The Zeding emitted a radiant glow.</p><p></p><p>[The six-barbel catfish has been subjugated, and can now evolve.]</p><p>[Consuming 80 points of water essence can evolve the six-barbel catfish into a bullhead catfish.]</p><p></p><p>The same evolution prompt, but Liang Qu still didn't have enough water essence, so he could only wait for the future.</p><p></p><p>After the struggle, he was completely drained. He quickly summoned the two beasts, grabbing one in each hand, and let them carry him out of the water to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu wiped the water off his face and took deep breaths. His aching, dizzy brain quickly regained clarity, like drinking an icy soda on a hot summer day.</p><p></p><p>The sky was still early, and as Liang Qu recovered, he admired the huge, imposing sizes of the two beasts, feeling a surge of pride and a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>With the two beasts assisting him, even if someone as tall and powerful as Lao Zhang were to fall into the water, he would be easily handled.</p><p></p><p>However, Liang Qu couldn't help but feel sorry when he saw the torn wound on the six-barbel catfish's tail. Now they were all his own offspring! Previously, he couldn't actively fight the six-barbel catfish, thinking its thick skin and tough flesh would be unharmed, but it ended up with a large scar. This was the downside of not being able to act - the pig-nosed dragon's agility and endurance were much lower than regular fish, but its thick blood made up for it. "Since you're so fat, I'll call you Fat Catfish, Afei!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu casually gave the six-barbel catfish a name, and after receiving the joyful emotional feedback, he led the two beasts back to the lotus root domain, breaking off a lotus root to feed Afei.</p><p></p><p>This lotus root did not contain water essence, but it still had a healing effect, just weaker. </p><p></p><p>After Afei ate it, the wound on its tail began to visibly heal, though at a slower pace.</p><p></p><p>Afei rolled in the water and started circling around Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Estimating that one piece was enough, Liang Qu returned to the boat to feed the immobilized fish, letting them continue guarding the place, and then let the healed Afei help him catch fish, with the lotus root domain as the center.</p><p></p><p>The six-barbel catfish's hunting ability was formidable - its large mouth could easily catch many small fish without leaving obvious wounds, which was why Liang Qu wanted to subjugate it.</p><p></p><p>"When you catch fish, spit them out here, but be careful not to let anyone see."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu lifted the board at the stern of the boat, pointing to the empty space inside.</p><p></p><p>Lao Zhang's raft, though simple, was still complete, around 3 meters long, with the same structure as a normal fishing boat, having two waterproof compartments at the bow and stern to store fish.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish undulated on the surface, shaking its head.</p><p></p><p>For aquatic beasts, the spiritual connection was not entirely without benefits. At least from what Liang Qu observed, the water beasts after establishing the connection were noticeably more intelligent, with a certain capacity for thought, no longer just simple wild beasts.</p><p></p><p>Receiving Afei's confirmation, Liang Qu did not close the stern cover, but directly lay down, covering himself with a rain cape, and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Establishing the spiritual connection had consumed too much of his energy, and he urgently needed to rest. Let's see what happens next.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Waking up, how was the harvest? The sky was gradually darkening, the river wind was blowing, and the water surface was rippling with a reddish glow.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu drowsily opened his eyes, looking at the sun that was setting in the west, and found that he had actually slept until dusk, and it was not a natural waking, but being slapped awake by a jumping fish.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt the wet and slippery mucus on his face, a bit dazed. He sat up and looked at the several large fish jumping in the boat, dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The waterproof compartment at the stern of the boat was actually filled with the catch!</p><p></p><p>Fish were constantly jumping out of the narrow gap, either fleeing into the water or jumping onto the boat body, and the fish that had awakened Liang Qu was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was struck by a huge surprise, even if these were just ordinary fish, they should be worth at least a hundred coins!</p><p></p><p>Was this all the harvest of A-Fei in half a day?</p><p></p><p>Just then, A-Fei surfaced, opened his big mouth, and spat out three more large fish, along with water and foam.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu asked, "Did you catch all of these?"</p><p></p><p>A-Fei shook his body and floated his head a bit higher.</p><p></p><p>"It was a collaboration with the immovable one, and these are not the full harvest, there are still a few fish that jumped out."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt the information in the spiritual connection and suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>The immovable one was not agile and slow, but it could play a blocking role, and it complemented the catfish A-Fei perfectly. Just in the lotus root water area, they had caught nearly fifty large fish, including a spotted-headed fish worth thirty coins!</p><p></p><p>The total catch of the entire boat was worth one hundred and thirty coins!</p><p></p><p>Although the immovable one had a bit of dereliction of duty by following the fishing, it was negligible compared to the huge catch.</p><p></p><p>"Good, you guys did a great job!" Liang Qu praised them repeatedly, then quickly picked up the fish in the boat and stuffed them into the compartment, covering it with the partition. He also went down to the water and broke off two lotus roots to reward the two beasts, the lotus roots without water essence were over a hundred pieces, and he didn't mind at all.</p><p></p><p>He also took a look at the injuries of the catfish A-Fei, which were basically healed, leaving only a scar.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts rewarded with the lotus roots rolled and circled in the water, kicking up a lot of white foam, and it took a while before they submerged and left, gathering around the lotus roots to guard the precious plants.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu rowed the boat towards the pier with a pole, and by the time he arrived, it was already dark. Lanterns were hung on the pier, and many fishermen were returning to their boats in twos and threes, preparing to go back for dinner and go out again in the early morning.</p><p></p><p>The catch was too much, at least a hundred pounds, and he couldn't carry it all at once. Liang Qu called the dock workers to come with fish baskets to help.</p><p></p><p>Worker Lin Songbao laughed, "A-Shui is here to sell fish again?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao, the second son of the dock manager Lin Di, was a part-time worker.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, who dares to use your fish baskets? Wouldn't you strip me bare?"</p><p></p><p>"A-Shui, you're talking like that... Who doesn't know that our stuff is..." Lin Songbao tried to use some business tactics, but Liang Qu didn't fall for it and told him to hurry up and get the fish.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like you had a good harvest today, you'll need three fish baskets." Lin Songbao picked up the fish baskets and came to the boat's side. As soon as he opened the lid, he was surprised to see the crowded school of fish. "Did you catch all of these?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao scanned the catch, estimating its value to be over a hundred coins. Only a few skilled fishermen on the pier could consistently catch this amount, let alone Liang Qu, who was not yet an adult. Even if he just happened to encounter a school of fish, it was still quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like we have another skilled fisherman on the pier."</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao put aside his playful attitude and gave a sincere compliment.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Liang Qu's father, Liang Dajiang, had passed away, and his boat had been sold. People had thought the orphan would just quietly wait to die, but he had managed to survive with just a small boat. And today, he had an impressive harvest.</p><p></p><p>There were many orphans in Yixing City, either selling themselves or begging. Liang Qu was the first one to actually make something of himself.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Songbao appeared on the pier carrying the three full fish baskets, many fishermen stopped in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

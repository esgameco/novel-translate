        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The crabs on the reef were waving their claws, asserting their dominance.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, the figure quickly surfaced to breathe, and after replenishing the air, went back underwater.</p><p></p><p>"The activity time has extended to about two hours."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu estimated the time, feeling excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, the record for the longest time holding his breath underwater was 24 minutes, and it was while remaining completely still, with an extremely low heart rate, which could almost be called a "turtle-breathing" state, which was one in a million.</p><p></p><p>But now, in a high-speed oxygen-consuming state of rapid swimming, he could easily go for half an hour without needing to breathe, which was completely superhuman, even martial arts masters couldn't achieve that.</p><p></p><p>"The rough perception range has increased to 10 meters, and the detailed perception circle is 5 meters. The range has expanded greatly, and the concealment is also stronger. Within less than a meter, the fish can't even detect me."</p><p></p><p>The larger the perception range, the greater the water control range. Within the detailed perception circle, water control is as easy as moving one's own limbs. Therefore, the expansion of the perception range is equivalent to an enhancement of water control ability.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu spread out his five fingers, and the invisible water flow changed into various forms under the manipulation of his will.</p><p></p><p>He controlled the water flow in his palm to form a vortex, making it smaller and spinning faster, until it shrank from half a person's height to the size of a human head.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the distance to cutting with a water blade was still far away.</p><p></p><p>At first, Liang Qu thought that if he could develop a water blade, it would be an extremely powerful move, but later he found that it was not the case. This was a skill with a very low cost-effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>The water flow he could control had a force of about 300 jin (斤, a Chinese unit of weight), which could be concentrated in 10 liters of water and explode, that is, 30 jin of force per liter of water. It sounded not bad, enough for manipulating objects and catching fish, but it was still light years away from a water blade.</p><p></p><p>A low-pressure water blade of 30 megapascals can only cut foam and wooden boards, and it requires 300 kilograms of force, that is, 600 jin, to be applied on a square centimeter.</p><p></p><p>To cut meat, it needs at least 50 megapascals, and to cut steel, it requires 100 megapascals, and it also needs to be mixed with fine sand.</p><p></p><p>It's completely impossible.</p><p></p><p>Mixing blades and steel needles into the vortex should have some killing power, but the cost is too high. Nowadays, there is no mechanical processing, and it takes thousands of blades made by hand-grinding every few minutes.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suspected that the Azure Spiritual Ape could not simply compress the water flow to form a water blade, and only the Purple Spiritual Monkey King could do it.</p><p></p><p>But even if he could reach that level, it would be better to use brute force to squeeze and burst the enemy with water pressure.</p><p></p><p>Unless the spiritual beast can evolve to a certain degree and develop usable skills.</p><p></p><p>Regarding this, Liang Qu felt that he could look forward to it. He could vaguely feel that after the fusion degree exceeded half, the spiritual beast would undergo some changes.</p><p></p><p>As for how to control blood with a water content of 85%, Liang Qu actually had some ideas, and had even practiced it once.</p><p></p><p>In the martial arts hall, he successfully counterattacked by controlling the attacker's blood to flow backwards.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the blood he can currently control is limited to the most concentrated part, the main artery of the heart. The spleen, which stores a lot of blood, is not feasible, as the blood is distributed in the small blood vessels.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Liang Qu also noticed that when he met his senior brother Hu, he could not feel the blood flow in their hearts within the perception circle.</p><p></p><p>Without the ability to perceive, he naturally cannot control it.</p><p></p><p>Is it because Senior Brother Hu has not broken through the blood barrier, which is the first three realms? Does the skin barrier have a shielding effect on his perception? This is unknown for now.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu even thought about whether he could control his own blood to achieve a similar effect of stimulating the qi and blood, but he didn't dare to try it.</p><p></p><p>It's too dangerous, a slip-up could easily backfire, and even if it works, it might shorten his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>He practices martial arts and catches fish, wanting to live longer and better. Playing with this kind of thing is not worth the risk.</p><p></p><p>Communicate with the Ding (鼎, a spiritual beast).</p><p></p><p>[Ding Master: Liang Qu]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Refined Marsh Spirit: Water Monkey (White) (Fusion Degree: 49%)】</p><p></p><p>【Water Marsh Essence: None】</p><p></p><p>【River Favor Degree: None】 </p><p></p><p>【Commanding Water Beasts: Tahua Crocodile, Six-Whisker Catfish, Stone Crab】</p><p></p><p>【Evaluation: The Water Monkey Marsh Spirit originates from the great Lord of the Huaihe Whirlpool, but is not fully awakened, a weak and minor character】</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the red-finned perch, the Marsh Spirit's fusion degree has reached 49%, almost reaching the halfway point, and even the last evaluation column has changed, no longer "not fully awakened" but "not fully activated".</p><p></p><p>The white Marsh Spirit Water Monkey, along with the green Marsh Spirit Marsh Baboon and the purple Marsh Spirit Water Ape, even the higher-level Wusupei is not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Liang Qu can only control the blood of ordinary people, but initially he couldn't even control ordinary people, continuing to rise, the future is promising.</p><p></p><p>In two months, from a starving orphan to a true disciple of a Hunting Tiger Boundary Great Martial Arts Master, and even in a few more days he will be able to break through the skin barrier and become a true martial artist, Liang Qu is already very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In the summer tax season, would those tax collectors still dare to kick his tax basket?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt a sense of pleasure, manipulating the water flow, after getting familiar with his own abilities, he began to check the growth of the lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>He has been trying to cultivate precious lotus roots, just breaking off a section and planting it elsewhere, but unfortunately none of them survived, all rotting in the water, wasting many precious plants.</p><p></p><p>It seems that only the nearby water area can grow them, causing Liang Qu to always want to dig out the silt to see if there is something buried underneath, but he is also afraid that there is actually nothing underneath, and the precious plant's roots are just a coincidence, in the end no treasure, and the lotus roots all died, so he never tried.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal plants with healing effects have played a huge role in Liang Qu's growth, initially the long-term hunger that caused physical depletion was slowly filled by the lotus roots, otherwise everything would not have gone so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the crab monster's remaining shell fragments after removing the main parts were all crushed by Liang Qu and buried in the silt, to see if it would help the growth of the lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>So far, nothing can be seen, the crab shell is too hard, even after being crushed, it is not easy to decompose, three days have passed, and it is still the same as when it was buried.</p><p></p><p>After a round, confirming that the lotus roots have not been affected by the crab monster's previous damage, Liang Qu began to clear the gravel and expand the growth environment of the lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>After everything was done, just about to surface to breathe, he suddenly saw a flickering spot of light in the distance in the darkness, constantly swaying and approaching, very eerie.</p><p></p><p>But the positional sense from the neural connection told Liang Qu that the two beasts were also there, and they were also approaching quickly, as if chasing each other.</p><p></p><p>Shit, these two guys, they didn't bring something they couldn't handle, did they?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned to flee, but suddenly received thoughts like "hot", "hot", "cooked" from the spiritual connection of the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>It's not quite the same as expected.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stopped and decided to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, the two beasts did not bring an enemy, but rather a glowing object, and the way they brought it back was very strange, using their foreheads to toss it back and forth.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish would take it after being passed, and then pass it to the one who couldn't move, who would then pass it back to the fat catfish.</p><p></p><p>The sense of déjà vu was so strong that Liang Qu was reminded of how he ate roasted sweet potatoes, tossing them back and forth with both hands.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts came in front of Liang Qu and dropped the glowing object, a huge red feather slowly sinking to the bottom of the water.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu raised his eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>This is the feather of the Fire Bird Demon!?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

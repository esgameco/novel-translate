        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming."</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Chen Qingjiang finished organizing the fishing net and followed behind Liang Qu as they headed to the dock.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang hadn't forgotten what Liang Qu had said - to take him to a place where fish gather to catch them. He had been staying at home since yesterday and hadn't even gone out the door.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, do you still go to the town to sell the fish you catch?"</p><p></p><p>"I went a few days ago, but it's getting colder and the fish are thinner than me, so I don't plan to go anymore, it's not worth it."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu said, "Then from today on, don't go anymore."</p><p></p><p>His senior brother said that the mountain demon could kill a Second Realm warrior, its strength was formidable, and it preferred robust warriors, but it didn't even pay attention to him, a non-Realm warrior disciple. But a gentleman doesn't stand under a dangerous wall, if he can avoid taking risks, he shouldn't go.</p><p></p><p>Yixing City was fifteen or sixteen li away from Pingyang Town. There was a main road, and it was quite wide, with many people coming and going, but on both sides were forests, who knows what mountain demons might be hiding there, waiting to ambush passing travelers, especially since Uncle Chen went to catch fish before dawn, which was even more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had come with the horse caravan this morning, he didn't dare to go alone.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Is it related to that Luo Shaohui person?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was honest but not stupid, hearing this, he immediately thought of the deceased warrior.</p><p></p><p>Warriors were rare creatures. As a town, Pingyang had so many warriors, all thanks to Yang Dongxiong taking the lead.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts school had been open for over twenty years, and many people from the surrounding counties came specifically to study under the Yang family school.</p><p></p><p>Over time, the number of warriors increased, and with more warriors, more clinics also appeared, and more people were needed to work and provide services - they all needed to eat and live.</p><p></p><p>Pingyang Town had developed to have tens of thousands of people over the years, not much different from the county seat, and this was largely due to this reason.</p><p></p><p>More people led to more people taking up martial arts, it was a mutually reinforcing process.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, in other places, the number of warriors would be at least halved, so if one suddenly died, it was definitely not a small matter.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, one of my senior brothers went to check, he said it was killed by a demonic beast, and they still haven't caught the beast, so we need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang nodded in acknowledgment, since he wasn't planning on going to the town to sell fish anyway, not going was fine.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the dock, Liang Qu made several leaps, jumping onto a black-canopied boat, no longer the original small sampan.</p><p></p><p>Last night he had slept at the martial arts school, and early this morning he came to the dock to get his own boat back from Lin Songbao, leaving that broken-down sampan for the fishing shed.</p><p></p><p>The sampan, the "three-board", had two partition boards in the middle, dividing it into the bow and stern, the rest was just empty.</p><p></p><p>This black-canopied boat was much bigger than that broken sampan, the sampan was only a little over 3 meters long and less than 1 meter wide, while the black-canopied boat was nearly 5 meters long and over 1 meter wide.</p><p></p><p>The boat sides were higher, less likely to be splashed by waves, the boat cabin was lined with red-lacquered boards, with mats on top, and bamboo and wood pillows.</p><p></p><p>The canopy was 1.2 meters high, with 8 panels on the sides, 4 fixed and 4 that could slide open and close, woven from bamboo and reeds, with bamboo mats in between, able to block the sun and rain, and very sturdy, painted black with soot and tung oil, hence the name "black-canopied boat".</p><p></p><p>From a sampan to a black-canopied boat, it was a major equipment upgrade, from a small gun to a cannon.</p><p></p><p>With the wind and rain-blocking canopy, Liang Qu could now directly live on the boat if it was inconvenient to go home.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Ashui, you've taken back your black-canopied boat?" Chen Qingjiang exclaimed, then realized, "Oh, you're different now, that Lailiao Zhang doesn't dare do anything to you anymore, come to think of it, I haven't seen Lailiao Zhang in a while, a while back he didn't pay his autumn taxes, the officials went to his house to arrest him but couldn't find him, he was judged as a vagrant, do you know about this?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I didn't know. This boat was given to me by Lin Di from the fishing shed, he said Lailiao Zhang had sold the boat to him, Lin Di wanted to curry favor with me, so he returned it to me."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's good then." Chen Qingjiang pondered, "That Lailiao Zhang, he even sold the boat, I'm afraid he really ran off with the money, I wonder what he's up to now, could it be that he's become a bandit?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's expression unchanged, he urged, "Who cares, he's just a hoodlum, let's get going."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang untied the boat, closely following behind Liang Qu's boat.</p><p></p><p>The black-canopied boat was much bigger than the sampan, logically it should be harder to row, but the black-canopied boat relied on oars rather than paddles, pushing left and right, not only faster and more stable, but also less tiring.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had been cultivating martial arts for over a month, about to break through the realm, his strength was far greater than an adult's, rowing felt even easier and more comfortable, the boat didn't rock at all.</p><p></p><p>He had heard that skilled fishermen could place a plate of fenugreek beans on the boat's edge and eat them while rowing, without spilling a single bean.</p><p></p><p>The two black-canopied boats sped forward, one in front, one behind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the water surface.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was immersed in the exhilarating feeling of speeding across the water, and Chen Qingjiang behind him was having a hard time keeping up, calling out for him to wait.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu would stop even without being called, for they had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Ashui, you're really strong." Chen Qingjiang was a bit out of breath. "Are we here?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is the place. The fish are especially plentiful in this area."</p><p></p><p>"Then let me try casting the net."</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment, let me throw something first." Liang Qu pretended to take out a small box, scooping out a mud-like lump and throwing it into the water.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>"It's bait that I got from my master. It has a strong attraction for the fish schools."</p><p></p><p>"There's such a good thing?"</p><p></p><p>It was just ordinary yellow mud, a measure taken by Liang Qu to reduce exposure and provide a signal for the two beasts to drive the fish schools.</p><p></p><p>After scattering the "bait", Liang Qu immediately notified the two beasts below the water surface through the spiritual link, directing them to herd the gathered fish schools.</p><p></p><p>After about a quarter of an hour, Liang Qu let Chen Qingjiang start catching the fish.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang grabbed the fishing net, made a sweeping motion, and the net spread out perfectly on the water surface.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so many fish, really so many fish!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang strained to pull the net up, and there were more than twenty large fish inside, estimated to be worth around forty taels.</p><p></p><p>In the winter, this was a huge catch! Liang Qu made a mental comparison, and it was much faster than Afei's solo fishing.</p><p></p><p>In a quarter of an hour, over twenty large fish, while Afei would have to make seven or eight trips to finish one fish, taking nearly an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Ashui, quick, more of that bait of yours."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Lump after lump of yellow mud, net after net of large fish.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang couldn't stop grinning, sweating profusely but unwilling to rest for a moment.</p><p></p><p>This was not just fish, but pure silver, shining white silver! "Uncle Chen, that's probably enough."</p><p></p><p>"No way, there are still so many fish," Chen Qingjiang, exhausted, still wanted to keep fishing.</p><p></p><p>"We didn't bring any fish baskets, the compartments are already full, we can't fit any more."</p><p></p><p>"Full?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was dazed, in just a few hours the two boats had been filled? He came to his senses, stammering, "That's so many fish, must be worth five or six hundred taels."</p><p></p><p>"I just saw two small trout, that's about it, Uncle Chen, wipe your sweat, don't catch a cold." Liang Qu tossed him a towel. "We can come back tomorrow, there's plenty of bait, if it's not enough we'll mix more, let's head back for now."</p><p></p><p>Five or six hundred taels, split evenly, would be three hundred taels each, seven taels of silver per month.</p><p></p><p>The key was that Liang Qu could now free up more time for other things, earning money from fishing, no longer needing to go out on boats in disguise.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could even recruit more people, forming a "fishing fleet", and the income could double, just need to be careful in selecting the right people.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought back to that dinner last night, feeling a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, he had already distanced himself from labor, becoming part of the parasitic class, able to earn money without doing anything, with a stable source of income, surpassing many businessmen.</p><p></p><p>Living in a mansion, keeping beautiful maids, it was no longer a dream, but within reach.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang looked at the boat hold, filled with regret.</p><p></p><p>He had lived an empty life for thirty years, never catching fish so joyfully before, the fish practically rushing into the net, needing to mend it after a few more times.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about having to leave, his heart felt hollow.</p><p></p><p>He was truly worried that today was just a dream, and he would wake up to an empty net again.</p><p></p><p>Or that today was the last day the fish school would stay, and tomorrow it would be the thin winter fish again, the eight taels owed to the medical clinic remaining far out of reach.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was filled with anxiety: "Ashui, will there be so many fish again tomorrow?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu paused, then smiled: "Of course, why wouldn't there be? The key is really my bait, which my master prepared, it's absolutely effective, and cheap too. Even if we go somewhere else, throw it there, the fish won't be less."</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>If it was the bait, there was no need to worry so much, the fish schools might change location, but the bait would always be useful.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, the sense of loss in his heart lessened, and he finally agreed to head back, no longer hesitating.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu let out a sigh of relief, he was really worried that Uncle Chen would stay and fish all night, and then be questioned by his sister-in-law upon returning.</p><p></p><p>The two boats with black awnings docked and moored.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he tied the boat, Liang Qu heard someone calling out to him from the pier.</p><p></p><p>"Ashui, you're finally back! Hurry back, there's someone causing trouble at your place!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

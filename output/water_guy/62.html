        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as Liang Qu came out of the academy, he saw Li Libo waiting at the entrance. He looked around and there was no one else nearby, so it was obvious that Li Libo was waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Libo, who was squatting on the curb, heard the voice and lifted his head, spitting out the grass stalk in his mouth, and complained, "I finally get to see you. I asked Senior Brother Xiang, and Senior Brother Xiang said you get off school at the end of the afternoon, so I came a quarter of an hour early to wait for you. But I waited for a long time and didn't see you. </p><p></p><p>I went to ask the old man at the gate, and the old man said you hadn't come out yet. I didn't want to barge in and disturb the studying students, so I waited for more than two hours. Are you in there courting some young lady?"</p><p></p><p>"I wish I was, but the whole class is just a bunch of kids."</p><p></p><p>"Then what were you doing in there?"</p><p></p><p>"I had some things to take care of, so I was a bit late. Have you eaten? If not, let me treat you, and we can eat together."</p><p></p><p>"That's great."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo beamed with delight, and the two of them went to a noodle shop to order and eat.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, you seem a bit different somehow."</p><p></p><p>"How so?"</p><p></p><p>"You're not as dark anymore, and you seem to have grown taller."</p><p></p><p>"I've been growing, and I haven't been out fishing much these past few days. Anyway, tell me, what did you come find me for?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right, I almost forgot." Li Libo took out a stack of papers from his chest and slapped them on the table. "Today, Elder Chen sent someone to the martial arts hall looking for you. They said there's going to be a River God Sacrifice ceremony tomorrow at noon, and you're the main officiant. You need to recite the sacrificial text in public, so they want you to read through it a few times beforehand to get familiar with the process and procedures, which are all written on the papers.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't find you, so they sent someone to the academy, and since I knew you were here, that person asked me to pass the sacrificial text on to you."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll remember that. By the way, there's one more thing I need to trouble you with. Can you go to the martial arts hall and help me bring that big wooden chest from my room?"</p><p></p><p>"The wooden chest? Sure, I'll go take a look and bring it over to you."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the papers, folded them, and put them in his own chest.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten that Chen Zhaoan had said he would let Liang Qu be the main officiant for the River God Sacrifice - a great opportunity to make a public appearance.</p><p></p><p>The sacrificial text wouldn't be in plain language; it would be a combination of obscure words and phrases that people don't normally use, so it would be quite difficult. He would need to read through it several times beforehand, and he would also need to dress up properly for the occasion.</p><p></p><p>He had always been reluctant to wear the big cloak, robe, and cloud-stepping boots that his senior brothers had given him, afraid to keep them at home in case they got stolen. But now he finally had a chance to use them.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Li Libo found the wooden chest and handed it over to Liang Qu, then hurried back to the martial arts hall to practice.</p><p></p><p>This opportunity didn't come easily. He and Chen Jiechanghad been training like madmen every day, and they hadn't even returned to Yixing City.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the River God Sacrifice tomorrow, they probably wouldn't have shown up in Yixing City for three months.</p><p></p><p>Their diligence and dedication surpassed even Liang Qu's, as Liang Qu not only had to study, but also had to occasionally take a nap and play with the three beasts.</p><p></p><p>He felt ashamed, and vowed to never be so lazy again.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the wooden chest, Liang Qu went to the Pingyang Wharf, pushed the boat out, and headed to the Shangrao Wharf. There, a huge beast gradually emerged from the water.</p><p></p><p>Its long, pitch-black body was half-hidden in the darkness, its scales shimmering with a faint glow. The rippling water flow broke apart as it rose, the water flowing through the gaps between the scales and merging into the river.</p><p></p><p>Now unable to move, the beast had reached a length of 3.5 meters - large enough to be considered a giant crocodile, even if it didn't grow any further.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stuffed the sacrificial text and the clothes into the boat's cabin, then jumped into the water wearing only his underwear. The immobilized beast swam alongside him, heading towards the direction of the fat catfish.</p><p></p><p>On the way, the immobilized beast swayed its body left and right, seemingly asking Liang Qu for a reward, but this time the treasure it had discovered was not the fat catfish, but a special terrain that it had accidentally found while digging a hole underwater - a hidden, extremely concealed place that led to a whole new world. If not for sheer luck, ordinary people would never be able to find it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu patted the motionless head to encourage it.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he didn't have anything good on hand, no material rewards. Even so, the motionless one was extremely delighted to be patted on the head, its tail twitching in the water, releasing a long stream of bubbles.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived, Liang Qu looked up, greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>There was actually such a huge rock at the bottom of the water, nearly 20 meters high, the size of a small residential building.</p><p></p><p>Under the rock, fist-sized hands were patrolling around. Seeing Liang Qu, they swam over and grabbed onto his shoulders.</p><p></p><p>The seemingly undisturbed muddy ground suddenly bulged, and a 4-meter-long fat catfish shook off the mud and swam over.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by these two giant beasts and one small one, Liang Qu even felt a bit of a thrill, as if he were the water god in the vast waves, commanding with might.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, countless water soldiers cleared the way.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought of Brother Toad, and his little thoughts dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, he would have to recite the sacrificial text for Brother Toad. For now, he would have to endure, and eventually eat the spicy stir-fried frog.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu descended to the bottom of the water, following the force of gravity.</p><p></p><p>There is a neutral buoyancy point for humans in water. </p><p></p><p>Normally, at a depth of 5 meters, the body will naturally float upwards, and one can return to the surface without doing anything.</p><p></p><p>But at a certain depth, the chest is compressed, and the overall volume will shrink, causing the person to start sinking freely without any weight. This point is usually around 30 meters.</p><p></p><p>Now the depth had exceeded 30 meters, and Liang Qu could easily sink to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Following the lead of the motionless one, Liang Qu found the hole it had dug under the rock, and by crawling through the hole, he discovered a 3-meter-wide crack in the bottom of the rock, with a faint light shining through.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu entered the crack and headed towards the light source. After swimming about 4-5 meters, the path made a 90-degree sharp turn, going straight up like a cliff face.</p><p></p><p>On this "cliff-like" vertical path, there grew a vine as thick as a person's arm, like the beanstalk in the fairy tale of Jack and the Beanstalk, leading to the giant's kingdom.</p><p></p><p>It was the source of the light, glowing with a bright, eerie luminescence in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tried to bite it, but it was too hard, and he couldn't bite through it. He could only climb up the vine. After just 10 meters, he suddenly broke through the surface, his wet hair standing up, looking around the suddenly open and bright space in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the rock was not water, but air!</p><p></p><p>Surveying the area, he saw a semi-circular platform, with the rippling blue light of the waves reflected on the ceiling above.</p><p></p><p>The entire rock was like a giant dome, trapping the air inside.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't need to hold his breath, as the motionless one had explored it before, proving the air inside was fine.</p><p></p><p>Being an alligator, its vocabulary was limited, so it could only describe the rock, the hole, the glowing plant growing inside the rock, without going into more details.</p><p></p><p>In reality, the interior space of the rock was shaped like an inverted eighth note, with the "belly" being the space Liang Qu saw, and the long "stem" being the passageway.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu grabbed the vine and climbed onto the platform inside the rock. The space was tall enough for him to stand upright. Scanning the area, he spotted a large, fleshy plant in the corner, the size of a human head.</p><p></p><p>It looked very much like a mushroom, with a short, thick white stem and a cap resembling lingzhi. It was deeply rooted in the rock crevice.</p><p></p><p>Water lingzhi! Liang Qu had been reading a lot lately and was no longer the ignorant little one, immediately recognizing this precious aquatic plant. Just as he was about to approach it, a stone block blended into the dark rock wall suddenly shook loose and shot out!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

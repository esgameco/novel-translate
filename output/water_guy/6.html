        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Staring at the two figures lingering at the doorway, Liang Qu furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>Who are these two guests? Why are they loitering in front of my door in the dead of night?</p><p></p><p>At the doorway, a middle-aged man and a slender young servant were standing, and the one who had just spoken was the pale-skinned middle-aged man. This person's clothes were clean and tidy, not looking like an ordinary commoner at all.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the middle-aged man who seemed to have some status, Liang Qu quickly searched his mind.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Zheng Xiang saw that Liang Qu remained silent, thinking the other party was still pondering. He waved his hand, and the servant beside him immediately lifted a burlap sack and opened the mouth wide.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Xiang rolled up his sleeves and reached into the sack. Under the moonlight, Liang Qu saw the man actually pulling out a large handful of gleaming white rice grains!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu swallowed, the stomach pains he had felt earlier had indeed left a certain psychological shadow.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Xiang slowly poured the rice in his hand into the bag: "How about it? As long as you acknowledge our Master Zhao as your adoptive father, this sack of rice will be yours, and from then on, the rice you eat will all be this good!"</p><p></p><p>Adoptive father!? Hearing this term, it seemed Liang Qu had triggered a certain switch in his brain, but not the "If you don't reject me, I'm willing to be your adoptive father" switch, but rather the whole cause and effect of the matter.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man in front of him was none other than Zheng Xiang, one of the stewards of the Zhao family estate in the neighboring town!</p><p></p><p>The purpose of their visit was simple - to buy a servant! Since they had come to the doorstep, it was obvious who the intended servant was.</p><p></p><p>As for why they called it "acknowledging as an adoptive father" when buying a servant, it was because the founding emperor of the Great Shun had banned ordinary people from keeping private slaves, so many wealthy families would adopt servants in the form of "adopting daughters or sons", as long as there was a notary to certify it, similar to the practice in later generations.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, since the original owner's life was so difficult, selling himself would not be a bad option, and this was a steward with good grain, really giving him face.</p><p></p><p>But the key problem was, which family would be so enthusiastic about recruiting a servant? That Master Zhao was rumored to be fond of young men!</p><p></p><p>When Liang Qu first arrived, he had noticed that the young man he had transmigrated into not only had the same name, but also a similar appearance, almost a parallel version of himself. Even though he had followed his father to fish at sea for years and his skin had become rough and dark, his features were still excellent, and with some grooming, he would not be inferior at all.</p><p></p><p>Combining the two, the so-called "rumored" was most likely true.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Liang Qu shuddered, feeling a strong aversion.</p><p></p><p>"How have you considered it?" Zheng Xiang asked again.</p><p></p><p>Last time he came, he was put off and asked to think it over, but now he was fully confident that if Liang Qu didn't accept his terms, he might starve to death at home in the next few days!</p><p></p><p>Zheng Xiang had even called in a pawnbroker as a guarantor, so that even if Liang Qu sold himself, he wouldn't suddenly change his mind and go to the authorities to report the Zhao family for forced servitude.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that the Zhao family was afraid of being reported, who would want to invite trouble? Wiping one's ass also requires a few sheets of paper.</p><p></p><p>The pawnbroker's servant also chimed in, "That's right, young master, to go to the Zhao mansion, that's a blessing that ordinary people like us can't even dream of in several lifetimes! Why bother wandering around in wind and rain, not even getting to eat a few mouthfuls of grain in a year?"</p><p></p><p>'Your grandma, if you want to enjoy this blessing, go ahead, but don't worry about not being able to wipe your ass clean.'</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu cursed inwardly, but outwardly declined calmly, "I'm really sorry, Steward Zheng, my life is too insignificant to enjoy such immense blessings. I feel bad for making you come all this way, so why don't you just take this yellow fish back as a token of my apology?"</p><p></p><p>The pawnbroker's servant was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Xiang's expression changed, completely unprepared for Liang Qu's refusal. He suddenly leaned in, forcing Liang Qu to step back, but the distance was still reduced considerably, making him sense something unusual.</p><p></p><p>How could this Liang Qu look so healthy? Not at all like someone who had been starving for a few days! And where did this yellow fish come from? Did he catch it himself?</p><p></p><p>Zheng Xiang's mind raced, unable to understand how a young man with no support could have turned things around so quickly in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was startled, just about to say something else to save his own life, when Zheng Xiang unexpectedly calmed down instead: "No matter, this was a voluntary transaction between us. There's no need to apologize with a gift. Catching a yellow fish is not easy, young master, you can keep it. It's late, I won't linger any longer, farewell!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Zheng Xiang left with the pawnbroker's servant, leaving only Liang Qu standing at the door holding the yellow fish.</p><p></p><p>Did I really offend him somehow? Liang Qu's expression was gloomy and unsettled. Normally, whether to accept or refuse should be his own choice, but when the weak refuse the strong, it's usually not that simple.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To be born is a mistake. The most crucial thing is that the whole affair is filled with many incongruities, with doubts piling up.</p><p></p><p>The Zhao family is a prominent household in the neighboring Pingyang Town. Why would they know so quickly that there is a struggling orphan in Yixing City? Zhang Laitou, is the Zhao family perhaps... "It seems I must become a martial arts master as soon as possible. Once I become a martial arts master, the Zhao family won't be able to do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>Bearing these thoughts, Liang Qu fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, amidst the bewildered gazes of passing fishermen, Liang Qu carried a yellow fish and sold it to the most luxurious restaurant in Yixing City, earning eighty copper coins.</p><p></p><p>It's not yet time to pay the fishing tax and other miscellaneous taxes, and neither he nor his ancestors have rented any fishing pens, so he doesn't have to be exploited and go into debt. Moreover, Yixing City is close to the big city, with good public security and no fishing overlords, so the money he earns basically all goes to him.</p><p></p><p>If it were in some remote mountain ravine, it would be disastrous - the fishing overlords and fishing pens would gang up, stripping you clean, always teetering on the edge of a peasant uprising, just needing someone to raise a slogan.</p><p></p><p>With the money in hand, Liang Qu found a cheap eatery and ordered two catties of meat, a bowl of rice, and a plate of seasonal vegetables, indulging himself.</p><p></p><p>However, Yixing City is truly small, and in no time, the news of him selling a yellow fish for eighty coins had spread far and wide, with people coming from all directions to inquire about the fishing spot, wanting to try their luck, much to his annoyance.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, kid, where did you catch that yellow fish? Spill the beans." A young man a couple years older than Liang Qu draped his arm around Liang Qu's shoulder, his hand reaching for the fatty meat on the plate, only to be slapped away by a pair of chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>"Ouch, you little brat, your hand is too heavy." The young man hissed, shaking his hand.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu remained unfazed. The locals of the same age were just that many, and he basically knew them all. Li Liboa was just one of them, but they weren't particularly close. At least his family didn't borrow grain from Liang Qu's.</p><p></p><p>There was no real resentment either. In an agricultural society, the productive forces were limited, and everyone was struggling to make a living. Not lending was normal, and it was those few relatives who, not only didn't lend, but also spoke rudely, that he was truly disgruntled with.</p><p></p><p>"I already told you, it's three li to the right of the Shangrao Ferry, in the reed marshes."</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe you. You're definitely not telling the truth. If I were you, I wouldn't tell anyone either, and just quietly get rich."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there was no meat to eat, Li Liboa could only pour himself a cup of tea and drink it alone. He was a lazy fellow, and upon hearing that Liang Qu had caught a yellow fish, he came over to freeload.</p><p></p><p>But it was precisely Li Liboa's character that made him very informed about certain inside information. Liang Qu, pondering recent events, had a sudden inspiration: "I'll ask you something, and if you answer well, you can have some meat."</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa's eyes lit up: "Oh, there's such good news? Ask, ask quickly."</p><p></p><p>"How much do you know about the martial arts schools in Pingyang Town?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa looked Liang Qu up and down, chuckling: "Ah, so that's it. Who doesn't have a martial arts master dream? But you've asked the right person."</p><p></p><p>"Go on."</p><p></p><p>"Pingyang Town has three martial arts schools, and the most formidable one is Master Yang's. The other two school masters are self-taught, but Master Yang is a retired military man! And I, Li Liboa, am about to become his disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa's response was more like boasting than answering.</p><p></p><p>"You?" Liang Qu deliberately questioned.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa immediately got agitated and spilled everything, allowing Liang Qu to gain a glimpse into the extraordinary system of this world.</p><p></p><p>It's simple - first, refine the foundation, then take medicinal baths, refine again, take more baths, and finally break through the barriers.</p><p></p><p>Skin, flesh, bones, blood - the four minor barriers. Once you pass them all, you can be called a martial arts master. Before that, you're only a martial arts practitioner. Apparently, there are even higher realms beyond that, but those are not known to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Enrolling in a martial arts school is also not difficult. They don't care about your innate talent, only whether you have money! That Master Yang's school charges seven taels of silver, not including food and lodging, ten taels including lodging, and twenty taels including lodging and medicinal baths. It's a bit more expensive than the other two schools, but it matches their more formidable reputation.</p><p></p><p>Seven taels of silver is not too difficult. Liang Qu pondered: "Then you're..."</p><p></p><p>"Shh, don't tell anyone. In two months, my family is going to send me to the martial arts school." Li Liboa was full of pride. "Once I'm there, I'll definitely be stronger than that Zhang Laitou. I've even learned some techniques!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

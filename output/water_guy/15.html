        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shattered silver coins rolled and clattered on the hard wooden bed, the sound becoming more and more captivating to hear.</p><p></p><p>It had been twenty-six days since he came into this world, almost a month, and he had finally saved up enough money to go learn martial arts, to see the most mysterious corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>It was not easy, too not easy.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu kept rolling the shattered silver coins, gazing at their tempting bright luster, and for a moment he felt a resonance with Gao Langta's sentiments.</p><p></p><p>But now spending money was for the purpose of earning more in the future, to live a better life.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath, separated out seven taels of the shattered silver, and carefully placed them in the small coin bag that Master Hu had kindly given him, tucking it safely in his bosom.</p><p></p><p>Yixing City was considered a big market, it wasn't just the ruffian Zhang Lantou causing trouble, among the thousands of people there were always some vile scoundrels.</p><p></p><p>But now he was no longer the helpless orphan, people would have to reckon with him to some extent.</p><p></p><p>The remaining two taels and three qian, along with one hundred and twenty-seven copper coins, were buried in the mud under the rice barrel, to be used for the autumn taxes.</p><p></p><p>The Great Shun had already implemented the "Tan Ding Ru Mu" and the "Yi Tiao Bian Fa" tax systems, the tax collection was very simple, just one item, but essentially it was no less, just merged together, the money had to be prepared, otherwise if you couldn't pay, you'd be taken to do corv√©e labor, undoubtedly a losing proposition.</p><p></p><p>After paying the taxes, when he entered the martial arts school, his finances would be much more abundant, first he would buy a mattress, this hard wooden bed was really uncomfortable to sleep on, and then save a few taels of silver to repay Uncle Chen, then his life would be much better.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was filled with an excited mood until he fell asleep in the late night.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Liang Qu with slightly dark eye circles saw Li Libo, who also had dark eye circles.</p><p></p><p>The two looked at each other and burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>"What time did you sleep last night?"</p><p></p><p>"Around the second watch, and you?"</p><p></p><p>"The fourth watch."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu mocked, "No wonder your eye circles are darker than mine."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo snorted coldly, glancing around, and whispered, "Did you bring all the money?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded, he had come out early this morning, just wanting to get to the martial arts school to pay the tuition as soon as possible, lest nightmares come true and some people develop improper thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After paying the tuition, no matter how bold the ruffians were, they wouldn't dare to go to the martial arts teachers and demand anything.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Libo, today was actually not the day he had planned to become a disciple, but seeing Liang Qu so anxious, he had to come earlier, so they could have each other's company, and Li's father had also given his consent.</p><p></p><p>Following the path, the two walked together to the entrance of Yixing City, spent ten copper coins to board a plank cart, and headed to the neighboring Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>The uneven road was lined with dense trees, and on a sunny and bright day, Liang Qu reckoned that few would dare to walk this night road, and he also had some anticipation for the Pingyang Town they were about to reach.</p><p></p><p>In Liang Qu's memory, he was like Chen Qingjiang, following his father to walk dozens of li to Pingyang Town to sell fish at a higher price.</p><p></p><p>That was a completely different scene from Yixing City.</p><p></p><p>"Fresh stir-fried chestnuts, fresh stir-fried chestnuts, fragrant and tender, sweet and delicious."</p><p></p><p>"Lamb blood soup, fresh lamb blood soup."</p><p></p><p>"Osmanthus flower buns, hot osmanthus flower buns."</p><p></p><p>The cries of the vendors filled the long street, which was also paved with bluestone, much wider than the streets in Yixing City, with the side alleys also paved, not just dirt roads.</p><p></p><p>The two sides of the long street were even more densely packed, the eaves of the shops connected, and the various stalls had set up colorful canopies outside the shops to compete for business.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, have two, they're so fragrant."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, give me two."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tossed over some copper coins and took two osmanthus flower buns, throwing one to Li Libo.</p><p></p><p>"Sizzle sizzle sizzle, hot hot hot." Li Libo juggled the bun with his hands.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After cooling down a bit, he took a bite and felt the fragrant taste fill his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had tried osmanthus cake before, but he had never had an osmanthus bun. When he took a bite, it wasn't as delicious as he had imagined, the difference between it and the modern industrialized products was too great.</p><p></p><p>The prosperity of Pingyang Town exceeded his expectations, with a large number of pedestrians, almost comparable to the bustling Bianjing in the Along the River During the Qingming Festival painting. It seems that the productivity of this world is more advanced than he had imagined. He wondered what the capital of the Great Shun would be like?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was lost in thought as Li Liboa led him to the Yang family's martial arts hall that he had been longing for.</p><p></p><p>There was no elaborate architecture, but the place was quite large, located on the edge of Pingyang Town, with a stone wall courtyard in the back, where people could often be seen coming and out, perhaps a mid-range accommodation.</p><p></p><p>At the entrance of the martial arts hall, there was a long table where a young man was sitting. Seeing the visitors, he stood up and blocked them, cupping his hands and saying, "I am Xiang Changsheng. You two are unfamiliar faces. Are you here to learn martial arts or to visit a friend?"</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa, being the elder, stepped forward and also cupped his hands in greeting, "Hello, we are here to learn martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the cost for learning martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"We know a bit, it's seven taels, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's correct, seven taels of silver does not include food and accommodation. Ten taels include accommodation, twenty taels include accommodation and herbal decoctions, with meals calculated separately. Fifty taels include food, accommodation, and medicinal baths. The term is only three months. Of course, the instruction is the same, how much you can learn depends entirely on your own effort."</p><p></p><p>"If after three months you still cannot break through the skin, flesh, bone, and blood barriers, you must pay the tuition again if you wish to stay."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was stunned, fifty taels for the high-end medicinal baths, that would require catching ten bull-headed pomfrets. For ordinary people, that would be a lifetime's savings.</p><p></p><p>As for the three-month term, that was not surprising. If one had no talent, they couldn't just keep staying.</p><p></p><p>The Yang family's martial arts hall seemed quite well-equipped, with a professional guide at the entrance who was amiable, showing no sign of disdain despite the fishy smell on the two men.</p><p></p><p>This was quite different from the novels, where was the arrogant attitude and humiliation?</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa nodded repeatedly, "Okay, we'll just pay the seven taels."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsheng's expression did not show any contempt. He pointed to the long table he had been sitting at earlier, "In that case, please come here to register, stating your names, ages, and places of origin, and make the payment."</p><p></p><p>The two men came forward, reported their information, and Xiang Changsheng wrote it down, then read it back to them.</p><p></p><p>The writing in this world was also pictographic, and surprisingly similar to the previous world. Liang Qu, who was initially surprised by this, had gradually gotten used to it, and did not reveal his ability to read, pretending to be the same as Li Liboa and nodding in agreement.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the information was correct, Xiang Changsheng led them into the martial arts hall, through the corridor, to the payment counter, handing over the paper with their information.</p><p></p><p>After verifying the silver, Xiang Changsheng received two wooden tablets, handing one each to Liang Qu and Li Liboa.</p><p></p><p>The entire process of becoming a disciple was smooth and efficient, indicating that the martial arts hall had already received a considerable number of students.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu examined the wooden tablet, finding it simple, just with his name carved on it and the date of joining. When the three months were up, the tablet would become invalid.</p><p></p><p>There weren't too many people in the Yang family's martial arts hall, so they probably relied more on facial recognition rather than any anti-counterfeiting measures.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, you two are now disciples of the Yang family's martial arts hall. You can call me Xiang Shixiong (Elder Brother Xiang)."</p><p></p><p>"Xiang Shixiong!" *2 Xiang Changsheng smiled and said, "Let me take you on a tour to familiarize you with the environment, and then briefly introduce some martial arts knowledge, so that you can have a better understanding of the path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Xiang Shixiong."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's spirits were lifted, as this was the part he had been most looking forward to. After being here for a month, this was the crux he had been anticipating, right? (End of chapter)</p>

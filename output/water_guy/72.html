        <h1>Chapter 72</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the people present exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>"It's best to leave it be. The fewer people who know about this, the better. Besides, the two pavilion masters together are not even a match for Third Senior Brother, so they won't be much help. When we find the location of the mountain demon, we can let them come out to clean up the mess," Xiang Changsong suggested.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi frowned, "If the Water Temple truly wants to refine the Embryo Pearl Elixir, the quality of the captives would naturally be the better the stronger. Since Yang Shi is not here, the martial arts pavilion may be the first target. Not informing them, is there not a certain risk?"</p><p></p><p>"If we do inform them, it's hard to guarantee there are no moles within the martial arts pavilion. That might cause the Water Temple to act prematurely, and then we would be overwhelmed. Having advance knowledge of their plan is our advantage right now."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi and Xiang Changsong both fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a thorny issue.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the two senior brothers' discussion, Liang Qu felt the matter was difficult to handle, no matter whether they told them or not, there were risks involved.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Hu Qi spoke again, "According to Shimu's words, if the mountain demon in Yixing City was accidentally attracted by the river god's sacrifice, then how do we explain the one at Fahua Temple? We still haven't caught that mountain demon, and now it seems the Water Temple's people may have dealt with it first.</p><p></p><p>I had thought Luo Shao's condition was due to him incubating a small mountain demon, but now we can't be sure. Was that appearance artificially fabricated after taking the embryo pill, or did he truly incubate a mountain demon?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that the Water Temple's control over the mountain demons is not as high as we thought? Are they also playing with fire? Or perhaps the number of mountain demons has already reached a staggeringly large amount, leading to some loopholes?"</p><p></p><p>"There is too little information."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the most urgent matter is to inform Senior Brothers Xu and Luo and see what they think."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stood up and proposed, "Then I'll go find Senior Brother Luo, and you go find Senior Brother Xu?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi looked up, the sky was already dark, and he nodded, "I'll stay at the martial arts pavilion and keep watch. Be sure to keep a low profile and not let anyone see you."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The two nodded, and just as Liang Qu was about to step out of the round door, Hu Qi suddenly called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Has the junior brother already broken through the barrier?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just the day before yesterday."</p><p></p><p>"It's a few days earlier than I expected. Junior brother's natural talent is indeed extraordinary, you must have a destiny upon you."</p><p></p><p>Again, this talk of destiny.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu vaguely remembered the first time he fused with the Zeling, there was also talk of him having a destiny.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he truly did have a destiny upon him.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've broken through the barrier, junior brother should not shut yourself in from now on. These days outside are also dangerous, you should stay at the martial arts pavilion and practice your fighting techniques more. I'll teach you another martial art."</p><p></p><p>Martial art.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu knew about this. It was recorded in the "Reflections on Cultivating Nature and Life," mainly divided into superior, middle, and inferior three grades, each with three levels.</p><p></p><p>Unlike cultivation techniques, martial arts are techniques, the highest expression of artistry. By controlling one's qi, the same punch, palm, or arrow can be unleashed with many times the power.</p><p></p><p>Given his current level of qi and blood, he could barely display the inferior martial arts. Hu Qi must have felt that Liang Qu would not be able to break through the flesh barrier in the short term, so he wanted him to learn martial arts to improve his combat ability as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Your injury this time has also reminded me. After this matter is resolved, you should go to the Changchun Medical Pavilion to learn some medical skills. You don't need to be too proficient, but you should at least have the ability to identify herbs and set bones.</p><p></p><p>When you're out and about, these are very important. Even the best elixirs can only aid recovery, they can't automatically realign broken bones. If there's no one to help you, rashly taking medicine might cause the bones to heal crookedly, and then it would be even harder to recover."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi spoke solemnly, afraid that his little junior brother would not take these things seriously.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Above, I intentionally gave two examples.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu knew that Hu Qi was right, but he felt that the burden on himself had become much heavier.</p><p></p><p>He was like a child who had been taken by his parents to sign up for several interest classes, and it was really for your own good, you have to learn.</p><p></p><p>Reading, learning martial arts, learning medicine, after the experience of the Water Bathing Sect, Liang Qu even felt that he should learn more about history and secrets, otherwise he would be at a loss when something happened.</p><p></p><p>This is the difference between being a self-taught person and having an inheritance.</p><p></p><p>A martial arts disciple with an inheritance may not necessarily be stronger in fighting than a self-taught person, but he must be more comprehensive, know more, and have a greater chance of surviving when in trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, it's nothing, I just wanted to tell you, go and come back quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned and stepped out of the round gate, until he passed through the corridor and came to the door of the martial arts hall, he suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, I haven't asked for leave from the academy yet."</p><p></p><p>Today is not a rest day! </p><p></p><p>He skipped the academy! He originally planned to worship the river god at noon, and then he still had time to go back to the academy for class, but so many things happened, he had forgotten, and he didn't even ask someone to apply for leave.</p><p></p><p>It's already dark, I guess there's no one at the academy now, I'll find a chance to apologize tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>In Lu Gang's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu walked into the house quietly under the guidance of the gatekeeper, he didn't know why he had to do this, it was a completely subconscious action.</p><p></p><p>It's dark, but it's only a little past eight o'clock, it gets dark early in winter.</p><p></p><p>Normally, there should be the sound of clanging iron in Senior Brother Lu's house, but today there is not a single sound.</p><p></p><p>Going into the house, several large iron stoves have gone out, only the big red stove that Senior Brother Lu uses is still burning, with two burly men guarding it, and Senior Brother Lu is leaning against it with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Almost at the moment when Liang Qu entered the house and stirred up the airflow, Lu Gang opened his eyes and looked towards the door: "Junior Brother Liang?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Lu." Liang Qu bowed and paid his respects, judging from the situation, Senior Brother Lu has been working hard on his long spear for him these days.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have something to see me about?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around: "Senior Brother, can we talk in a quieter place?"</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's go to the study."</p><p></p><p>In the study, Liang Qu told Lu Gang about his experiences today, including the exchanges with the Yang family and the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The Water Bathing Sect, I know a little about it, I thought it had already died out, but it turns out it still exists. Since it's a bit quiet now, let's go to the martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi greeted Lu Gang, and the three of them waited for Xiang Changsong and Xu Zishuai.</p><p></p><p>It took nearly half an hour before they saw two figures hurriedly walk out of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, sorry, we're late, we're late." As soon as Xu Zishuai came in, he kept apologizing, and Liang Qu faintly smelled a fragrance of rouge.</p><p></p><p>"Where have you been fooling around again?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang frowned, although it was a question, his gaze was on Xiang Changsong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai gave a threatening look, and Xiang Changsong smiled helplessly: "Senior Brother Lu must already have the answer in his heart, right?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang sighed helplessly: "Since all my junior brothers are here, I won't say anything about you. Anyway, you take care of yourself, and don't go to those places too often in the future, or your legs and hands will go numb, and don't blame me for not reminding you."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, Senior Brother Lu, don't underestimate me." Xu Zishuai straightened his back and brushed off his robe, about to boast.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, don't show off, talk about the serious matter, do you know about the Water Bathing Sect?" As the oldest and most powerful disciple present, Lu Gang naturally took on the responsibility of taking the lead.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai became serious: "As for the Water Bathing Sect, I actually have an idea."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

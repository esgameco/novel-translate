        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Disciple!? Liang Qu wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth, only to realize that he didn't know when his thumb had split open, the skin and flesh peeled back, his hand covered in blood, perhaps from just now when he had been smashing bricks. The blood at the corner of his mouth wasn't cleaned off properly, leaving a bloody trail on his face instead.</p><p></p><p>With his face covered in blood, Liang Qu didn't pay much attention to it. His gaze was filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>So many people had jumped down from the roof, and Hu Qi and Xiang Changsong had followed closely behind - it was obvious who the leading elder was.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong! The true master of the Yang Family Martial Arts Hall, rumored to be the most powerful master in the entire Pingyang Town!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't know what Zhao Sanguozi Zhao Xueyuan had been thinking before the commotion occurred, but if he knew, he would surely understand.</p><p></p><p>In fictional novels, the emperor must be wise and mighty, and if the common people are suffering, it must be because of treacherous ministers deceiving him.</p><p></p><p>But fictional novels are just that - fiction. They are stories written out of unfulfilled desires.</p><p></p><p>Reality doesn't have that many heroic detectives, nor are there people who would willingly spend a lot of effort to clearly discern right from wrong for others.</p><p></p><p>How many people dare to report to the authorities after being wronged? </p><p></p><p>In the school, how many victims of bullying dare to tell the teachers?</p><p></p><p>Those in power don't have the energy to determine who's right or wrong among the lower ranks. They just think someone has caused trouble, so they'll just beat them up and drive them out - problem solved.</p><p></p><p>The lowly are used to suffering, so they don't dare to have any illusions about those in high positions.</p><p></p><p>You can't completely drive people out of your sphere of activity, or in the end, you'll be the one left battered and bruised.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had thought he would be seen as a troublemaker by the martial arts hall masters and be driven out, but he never imagined it would turn out this way!</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong bent over slightly, a faint smile on his face: "What, you don't want to?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the people behind him, Li Libo and Chen Jiechangchang, were anxious. If they could communicate telepathically, they would be shouting in Liang Qu's mind to quickly agree, quickly agree.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the martial arts hall disciples were silent.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt that those people were looking at him with envious, jealous, and hateful gazes.</p><p></p><p>A true disciple, not just an ordinary student who pays tuition to come to the martial arts hall! Liang Qu snapped out of his daze and immediately knelt on the ground, kowtowing three times.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Liang Qu pays respects to the master!"</p><p></p><p>A man's knees have gold beneath them, but to kowtow to one's master is not shameful!</p><p></p><p>The saying goes, "Teach a disciple, and the master will starve." If you want to learn a skill, you have to support your master for the rest of their life - this principle applies everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong's actions have convinced Liang Qu that his choice was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" Yang Dongxiong was overjoyed, bending down to help Liang Qu up. "Get up quickly, you're injured. As for the tea ceremony and such, we'll deal with that later. But since you've already kowtowed, your status as my disciple is now established. From now on, you will be my ninth disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked up and saw the seven people behind Yang Dongxiong - six men and one woman. Although one was missing, among them were Xiang Shixiong and Hu Shixiong.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Shixiong winked at him, and Hu Shixiong secretly gave him a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Liang Shidi!"</p><p>"Liang Shidi is truly a talented person."</p><p>"Oh no! Now that Liang Shidi has joined, won't my title of 'the most handsome' be in jeopardy?" a tall young man exclaimed in dismay.</p><p>"Cut it out, even if Liang Shidi hadn't come, the one holding the title of 'the most handsome' would still be me, okay?" </p><p>"You two, don't just pee on yourselves and think you're all that." The lone female disciple sneered.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong patted his pocket, somewhat regretfully: "It's a pity I don't have a proper welcoming gift on me right now. I'll make it up to you next time we meet."</p><p>"Damn it, Xiang Shidi, why did you have to bring that up! I hate picking out gifts the most!"</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was lively and joyful, and Liang Qu couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>How wonderful, it seems my choice was not wrong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong stroked his beard, and the more he looked at Liang Qu, the more he liked him.</p><p></p><p>He did not take in disciples casually, nor was it out of some compensatory psychology, but purely out of a love for talent.</p><p></p><p>Even on the eaves, Yang Dongxiong had heard the abducted apprentice recount the ins and outs, and although there were some gaps, at his age, he naturally understood the course of events at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong also told Yang Dongxiong that Liang Qu had used all his savings to rescue Chen Qingjiang, simply because Chen Qingjiang had once done Liang Qu a small favor.</p><p></p><p>It was not because this matter was so famous that it had spread from Yixing City to Pingyang Town, but because Li Liboa and Chen Jiechanghad said so.</p><p></p><p>After Hu Qi took a leave of absence, the only one they knew in the martial arts hall was Xiang Changsong, and they occasionally chatted and naturally mentioned it.</p><p></p><p>One was hearsay, the other was witnessed, and the two together were enough to prove Liang Qu's excellent character.</p><p></p><p>In addition, being able to fight against seven people in a month after entering the hall was enough to prove that Liang Qu's natural talent was not weak, and his qi and blood were at least as thick as a little finger, which allowed him to have such physical fitness.</p><p></p><p>He had talent, he had character, and he was also an apprentice of his own martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>The only shortcoming was that his fighting skills were not refined, too clumsy, and he even resorted to brute force when fighting against seven people, when he could have solved the opponents with less cost. But this was not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>There were many in the martial arts hall who only learned the techniques and not the fighting skills, and everyone was looking for a way to become a martial artist, which was understandable, and could be supplemented later.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong encouraged him: "Your courage is admirable, but your fighting skills are not refined. Refining techniques is certainly of paramount importance, but you cannot forget to learn fighting skills. A martial artist relies on martial arts to survive."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu hurriedly cupped his hands: "Your disciple will remember."</p><p></p><p>He knew that Yang Shifu was right, that he only had techniques and no fighting skills, and that he had to rely on sheer courage when fighting, but it was an inevitable choice.</p><p></p><p>Fighting skills are not just about memorizing routines, as evidenced by the seven people lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He had been coming here for a long time, but could only swing a stick, and becoming a master required long-term sparring to form muscle memory.</p><p></p><p>His outstanding performance on the training ground was entirely due to his physical fitness and the fearlessness and calmness he had cultivated in his fight with the crab monster.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong nodded and turned to his disciples: "Changsong, Huqi, since you two are already acquainted, take your ninth junior brother to wash his face and change his clothes. Oh, and don't forget the other two, there should still be an empty room in the backyard, let them stay there tonight."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's face was covered in blood, both his own and others', which was unsightly, and his body was also in pain from being hit by many sticks, so he urgently needed to clean up.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong and Hu Qi cupped their hands and went forward to support Li Liboa and Chen Jiechanghang, while Liang Qu could still walk on his own, though Li Liboa and Chen Jiechanghang were more seriously injured and had difficulty walking.</p><p></p><p>They walked together towards the corridor leading to the backyard, with high walls on both sides blocking the moonlight and lamplight, making the narrow passage pitch-black.</p><p></p><p>The training ground was brightly lit, with people bustling about.</p><p></p><p>The crowd naturally parted, as if the Great Sage had split the Peach Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of apprentices watched Liang Qu, their gazes of mockery, ridicule, and schadenfreude turning into awe, envy, and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>The crickets in the flower bed began to chirp again.</p><p></p><p>The two parties passed each other, one in the light, the other in the dark.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu disappeared into the darkness, but everyone knew that the path he was walking was brighter than the one on the training ground.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong silently watched the new disciple leave, then turned to the crowd on the training ground, his expression becoming serious again: "The matter is over, and I don't want to waste your time either. Line up in order and come up one by one to demonstrate what you've learned today!"</p><p></p><p>Most of those present were senior apprentices, and they knew what to do. Even those who had never experienced it tried to imitate.</p><p></p><p>A long queue soon formed in front of Yang Dongxiong, with the apprentices taking turns demonstrating what they had learned today, hoping to get some guidance.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai and the others, covered in wounds, lay on the ground bleeding, and no one paid them much attention.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

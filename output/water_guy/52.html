        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dead?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang was taken aback and asked, "What conflict did you have with him?"</p><p></p><p>"I guess you could say that." Liang Qu briefly explained what had happened at the martial arts school, "So I wanted to go see what exactly happened."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang shook his head and put down the Crimson Fire Mourning Feather: "Going alone would be too dangerous, let me accompany you."</p><p></p><p>Joking, how could the young master Lu be killed, and in such a gruesome way of having his organs devoured? It was most likely the work of a demonic creature.</p><p></p><p>Who knows if there are any demonic creatures lurking nearby, those that have gained sentience are all cunning.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt a bit awkward to trouble Lu Gang over this small matter, since the incident was so major, the area must have already been thoroughly investigated. But thinking it over, it wouldn't hurt to be extra careful, so he had no choice but to trouble his senior brother again.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang turned and walked out of the quiet room, and when he returned, he had a few black stones in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The black stones were placed next to the Crimson Feather, and when exposed to heat, they quickly changed color, the surface gradually covered in a network of dark red veins, shining in harmony with the Crimson Feather, like a few beating hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Fire-red stones, high-quality charcoal stones. Placing them here, the Crimson Fire Mourning Feather's energy will not only not decrease in the short term, but will even increase. Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The two set out from the small path next to the Huang family's cloth shop, and along the way, they came across a flat dirt road. Although there was withered grass, it stood out from the surroundings since there were no trees, making it easy to see that this was once a road.</p><p></p><p>"The Fahua Temple has been abandoned for decades, I remember that in the early days of the founding of the country, the monks there were all killed. Back then, Pingyang Town was just a small village, I don't even remember the exact location, but it should be around here. The footprints on the ground are very fresh, the shoes are not bad, they should be from the officials."  Lu Gang glanced down.</p><p></p><p>The ground was hard in winter, but it had rained the night before, leaving the soil relatively soft, and the footprints were very clear.</p><p></p><p>The Fahua Temple had been abandoned for a very long time, and it was far from the town, located near the mountain top, with few beggars going there. So many fresh footprints in a short time could only be from the investigating constables.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang took the lead: "Let's go, stay behind me and be careful."</p><p></p><p>With Lu Gang's sturdy figure in front of him, Liang Qu felt a strong sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Treading on the soft yellow soil, Liang Qu looked around, the surrounding forest was lush, and although there were not many leaves, he could imagine how deep and secluded it would be in the summer.</p><p></p><p>After walking a few hundred meters, the scene suddenly opened up, and they could see the Fahua Temple on the mountaintop.</p><p></p><p>The vermilion walls of the temple had completely peeled off, exposing the gray bricks, and years of wind and rain had turned this gray into a blackish color, with dark green moss covering the corners.</p><p></p><p>Thin, dry vines had spread across one corner of the roof, deeply rooted in the cracks of the tiles, like parasitic trees drawing nourishment from the mud walls.</p><p></p><p>Was this where Lu Shaohui died? Why here, in such a remote place?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu couldn't figure it out.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that a demonic beast killed him and then dragged him here? Otherwise, what would Lu Shaohui be doing in this dilapidated temple?</p><p></p><p>As they approached, the lintel at the entrance had completely collapsed, revealing the broken bricks inside.</p><p></p><p>The constable on guard saw Lu Gang's imposing figure and did not dare to rebuke them, only saying, "Civilians are not allowed to enter!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang took out his waist token from his waist and waved it: "I am Lu Gang, a disciple of Yang Donghong. Do you recognize me?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's Lord Lu! Please come in." </p><p></p><p>The constable bowed respectfully, not recognizing Lu Gang, but the exquisite waist token indicated that he was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The constables coming and going all bowed and greeted them respectfully, without any arrogance or overbearing attitude, quite different from the group seen during the autumn tax collection.</p><p></p><p>Walking behind Lu Gang, Liang Qu was greatly impressed, reaching for his own waist token eagerly, but unfortunately, after entering, the constables were all very courteous, leaving him no chance to show off.</p><p></p><p>Not only the lintel, but even the main gate of the Fahua Temple was completely rotten. Entering the courtyard, Liang Qu immediately spotted the corpse in the center.</p><p></p><p>Lu Shaohui lay dead at the feet of the Buddha, the body leaning against the ornately carved altar. Thick black blood dripped from the ends of his hair, his entire chest cavity completely torn open, like two collapsing doors.</p><p></p><p>No, it was more like a cicada molt.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if Lu Shaohui's heart, liver, spleen, and lungs had all gained their own lives, hatching and bursting out from his body, an astonishing aura of death emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt a bit nauseated and asked, "Senior Brother Lu, can you tell what demonic creature did this?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The coroner wearing a small cap and carrying a wicker box hurriedly stood up when he saw the body: "Can this esteemed gentleman see anything? Lord Lu, rest assured, from the discovery until now, we have not done any processing to the body, it is still exactly the same as before."</p><p></p><p>He could perform autopsies, but the scene before him was beyond his experience, he had never seen anything like this, the internal organs did not seem to have been removed, they were too clean.</p><p></p><p>"It's a mountain demon."</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice came from behind Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Hu?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang, what are you doing here?"</p><p></p><p>"The yamen officials said the coroner couldn't determine the cause of death, so they sent someone to the martial arts school to ask for my help. I thought Lord Lu might be from the martial arts school, so I came to take a look. But when I got to the door, someone said the people from the martial arts school had already arrived, and I was wondering who it could be, turns out it's Brother Lu and Brother Liang. Oh, let me introduce, this is the squad leader, Shi Guangxi."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi strode forward, followed by a rough-looking man with a beard.</p><p></p><p>The rough-looking Shi Guangxi hurriedly cupped his hands in greeting: "Greetings, gentlemen."</p><p></p><p>Lu Jian nodded slightly, and Liang Qu followed suit.</p><p></p><p>After greeting them, squad leader Shi Guangxi looked at Hu Qi and urgently asked, "Master Hu, you just said it's a mountain demon? Is it a demonic beast?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi did not answer, but looked at Lu Jian: "Brother Lu, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be correct."</p><p></p><p>"What is a mountain demon?" Liang Qu felt he needed to learn more about this.</p><p></p><p>Lu Jian said, "A kind of mountain spirit that resembles a human, with skin the color of a withered tree, impervious to blades and guns. At first they like to eat livestock, but as they grow older they prefer to eat human organs. When they mature, they will even lay eggs inside a person's body, and when the eggs hatch, the person's chest will open up like this.</p><p></p><p>Brother Liang, you don't need to hurry, the master has already arranged for you to study at the academy. What we learn is different from ordinary scholars, you'll understand everything in due time."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi walked around the area, then returned with a grave expression: "If this is the place of death, then this mountain demon is very powerful. Lord Lu is a Second-level martial artist, able to split rocks, but there are hardly any signs of a struggle around here, so he was probably killed in one encounter. And the incubation of the mountain demon's eggs is extremely fast, even if it's just a little, it would still take two days."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was shocked: "So he really died on the same day he left the martial arts school?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi nodded: "Most likely."</p><p></p><p>Lu Jian said, "It's best to go tell the master first, let him make the arrangements, the threat to ordinary martial artists is quite large."</p><p></p><p>Shi Guangxi listened nearby, his heart pounding: "What about ordinary people then? Won't it be even worse?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi shook his head: "Not necessarily. The big fish eats the small fish, the small fish eats the shrimp. This mountain demon prefers the most vigorous lifeblood, so it actually doesn't pose much threat to ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Shi Guangxi heaved a sigh of relief, but then his anxiety rose again.</p><p></p><p>"However, when the mountain demon hatches a baby mountain demon, the baby is different from the adult. Squad Leader Shi should still send more people to patrol in the next few days."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, but the martial arts master should help us more. We ordinary people can't deal with those mountain spirits and demons, when I go back to report to the county magistrate, I'll definitely post a big reward notice, I won't stinge on the master."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we'll definitely keep an eye out. If we can resolve it, that would be best. It's just, what about the people in your yamen?"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh, don't even mention it." Shi Guangxi frowned worriedly, "I don't know why, but lately the martial artists in the yamen seem to all have tasks, I can't find a single one."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi pondered this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that someone was handling it, Lu Jian prepared to leave: "Brother Hu, since you're staying here, I'll head back first. Brother Liang, bring back the Scarlet Mourning Feather, you need to refine it quickly before it deteriorates."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi was surprised: "Scarlet Mourning Feather? Where did you get that?"</p><p></p><p>Helplessly, Liang Qu repeated the whole process of how he found the feather.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi was quite envious: "Brother Liang, your luck is really extraordinary. But with your current cultivation, fully activating and refining the Scarlet Mourning Feather into a weapon is indeed the best choice, since spiritual weapons are so hard to come by. Alright, you two go back first, I'll take a look around the area with Squad Leader Shi."</p><p></p><p>Lu Jian nodded. He had said it in front of Hu Qi, just to let Liang Qu know that his advice was not because he wanted to forge a spiritual weapon.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

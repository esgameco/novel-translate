        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned around and looked at his own house.</p><p></p><p>It was no more than ten meters wide, and only with the surrounding low courtyard walls did it look a bit larger.</p><p></p><p>The old tile roof had a few corners covered with straw to keep out the rain, and the dirt floor was already full of pits and holes.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that after refusing Xue Chengquan, he would end up coming back again.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't refuse again, at worst he could just go to the martial arts school when he couldn't return home.</p><p></p><p>As for the main sacrificial ceremony, it wasn't too much trouble, and it was also a chance to show his face, so he agreed to it.</p><p></p><p>He thanked Old Chen Zhaoan again, and the group headed back in a grand manner.</p><p></p><p>Just as Liang Qu was about to close the door and practice martial arts, enjoying his free time, the door was knocked on again.</p><p></p><p>Opening the door, it turned out to be Uncle Chen, who had just sold the fish and came to divide the earnings.</p><p></p><p>Chen Qingjiang was in an excited mood, fishing out a few silver coins from his bag and placing them on the table, excitedly talking about selling the fish: "Five hundred and sixty-seven coins! When Lin Songbao heard it was your fish, he directly gave me five silver coins, five coins, that's half a tael! We earned half a tael of silver in one day!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Uncle Chen so elated, Liang Qu felt even better. He divided the silver coins on the table into two halves and pushed them apart: "Then according to the agreed five-five split, you take two and a half coins, and I take two and a half coins."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, two and a half is too much, I can't take that, one coin is enough, I'll just take one coin." Chen Qingjiang took one coin from his half and put it back in his bag.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, didn't we agree on a five-five split from the beginning? Now you want me to go back on my word? Isn't this dragging me into unrighteousness? If this gets out, won't it ruin my reputation?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had already figured out Uncle Chen's character, so he didn't bother with politeness, directly using the moral high ground to pressure him.</p><p></p><p>Two and a half coins a day, he could save at least two coins every day, and the money for Uncle Chen's clinic could be repaid in four or five days.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Chen Qingjiang was swayed by this, his face scrunching up. He may not have read many books, but he had heard plenty of stories about people who sacrificed themselves for the greater good, and he was immediately intimidated, so he had to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"I really feel bad about it. Since it's time for dinner now, Uncle Chen, why don't you let me come to your house and have a meal?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I'll go tell my wife to cook a few more dishes."</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Liang Qu saw that Xue Chengquan had set up a simple porridge stall at the dock.</p><p></p><p>The thick, fragrant porridge was steaming in the cold wind, and people were lining up, shivering as they received and drank the porridge.</p><p></p><p>There were the same children, women, and limping old men from the alley that he had seen before, and in the middle, there were also many people smearing ash on their clothes to blend in, but they were chased away by the nearby Lin Songbao.</p><p></p><p>He was here to help, and he knew very well who was truly poor and who was just pretending in the town.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, coming here to beg for food and drink, do you know whose stall this is? Water Brother! Liang Qu! Who is that? Master Yang's disciple, the future lord! If you're not afraid of death, come on over, if you can fool me, Lin Laoye, then I'll give you that!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao raised his thumb high and shouted loudly to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu heard this and laughed. He didn't approach, but just took a quick look and then left.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Liang Qu put on his waist plaque and arm guards, wore clean clothes, and followed the carriage team to the Shangshu Academy. Through the old man he had met the day before, he found his teacher and started learning from the basics, studying things like the Disciple's Rules and the Three Character Classic.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the seat, Liang Qu looked around at the group of children around seven to twelve years old, feeling quite helpless. At his age, coming to learn characters, he was considered an "elderly student."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, as someone who had received a systematic education and had been admitted to a prestigious university, Liang Qu's learning ability was extremely strong. Plus, the characters in this world had many similarities, so he learned them at an astonishingly fast pace, surprising even the teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Qu, you really haven't attended a private school before?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir, I've been a fisherman since I was young, never went to school, but I often pass by the shops and ponder, so I can recognize some characters, like the ones on the Five Fragrance Hall, I memorized them after passing by a few times."</p><p></p><p>The schoolmaster gave Liang Qu a label of being studious in his heart, and sighed with emotion: "If you give up the martial path and turn to pursue an official career, you might just achieve great success."</p><p></p><p>The little children around were all looking at him with admiration, making Liang Qu feel rather awkward.</p><p></p><p>Appearing saintly in front of others is not the right way to do it, there's no sense of accomplishment at all.</p><p></p><p>"You are a martial practitioner, so you have an extra learning task. Since your foundation is not bad, perhaps you can try reading these two books, if you don't understand, you can come ask me."</p><p></p><p>The teacher handed over two stacks of books, one was the "Annotated Edition of the Miscellaneous Records of the Vast Wood Hall", with six volumes, the other was "Reflections on Cultivating Nature and Life", with two volumes.</p><p></p><p>The Great Shun Dynasty was founded on martial arts, even scholars who have never practiced martial arts have a deep understanding of the martial path, there are even stories of great Confucian scholars who could instantly enlighten martial masters despite their lack of martial skills.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the books with both hands and briefly flipped through the table of contents.</p><p></p><p>Both were works by cultivators at the Pinnacle realm. The former was a compilation of the author's lifetime experiences and those of his friends, mainly discussing the characteristics of various spiritual creatures, herb identification, and encounters with spiritual treasures. Since it was from a personal perspective, it was quite interesting to read.</p><p></p><p>The latter was not much different, except that this martial practitioner lived in an earlier era, describing many battlefield experiences and his understanding of martial cultivation, with more accurate and precise descriptions of certain realms.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Galloping Horse Realm, where the peak can hold back dozens of galloping horses without moving. What kind of horses are these? Are they all Heavenly Horses, or all inferior horses, are they large or small horses? It's actually a rather vague description.</p><p></p><p>"These two books are just for beginners, there are many more to read later on. Most of the records about spiritual creatures and demonic beasts are accurate, and the inaccurate ones have annotations left by later generations, all are precious experiences of the predecessors.</p><p></p><p>You can try reading them first, take them back and flip through, but be sure not to damage them, otherwise not only will you have to compensate at the original price, but also pay an additional fee for disrespecting the books, since they are handwritten, one volume costs one tael of silver."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded seriously, thinking that it's not easy being a martial practitioner, without some culture they can't get by anywhere, they can't even understand the martial arts manuals, if they encounter spiritual treasures they can't even recognize them, and if they meet some strange spiritual creatures, they may not know how to deal with them and could end up in trouble.</p><p></p><p>For several consecutive days, Liang Qu went back and forth between Pingyang Town and Yixing City, reading books and practicing calligraphy.</p><p></p><p>He didn't go to the martial arts school, as the twenty-day breakthrough time being compressed to less than five days was too exaggerated, it would be better to take a break for a couple of days before going.</p><p></p><p>In the town, the matter of Lu Shao's incident gradually faded away, it seemed that the mountain ghost had disappeared without a trace, and the townspeople's emotions gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>The only anomaly was that when Liang Qu was reading the "Annotated Edition of the Miscellaneous Records of the Vast Wood Hall", he found records related to the mountain ghost, which said that this creature usually eats once every two days, so it shouldn't have been silent for so long.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, no one dying is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu also didn't stand under dangerous walls, when traveling between the two places, he tried to avoid taking the land route as much as possible and took the water route instead.</p><p></p><p>Pingyang Town is not located next to the Jianghuai marshes, but the two places are connected by waterways.</p><p></p><p>There is a winding tributary river running through the entire town, about seven or eight meters wide and over ten meters deep, the one in front of the Liangyun Pavilion, with the South Stone Bridge spanning across it.</p><p></p><p>According to the elders, it was carved out by the passage of a great serpent, making it unusually winding, causing the water route to be longer than the land route. And there are also fishing docks in the town, so those who want to sell fish in the town have to pay a crossing fee first, which is why fishermen rarely take this route.</p><p></p><p>For safety's sake, Liang Qu was willing to pay a little more for the crossing fee.</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, he also went on two boat trips, following two beasts to search for whether there were any other treasures or spiritual plants hidden in the waters around Yixing City, but unfortunately they found nothing.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps if you keep something in mind, there will be a response, that day Liang Qu was tracing the calligraphy practice sheets, when he received an unmoving transmission in the middle.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

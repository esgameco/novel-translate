        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the hall, Xue Dingyi knelt on the ground, his eyes downcast, daring not to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>The entire Xue mansion was as silent as a cicada in winter, with only the roar of Master Xue Chengquan.</p><p></p><p>"If others hadn't told me, I wouldn't have known that you've caused such a huge disaster outside! Four months, just the tuition fees are a hundred taels of silver, and I've also provided you with an extra fifty taels for medical expenses. What have you accomplished? Huh? Idling outside, not striving for progress, stirring up trouble, defiling the maidservants at home, being unfilial and dissolute, how could I have given birth to such a rebellious son!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Dingyi stiffened his neck: "How did I defile the maidservants? It was Qiuhua who seduced me first, and she even called me to drink brown sugar water in a very flirtatious manner."</p><p></p><p>"You, you!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan trembled as he pointed his finger at Xue Dingyi, his face turning as pale as gold paper, his mouth, nose, and eyes askew.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, my son, please say less." Xue's mother cried out anxiously beside him.</p><p></p><p>"You shut up too! If it weren't for you helping to cover it up, how would I have only found out now? Two days, a full two days, going out to mess around every day, I thought you were going to the martial arts school! Turns out you were going to the brothel!" Xue Chengquan looked around at the little servants and ordered, "Gag his mouth and beat him to death!"</p><p></p><p>The little servants trembled like quails, but they dared not disobey the master of the house.</p><p></p><p>They could only pin Xue Dingyi down on the bench and give him a dozen or so heavy blows, but it was just a loud noise and a light drizzle.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, are you all just putting on a show for me? Huh? Get out of my way!" </p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan kicked away the ones holding the board, snatched it himself, and gritted his teeth as he struck him thirty or forty times.</p><p></p><p>Xue's mother wailed and hugged Xue Chengquan's legs, tearfully begging him to stop beating, but Xue Chengquan didn't listen at all, and instead beat him even more fiercely: "A doting mother ruins her son, you've spoiled this rebellious son of mine every day, and now you're still trying to persuade me? If you keep persuading, I'll beat you too!"</p><p></p><p>Xue's mother was frightened and let go, sitting silently on the ground, wiping her tears with a handkerchief.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan panted as he beat, not stopping until he could no longer hold the stick. He then sat down on the bench, took a few sips of tea, and shouted, "Tomorrow, tomorrow you'll go with me to Yixing City to apologize to Yang Shi's ninth disciple!"</p><p></p><p>There was no response.</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear me?"</p><p></p><p>Still no response.</p><p></p><p>Xue Chengquan's eyebrows shot up, and he was about to pick up the stick again, when the little servant next to him hurriedly shouted, "Master, don't hit anymore, the young master has fainted! If you keep hitting, it'll really be trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"Tungsten is different from ordinary metals, it is very heat-resistant, and ordinary furnaces can't melt it, but it has a characteristic that it easily absorbs fire essence but is difficult to release it, so using a large amount of fire red stones to constantly temper it, after a certain time, it will gradually soften."</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang sat in front of the furnace, pouring in fire red stones, his muscular body shining with a metallic luster.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't used Scarlet Flame Mourning Feather to forge weapons before, but I've used similar materials, so I have a certain grasp of it. Maybe this spear will be my masterpiece."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu listened happily beside him: "Thank you, senior brother Lü."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to thank me, being able to forge a sharp weapon is the best reward for a blacksmith. If you didn't come, I would have found a way to refine the Scarlet Flame Mourning Feather into a weapon anyway, the only difference is what kind of weapon I make."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, senior brother Lü, if you use the Scarlet Flame Mourning Feather, will the spear become a fire-attribute weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was worried in his heart, this was both fire red stones and Scarlet Flame Mourning Feather, in another story setting, that would be a perfect fire-attribute magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>But he was a water monkey, the eight characters didn't match at all.</p><p></p><p>"No, the characteristic of tungsten is stable compatibility, it's not easy to change the attribute. And the fire red stones are just a kind of high-heat charcoal, nothing special.</p><p></p><p>As for the Scarlet Flame Mourning Feather, it is essentially the essence of life, although it has fire attribute energy, unless you use other methods, it can't be fused into the tungsten. It can only imbue the tungsten weapon with spirituality. Junior brother, are you wanting to add an attribute to it? Then the material for the spearhead needs to be changed."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll change it." </p><p></p><p>"Oh, no, no need, it's good as it is now."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>At noon, Liang Qu went to Lu Gang's place and had a meal there before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Staying here wouldn't be of much help, just watching his senior brother busy himself, sitting idle wouldn't be right. After returning to the martial arts school, Liang Qu practiced the skin-refining technique again, getting one step closer to breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Everything was progressing in an orderly manner, there was sufficient positive feedback every day, making him enthusiastic about it. Even though the weather was getting colder by the day, he had no desire to sleep in, only wanting to break through, break through, break through!</p><p></p><p>After finishing the skin-refining, Xiang Changsong came to look for Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Elder Brother Hu had returned for a visit earlier, and seeing Liang Qu cultivating, he didn't disturb him, so he asked Xiang Changsong to take Liang Qu to the academy to register.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts, watching the blacksmith, reading books, and even diving to retrieve treasures. Liang Qu suddenly felt his time had become very tight, as if he had been enrolled in several cram schools by his parents.</p><p></p><p>But this "cram school" was one where he was experiencing both pain and joy.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts, reading, spiritual weapons - no ordinary person would have the qualifications to engage in these, yet he now had access to all of them.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the academy, they were greeted by a white-haired elder in a long robe.</p><p></p><p>After briefly recording the information, the elder stroked his beard and said, "Tomorrow is a rest day, so starting the day after, the young master will come from the end of the afternoon hour to the end of the evening hour, studying for one hour, with one break in ten. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll follow your instructions."</p><p></p><p>"Good, when the time comes, you come find me, and I'll take you to meet the teacher. If you need to ask for leave, remember to notify in advance. If it's an emergency, you'll need to have someone inform us as well."</p><p></p><p>"The student understands."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you two can take a look around the academy, walk around and have a look, as long as you don't disturb the others."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu went in and strolled around. The courtyard had a simple pond, a bamboo grove, and a small pavilion with a stone table and benches - the standard scenery of an academy. There were also several small classroom-like rooms, totaling around sixty students, some reading and some writing.</p><p></p><p>After familiarizing himself with the environment, Liang Qu returned to the martial arts school and began the second round of skin-refining in the quiet room.</p><p></p><p>After two or three days of skin-refining, Liang Qu found that his physical fitness was much better than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Unlike what Hu Qi had said, where he could only condense blood qi twice a day, Liang Qu could now completely refine it three times a day! And the condensed blood qi was no longer as thick as a finger, but as thick as a thumb!</p><p></p><p>Knowing that blood qi is the result of physical fitness, not the cause, Liang Qu guessed that the previous improvement in his physical fitness from the 40% fusion of the Zeiling had not been fully converted into blood qi results. If he had squeezed it out back then, his chest qi would have been even more robust.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, his recovery ability and physical fitness were far superior to others at the same stage.</p><p></p><p>The benefit of this was that after this round of skin-refining, the abnormal sensations in his skin and fascia were very strong, as if a transformation was imminent.</p><p></p><p>Based on the current progress, as long as he did it for two or three more days, he should be able to break through. The joy in his heart was irrepressible, and Liang Qu suppressed his fatigue and continued to stand in the stance, eagerly anticipating the moment of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Li Liboa knocked on the door: "Ashuai, there's someone at the door looking for you, it's that guy Lin Songbao."</p><p></p><p>"I'm coming."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu put away his stance, wiped the sweat off his face with a towel, changed his clothes, and walked out the door neatly dressed.</p><p></p><p>Outside, Li Liboa was a bit curious: "What does Lin Songbao want with you?"</p><p></p><p>"His father must have known that I was accepted as Yang Shi's direct disciple, and wants to invite me to dinner."</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa's eyes lit up: "That's great! Isn't Lin Songbao's father the owner of the fishing dock? You can talk to him and see if we can get a better price for selling fish in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll take care of it."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

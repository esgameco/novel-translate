        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu went home to find some clean clothes to change into, and then ran towards Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>The piles of leaves on the sides of the road became thicker and thicker, with the top layer being red and yellow, and the bottom layer being dark brown.</p><p></p><p>The wind blew on him like icy knives, but Liang Qu only felt full of energy, not cold at all, with a burning passion in his chest.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tilted his head up, and the huge setting sun gradually descended, casting a brilliant rainbow-gold glow in his pupils.</p><p></p><p>The sunset slowly took the sunlight away from the earth, turning the scarlet forest into a dark red, and night would soon fall - this was the last glimpse of the sunset.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt that this world was not bad at all, without pollution or cages, and the air was refreshingly clean.</p><p></p><p>A brief period of decline is not a bad thing, as long as the direction is right, frying and stewing can both become delicious ways, and struggling is also like that, there will always be a day when you can emerge.</p><p></p><p>"Woo hoo!" </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>The mule pulling a cart by the roadside was startled, and tried to run into the forest, but the carter cracked the whip several times to bring it back on track, muttering, "Idiot."</p><p></p><p>Has this word appeared so early?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was stunned, but did not get angry, just smiling back. Seeing this, the carter left cursing, feeling that he had really encountered a fool.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in Pingyang Town, Liang Qu guessed that Li Liboa and Chen Jiechangshould be hungry, so he bought a few steamed buns and came to Yang's Martial Arts Hall through a familiar shortcut.</p><p></p><p>The main gate of the martial arts hall was brightly lit, and there was a large oil lamp a few meters inside, and a lantern every ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu carried the paper-wrapped buns and walked through the corridor with familiarity.</p><p></p><p>There were more people on the training ground, about fifty or so.</p><p></p><p>Many people would go home to practice on their own after learning the moves, and only meet again at the end of the month for registration. The thirty people he had seen on the registration day were not the full group.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that there were no formal martial arts masters among the crowd, only disciples.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought that the masters might have other matters to attend to, or had gone to pay respects to Master Yang, and did not think much of it, but many people were stealing glances at him.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why are they all looking at me?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was puzzled. He was down on his luck, and normally no one would bother with him, so why were they staring at him?</p><p></p><p>Was he late?</p><p></p><p>He remembered when he was in high school, there was a time he overslept and was caught by the homeroom teacher who came to round up the students for morning reading. Many of his good friends who pretended to be reading were actually watching the show, just like now.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had no choice but to pretend not to notice, and went alone to the corner of the flower bed to find Li Liboa and Chen Jiechangs.</p><p></p><p>Hearing footsteps, the two of them looked up, and seeing Liang Qu, they lowered their heads again in unison, but the bruises around their eyes and the swollen cheeks could not be hidden.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that the two of them liked to tease each other, Liang Qu thought they had gone overboard: "What's going on, you two got into a fight? You hit each other so hard?"</p><p></p><p>The two of them exchanged a silent glance.</p><p></p><p>It was Chen Jiechangs who broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>His swollen cheek made his voice sound muffled: "After you left, Lu Tingcai brought a group of people to ask us for money, saying we had a bad smell that affected their practice, and they wanted two taels of silver from each of us as compensation. We got angry and fought with them."</p><p></p><p>Two taels?! Liang Qu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was not just asking for money, it was asking for his life!</p><p></p><p>"What about that Lu guy? And your senior brother Xiang, didn't they help you?" Liang Qu had no respect for Lu Shao at all, and was filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>"That Lu guy didn't even give us a proper look." Li Liboa gritted his teeth. "He just turned and left! And we don't know where Senior Brother Xiang is, he's been gone since noon, and there are only us disciples left in the martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu couldn't believe it, how could it be so coincidental today?</p><p></p><p>"Originally I knocked one of them out first, and with Chen Ge, the two of us against three of them, we weren't doing too badly. But then three more people came to help them, and we ended up losing the fight."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chen Jiechangs snorted coldly. He was not satisfied, as he could have seriously injured Xue Dingyi if he had the chance, but in the end he only managed to leave a few bloody marks on his neck.</p><p></p><p>"Now they want us to come up with ten taels of silver, or else they'll come 'spar' with us every day, tsk."</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangs laughed self-deprecatingly. He didn't regret it, he just regretted that the three reinforcements came too quickly, preventing him from strangling Xue Dingyi to death.</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was nothing they could do. He sighed: "We discussed it, and since the fight was our doing, we'll make up the extra four taels ourselves."</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa nodded. They both felt a bit guilty, feeling that it was their own fault for getting into the fight, causing one person to become three.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The situation of the Liang Qu family was already not good, so naturally they had to make up for the extra shortfall.</p><p></p><p>The corner of the flower bed was silent.</p><p></p><p>Without the sound of people, the crickets in the flower bed felt safe again and started to chirp intermittently, the sound not clear but sounding very aged.</p><p></p><p>It was now early winter, less than half a month to mid-winter, and the crickets could no longer chirp - they were about to die, perhaps frozen to death on a night when the temperature dropped sharply.</p><p></p><p>On the training ground, the people who were practicing and exchanging often cast their gaze down to that neglected corner of the flower bed.</p><p></p><p>There was mockery, indifference, and some found it interesting.</p><p></p><p>The young master Zhao Sanzi in his brocade clothes looked at the flower bed, then turned his gaze to another corner.</p><p></p><p>The people there, such as Lu Tingcai, were also silent.</p><p></p><p>If things turned out this way, could they get any benefits?</p><p></p><p>Impossible, Zhao Xueyuan knew clearly in his heart, they would be punished, and more severely punished.</p><p></p><p>In the past, this group of people could collect protection fees, relying on the fact that the bullied people dared not speak up.</p><p></p><p>And they had always acted outside the martial arts school, and only today when the martial arts teachers were not there, the situation was different.</p><p></p><p>The lower-class people were used to being self-abased, born afraid of high-status people, and were deceived by Lu Tingcai's rhetoric, so they did not dare to seek help from the martial arts teachers.</p><p></p><p>Most people who suffered losses would not even think of reporting to the officials, right?</p><p></p><p>Relying on the routine of cheating and beating, they had been unstoppable, but unexpectedly they now encountered two hard nuts, who came at them with a brick right away.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known whether the last apprentice of their fellow villager has a strong or weak backbone.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Xueyuan was very curious.</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai and the others now only had regret and fear, but when their brother was beaten up, their blood boiled, and they didn't care about so much at the time.</p><p></p><p>Now they were reckless, like desperate gamblers at the end of their rope, more dangerous than ever.</p><p></p><p>The difference is that the deceived people are still buried in the drum.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was enjoying the show.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stood up, and the oil lamp cast his long shadow on the board wall, flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechanglooked up, and two oil paper packages appeared in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Take it."</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>"Take it!"</p><p></p><p>The crickets in the flower bed fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboand Chen Jiechangreached out and took the packages, feeling the warmth and fragrant steam inside, guessing that there was food.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned and walked towards the center of the training ground.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze was on him.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around.</p><p></p><p>He had never been here before, nor had he ever enjoyed the attention of the masses.</p><p></p><p>Tired, truly tired.</p><p></p><p>He had worked overtime until midnight in the past, tired like a dog, but not as tired as he was now.</p><p></p><p>The shameless scoundrels could live, the bullies who occupied the water sources could live, and the small clerks who kicked the baskets could also live.</p><p></p><p>But the ones who just wanted to live well couldn't! The whole society was like a dense net, trapping all those who wanted to climb up.</p><p></p><p>Every one who tried to break through was squeezed into an ugly, blurred face in the narrow hole.</p><p></p><p>Those spiders, venomous insects, and centipedes hung on the nodes of the big net, waiting for the bloody prey to struggle to exhaustion and fight for the blood food.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked towards the corner.</p><p></p><p>They were all there, Lu Tingcai, Xue Dingyi, Yu Weilong, Xiang Quju... these... venomous insects! Liang Qu's gaze suddenly changed, becoming very calm, and he stretched out his hand, pointing to the seven people.</p><p></p><p>"I want to fight with you!"</p><p></p><p>The training ground was as silent as death.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk"</p><p></p><p>Someone laughed.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's face was expressionless, staring fixedly.</p><p></p><p>"Cough..."</p><p></p><p>The atmosphere was silent again.</p><p></p><p>Under the oppressive gaze, Lu Tingcai and the others had to stand up, and the crowd slowly parted to make way.</p><p></p><p>Even if they regretted it, facing such arrogant provocation, it would be too cowardly to just sit there.</p><p></p><p>"Just you?" Lu Tingcai, with a white bandage on his head, looked ridiculous, but with the six people behind him, no one would find it funny. "You don't know your own strength."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you idiot!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Tingcai was stunned, and everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>They were like chickens with their necks squeezed, their veins bulging, but they couldn't spit out any more powerful curses to fight back.</p><p></p><p>How despicable.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt a tightness in his chest, that kind of pent-up anger with no outlet, just like a volcano was smothered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He took deep breaths, his chest rising and falling, suppressing the volcanic anger, and the wind fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"One person is enough for me! One person, to defeat all of you!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Six liang and five qian!" </p><p></p><p>"Is it really six liang and five qian?"</p><p></p><p>"Strange, that's not getting rich, they are all precious fish, why is A-shui's so expensive? Is it that good?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, everyone was shocked by Hu Wushi's quoted price.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo next to him counted on his fingers and was startled.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangs's red-finned perch weighed two jin and seven liang and six qian, earning him only three liang of silver, totaling one jin, one liang and one qian.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu's horned bream was three jin, two liang and one qian, yet it was worth six liang and five qian! Totaling one jin and two liang, almost double the red-finned perch! Wait, why did I say the red-finned perch "only" earned three liang.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Liang Qu was also overwhelmed with joy.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that a single precious fish would greatly reduce the time he needed to join the martial arts school, but he never imagined it would directly fill up the progress bar! Adding the two liang and eight qian of silver he had saved up these days, Liang Qu's total assets had already exceeded nine liang and three qian!</p><p></p><p>Not only did he meet the minimum requirement of seven liang to join the martial arts school, he even had money left over for the autumn taxes.</p><p></p><p>As for any unwillingness to sell, there was none at all.</p><p></p><p>The fact that the martial arts teacher could offer a clearly different price showed that he was not taking advantage of the ignorance of the rural fishermen and arbitrarily pricing, otherwise he could have just offered a price similar to the red-finned perch.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a few liang of silver is not much to a martial arts teacher. Like that Chen Jiechan, earning a hundred wen a day, three liang a month, it's just that his living expenses are high, making him appear not so wealthy.</p><p></p><p>Even if the price was pressed, there's nothing to be done about it. It's not like he wouldn't be pressed in Pingyang Town either. The fishermen are not stupid, and the martial arts teachers are not stupid either. Selling directly can save them over ten miles of travel.</p><p></p><p>"Sell, of course I'll sell, I just have one question I want to ask Mr. Hu."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu calmed himself down and made a small request.</p><p></p><p>Hu Wushi responded concisely, "Ask."</p><p></p><p>"Why is the price of the horned bream, also a precious fish, double that of the red-finned perch?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding fishermen all perked up their ears, also very curious.</p><p></p><p>The world of martial arts teachers is ultimately mysterious and admirable. Being able to secretly know some things that others don't know is undoubtedly a source of quiet pleasure.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Liang Qu's question, Hu Wushi was not impatient, and explained, "The horns of the horned bream can be used as medicine, made into dense pills, with the effect of refining qi and helping to break through the blood barrier. I am currently at this barrier, so it is of great use to me."</p><p></p><p>I see!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought about the small horns he had saved before, relieved that he hadn't thrown them away.</p><p></p><p>Hu Wushi turned out to be quite sincere.</p><p></p><p>The rest went very smoothly, Liang Qu presented the fresh horned bream, Hu Wushi threw over a bag of silver, and left without even asking for the cloth bag.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he shouted, "In the future, whoever can catch the same kind of precious fish with abnormal features, come tell me, I won't let you get the short end of the stick."</p><p></p><p>The fishermen at the dock cheered in unison.</p><p></p><p>Skin, flesh, bones, blood - four barriers. Based on the information previously revealed, Hu Wushi had already reached the level of the fourth barrier. Once he crossed it, the title of "martial arts teacher" would no longer be an honorific, but a solid capability. A few precious fish are indeed crucial.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After Hu Wushi left, the fishermen on the dock no longer cared about their volume, and immediately congratulated Liang Qu on his good luck. Some even wanted to come forward and touch him, trying to absorb some of the mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>In the past half month, Liang Qu had caught a yellow fish and a spotted-head fish, and now he had even caught a precious fish - he was truly a walking lucky charm.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the crowd's adulation, Liang Qu firmly grasped the bag of silver, but did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>Fishing is more uncertain than farming, so fishermen often believe in some supernatural things more than farmers.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The existence of secret powers means that there are many large and small sacrificial activities in Yixing City. However, due to the development of productive forces, they are all led by wealthy families and use livestock.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in this world, there are the existence of martial artists who are extraordinary. Whether there are those unspeakable things, Liang Qu is also uncertain.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were two people at the Shangraobu who caught the precious fish, but almost all of them were snatched away by Liang Qu alone.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangstood outside the crowd, feeling the heavy money bag, resentful but helpless, and could only leave alone.</p><p></p><p>After the excitement was over and the fishermen dispersed, Li Liboexclaimed, "Goodness, six liang, my family has never saved so much money before!"</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, the one who is about to go to the martial arts school is not you." Liang Qu put the money bag away, returned to the boat, secretly collected the two fish horns the size of a finger bone, and grabbed Li Libo's fishing net to return it to him, "Your fishing net has been a great help to me."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, don't I deserve a meal?"</p><p></p><p>"I already had that in mind."</p><p></p><p>Having made a windfall, and about to enter the martial arts school, Liang Qu seemed spirited and naturally wanted to treat others.</p><p></p><p>The two went directly to the foot shop and ordered a chicken, a plate of mutton, and a plate of pork, as well as a pot of hot wine, spending over a hundred coins, and had a satisfying meal with Li Libo.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu did not usually drink, and was not used to drinking, but Li Libo could drink. Fishermen often go out to sea, so they don't have the habit of not drinking. Given the joyous occasion today, he ordered a pot for him, as a way of thanking him for lending the fishing net.</p><p></p><p>After the meal and wine, Li Libo's face flushed red, looking around left and right, and whispered, "When are you planning to go to the martial arts school?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned his head and said, "How do you know I'm going to the martial arts school?"</p><p></p><p>The original body was reclusive, and there was no one he was particularly close to on the wharf. But Liang Qu was different. He was generous, and since he had treated Li Libo to two meals, their relationship had become much closer than at the beginning.</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense, you asked me so carefully last time, even a fool could see your thoughts. But it's normal, who hasn't dreamed of practicing martial arts and becoming a martial arts master? That's a cut above the rest, not like us muddy-legged fellows, reeking of fish."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo's tone was not without envy. Becoming a martial arts master, registered and recorded, would have a government subsidy, escape the despised status, and no longer have to go out fishing every day, nor would he have the lingering fishy smell that could never be washed off with soap.</p><p></p><p>The Great Shun Dynasty had only been established for sixty years, and in recent years it had been peaceful with good weather. It was said that one would not starve, but the daily struggle for food was indeed tiring. No one wants to live such a life forever.</p><p></p><p>All the young men under the age of twenty in Yixing City have dreamed of having extraordinary roots, being recognized by a superior, and becoming a renowned master.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the vast majority of people cannot get past that seven-liang silver threshold. Even if they can afford it, the poor in culture and the rich in martial arts ultimately do not have much prospect.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo originally thought Liang Qu was just another young man with dreams, but today's precious fish made him look at him with new eyes.</p><p></p><p>Six liang and five qian, almost enough for the threshold.</p><p></p><p>This guy, could it be that he's going to enter the martial arts school with me?</p><p></p><p>But it's too coincidental, he just asked about it not long ago, and now he's made a windfall that can get him into the martial arts school. And there's that incident with Laozhang's fight, come to think of it, it's been almost half a month since he's seen him, which is quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo felt something was off, but he couldn't quite put his finger on it. He just felt that there was no one like Liang Qu in the whole of Yixing City.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, my father left some savings, which is enough." Liang Qu saw no need to deny it.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo had a look of "I knew it", and put his arm around Liang Qu's neck and laughed heartily, "That's great, I was worried I would be bullied when I go to the martial arts school. In that case, let's be sworn brothers!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

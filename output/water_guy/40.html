        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Resembling an old farmer, Yu Dun took out a large fur cloak, the entire cloak was black in color, with a layer of glossy fur.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth junior brother, this is a bear fur cloak, it cannot be cut by a knife, nor can it be damaged by water, and it also keeps you warm very well. As winter is approaching, I hope you will like it."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, second elder brother!" Liang Qu bowed respectfully and joyfully accepted the cloak.</p><p></p><p>The cloak felt extremely soft and comfortable, it was hard to imagine that it could actually protect against cold weapons.</p><p></p><p>The weather was getting colder and colder, the two sets of hemp clothes he had bought earlier were indeed not enough, this cloak was just what he needed to urgently solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>Third elder brother Lu Gang stepped forward: "Ninth junior brother, take a look at mine."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang was the most burly among all the brothers, his upper limbs were extremely thick and powerful. Even in the winter, he was still only wearing a short shirt, and in his hand, he was holding a black metal block as thick as his forearm.</p><p></p><p>"Third elder brother, what is this?" Liang Qu was puzzled, was he being given a piece of steel?</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong laughed and said, "Lu Gang is a blacksmith by birth, his grandfather was a blacksmith in the army, he followed the founding emperor to conquer the world, and the weapons he forged were excellent. This tungsten-gold alloy is most suitable for making weapons. He intends to forge a weapon for you, and wants to know what kind of weapon you prefer."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang nodded, "Swords, spears, halberds, I can forge them all. I don't know what ninth junior brother likes to use."</p><p></p><p>Weapons?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's mind became active, he had long wanted a weapon, but iron weapons were not cheap, and until now he had been using a sharpened stone knife to fillet fish.</p><p></p><p>His main battlefield was underwater, and the weapons that required chopping, slashing, and swinging were not very suitable. The most appropriate would be a thrusting weapon.</p><p></p><p>The most commonly used by fishermen was the trident, and to increase the chance of a successful strike, it was often a three-pronged spear.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu did not need three prongs, as he was dealing with crab monsters, what he needed was a weapon that could break them with a single strike, and the long spear was the most suitable.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Liang Qu respectfully said, "I like the long spear, I wonder if Elder Brother Lu Gang can forge a long spear for me?"</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong was surprised, "A long spear? The long spear is easy to learn but difficult to master, of course, I can also teach you."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple is determined."</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong no longer persuaded him, as becoming proficient in any weapon was very difficult, he had just mentioned it in passing. Moreover, the long spear was indeed easy to get the hang of.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll draw you a few long spear blueprints later, you can take a look at the styles and decide, and then I'll start forging. The spear shaft materials are ready, no need to dry them, with lacquer, it'll only take about two months."</p><p></p><p>"About two months?" Liang Qu was startled and worried, "Won't that be too much trouble for the elder brother?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it'll be ready in just over ten days, the main thing is the lacquer takes time to dry, lacquer is faster than regular glue, which takes at least three months."</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm really troubling the elder brother."</p><p></p><p>"I won't let the junior brother down."</p><p></p><p>Next was fourth elder brother Xu Zishuai, the tall young man who had joked last night that his reputation as the most handsome might be in jeopardy. He had a dignified appearance, fair and clean, with an upright and graceful bearing.</p><p></p><p>Elder Brother Xu gave him a pair of tungsten steel bracers that could cover the entire forearm, they were hard in quality but very light, with adjustable leather straps.</p><p></p><p>Fifth elder sister Zhuo Shaoqin was tall and heroic in bearing, she gave him a pair of cloud-stepping boots made of ghost-eye tiger skin, light and breathable.</p><p></p><p>Sixth elder brother Cao Rang had a square face and an awe-inspiring presence, he gave a piece of clear jade pendant that could invigorate the spirit, relieve fatigue, and have a miraculous effect on sleep, four hours of sleep would be enough for three and a half hours.</p><p></p><p>Seventh elder brother Hu Qi was tall and burly, he gave a waist belt that was one and a half palms wide, made of mountain ox leather, with dark red patterned lines, it was fireproof, cut-proof, and had excellent defensive properties.</p><p></p><p>Eighth elder brother Xiang Changsong gave him a set of high-quality narrow-sleeved robes, with gold thread embroidery, woven with mulberry silk, soft yet durable, not easily damaged, and quite beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thanked them one by one, deeply moved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After traversing for so long, he experienced the relaxing feeling of having support for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Having so many senior brothers was great, as they had a total of seven extraordinary items. A belt, arm guards, a robe, a cloak, a weapon, an ornament, and shoes - they had put together a complete set for him!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt like he had gone to the Dragon Palace of the East Sea and received the golden crown, golden armor, and cloud-stepping shoes like Sun Wukong.</p><p></p><p>Fourth Senior Brother Xu Zishuai's following words confirmed his guess.</p><p></p><p>"I personally dislike giving gifts, it's a headache. Later, I discussed it with my senior brothers, and we decided to just outfit you with a full set of gear. Each of us will give you one item, so there won't be any overlap.</p><p></p><p>How about it, Little Nine, do you want to try it on? You're no less handsome than I am, it will definitely look great on you."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it will certainly look good." Xiang Changsung, who had gifted the robe, was eager to see how his gift looked. "Considering you're still growing, I didn't tailor the size, but it should fit fine."</p><p></p><p>Xu Shi also chimed in, "Go try it on."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, all the senior brothers wanted to see how Liang Qu looked in their gifts.</p><p></p><p>"This..." Liang Qu looked towards Master Yang Dongxiong.</p><p></p><p>Yang Dongxiong stroked his beard and laughed heartily, "Since your senior brothers and sisters want to see it, Nandi, take my Ninth Disciple to the guest room to change clothes."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Nandi stepped forward, extending her slender, fair right hand towards a side corridor, "Young Master Nine, follow me."</p><p></p><p>Young Master Nine? Liang Qu was dazed, following Nandi to the guest room in a haze.</p><p></p><p>Nandi had the servants bring in a large bronze mirror, polished smooth as water, far surpassing the silver and aluminum mirrors of later times.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the vigorous and spirited reflection in the mirror, Liang Qu's thoughts were in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>When he first arrived, he had been pale and emaciated, his cheeks sunken, his life like a flickering candle in the wind. But now?</p><p></p><p>Two months, sixty days.</p><p></p><p>Full of vigor, radiant in appearance, even being called "Young Master Nine"! Young Master Nine! He couldn't believe this was referring to him! "Haha."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly laughed out loud in front of the bronze mirror, only noticing Nandi standing to the side when his gaze swept over her. He coughed awkwardly, trying to suppress his smile, but the muscles in his face soon couldn't be restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Oh no, he was going to be seen as a fool.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took deep breaths, using the breathing to suppress his laughter, schooling his facial muscles back into a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, I was overcome with mirth."</p><p></p><p>Nandi gave a slight bow, revealing two shallow dimples on her face. "Young Master Nine being able to become Master Yang's disciple is certainly cause for joy. Among all the cities, towns, and villages, so many wish to become his disciples but don't have the chance. It proves that Young Master Nine is a rare talent, far surpassing ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Hmph, typical of a young lady from a wealthy household, beautiful in appearance and eloquent in speech, so pretentious.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu clenched his fist, covering his face and coughing. "Alright, you can leave first, I'll change once you're gone."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Once the room was empty, Liang Qu took off his outer garment, preparing to get dressed.</p><p></p><p>The clean clothes he was wearing were the ones Hu Qi had given him last night, which were more presentable. If he had come in his brown hemp clothes, not only would it be improper, he wouldn't even have a decent inner garment to wear under the fine attire, which would look awkward.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Liang Qu was putting on proper robes, and he studied them for a while before finding the right way to wear them.</p><p></p><p>In poor families, there wasn't much fuss, just throwing on loose hemp clothes. But these gold-trimmed robes, white cloud boots, wide leather belt, jade pendant at the waist, ebony plaque, tungsten arm guards, and black bear-fur cloak - Liang Qu put them on one by one.</p><p></p><p>In the mirror, a brand-new Liang Qu majestically made his debut!

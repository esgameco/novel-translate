        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The harvest from this boat trip was so bountiful, not only did they catch precious fish, but the fusion degree of the Zeeling also broke through 10, reaching 11.7.</p><p></p><p>The Jianghuai Zeye region truly is a blessed land, it needs to be explored more and more.</p><p></p><p>The waters near the Shangrao wharf have only been explored less than half, they need to find an opportunity to further explore the map. Apart from the precious fish, the precious plants are also excellent.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu also discovered that as he grew stronger, his spirit also improved. Perhaps in not too long, he would be able to command another water beast.</p><p></p><p>The weather was getting colder, and the role he could play was diminishing, so he needed to find a water beast to replace it. Then, whether it was catching fish or exploring the deeper waters, it would be helpful.</p><p></p><p>By noon, Afen had caught around thirty fish, and Liang Qu rowed the boat back to the wharf, pretending he had been fishing all night.</p><p></p><p>He still sold them to the fishing shed, and the one receiving him was still the second son of the fishing shed's owner, Lin Songbao.</p><p></p><p>Lin Songbao helped carry the fish and asked, "Ashui, why haven't you been selling fish the past few days? Did you also go to the town?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu smiled, "I did go to the town, but not to sell fish. I went to learn martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Learn martial arts?" Lin Songbao was surprised, looking Liang Qu up and down with a tone full of regret, "Ai, did you use the money you made from selling the precious fish to learn martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, so what?" Liang Qu replied.</p><p></p><p>"You, you're so foolish!" Lin Songbao lamented, "Ashui, you're still too young, you don't know how deep the waters of practicing martial arts are.</p><p></p><p>Yes, the threshold to start practicing martial arts is only six or seven taels, but without tens of taels of silver to buy medicinal materials, you can't really learn anything.</p><p></p><p>In that Pingyang town, the three martial arts schools there, every year there are so many farmers and fishermen who have saved money for over ten years, but after they enter, what happens?</p><p></p><p>In three months, they come slinking back, in the end still just being farmers and fishermen for life. Some even have their qi and blood damaged, and end up crippling or even killing themselves through the practice! You keep that seven taels of silver, and with your skill at fishing, you can definitely find a good wife. Ai, it's really..."</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Lin Songbao truly felt regretful, thinking that spending money to learn martial arts was just a waste of effort.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu just smiled and scratched his head, not saying much more. He just counted the copper coins after the transaction, confirmed everything was correct, then headed home.</p><p></p><p>The past two days, he didn't plan on going to the martial arts school again. After eating a precious fish, his changes were quite significant, if someone noticed it wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Fist and Crane Fist were not yet fully learned, but the Ape Fist was complete, and the effects were the same when practicing at home.</p><p></p><p>"That kid still hasn't come back?"</p><p></p><p>Three young men were squatting at the door, some chewing on grass stems, others leaning on the wall, looking very impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe we should go in and look around again, I feel like he must have hidden the money at home, who would carry around that much silver all the time?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't we already search everywhere? Damn it, there's nothing, just a few catties of coarse rice, and the quilt is even tattered. He made so much money from selling the precious fish, why didn't he use it?"</p><p></p><p>"You guys don't think he used the money to go learn martial arts, right? Around six taels would be about right."</p><p></p><p>"That muddy-footed brat wanting to rise up through martial arts practice? Hah!"</p><p></p><p>"Some people are just stupid, can't see through things. Who knows, maybe..."</p><p></p><p>The one called Second Brother squinted his eyes, seeing the figure in the distance, not daring to confirm, but feeling the aura was a bit different from the one he had seen before, though the outline was very similar.</p><p></p><p>"It should be him, let's hide first, don't scare that little bastard away before he comes."</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Liang Qu frowned slightly. Ever since refining the Zeeling, his hearing and vision had become sharp, and he had already seen the three young men at his doorstep. He saw them hiding away as soon as they noticed him, afraid that the person they were waiting for wouldn't dare to come.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu recognized those three, they were the famous Wang family three brothers of Yixing City. They weren't fishermen, but farmers, with over ten mu of fields on the back mountain, following the same path as Lanzhi Zhang, just not as wild as him, daring to do harm to people.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To the death.</p><p></p><p>Since they were three brothers, the family had a thriving male lineage, and they didn't hesitate to bully others. Whenever it was time to irrigate the fields, the three brothers would stand guard at the river mouth with their hoes, ensuring their family's fields were watered first. Anyone who dared to try and cut in would be beaten bloody.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't farm the land, but he had heard about their reputation. </p><p></p><p>With the three brothers having such a notorious reputation, it was clear why they were blocking the entrance to his home - they had heard that Liang Qu had recently sold some precious fish and had a good amount of silver, so they had their greedy eyes on it.</p><p></p><p>However, Liang Qu didn't try to avoid them. Times had changed. In the past, when dealing with a bald-headed Zhang, he had to be extremely careful and calculate everything. But now, with his water monkey fusion level over 10, although he wasn't underwater, his strength had increased greatly. Plus, he had practiced martial arts and was nourished by the precious fish and lotus roots, so he was in peak physical condition.</p><p></p><p>Even if he hadn't learned the three fist techniques, he still had the ability to fight back. In the alley, the Wang brothers were quietly waiting, but after a while, they didn't hear the sound of the door opening, so they started murmuring to each other.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why aren't they here yet?"</p><p>"Is that bastard so slow because his leg is lame?"</p><p>"I'm looking for the right tool for the job."</p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>The voice came from above, startling them. The eldest Wang brother looked up and saw a blue brick flying towards him.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu jumped down from the rooftop, brick in hand, and struck the eldest Wang brother in the face. The impact was powerful, causing his nose to bleed and teeth to shatter, and the brick broke in two.</p><p></p><p>"And you too!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu swung his arms left and right, slapping the dazed second Wang brother in the forehead with a brick, splitting his head open.</p><p></p><p>The third Wang brother watched, dumbfounded, as his two older brothers fell to the ground. Timidly, he asked, "Liang Qu, why did you hit my older brothers?"</p><p></p><p>"You deserving scum! I'll hit whoever I want to hit!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu held half-bricks in each hand and charged at the third Wang brother.</p><p></p><p>The fight was all about dominating presence!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's imposing aura overwhelmed the third Wang brother, who didn't dare resist and crawled and rolled his way out of the alley.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu threw a half-brick, hitting the third Wang brother in the abdomen. His shoulders went limp, and he almost hit his head on the ground, but he endured the pain in his waist and continued to crawl away.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't bother chasing him, turning back to the two brothers lying on the ground, punching and kicking them.</p><p></p><p>"You have no one to teach you anything, you're worse than pigs and dogs!"</p><p></p><p>The eldest Wang brother tried to fight back, but Liang Qu forcefully pushed him back down with one hand, slamming his head against the wall, almost making him vomit blood.</p><p></p><p>He kicked the second Wang brother, who was trying to escape, back to the ground. Grabbing the eldest Wang brother's head with one hand, Liang Qu used the other to repeatedly strike him in the crotch.</p><p></p><p>The two could only wail in agony, their bodies covered in blood, their pants soaked, making Liang Qu feel disgusted, with no place left to kick them.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>The Wang brothers moaned, and upon hearing this, they felt as if they had been granted amnesty. Leaning on each other, they crawled out of the alley, leaving in a pitiful state.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's expression was cold. If it weren't for the difficulty of disposing of the bodies and the risk of attracting the authorities, he would have killed them.</p><p></p><p>Those dog-like creatures, living is just a waste of food.</p><p></p><p>At this time, many people had gathered outside the alley, attracted by the sound of the fight. But since the Wang brothers had a notorious reputation, the onlookers not only weren't afraid, but even cheered.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Shui, you're only sixteen, right? How did you get so skilled?"</p><p>"Not just sixteen, I think he's only fifteen, and he'll be sixteen after the new year. Truly remarkable."</p><p>"Yeah, I saw those two brothers' pants were wet, haha!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu calmed his breathing and said in a composed manner, "Let everyone know, the reason I'm so formidable is that I've learned martial arts. The teacher at the martial arts school, Hu Wushi, said I have an extraordinary foundation and am a rare martial arts prodigy! Dealing with a few ruffians is nothing for me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the onlookers had mixed reactions.</p><p></p><p>Learned martial arts?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

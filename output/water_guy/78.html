        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai reined in his horse, looking around left and right. The spirited horse under him was panting heavily, and even the horse he was leading was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>The two of them, one man and two horses, had been riding all night and finally reached the vicinity of their destination.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go down and take a look."</p><p></p><p>The southern winter was not too cold, and the dense forest was filled with large broadleaf trees, with the sunlight dappling through.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dense forest, Xiang Changlong was about to dismount, but was stopped by Xu Zishuai.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'll go. You go to the nearby village and see if you can hire some carriages, the rest is up to me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changlong turned his horse's head and went to search for the town according to the map.</p><p></p><p>Although Shi Xiong was usually carefree, when it came to important matters, he was still reliable, and his talents were among the best of the group of brothers. Dealing with a few mountain bandits would be a piece of cake for him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai tied his horse to a nearby tree and entered the forest alone.</p><p></p><p>The terrain of the mountain forest was complex, and even with his sharp senses, it took him nearly an hour to find the place.</p><p></p><p>A two-meter-high mountain fortress gate stood tall in the forest. Xu Zishuai did not act rashly, he suppressed his aura and sneaked in for a look around.</p><p></p><p>The mountain bandits were all oily-faced, their arms covered in tattoos - they were not the oppressed, but a group of ruffians gathered in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>He also saw a room where several disheveled women were being held, the youngest around 10 years old, their necks chained with iron, in front of them were bowls filled with black, foul-smelling oil.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the authorities had a bounty on their heads.</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai confirmed that the wanted poster was accurate, and returned to the mountain gate, standing in front of a tree as thick as a human leg. With a flash of his long sword, the entire tree slowly toppled down, the dry branches crashing and breaking with a huge noise.</p><p></p><p>The mountain bandits were startled and rushed out of their rooms, climbing up to the gate to investigate.</p><p></p><p>A sharpened tree trunk suddenly flew out from the forest, accompanied by a terrifying gust of wind, and slammed heavily into the gate, instantly shattering it and sending the two bandits behind it flying.</p><p></p><p>A huge roar echoed, startling the birds and beasts in the forest.</p><p></p><p>Dust and smoke rose.</p><p></p><p>The bandits fell to the ground, their pants soaked, completely petrified with fear.</p><p></p><p>"What a waste of two dogs' lives, how unfortunate."</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai brushed the dust off his hands, stepping into the fortress. He looked at the fallen bandit with a broken tooth, picking up a broken tree branch and lightly slapping his face.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, where's your boss?"</p><p></p><p>The toothless bandit, his mind blank with fear, instinctively pointed to the bloody pulp under the broken gate.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, he's dead? How troublesome." Xu Zishuai scratched his cheek, then leapt up onto the remaining wooden frame, taking out a rope and shouting, "Don't be afraid, everyone, listen to me. I'm here to do three things: one is to catch people, two is to catch people, and three is to catch people again. Come up one by one and put your necks in this rope."</p><p></p><p>In the corner of the shadows, a bald bandit moved his fingers, seeing that no one seemed to notice him, he slowly retreated a few meters, then stood up and fled.</p><p></p><p>The bald bandit lowered his head, a blood-stained tree branch piercing the ground in front of him. He reached out and touched it, not knowing when a thumb-sized hole had opened in his chest.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>The bandit fell to the ground, blood slowly seeping out.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I told you to listen, why didn't you listen? Come on, put your necks in the rope!"</p><p></p><p>By the time Xiang Changlong returned with the carriage team, more than 20 bandits had been tied up like dogs to the trees.</p><p></p><p>"There are still a few women in the fortress, go help deal with them."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Bringing a few trembling carriage drivers, Xiang Changlong arrived at the fortress. The gate was in shambles, the heavy wooden door crushed under a bloody pulp, and blood was spilled everywhere. Xiang Changlong was unfazed by the sight.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Shixiong was an orphan.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a bit luckier, and a bit unluckier, than Liang Shidi. He had once been adopted by a pair of foster parents, but later, when a group of mountain bandits passed through the village, they were all gone in order to protect the only egg-laying hen.</p><p></p><p>Xu Shixiong hated the mountain bandits intensely.</p><p></p><p>Within a hundred-li radius of Pingyang Town, there was not a single bandit stronghold.</p><p></p><p>Night.</p><p></p><p>Today's special training had finally ended, and Liang Qu was so tired that he wanted to lie down on the training ground.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he closed his eyes, he thought of the Fubo Spear lying under his bed, and his spirit was roused.</p><p></p><p>After absorbing the medicinal bath and completing a set of pole exercises, Liang Qu, whose blood and qi had been restored, took out the long spear, admiring it for a while, and then shouldered it to practice in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone on him, and his bare chest rose and fell with his breathing.</p><p></p><p>He used all his strength, and his muscles knotted up like a crouching panther.</p><p></p><p>As the blood and qi circulated, the powerful and distinct muscles of his arms forcefully lifted the heavy spear, and every line was extremely smooth.</p><p></p><p>Just from his physique, he could completely rival the top-level swimmers of the past.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, standing in front of the bronze mirror in his room, Liang Qu could hardly believe that the perfect lines belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>In just over three months, his height had soared, from being a short person just over 1.6 meters who couldn't even finish a meal, to 1.75 meters, and the trend was still rapidly rising.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Lu Gang had measured his bones again before forging the Fubo Spear, calculating his bone age to determine the length of the spear.</p><p></p><p>The final conclusion was that according to the current trend, Liang Qu's height would stabilize between 1.85 to 1.87 meters - perfect.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath and indulged in unleashing his power under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The ebony-colored spear gleam became increasingly sharp, as if reflecting the shattered fragments of the stars.</p><p></p><p>After punching a hard object, the fist would have microscopic cracks, and the body would then begin to repair itself. The more times this repair occurred, the denser the bone density would become, and the harder the fist strike would be.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual weapons were the same - every collision and swing would make them adjust themselves to better suit the needs and combat habits of their wielder.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual weapons could no longer be called mere weapons - they were living beings!</p><p></p><p>As long as they did not suffer catastrophic damage, spiritual weapons could recover.</p><p></p><p>"Huff, huff, huff."</p><p></p><p>The nearly 100-pound great spear swept through the bushes like a hurricane, kicking up layer after layer of fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>After practicing for a quarter of an hour, Liang Qu's muscles ached and swelled, and he had to stop, wiping down the spear shaft before rinsing off the sweat with cold water and falling into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>The third day, special training resumed.</p><p></p><p>But today, they would only train half a day, and in the afternoon, Hu Qi would let Liang Qu adjust his condition and take a nap.</p><p></p><p>According to the departure time of Xu Zishuai and the others, they should be able to return by this evening.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the four of them would go up the mountain together and head to Fahua Temple to see what was going on with that mountain ghost.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Hu Qi dismissed class early, taking a pair of arm guards, shouldering a nearly 1.5-meter-long dark red great bow, and hanging a quiver of arrows at his waist.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang also came to the martial arts hall, still dressed in ordinary clothes, but leading an exceptionally large and sleek black hunting dog.</p><p></p><p>"This is a mountain hound, my master's treasure. It is very sensitive to the aura of spiritual creatures. If the blood sacrifice doesn't work, we'll let it try."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, dressed in his robes and shouldering the long spear, was lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready, and he and the two senior brothers came to the fork in the road at the foot of Fahua Temple.</p><p></p><p>Around nightfall, the sound of wheels rolling over the yellow mud road grew louder in the distance.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai was an unconventional person, who liked to show off and flirt with women, but he did have a lot of clever ideas. </p><p></p><p>Every year when it was his master's and mistress's birthday, he could always come up with some new tricks to entertain everyone and make them happy.</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, I received a bounty notice from the government office, saying that there is a bandit stronghold 120 li east of Pingyang Town, with over 20 people. Since Liang Shidi is about to break through, I didn't rush to go, thinking I'll wait until he breaks through and then take him to see some action."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked up in surprise, not expecting his own matter to be mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong's face turned bitter: "Xu Shixiong loves doing this the most, taking the new disciples to see bloodshed. When he took me to eliminate a mountain bandit den 300 li away, I was dizzy and nauseous for half a day after returning, almost vomiting."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, he leaned in close to Liang Qu's ear and said in a whisper in front of everyone: "I heard that even Fifth Shijie was taken by Xu Shixiong, and she cried loudly after returning, and Xu Shixiong was punished by the master to be confined for a month."</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, what are you all talking about? I'm just doing it for your own good," Xu Zishuai coughed, making a fist. "A martial artist who has never seen blood, how can he be considered a true martial artist? Didn't the master often say that a martial artist's essence is to take life by force?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop talking nonsense, continue."</p><p></p><p>"My idea is, since the mountain demon was attracted by the bloody smell of the sacrificial animals during the River God Festival, can we not do the same thing. </p><p></p><p>Take those mountain bandits over, after all they are outlaws who rape and plunder, the government has issued a bounty for their heads. We can do a blood sacrifice on the spot, maybe that can lure the mountain spirit out. The blood energy is much more potent than animal blood, most attractive to mountain spirits and ghosts.</p><p></p><p>As long as the mountain spirit appears, we'll have a clue to follow, see where it goes and what it does. </p><p></p><p>If it's been trained, we can naturally follow it to its lair. If not, there must be someone watching nearby, and if there's no one watching and it's not trained, then we're just overthinking and imagining too much, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>"Where should the blood sacrifice be held?"</p><p></p><p>"Fahua Temple! My intuition tells me that dilapidated temple is not ordinary, the big mountain demon also disappeared there, so let's assume the target is it!"</p><p></p><p>The people present fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi was the first to ask, "The bandits are 100 li away, won't that be too far? For the blood sacrifice to be effective, at least a dozen or so people are needed, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, but we still have some time. Judging from when the master left, if the Water Bathing Sect really wants to make a move, it'll take at least a few days for the trouble on the master's side to fully unfold and for him to be completely preoccupied. We should have about three to four days of buffer time, which should be enough."</p><p></p><p>Xu Zishuai's words sounded a bit unscrupulous, as if he didn't care about Yang Shi's safety at all.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, as the great martial arts master Yangdonghong's disciples, they could only watch helplessly if he ran into trouble, and the best they could do was not to make things worse.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had confidence in their master.</p><p></p><p>Although the tiger is old, its might remains! Seeing the others still in deep thought, Xu Zishuai said, "Anyway, you guys don't have any other good ideas, right? We're martial artists, not imperial secret agents, we're not good at unraveling cases step by step.</p><p></p><p>In short, I suggest a simple and brutal approach, otherwise if they really succeed, who knows how many hundreds of people will die, can we even continue living our lives?"</p><p></p><p>The death of hundreds of people would be a huge blow to the prestige of the local tyrants.</p><p></p><p>The biggest "tyrant", the Yang family martial arts school, would be hit the hardest.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there would be a large number of civilians fleeing the area, and Pingyang Town, which had developed for so many years, would be ruined, its foundations completely shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's do it as you said." Lu Gang made the decision. "As for Yixing City, it's already late, tomorrow I'll go find two acquainted martial artists and have them stay there for a while, so it won't look too suspicious, and it'll also be an explanation to those local elders."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Shixiong." </p><p></p><p>Lu Gang's actions could be considered providing both substance and appearance for the help-seeking Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lu, please take a look! But I'll need to find someone to go with me, there are so many mountain bandits, and I'm afraid I won't be able to handle them all by myself."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang's spirit weapon will be forged in the next couple of days, and I need to stay here to oversee it. He also needs to stay to infuse it with his blood to imbue it with his essence. Since he is a bit weaker than you, he can't fully guard the martial arts hall alone, so you can go with him."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Changsong quickly agreed, "I have no problem with that."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm counting on you, Brother Xu and Brother Xiang. If the rumors about the Shuimo Sect are true, and we can nip this in the bud, no matter whether the county magistrate is involved or not, we will surely receive a generous reward from the imperial court, and may even reach the ears of the Emperor."</p><p></p><p>Reach the ears of the Emperor!</p><p></p><p>The people present were stirred, for this was a real possibility! The last time the Shuimo Sect appeared, the Founding Emperor was enraged, and blood flowed like a river.</p><p></p><p>While the current scale may not be as large as last time, under the halo of the Founding Emperor's wrath, the nature of the threat is still extremely grave, worthy of the imperial court's attention, and the reward will surely be generous.</p><p></p><p>Although saving Pingyang Town and the surrounding villages was primarily driven by the moral sense of the brothers, not wanting to see their hometown turn into a living hell, with familiar friends and relatives facing mortal danger, having a reward on top of that would be the best outcome.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sat among the group, his emotions complex.</p><p></p><p>When he joked in Yixing City that dealing with mountain goblins was like running a livestock farm, he didn't expect his words to come true - it really was a livestock farm! Just the feed was a bit subpar.</p><p></p><p>Breeding a martial arts master from a hundred people, fishing in a drying pond - this tactic of cutting off the logistics during wartime, forcing the soldiers to fight with their backs to the wall, or even killing the soldiers and their horses, is the kind of reckless, consequence-disregarding, revenge-driven behavior one would only find in an organization like the Shuimo Sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are a group of old-timers and young radicals who feel their privileges have been taken away, so it's not surprising they would commit such heinous acts that incur the wrath of heaven and man.</p><p></p><p>After the discussion, Xiang Changsong and Xu Zishuai wasted no time, going to the Yang family to borrow horses, and riding through the night to reach the mountain bandit stronghold.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-mile journey was not close, and they would need to hire carriages to bring back twenty people. They had to hurry, trying to complete the round trip within two days.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gan stood up, "The forging of the spirit weapon is progressing faster than I expected. Liang, come to my place tomorrow noon, I need to use the fresh blood of the weapon's master to imbue it with its essence."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded, knowing this was a necessary step in the spirit weapon's creation - infusing it with the master's blood to shape its "nature".</p><p></p><p>This was not the traditional "claiming ownership", there was no such concept. </p><p></p><p>Since the spirit weapon has a spirit, it naturally has a nature. The explosive ones are used by the explosive, the gentle ones by the gentle. When the nature matches the wielder, it becomes an extension of their own body.</p><p></p><p>Even if the natures don't match, it doesn't affect the weapon's quality, it just won't be as smooth to use certain martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>By adding the master's blood during forging, their natures will be aligned, and as long as the master doesn't undergo a major personality change, this harmonious effect will be permanent.</p><p></p><p>After the senior brothers all left, Hu Qi asked Liang Qu to stay, and returned with a short baton and a small booklet.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang, this Bow Strength Technique is a method of circulating one's qi and blood into explosive power, very compatible with your innate constitution. Combined with your Ape Fist, the power will increase by a third. Take a look and memorize it, then start practicing."</p><p></p><p>With everyone else occupied, Hu Qi would personally train his junior brother. If they did end up clashing with the Shuimo Sect, Liang Qu would inevitably be involved, so he needed to quickly boost his combat abilities to ensure his own safety.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

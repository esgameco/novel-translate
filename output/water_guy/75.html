        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu soaked in the bathtub.</p><p></p><p>Awei climbed up to the edge of the bathtub along his shoulders, with its many feet hanging down. The two-finger-wide tub wall fit its body width perfectly, the two adhering to each other like a card slot installed.</p><p></p><p>What was in the bathtub was not a medicinal ointment, but a medicinal bath to be used in conjunction with the Ape Fist technique.</p><p></p><p>Today's battle with the Mountain Demon had healed up quite well after taking the Replenishing Flesh Pill, and his sparring with Brother Hu, although leaving some bruises, was not serious enough to require special treatment.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal power seeped into his pores, bit by bit strengthening his physique.</p><p></p><p>When the brown medicinal liquid turned light yellow, Liang Qu got up, dried himself off, and put on a pair of pants to practice the Ape Fist.</p><p></p><p>The depleted blood qi was replenished again, its length and width swelling noticeably - the effect was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>After the exercise, Liang Qu rinsed off the sweat with water, returned to his room, and fell into a deep sleep, lying on the bed.</p><p></p><p>Too many things had happened in a single day, he was truly exhausted.</p><p></p><p>The next morning.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had Chen Jie-chang run an errand, helping him request a leave of absence from the academy, then went to the training field to spar with Hu Qi.</p><p></p><p>The apprentices sat around watching, cheering when they saw Liang Qu make a brilliant counterattack, and booing when he was knocked down again.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had been accepted as Yang's personal disciple, and many apprentices were initially dissatisfied, feeling that they should have been the ones, not this mud-footed boy from Yi Xing City.</p><p></p><p>But now, after half a month, even if they were still not fully satisfied, they could only accept the reality and gradually get used to it, the atmosphere between the two sides becoming more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Many clever ones wanted to invite Liang Qu to a meal, to build a good relationship, but unfortunately, after becoming a disciple, Liang Qu appeared at the academy less often, so they never found the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Among the apprentices, there were also a few who shouted "Admirable!"</p><p></p><p>They had joined later and, after hearing Liang Qu's story, were amazed, completely worshiping him as an "idol".</p><p></p><p>They "looked forward to" one day also encountering unfair treatment, then making a great slaughter and gaining the favor of a superior.</p><p></p><p>This was quite normal - those who came to learn martial arts were mostly supported by their parents, young teenagers of fourteen or fifteen, their youthful passions burning, completely unaware of the resentment and bitterness hidden beneath their aspirations.</p><p></p><p>"Huff, hah."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was once again pushed back by Hu Qi, his whole body flushed red, panting heavily, his inner qi and blood depleted again.</p><p></p><p>This morning was the second round. Compared to last night's immediate collapse, he could now manage two or three moves before his strength was exhausted - a tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi was also surprised, for cultivation talent did not necessarily mean fighting talent, and there were many who had the potential but failed to show it in actual combat, their training in cultivation surging ahead, but their legs shaking when it came to real battles.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's combat talent was not bad, his progress extremely fast, his fighting style bold and courageous, quickly absorbing experience like a cotton cloth, showing new performances each time - he was someone who thought during the fight.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liang Qu stand up, ready to continue, Hu Qi tapped his short staff on the ground and shook his head: "Let's stop here for now. It's already the first quarter of noon, let's have a meal first. After eating, you should go to Brother Lu's place, and when you come back, we'll practice again, and you can recover your qi and blood in the meantime."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu turned his head to look at the dripping copper kettle, and indeed, the water level had risen to the noon mark.</p><p></p><p>The apprentices scattered in twos and threes.</p><p></p><p>After a tiring half-day, Liang Qu's appetite was wide open, closely following behind his senior Brother Hu, chopsticks in hand, single-handedly finishing four bowls of rice and a large amount of beef, his whole body feeling warm and comfortable.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, he bid farewell to Hu Qi and hurried to Brother Lu's place.</p><p></p><p>After waiting half a month, the spiritual weapon was finally about to manifest for the first time, and Liang Qu's heart was surging with excitement, difficult to contain.</p><p></p><p>The blacksmith's shop was still quiet, Luo Gan not standing in front of the big red furnace, but turning around and drawing something on a red wood table.</p><p></p><p>Approaching, Liang Qu saw it was a piece of grayish-brown thin leather.</p><p></p><p>Brother Lu was using a brush dipped in ink to draw mysterious patterns all over it, and Liang Qu stood quietly beside him, controlling his breathing, not disturbing him.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the final stroke, the entire piece of leather burst into a silvery haze, and...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The traces of the pattern disappeared without a trace. Lü Gang wiped the sweat from his forehead and explained, "This is the Bat Shadow Skin, existing between illusion and reality. It can infiltrate the shadows and absorb blood. You'll see the shape of your long spear take form with it."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't understand why the shaping required a piece of leather, but he simply nodded without saying anything. This experience would be a precious treasure, so it was better to observe more and speak less.</p><p></p><p>When Lü Gang picked up the animal skin, he only then realized that the texture of this skin was very strange, half-hidden and half-visible, as if it were illusory. How wondrous.</p><p></p><p>In the large red furnace, the scarlet-feathered phoenix had already been ignited, and a continuous stream of golden energy was surging into the soft red metal at the top, with faint red threads also seeping out.</p><p></p><p>This should be what Lü Shixiong mentioned, the balanced tungsten and gold, which can only absorb life energy and exclude fire energy.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the golden energy had weakened considerably, and the entire forging process was already in the second stage.</p><p></p><p>The first stage was the softening of the tungsten gold, followed by thousands of hammer blows to refine and increase the toughness.</p><p></p><p>The second stage was to activate the energy of the scarlet-feathered phoenix, allowing it to be absorbed by the tungsten gold.</p><p></p><p>Just as the golden flames were about to flicker and dissipate, Lü Gang handed Liang Qu a dagger and a bowl.</p><p></p><p>"Blood! Half a bowl!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Liang Qu took the dagger and cut his palm, letting the fresh blood flow out. It hurt so much! Liang Qu grimaced as he cut himself, especially when he was mentally prepared, it was the most painful.</p><p></p><p>The bowl quickly filled with half a bowl of fresh blood. Lü Gang inserted his hand into a nearby water tank, took the bowl of blood, put something in it, and then sprinkled a handful of silver powder into the furnace.</p><p></p><p>With a loud boom, the temperature inside the furnace rose sharply, forcing Liang Qu to take a step back.</p><p></p><p>However, Lü Gang reached into the red furnace and poured the fresh blood onto the softened metal.</p><p></p><p>The contact between the blood and the scorching hot metal caused a violent blood mist to erupt.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a huge red bird-like phantom emerged from the tungsten gold, as if it wanted to fight the fresh blood, but its remaining spirituality was like a tree without roots, unable to last long, and it dissipated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The fresh blood seeped into the almost liquefied metal, not evaporating or drying into fragments, but quietly seeping in, like pouring half a bowl of blood onto cotton.</p><p></p><p>A faint sense of resonance rose in Liang Qu's heart. Was this the shaping? He truly felt a sense of another body extending.</p><p></p><p>After Lü Gang withdrew his hand, he casually flung out the shadow beast skin, and the entire animal skin automatically wrapped around the metal like a blood-sucking bat, the skin shining with a silver luster, the thin skin constantly contracting, gathering, and elongating.</p><p></p><p>It was actually alive, transforming the metal into the shape of a spearhead! A twelve-inch spearhead, like half a sword, was pulled out effortlessly, followed by the part wrapping the spear shaft, and the iron core extending from the middle.</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang reached for a long box placed on the table, opened it, and took out a white wooden rod from the three rods soaked in an unknown oil liquid. He inserted the white rod into the furnace, and the unknown oil liquid instantly ignited, burning along the head to the entire wooden rod. Lü Gang, seemingly unaffected by the pain, inserted the burning wooden rod into the iron core.</p><p></p><p>After installing the entire long wooden rod, Lü Gang attached the butt to the end.</p><p></p><p>The shadow beast skin that had only wrapped around the spearhead now crawled and covered the spear shaft as well, extinguishing the oil fire as it went, and then remained motionless after the wrapping was complete.</p><p></p><p>About half an hour later, the motionless shadow beast skin began to move again. It retreated from the part covering the spearhead, only wrapping the spear shaft, and the remaining part completely hardened into a glossy gray membrane.</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang let out a long sigh of relief, grabbed the long spear from the furnace, and handed it to Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>"It's done."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu: "???</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, sat up straight, and untied the cloth around his waist.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's mouth twitched.</p><p></p><p>The coarse burlap was soaked in fresh blood, and in the cold wind, it quickly hardened and adhered firmly to the scabbed wound.</p><p></p><p>Tearing it off would be like forcibly peeling off the scab.</p><p></p><p>But there was no choice, as the burlap not only had dried blood but also sand and dirt that had seeped in during the battle.</p><p></p><p>The reason he didn't eat the lotus root earlier was that he had to dress the wound first. If there were pebbles in the wound, eating the lotus root would cause them to grow into the wound.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he didn't have time to clean the wound carefully and pick out the stones.</p><p></p><p>Peeling off the blood-soaked burlap, Liang Qu casually threw it into the water.</p><p></p><p>After washing the wound again, he finally chewed on two pieces of lotus root, watching as the wound slowly healed.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, I'm still poor," Liang Qu sighed.</p><p></p><p>If he could afford brocade and silk, he could use them as bandages. The coarse burlap is really too rough and tends to grow into the flesh.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, it was just a muscle and skin injury, not too serious, and the lotus root worked its effect quickly.</p><p></p><p>After about a moment, the red muscle tissue was no longer visible, the dermis had fully grown back, and the bleeding had stopped, leaving only a thick scab and a slight pain and intense itchiness.</p><p></p><p>The strong tingling itch made Liang Qu want to peel off the scab, but he knew it was a sign of rapid cell division and healing, so he resisted the urge, only scratching the skin around the wound to relieve the itch.</p><p></p><p>Still, the itchiness was much better than the pain, as there was no painful stimulation to the brain, and Liang Qu felt completely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>It was like the intense abdominal pain had suddenly disappeared - even though he had just returned to normal, the contrast made him feel inexplicably refreshed, as if he were floating on clouds.</p><p></p><p>With the wound mostly healed, Liang Qu couldn't wait to get back into the water.</p><p></p><p>If there was one thing he was most looking forward to from this battle, it was the harvest, just as he had initially thought.</p><p></p><p>A spirit creature - how much essence could it provide? In his previous life, he had never even seen a crab, let alone eaten one, and now he was about to feast on a giant crab bigger than a person, which was incredibly tantalizing.</p><p></p><p>Back underwater, the two beasts were guarding the crab creature's corpse, one lying on the nearby rocks, the other crouching in the mud.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liang Qu, the two beasts rose and shook off the dust, equally excited.</p><p></p><p>According to past experience, the heavenly gods would bestow the discarded scraps upon him, and this giant crab must have plenty of such scraps.</p><p></p><p>But the two beasts guessed wrong.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was preparing to share the delicious crab meat with them, not out of sudden generosity.</p><p></p><p>It was simply that this crab creature was too large! </p><p></p><p>Before it spoiled, he wouldn't be able to finish all the meat by himself.</p><p></p><p>The three of them - one human, two beasts - began to dismantle the giant crab.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu pulled out the broken spear that had pierced the crab's body, removed the flint at the tip, and cut through the joint membranes connecting the massive claws.</p><p></p><p>Below, the beasts, unable to bite and grip the crab's legs, spun in death throes, dismembering the limbs one by one.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish, meanwhile, retrieved the two crab legs that had been torn off earlier, but its bite force was not strong enough to detach any more.</p><p></p><p>After removing the entire massive claw, Liang Qu cut open the joint membranes on the carapace and reached into the crab's upper body, straining to pry open the large shell.</p><p></p><p>It was incredibly difficult, harder than moving heavy loads at a construction site.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's face flushed red, bubbles escaping from his mouth as he exerted all his strength to slowly pry it open, bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack.</p><p></p><p>The internal flesh and tendons tore away from the carapace, the resistance decreasing until finally, with a mighty heave, Liang Qu managed to completely remove the shell.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a massive crab roe the size of a human arm and head came into view, and Liang Qu's eyes widened at the sight.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two beasts drooled, unable to move and having even forgotten what they were supposed to do, until Liang Qu regained his senses and prepared to collect the crab roe, at which point he remembered to report the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you found something that you can't move, right?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu received the information through the neural link and stopped his hand movements.</p><p></p><p>The Pig Dragon was in a semi-upright position, pointing its short claws at the abdomen of the crab monster's lower body.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu followed the direction of the immobilized short claws and discovered that under the navel cover of the crab monster's front half, there were actually many fist-sized, semi-transparent round balls, over a dozen of them.</p><p></p><p>These were crab eggs?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was surprised and quickly lifted the navel cover, taking out one of the round balls to examine it closely.</p><p></p><p>The crab eggs were very large, the size of an adult's fist, semi-transparent orange-yellow, somewhat like the dragon balls in Dragon Ball, and because they were large enough, he could directly see the already fully-formed small crab monsters inside.</p><p></p><p>Crabs are different from fish - fish have external fertilization, laying eggs first and then being fertilized, while crabs have internal fertilization and then lay eggs. As long as they are carrying the eggs, they are all fertilized eggs that will develop into adults.</p><p></p><p>The small crab monsters were almost identical to the large crab monsters, with the upper body upright and the lower body with six feet, like fearless war chariots, only the shell was milky white.</p><p></p><p>Normal crab species carry thousands or even millions of eggs, but here there were only thirteen, and Liang Qu guessed it was because the crab monster had become a superior being.</p><p></p><p>After becoming stronger, the crab monster naturally transformed from an r-strategy organism, that is, an opportunist who relies on quantity to succeed, to a K-strategy organism, who is stable and steady and cherishes every life.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the millions of crab monsters would have long since occupied the Jianghuai wetlands, and how would humans survive? Speaking of which, can I control the crab eggs?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had a bold idea.</p><p></p><p>Directly controlling the crab monster is impossible, the psychic shock would probably kill him, but the unhatched young should be no problem, right? Liang Qu's psychic link value is about two to three times that of the immobilized, the fatty catfish is a bit stronger than the immobilized, and after controlling two, there would only be 0.2 to 0.3 of the immobilized's remaining space.</p><p></p><p>Although the space is not large, controlling a fertilized egg should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"No hurry, let's leave them for now, and I'll deal with it after I've eaten the crab monster's meat."</p><p></p><p>He had left the martial arts hall in a hurry that morning and come to the wetlands, not even having had lunch, so Liang Qu was already famished.</p><p></p><p>He took out the crab roe and a crab leg and returned to the boat, setting up a stove to boil water. After the water boiled, he put the crab roe and crab meat in.</p><p></p><p>After they were cooked through, he scooped out the crab roe and crab meat and made two meat balls of equal weight.</p><p></p><p>Aquatic organisms decompose very quickly after death, especially crustaceans, because they have a lot of internal bacteria and liquid water, and once the body's balance is disrupted, they will completely spoil within a few hours.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's stomach capacity was limited, so he had to select the high-value parts and consume them quickly.</p><p></p><p>He ate the two meat balls one by one, the golden crab roe was rich and fragrant, and the snow-white crab meat was fresh and sweet.</p><p></p><p>【Wetland Essence +0.9】</p><p>【Wetland Essence +0.5】</p><p></p><p>The first part of the prompt was for eating the crab roe, and the second part was for eating the crab meat.</p><p></p><p>The crab roe was indeed more valuable, but the absorption value was also too high, almost on par with half a precious fish!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's eyes reddened as he verified the results, immediately adding more crab roe and throwing the remaining crab meat to the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>【Wetland Essence +1】</p><p>【Wetland Essence +1.1】</p><p>【Wetland Essence +1.2】</p><p></p><p>Fusion degree! Fusion degree! Increase my fusion degree all of it!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu ate with determination, watching the Wetland Cauldron constantly glowing, a sense of unprecedented satisfaction welling up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was going to be invincible.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The broken stone piles were inserted into the mud, and the water grasses that were rooted in the crevices were forced to leave their original growing place, drifting away with the gentle waves.</p><p></p><p>The entire seabed had become chaotic under the fierce battle of Liang Qu and the others, as if an underwater earthquake had erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu surfaced from the water, taking deep breaths. He tilted his head back, his tongue dry as if it would crack, his chest heaving violently.</p><p></p><p>Strings of water droplets dripped from the ends of Liang Qu's wet strands of hair, merging with the cold sweat and dripping down his chin, splashing up water.</p><p></p><p>The tidal waves lifted Liang Qu up and down, with dazzling ripples everywhere.</p><p></p><p>He kept taking deep breaths, his bellows-like lungs inhaling a large amount of oxygen, his heart striving to pump oxygen throughout his body. The flushed face quickly faded in color, and his numb brain regained its vitality.</p><p></p><p>The crab monster's attacks were relentless, and the oxygen consumption in just a few minutes of battle was almost equivalent to that of a normal ten-minute period.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at his waist, the wound was almost a handspan wide, starting from a few inches beside his navel and extending all the way to the back of his waist. </p><p></p><p>The entire upper layer of skin had been torn off, with pale yellow tissue fluid secreting at the edges, and the fresh red muscle tissue exposed in the center, with blood constantly oozing out, making him break out in cold sweat and feel a lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Splash.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish surfaced, dragging Liang Qu's clothes left on the boat. Liang Qu gritted his teeth as he took the clothes, tearing them into strips to bandage his waist. The wound was no longer being washed by the water flow, and the excruciating pain finally eased.</p><p></p><p>His rapidly beating heart finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The waves crashed against Liang Qu's chest, and he took out the broken half of the long spear, the wooden end with several long wooden spikes protruding.</p><p></p><p>If only he had an iron fork, he wouldn't have been injured.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu extended his palm and snapped off the protruding wooden spikes, tidying up the broken end, then gripped the short spear again, took a deep breath, and dove back in.</p><p></p><p>The crab monster was severely injured, but not yet dead. He couldn't let it have a chance to recover.</p><p></p><p>Round two, begin! Underwater, the scattered dust that had been dispersed up to four or five meters high had now settled to around two meters, but the crab monster's figure was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>However, with the search of the fat catfish and the pig dragon, the trace was soon discovered. When Liang Qu saw the crab monster, his eyes turned red! At this moment, the crab monster was lying on the lotus root field, its claws grasping large pieces of lotus roots, frantically chewing, almost one bite per section.</p><p></p><p>With the massive replenishment of lotus roots, its healing ability was activated, and the broken foot stumps had almost grown new flesh buds, and even new tentacles were growing out of the eye sockets.</p><p></p><p>The crab's tissue regeneration ability was extremely strong, and Liang Qu dared not let it continue eating, or else all his previous efforts would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those were his lotus roots!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu charged towards it again, and the moment he landed on the ground, the newly grown tentacles of the crab monster twitched and turned in Liang Qu's direction.</p><p></p><p>But its vision had not yet recovered, and it could not see Liang Qu's movements, only able to judge the direction of the approaching target from the vibrations of its limbs.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary crabs, if their eyeballs and eye stalks were completely damaged, they could only grow a new tentacle in the eye socket, but Liang Qu was not sure if this crab monster was the same.</p><p></p><p>He had to resolve it before its eyes grew back! </p><p></p><p>Even before the crab was attacked and changed its pursuit target, Liang Qu had already discovered that this creature was not very intelligent - a fatal weakness.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his thoughts, Liang Qu struck the rock with his short spear, and the moment the vibration appeared, the crab monster flew into a rage, its four legs trembling and swinging, charging towards him.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was on high alert.</p><p></p><p>The crab swung its severed limbs, charging towards him like a tank, the water flow it stirred up rushing towards him, as if he was standing at the mouth of an erupting volcano. Liang Qu leaped up, controlling...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The water flow caused disturbance on the other side.</p><p></p><p>The crab claw unhesitatingly pinched towards the water flow, the sharp giant claw cut off the water flow, but it only grasped empty air.</p><p></p><p>The crab monster shook off the giant claw, its front wide open, exposing its white abdomen. Now is the time!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu fell back to the ground, tightly gripping the short spear that was now only half its original length. His gaze fell on the spear tip, aiming at the white navel.</p><p></p><p>His wrist, elbow, waist and legs, every muscle that could be utilized was tensed, contracted, and then rapidly extended.</p><p></p><p>He stepped on the ground, stirring up dust, the long-term piling exercises had made his lower body as stable as a rock, his whole body surging forward, piercing.</p><p></p><p>The spear tip that had a small crack left Liang Qu's sight, he gritted his teeth, the fresh blood on his waist seeped through the cloth bandage and dispersed in the water, forming thin blood-red threads, which were then scattered by his advance.</p><p></p><p>In the instant Liang Qu landed again, the crab monster reacted, turning its giant claw, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The over one-meter-long short spear, slanted upwards, was thrust completely into the crab monster's navel, penetrating its most vulnerable and vital area without any resistance.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a female crab."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the round carapace of the crab's abdomen, Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>Arthropods of the crustacean class have three nerve centers, and the most vulnerable part is the navel, where its gonads and nerve centers are located, and it is also the softest part apart from the joint membranes. </p><p></p><p>When cooking crabs, as long as you press on the crab's navel with a chopstick and stab it into the body, the crab will instantly die without any pain.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The raised giant claw, supported by the water flow, slowly fell, passing over Liang Qu's head and landing on the sides.</p><p></p><p>The huge object crashed into the mud, kicking up a large cloud of dust, rising high from the ground like a stone wall.</p><p></p><p>The nearby pig dragon and fat catfish stared wide-eyed, awestruck.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't understand how such a huge monster could be killed by Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>It was just beaten and scurried away in fear earlier.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts' respect and awe for him increased even more, truly a divine being who had awakened their intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt a wave of weakness in his body. He slowly got up and swam out from the dust cloud before it enveloped him, and then climbed back into the boat, lying down and panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>After delivering the final blow, he only felt dizzy and disoriented, as if his whole body was tightly wrapped in numbness, a kind of fatigue that made him feel hollowed out.</p><p></p><p>The wound on his waist was bleeding profusely.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was drowsy, but dared not fall asleep, fearing that if he did, he would bleed out and never wake up again.</p><p></p><p>He lay there for a while, and the dizziness in his head gradually subsided, and a bit of strength returned to his weary body.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu used his palms to grip the gunwale, his trembling arms supporting him as he moved up, gently leaning against the partition, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>The wind rose, the endless tides kept crashing against the boat, shimmering with light, and the soaring eagles swooped down to snatch the small fish jumping out of the water.</p><p></p><p>The cold wind carried away the damp mist, and his wet hair swayed with the rhythm of the wind.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Haha haha!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly burst into laughter, the laughter echoing over the waves of the marsh river. At this moment, he suddenly felt so extraordinary! He actually managed to kill such a huge monster! That was a monster! The creature that so many fishermen fled from in fear, was killed by him, Liang Qu!</p><p></p><p>What's a Lai Tou Zhang, what's the Wang family trio, they suddenly became as insignificant as children playing house.</p><p></p><p>His ambition suddenly expanded, as if there were no more difficulties on the road ahead.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

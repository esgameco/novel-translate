        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fishermen of Yixing City, who hasn't been beaten by him in the autumn wind, which widow hasn't been teased by him, has long become a universally despised scourge.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't dare to say it to his face, Li Liboa also expressed his disdain for him privately.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's expression changed, and he asked, "When was he beaten?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe this morning? Anyway, when I saw him, he had a big black eye and was limping as he walked, he was beaten pretty badly."</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to hit him?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Li Liboa shook his head, then whispered, "Actually, he's not that formidable either. He was just kicked out of the martial arts school after causing trouble there for only two days. What good could he have learned? He probably can't even set up a frame, it's just that no one has exposed this paper tiger yet."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu gave him a sidelong glance: "If that's the case, why don't you expose him?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if he's a paper tiger, he's still a big guy." Li Liboa chuckled, "But he secretly went out on a boat today, I think he's worried someone will seek revenge, and if I hadn't happened to be taking a shit in the reed bed, who knows if anyone would have found out about this. You're the second person to know."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu understood.</p><p></p><p>"Are you done asking? I've told you so much, where's my meat?"</p><p></p><p>"Here you go."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so generous, really generous! My family has been saving money, it's been so long since I've had meat, hehe."</p><p></p><p>"Wait."  Liang Qu held the plate.</p><p></p><p>"What again?"</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, go ahead and eat."</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa was puzzled but didn't care, and started eating the meat hungrily.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu shook his head, he had originally wanted to lock up the information, but on second thought, it was completely unnecessary, he was taking himself too seriously.</p><p></p><p>On the Jianghuai Lake.</p><p></p><p>A small boat was quietly moored on the surface of the lake, and Zhang Tieniu was lying inside, his warts and scars particularly prominent.</p><p></p><p>The usually fierce-looking bald Zhang now looked like a plucked chicken, his expression gloomy, the bruises around his eyes making him look comical.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I was fine yesterday, how could this have happened suddenly? Ouch, that bastard Zheng Xiang, he hit too hard, my kidneys..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu clutched his abdomen, his face full of distress.</p><p></p><p>He had done too many evil deeds, so he didn't dare stay at home to recover, for fear of being retaliated against, so he could only row his own small boat and hide on the lake.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu sighed, "This is the only safe place."</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu's heart suddenly stopped, he had just wanted to get up when a mass of clear water splashed in his face, the water seemed to have a life of its own, desperately rushing into his lungs, and Zhang Tieniu involuntarily took a deep breath, feeling his lungs fill with water, unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, he saw a figure climbing onto the boat from the edge, with disheveled hair, and then quickly stood up, viciously kicking him in the groin, an indescribable pain assailing him.</p><p></p><p>Facing the swollen, liver-colored bald Zhang, Liang Qu did not dare to stop, the veins on his hand gripping the stone were bulging, and he put all his strength into hitting that wart-covered head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Zhang Tieniu's eyes rolled back and he passed out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing him motionless, Liang Qu dropped the stone, the stone hitting the boat board and rolling into the corner with a gurgling sound.</p><p></p><p>Was it really that simple? With just a slight touch, the bald Zhang, who had been terrorizing the area and even gone to the martial arts school, had fallen? Liang Qu panted heavily, staring at his own hands, and at the water mass that was gradually dissipating from Zhang's face.</p><p></p><p>Before coming, he had made a lot of plans, but he didn't expect the implementation to be so easy. He had even spent a lot of time finding someone, and he had even prepared to be injured, breaking off a lotus root and putting it in his pocket, also heating up some hot water to warm it up, quietly lying in wait in the water.</p><p></p><p>But none of it was needed!</p><p></p><p>Water control ability, against ordinary people, is simply a special attack!</p><p></p><p>As long as you take the other party by surprise and cover their mouth and nose with water, even if they have extraordinary abilities, it's useless.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the corpse-like bald Zhang, Liang Qu took a hemp rope from his waist and tied up the man's hands and feet, searching him and finding that he even had two liang of silver, which was truly an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu tidied up the sampan, putting away all the sharp objects, and then found a rope to reinforce it again. Finally, he rowed the sampan to a reed marsh that was rarely visited by people.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while in the reed marsh and taking a few bites of lotus root to regain his strength, Liang Qu splashed water on Zhang Tieniu's bald head again.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm..."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu slowly woke up, his vision swaying with a few reed leaves, and in the distance, the sunset had set the sky ablaze.</p><p></p><p>He coughed a few times, spitting out a lot of water, which seemed to have aggravated his wound. Intense pain radiated from his lower body, completely overshadowing the pain from his previous injuries. His mind was in a daze for a while before Zhang Tieniu finally realized what had happened, turning his bloodshot eyes towards Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!"</p><p></p><p>Glared at, Liang Qu gave a kick to Zhang Tieniu's lower abdomen, almost making him stop breathing.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating abdominal pain finally made Zhang Tieniu realize his predicament. This was clearly the reed marsh, a place rarely visited by people, where no one would know if Liang Qu killed him. He hurriedly changed his expression: "Water Brother, I was wrong, you hitting me is justified."</p><p></p><p>"I actually prefer your just now defiant look."</p><p></p><p>"Water Brother, you're just joking, right?" Zhang Tieniu forced a smile, his heart filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that his attacker would be Liang Qu! A useless person who couldn't even get enough to eat, what could have happened to change him so much? Just yesterday, he still looked listless and lifeless. Could it be some kind of witchcraft with the living water? Sitting at the bow of the boat, Liang Qu kicked Zhang Tieniu's bald head with the tip of his shoe: "Tell me, where is my black-cloth boat? Where did it go?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tieniu stammered until Liang Qu raised his foot, ready to kick again, before he finally revealed, "I sold it."</p><p></p><p>"Sold it?" Liang Qu hurriedly asked, "To whom?"</p><p></p><p>"The fishing shed."</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Liang Qu wished he could just drown Zhang Tieniu in the water. As long as it was sold to any fisherman, it would have been fine, but it had to be the fishing shed, which, to put it bluntly, was an organization of people like Zhang Tieniu!</p><p></p><p>The fishing shed was a place that specialized in renting out fishing boats and fishing gear, but the rental prices were exceptionally high. Many who rented boats ended up working for the fishing shed for the rest of their lives, exploited by them. But if they didn't rent, they had no livelihood and would starve to death in a few days.</p><p></p><p>Even in Yixing City, it was considered relatively good, but in other places, the fishing sheds were practically fishing overlords - you had to rent from them, whether you wanted to or not! Seeing Liang Qu fuming with rage, Zhang Tieniu hurriedly begged, "The boat wasn't easy to sell, and I was in a hurry to drink, so I had to sell it to the fishing shed at a discounted price."</p><p></p><p>"How much did you sell it for?"</p><p></p><p>"Four, four taels."</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you sold the black-cloth boat for the price of a sampan!?" Liang Qu kicked him a few more times.</p><p></p><p>A sweet, pungent taste rose up Zhang Tieniu's airway, and he wanted to say something, but Liang Qu didn't give him a chance to speak. After the beating, Zhang Tieniu panted and finally spoke.</p><p></p><p>"There, there are two taels left in my, my pants pocket."</p><p></p><p>Damn, so the two taels of silver were originally mine! Liang Qu thought about the silver he had previously found on Zhang Tieniu, his anger boiling over. So the wool was pulled over his own eyes.</p><p></p><p>"And what about the Zhao family matter?"</p><p></p><p>"That, that was also what I told them."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's guess was correct - it was indeed Zhang Tieniu who had revealed the information! Apparently, after stealing the boat, Zhang Tieniu also noticed that Liang Qu wasn't bad-looking, and having heard that Old Master Zhao liked men, he thought it would be a good business opportunity, so he directly informed the steward Zheng Xiang.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, the incident of Zheng Xiang coming to visit happened. After seeing Liang Qu in person, Zheng Xiang felt that Zhang Tieniu's description was indeed accurate, but Liang Qu said he needed to think it over.</p><p></p><p>The deal didn't go through, and Zhang Tieniu didn't get the reward, but Zheng Xiang didn't want to have made the trip for nothing, so he hinted that Zhang Tieniu should "help" Liang Qu make a decision sooner.</p><p></p><p>In order to get the reward, Zhang Tieniu directly went to Liang Qu's place and stole the few dou of rice he had left, and then reported it again at the right time.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Zheng Xiang felt he had been deceived, and that very night, he went to find Zhang Tieniu and beat him up.</p><p></p><p>Although Zheng Xiang was just an ordinary person and not physically strong, he was from the Zhao family, so Zhang Tieniu didn't dare fight back. Afterwards, he could only row the sampan to hide and recover from his injuries, giving Liang Qu the opportunity to catch him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi finished feeling the bones and exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"In all my years of learning bone-setting, this is the first time I've seen such a standard wasp waist, ape arms, and mantis legs. How old is your junior brother, Liang?"</p><p></p><p>"He's almost 16."</p><p></p><p>"Then he'll grow a lot taller. He'll be at least 6 feet tall when he's fully grown."</p><p></p><p>One Chinese foot is about 30 centimeters, so 6 Chinese feet would be over 1.8 meters.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liang Qu let out a sigh of relief. His physique hadn't been the best when he was younger, and he had been worried he wouldn't grow tall enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo standing nearby had a pained expression on his face: "Damn, I'm grinding my teeth. You've got such good natural talent and physique, and all the good things keep happening to you. I'm not treating you to a meal today, we're not done!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu casually replied, "Next time for sure."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi continued, "You'd also be very suited for learning the Ape Fist style, and archery as well. Liang shidi, you should learn those in the future if you have the chance."</p><p></p><p>This statement caused both of them to pause.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute, Senior Brother Hu, why am I suited for the Ape Fist just because I'm slightly above average, but he has good natural talent and is also suited for it?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi explained, "There are many types of good natural talent, not just the wasp waist, ape arms, and mantis legs kind. That specific physique is most suited for the Ape Fist - the power is drawn like drawing a bow, and released like firing an arrow - the force is quick, far-reaching, and powerful. The Tiger form is also good, but the Crane form is a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>"As for you, Junior Brother Li, you're a bit lacking in other areas, but your arm span is long, so you have the power of the Tiger form and the lightness of the Crane form, just not the advantages of the Ape form. So you're also suited for the Ape Fist."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu suddenly understood. He was suited for the Ape Fist because of his natural talent, while Li Libo was suited for it because the other two forms didn't suit him as well.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, perhaps his affinity for the Ape Fist was also related to merging with the Water Monkey spiritual energy. After that merger, Liang Qu could feel changes in his own physique, so maybe that had altered his natural talent.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo felt a bit discouraged - the reality of martial arts was not quite what he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hu Qi comforted him: "Junior Brother Li, don't be discouraged. Having slightly less natural talent doesn't mean anything. It doesn't limit our futures - those with lesser talent don't necessarily progress slower than those with great talent. And Liang shidi, don't be overly proud of your good natural talent either, as it also doesn't determine our futures."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the advice, Senior Brother Hu."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi nodded, and pulled two books from his robe: "These are Master Yang's Three Fist Methods - the Ape, Tiger, and Crane. You can all learn them, but it's best to focus on what I suggested earlier."</p><p></p><p>"Can you read? If not, it's fine, there are illustrations to follow. Just practice in order, and I'll correct you as we go."</p><p></p><p>How thoughtful, Liang Qu thought as he flipped through the books. The people at the Yang Family Martial Hall were all talented, and so kind. He really loved it here.</p><p></p><p>The books were divided into six sections - the cultivation and application methods for the Ape, Tiger, and Crane. Liang Qu focused on the cultivation methods first, to build a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation relied mainly on post standing. Each of the three fist methods had 32 post standing exercises, some the same, some similar, some quite different.</p><p></p><p>Seven taels of silver to learn all three fist methods - a great deal.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, knowing to heed advice, focused on the Ape Fist, following the post standing exercises in the book.</p><p></p><p>He spread his feet, chest up and back straight, shoulders down and elbows down, then relaxed his abdomen and hips, controlling his breath in the dantian.</p><p></p><p>"Your feet are wrong, you need to have the center of the soles hollow. You're too stiff."</p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, you're right."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Li, don't tense up, relax. Your movements are too rigid."</p><p></p><p>"Upper empty, lower solid. Make the stance solid while keeping the body relaxed. Hold the position as still as possible, so your body can remember it."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi guided them, only moving on to the next exercise once he confirmed they had the current one correct.</p><p></p><p>By noon, Liang Qu had learned three post standing exercises, while Li Libo had only learned two.</p><p></p><p>As lunchtime approached, the seven taels didn't cover meals, so the two had to go find a street stall to get by. When they returned, they found someone had brought out a large wooden tub from the back courtyard, filled with steaming medicinal liquid.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Some students came to the barrel, took a bowl and drank it all in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Li Libo stretched his neck: "So that's the medicine? I heard our martial arts also have corresponding medicinal formulas, but why haven't I seen any?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe the value of the medicinal formulas is higher? Does the martial arts school rely on the formulas to make money?" Liang Qu guessed.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, money is always in short supply when you need it."</p><p></p><p>"There's no help for it, we were born as the lower class. If we want to change, we have to rely on ourselves, and can only learn more movements seriously in the afternoon."</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Liang Qu learned five more foundation stances, and could flow through them smoothly without guidance, while Li Libo only learned three.</p><p></p><p>By the time they left the martial arts school at 6 o'clock, it was already dark. The two no longer took the bus, but chose to walk back to Yixing City.</p><p></p><p>It was more than ten li, taking nearly half a day. When they reached the street, the two parted ways.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu still found a roadside stall to have his dinner, no longer just the old three dishes, but two meat dishes, one vegetable dish, and one rice, because after learning martial arts, he needed more nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Day by day passed.</p><p></p><p>With the foundation, Liang Qu learned faster and faster, single-mindedly focused without any social life, and so far only knew Hu Qi and Xiang Changsong in the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>With such diligence, in less than four days, he had learned all the foundation stances of the Ape Fist, while Li Libo, who was learning at the same time, had only reached the twentieth stance, lagging far behind, just as Hu Qi had said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liang Qu finish the last stance, Hu Qi nodded: "To learn all the foundation stances in less than four days, I can say you are the fastest I've ever seen. Try flowing through them all."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu responded, and started from the first stance, performing through to the last, taking about half an hour, flowing and graceful.</p><p></p><p>And halfway through, a faint qi actually began to gather within Liang Qu's body, accompanying the movements and spreading throughout his whole body, as if he had taken a hot bath, drenched in sweat while also exhausted.</p><p></p><p>This was an experience he had never had before. In the past, after practicing, he only felt tired and his whole body would heat up.</p><p></p><p>"How was it, did you feel a trace of qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"To feel the qi in just one round means, Disciple Liang, you have abundant qi and blood, excellent natural talent. The appearance of qi means your qi and blood are growing. When the qi becomes as thick as a finger, and the qi and blood like the tide, it will mean you can break through the skin barrier. As long as you break through the skin barrier, that will be a true metamorphosis!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu immediately asked, "Breaking through the barrier, exactly how is that done?"</p><p></p><p>"That involves the medicine again. When the time comes to truly break through the barrier, I will explain it to you in detail. Disciple Liang only needs to keep practicing diligently."</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi smiled, not revealing the full truth.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he fundamentally did not believe the two disciples had any hope of breaking through the barrier.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he looked down on them, but simply the reality of the situation, based on his own experience.</p><p></p><p>He himself was a butcher in Pingyang Town, his ancestors having slaughtered countless pigs to achieve his current attainments.</p><p></p><p>These two fishermen without any background, their income not even reaching that of an ordinary farmer, talking about it would only add to their troubles, so it was better not to say anything.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was not the type to break the pot and ask for the bottom. He just wanted to learn the Ape Fist foundation stances, with a clear focus, but that didn't prevent him from learning a few more things to broaden his horizons. And the other two sets of foundation stances had some similarities, so he would learn them faster.</p><p></p><p>As long as he mastered all the foundation stances before the skin-breaking, he could practice on his own without having to waste time on the more than ten li round trip to the school every day, which would take over an hour each way, that's three sets of foundation stances.</p><p></p><p>Hu Qi was not surprised: "Okay, then I'll teach you the twenty-four different foundation stances of the Tiger Fist next."</p><p></p><p>At 3 o'clock in the afternoon, after Liang Qu learned one Tiger Fist stance, he immediately asked Hu Qi for leave, then hurriedly left the martial arts school under Li Libo's puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish in the spiritual connection told Liang Qu that it had found another precious fish!

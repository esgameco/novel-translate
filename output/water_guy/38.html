        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the end of December, the weather was exceptionally cold.</p><p></p><p>Inside the small cabin, two large bathtubs were placed side by side, with a screen in the middle as a partition. Outside the window sill, the icy cold wind was blowing, while inside, the steam was rising and swirling.</p><p></p><p>The strong herbal fragrance filled the nose, a bitter taste accumulated over the years.</p><p></p><p>The reddish-brown medicinal liquid was surging beneath him, and every pore had relaxed and opened up. Liang Qu's arms were resting on the edge of the tub, and his tense muscles quickly loosened.</p><p></p><p>This wooden tub specially made for bathing was much more sophisticated than his family's rice bucket, with a raised platform in the middle for sitting, and the edge of the tub was even made with fine tooth-like grooves to prevent slipping.</p><p></p><p>The hot water quickly drove away the coldness of the entire room, and it became warm as spring in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The swelling, bruises, and even blood clots left from the previous battle were painful when first in contact with the hot water, but under the penetration of the medicinal liquid, the color quickly faded, became hot, and the pain was significantly relieved, the effect was obvious, even the wound on his head was not as painful.</p><p></p><p>Medicine and martial arts are not separate, the special healing medicine of the martial arts school is indeed exquisite. It's just some common herbs, far from the lotus root in the water, but when combined, they can have such a therapeutic effect! Liang Qu leaned his neck against the edge of the wooden tub, feeling so comfortable that he just wanted to sleep and didn't want to get up.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Shui, how did you do it?" Chen Jie-chang's voice came from behind the screen. After soaking for a while, he finally regained his strength and asked this question that was killing Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Reminded by Chen Jie-chang, Li Li-bo also reacted: "Yeah, yeah, you actually managed to beat seven of them by yourself, that's amazing, how did you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"I have extraordinary natural talents, I won't panic even if a knife is in front of me, just seize the right moment and attack." Liang Qu said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Bragging feels good in the moment, but the aftermath is a disaster.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's face didn't flush, and his heart didn't race.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jie-chang behind the screen suddenly had an epiphany: "I see."</p><p></p><p>Li Li-bo sighed deeply: "Elder Brother Hu just said you have good innate qualities, he must not have expected your talents to be so good too. Ah Shui, no, Brother Shui, I don't ask you to take us under your wing, I just hope that in the future when you make it big, you can let me come to the Liang family and be a doorkeeper, just to manage the three meals would be enough."</p><p></p><p>!!!</p><p></p><p>No, you just believed it like that?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's mind was in turmoil, just about to weave a seamless excuse, but he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was about to launch a heavy punch, but the enemy suddenly sidestepped and then hit him on the back of the head with a sledgehammer, leaving his mind completely blank.</p><p></p><p>Li Li-bo and Chen Jie-chang seemed to really think so.</p><p></p><p>If it's not extraordinary natural talents, then what else could it be? Liang Qu's innate qualities were indeed exceptional, everyone had witnessed it, and Hu Qi said he had never felt such a standard ape-like arms, wasp waist, and mantis legs on anyone else, so it must be like this.</p><p></p><p>Without the modern internet novels, the two of them didn't have concepts like "old grandpa", "system", "golden finger" in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the simplicity of the local folks is so pure and good.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's heart relaxed, and he leaned back into the tub.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>The reddish-brown medicinal liquid became more and more diluted, turning into a pale red color. According to what Hu Qi said, the medicinal effect had been fully absorbed at this stage.</p><p></p><p>But the three of them had no intention of leaving at all. Ordinary families wouldn't have such a specialized bathtub for soaking, they would just use a big tub, cheaper and more practical. But here it was so comfortable, especially with the cold outside, they didn't want to get out.</p><p></p><p>They had the water heated up two more times, and in total, they soaked for nearly an hour before getting up. Their skin was all wrinkled, but after drying off and lying on the bed, they felt no coldness at all. "Hey, look, the quilt is made of cotton!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Li-bo lay down, he noticed something was off, the bedding was too soft. He reached out and felt that it was actually a cotton quilt.</p><p></p><p>In the south, it's not that cold, ordinary families usually...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was mostly filled with reed flowers, accumulated willow floss, and even some straw. The outer cover was sewn with hemp cloth, no need for cotton quilts, let alone a whole cotton jacket.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was quite surprised, and in comparison to his own environment, it was comparable to a five-star luxury hotel! "It's really luxurious, living at eight taels per month!" he exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The three of them blew out the candle and crawled into the quilt. Strangely, although they were exhausted before bathing, once they lay on the bed, they no longer felt sleepy, but became more and more energetic.</p><p></p><p>Especially when thinking about how Lu Tingcai and the others had just been brutally beaten by Liang Qu, Li Liboa chuckled under the quilt.</p><p></p><p>The laughter seemed contagious, and then Chen Jiechangfollowed, and finally Liang Qu, and the three of them all laughed.</p><p></p><p>Li Liboa suddenly threw off the quilt, full of amazement: "It's different, really different now. Ah Shui, from now on you are the direct disciple of the master. I've never seen anyone more capable than you in my life."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Yang is even more capable than the old lord. In Pingyang Town, he is one of the best, I heard that even the county magistrate has to greet him respectfully."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu placed his hands behind his head and gazed at the ceiling: "I didn't expect Master Yang would take me as a disciple. It feels like pulling up a fishing net and finding a precious fish inside."</p><p></p><p>"If you had gone to pay the autumn taxes a few days earlier, that dog official wouldn't have dared to kick your grain. If he dared to kick your grain, you should have gone and kicked him!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I wouldn't dare to do that."</p><p></p><p>"Why not? The one who should be afraid is him. Just call him 'Your Lordship', and he'll think he's really an official, when in fact he's just a lackey of the gentry."</p><p></p><p>"That's absolutely right."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, the room was filled with the atmosphere of a late-night dormitory chat among young men. Everyone was full of vigor and looking forward to their own future.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had been accepted as a direct disciple, with a bright future ahead. Li Liboa and Chen Jiechanghad also been promoted from the seven-tael level to the twenty-tael level, with a significant increase in their breakthrough rate.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had a bright future! They chatted for about half an hour before feeling sleepy.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sleepy."</p><p></p><p>"Me too, let's stop talking and sleep."</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to sleep."</p><p></p><p>The next morning.</p><p></p><p>In the misty dawn, the rooster crowed.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu opened his eyes and got up. He was not at all sleepy, but rather full of energy.</p><p></p><p>Without electricity or phones, everyone worked from sunrise to sunset. So last night, after the bath, it was only around 9 o'clock when they went to sleep.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Liboa and Chen Jiechanghowever, they did not have Liang Qu's robust physique, and with their serious injuries, the warm quilt was too comfortable. They just let out a few hums when they heard the rooster crow and continued dreaming.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu did not disturb them, quietly putting on the clothes Hu Qi had given him, and after a simple wash, he was about to go out, just in time to see Xiang Changsong practicing martial arts in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Liang Shidi, you're up early."</p><p></p><p>"Xiang Shixiong is even earlier, isn't he?" Liang Qu said helplessly, "I also want to sleep in, but my body is used to waking up early."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that fishermen even go out to sea at the Yin time (11 pm to 1 am) or the Zi time (11 pm to 1 am), is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, there are more fish at night, and many people go out to sea at that time to catch enough for their families."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the common people's lives are not easy," Xiang Changsong sighed, then paused and said, "Anyway, the master instructed me last night that if you woke up, I should take you to the manor for the formal ceremony of becoming a disciple, to officially establish the teacher-disciple relationship. Since Liang Shidi is already awake, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I've been longing for it!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

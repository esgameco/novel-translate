        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Study martial arts?</p><p></p><p>A martial arts prodigy?</p><p></p><p>The people present chewed on the two words, feeling a bit strange, as if such a character should not appear in Yixing City, at least not on Liang Qu.</p><p></p><p>Who is he? An orphan.</p><p></p><p>An identity that is exceptionally heavy in any era.</p><p></p><p>Aside from selling themselves to make a living, the vast majority became beggars, silently starving to death in some winter.</p><p></p><p>The Liang family father and son were already not doing well, and many neighbors still had a fresh memory of Liang Dajiang, the widower, passing away. After his death, he was not wrapped in a straw mat, but only a thin wooden coffin, hastily buried in the back mountain, with a wooden tombstone erected.</p><p></p><p>Liang Dajiang's fishing skills were also quite average. Apart from the good boat left behind, the family didn't even have a fishing net. As his son, Liang Qu naturally wouldn't be that strong.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that could be considered good was perhaps that Liang Qu looked decent, but in this world, even if a boy looks good, no one would come to propose marriage, let alone have enough to eat.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the three brothers fleeing in a sorry state, it seems that can only be explained this way.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at each other.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought that Liang Qu's final path would be no different from those orphans, either selling himself or begging. But unexpectedly, he is now different from what everyone imagined, completely transformed.</p><p></p><p>First, he became good at fishing, catching nearly a hundred coins worth of fish every day. Later, he even caught a precious fish, a good one, selling for twice the price. Now it seems the money he made from selling fish was used to learn martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Reading and practicing martial arts have always been the two best paths for ordinary people to rise above the rest.</p><p></p><p>As for reading, we won't discuss it for now. As for martial arts, it is not far from the common people, as they have seen it or heard of it, but they have never heard of anyone in the village who became successful by learning martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After learning, they can't even do things like occupying the river mouth, irrigating two more acres of land, or catching two more nets of fish. They just waste the money in vain.</p><p></p><p>But this Liang Qu, it seems he has learned something remarkable.</p><p></p><p>However, to have reached this point today, it proves that Liang Qu is not quite the same as ordinary people. Some people start to praise him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah Shui has made progress, he will become a lord in the future."</p><p></p><p>"If you really become a martial arts master, don't forget us neighbors."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, if you become a martial arts master, I'll let my son learn from you!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked at the reactions of the people, not very happy. He just said that he was lucky.</p><p></p><p>Revealing that he had learned martial arts was also just to prevent the ruffians from coming to his door every two or three days. So he told the people two pieces of information:</p><p></p><p>One, I have no more money, I've used it all to pay for martial arts tuition.</p><p></p><p>Two, I have the talent for martial arts, if you want to come and try your luck, think it over first.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there is another purpose, as his changes will become greater and greater in the future, then don't ask, just say he learned martial arts.</p><p></p><p>What, you ask why others don't have this kind of change? Do they have the excellent innate quality that I have?</p><p></p><p>At the beginning, I planted a seed of extraordinary talent in everyone's mind, and later it will become more outrageous, so it won't be too abrupt.</p><p></p><p>After the crowd left, Liang Qu returned home, moved the rice barrel, dug out the silver coins buried in the mud, and breathed a sigh of relief after confirming that not a single coin was missing.</p><p></p><p>The autumn tax will be due soon, and if he has no money, it will be a headache.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, thanks to a whip technique and the tax per acre, it's quite simple for a fisherman to pay taxes, just one tael of silver for an adult male.</p><p></p><p>The only problem is that the purity of the silver varies, and the standard is official silver, so there will be a problem of fire loss, which naturally falls on the common people, and the actual tax paid is around one tael and three coins.</p><p></p><p>In the 16th year of the Great Shun, Liang Qu is still a few months away from adulthood, but those who know understand, not to mention a few months, even half a year, you are still "sixteen".</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, according to the whip technique, you can just pay the white silver directly, but the several prefectures in the Jianghuai Zeye area still need to continue to pay grain to supply the capital.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he should go buy rice tomorrow, otherwise the price will rise sharply.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu set his plan, put the money in his pocket, and then took out a tree branch and drew a diagram on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Ledger, Start Practicing Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Using a ledger to record one's growth, and determine the best time and efficiency for practicing, is the scientific method of physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, Liang Qu took his money and went to the rice shop early, finding that there were still quite a few people coming to buy rice.</p><p></p><p>He entered through the front door, and saw a long counter in front, with a row of rice bins beside it, most of them half-full with rice grains for display. If one bought a small amount, they could just scoop it out and take it away, but if buying a large amount, they would fetch it from the warehouse.</p><p></p><p>Behind the counter sat the shopkeeper, manipulating the abacus and marking things down with a brush. Seeing someone come in, he glanced over briefly before continuing with his own business.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's clothes were shabby and poor, so he didn't seem like a wealthy person, and the shopkeeper naturally had no interest in serving him.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take this, it's 36 coins total, go pay at the counter."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, let me see, what kind of grain do you want?"</p><p></p><p>The shop assistant, on the other hand, enthusiastically greeted him, and after finishing his task, hurried over to even answer questions from others.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around, seeing varieties like polished rice, brown rice, inferior rice, glutinous rice, sweet potatoes, but none of them had price tags.</p><p></p><p>"How much is the polished rice per catty?"</p><p></p><p>"10 coins per catty."</p><p></p><p>"That's so expensive? Wasn't it 9 coins per catty just the other day?"</p><p></p><p>The assistant smiled and said, "Well, it's the autumn tax season, a lot of people are coming to buy rice, and no one wants to do the hard labor, so the prices change day by day. If you'd come a couple days later, it might have been 11 or 12 coins."</p><p></p><p>The changes were so rapid, no wonder there were no price tags, Liang Qu thought.</p><p></p><p>"Can't it be a bit cheaper?"</p><p></p><p>"Well..."</p><p></p><p>Tap.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper put down his brush, looked up, and said in a flat tone, "The price is the same everywhere now. If you want to buy, then buy, if not, then leave quickly. The front shop space is not big, leave it for the people behind you."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's eye twitched, really wanting to take off his shoe and hit the guy, but this was the only rice shop in Yixing Market, offending him would mean having to go to Pingyang Town to buy.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a stone of rice, over 150 catties, for over 10 li would be exhausting. If he took a carriage, that would be an unnecessary expense.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a stone of rice might not even be enough, as sometimes they would cheat and count it as only 7 dou, so he'd have to buy one and a half stones to be safe.</p><p></p><p>With money and grain, they really were arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Not wanting to fight over money, Liang Qu could only continue asking, "If the rice is 10 coins per catty, then if I want to buy one and a half stones, how much would that be in silver?"</p><p></p><p>"One and a half stones in silver?" The shopkeeper thought for a moment, manipulating the abacus, "Then that would be 1 liang 6 qian, how's that?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu did some quick mental calculations. He wasn't very good at bargaining, usually just accepting the price quoted, if it seemed reasonable.</p><p></p><p>One and a half stones for 1 liang 6 qian, that was still alright.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, then 1 liang 6 qian." Liang Qu took out his money pouch, and as the assistant reached out, he avoided him and said, "You can deliver the rice to my home, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Your home is in..."</p><p></p><p>"Just in Yixing Market."</p><p></p><p>"Then of course we'll deliver it."</p><p></p><p>"Good, then go get the rice."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu directly paid the money, not worried about any underhanded tricks.</p><p></p><p>Coming to this ancient time, the only thing he felt was still alright, was that the shops wouldn't try to cheat the local people. If they wanted to exploit, they'd do it openly, like the fishing weirs, where they'd tell you upfront how much they were going to rip you off. They wouldn't do it sneakily, otherwise they wouldn't be able to survive with the high population mobility here.</p><p></p><p>After the rice was delivered and settled at home, Liang Qu also bought two baskets to hold the rice, a bedding set, two sets of clothes and shoes, a good fishing net, a bar of soap, a pig bristle toothbrush and some tooth powder, spending all his remaining money.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the bedding on his back and holding all the other items, Liang Qu sighed that money really didn't last long. He had just bought some basic living necessities, and the extra 1 liang was already gone.</p><p></p><p>But with the soft, fluffy quilt, he was sure to sleep well tonight.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

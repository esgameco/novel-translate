        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The essence of the fishing shed is a lending organization, except that they lend out fishing boats and equipment, and collect the fish catch as interest. In addition to renting out fishing gear, they also take on some of the responsibilities of fish traders, acting like distributors.</p><p></p><p>For fishermen who don't rent their boats and equipment from them, the prices are still reasonable, allowing them to save a lot on time costs.</p><p></p><p>It is now past midnight, but there are still shops open on the street, as long as there are fishermen going out to sea, there will be people doing this business.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was hungry, so he found a roadside stall and ordered the "three old things" - one meat dish, one vegetable dish, and one rice dish.</p><p></p><p>Cooking at home requires oil, salt, and firewood, and buying all the ingredients is a hassle. It's better to eat out, as they are all poor folks just trying to earn a living, and a meal costs just eighteen coins.</p><p></p><p>There's no need to hurry with saving money, first focus on building up his physique.</p><p></p><p>He can't move fast, but the deterrence is there, and it can serve as a roadblock, which is helpful for catching fish.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Liang Qu saw Li Libo, the fish seller, setting up his stall along the street.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you're looking great today! How about a fresh fish head soup to nourish you?" Li Libo held up a large white carp by the gills.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Li Libo was taken aback, as he had just casually asked, not expecting a real customer: "Oh, is there good news? Tell me, let's celebrate together."</p><p></p><p>"If I tell you, you might get scared. Just this fish is fine."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't reveal anything. As an insider, even if Li Libo guessed the truth, without evidence, he wouldn't dare to spread it.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, such a big attitude?" Li Libo said as he tied the fish with a straw rope. "Here's your fish."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu casually handed over ten copper coins.</p><p></p><p>"That's too much!"</p><p></p><p>"The extra is for you to have a drink."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, having too much money and nowhere to spend it, huh?" Li Libo was puzzled, but happily took the copper coins.</p><p></p><p>For several consecutive days, Liang Qu followed the normal fishing routine, going out to sea and catching about thirty coins worth of fish each day.</p><p></p><p>Zhao's steward, Zheng Xiang, didn't come looking for him again, allowing him to feel somewhat at ease.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of Laozhang the Bald didn't cause any ripples, as he was just a lone wolf, and no one cared about him as long as he didn't cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it won't be until the autumn tax collection that someone will notice, and that's at least a month away.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Libo, he had long forgotten the matter, and still thought Laozhang was just hiding outside to recover from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>"I can relax for a while now."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, who had been on edge for several days, finally let down his guard and focused on making a living.</p><p></p><p>Aside from eating at the inn every day to nourish his body, the rest of his food came from the precious lotus roots, which he had eaten more than ten pieces of, obtaining 1.3 units of water essence, all of which were used to improve his fusion degree.</p><p></p><p>Healing plants may be rare, but Liang Qu cares more about the present - the stronger he is, the less he will get injured.</p><p></p><p>[Dingzhu: Liang Qu]</p><p>[Refine and Fuse Water Spirit: White Monkey (Fusion Degree: 6.5%)]</p><p>[Water Essence: None]</p><p>[River Favor Degree: None]</p><p>[Water Beast Domination: Tahua Crocodile]</p><p>[Evaluation: The Water Monkey Spirit originates from the great Huaihe River Lord, but it is a weak and insignificant individual]</p><p></p><p>It takes about an hour to consume the water essence to complete the fusion degree upgrade. The 1.5 units of water essence allowed Liang Qu to raise his fusion degree to 6.5, enabling him to control the power of a 40-pound water flow, stay underwater for over 10 minutes, and experience a slight physical enhancement, though his sensing range remains unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Consuming the water essence does not affect the effects of the lotus roots.</p><p></p><p>After eating so many lotus roots, and being young, the deficiencies caused by long-term hunger have been replenished, and Liang Qu can feel his vitality gradually recovering.</p><p></p><p>"I can now dominate another water beast to help with fishing."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu can sense the limit of his spiritual capacity, which is around two to three "immobilized" states. To be on the safe side, he can still dominate another water beast.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A water beast that can barely move.</p><p></p><p>In the cold autumn water, the slow-moving pig dragon struggles to catch fish, and if it weren't for Liang Qu's driving, it would have hibernated long ago and slept until spring.</p><p></p><p>Now, with one person and one beast working together, they don't pick the most valuable fish species, and they can only catch about thirty coins' worth of fish a day. It's not that they don't want to catch the more valuable ones, but Liang Qu is worried that catching too many of them will draw attention.</p><p></p><p>Even if they do catch them, they have to be the kind that are valued in silver.</p><p></p><p>Rowing the boat near the lotus root area, Liang Qu slaps the surface of the water with the oar.</p><p></p><p>Summoned by the call, the pig dragon appears at the side of the boat, its head emerging from the water weeds, scratching its waist with its hind legs and blinking its eyelids.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu takes off his clothes, grabs a wooden spear, and dives into the water.</p><p></p><p>The immobile beast sways its long tail and swims beside him, the water weeds on its head drifting with the current. The man and the beast explore the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The underwater light is dim, and in the shallow areas, the river bottom and water plants can still be seen, but deeper down, it's pitch black, so exploration relies mainly on perception.</p><p></p><p>Common water fish swim past them, but Liang Qu is unmoved, as today's target is a good helper.</p><p></p><p>He pays attention to his direction of travel, avoiding going into the deep water area. In the shallow areas, large aquatic beasts occasionally appear, but they are no more than four meters long, so it's safe. The deep water area is different - according to the old fishermen, there are all kinds of monsters there.</p><p></p><p>After searching for about an hour, Liang Qu found nothing, not that there were no big fish, but they were not the ferocious carnivorous type he was looking for.</p><p></p><p>He is not discouraged, as a fishing enthusiast would sit on a stool by a pond all day with a rod. This is just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>As he dives down again and brushes past a grass carp, a huge, blurry figure suddenly disappears from his perceptual range, taking the grass carp with it!</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu is startled, gripping his spear tightly and summoning the immobile beast to guard him.</p><p></p><p>The blurry figure he sensed was at least two meters long - a real big one! The immobile beast quickly swings its tail, coming to Liang Qu's side, circling constantly to avoid a sudden attack.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu thought it was just a chance encounter, but the dark shadow turned and appeared in his perceptual range again, circling around him.</p><p></p><p>Brushing against the perceptual range, it occasionally entered within a three-meter radius, and Liang Qu finally identified what it was - a six-barbel catfish! A two-meter-long six-barbel catfish, not a common sight. This fish is ferocious in nature, attacking by first flapping its pectoral fins to create a vortex to disorient its prey, then opening its massive mouth like a vacuum cleaner to suck the prey in and swallow it whole.</p><p></p><p>It is said that a child in Yixing City was once drowned and eaten by a six-barbel catfish!</p><p></p><p>There's no doubt that the six-barbel catfish in front of him sees Liang Qu as prey! This fish is truly brave, two meters long and nearly fifty kilograms, daring to attack a man and a crocodile together! Well, it's asking to be taken down. This six-barbel catfish meets all the requirements, so it's decided - you're the one.</p><p></p><p>With a splash, the catfish rolls in the water near the surface, and Liang Qu immediately orders the immobile beast to charge. The crocodile moves slowly, but its attack is extremely fast, like a dagger piercing the heart, instantly stopping the circling six-barbel catfish.</p><p></p><p>The catfish turns to flee, and the immobile beast swings its iron tail like a mace, striking the catfish's head as it brushes past.</p><p></p><p>The six-barbel catfish's head is left with bloody marks, and it turns to ram the soft belly of the pig dragon, but to no avail. The pig dragon seizes the opportunity to hook the catfish's fins with its sharp claws.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu holds his breath, his pupils slightly trembling, staring intently at the battle. As the catfish struggles to shake free, the water current suddenly binds its tail fins - a perfectly timed interception!</p><p></p><p>The six-barbel catfish loses its balance, and the pig dragon seizes the opportunity to bite its tail!</p><p></p><p>The catfish frantically struggles to break free from the pig dragon, and Liang Qu, with a cut finger bleeding into the water, kicks against the current and leaps onto the catfish's back, his black hair scattered like ink smoke. With three fingers together, he draws a water control symbol!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

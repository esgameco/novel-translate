        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Through a layer of semi-transparent film, it did not in the slightest affect Zeding's domination effect.</p><p></p><p>The blood water easily seeped through the thin film, like the Buddha's Vajra pressing down on Sun Wukong's Five Elements Mountain, descending from the sky, piercing through the nutrient solution, stirring up a bloody mist, and striking the young crab.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the perilous experience of being unable to move and the fat catfish, the moment the connection was established, it was like a gentle breeze caressing the face.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt it, and the last gap in the spiritual connection was completely filled, indicating that he had reached the limit of the aquatic creatures he could currently dominate, unless he could enhance his spiritual strength, otherwise he would not be able to dominate other aquatic creatures.</p><p></p><p>[Successfully dominated the stone crab, can evolve]</p><p></p><p>The bloody light dissipated, the crab eggs turned back to orange-yellow, and the eyes of the young stone crab inside suddenly trembled.</p><p></p><p>Is it about to wake up?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was pleasantly surprised, cupping the crab eggs in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The development of the young inside the crab eggs was different from ordinary crabs. It skipped the large-eyed larval stage and went directly to the juvenile crab stage. The one he had chosen was the best-developed one in the crab eggs, its body filling the entire crab egg ball, so its hatching was not unexpected.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining ones, they could only be thrown into the pot, cooked, and turned into another batch of aquatic essence.</p><p></p><p>Raising them was impossible, that was not even a thought, just something said out loud. The crab monsters' intelligence was too low, it was hard to imagine that without domination, they would have the concept of "master" in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Troublesome, dangerous, full of uncertainties, and low returns - these were things Liang Qu would not do.</p><p></p><p>Inside the semi-transparent ball membrane, the juvenile crab waved its large claws, trying to break through the ball membrane, but it had just hatched and its shell was still soft, so it could only squeeze and deform the ball membrane.</p><p></p><p>Next to the raft, the immobilized and the fat one were floating on the water surface, motionless, also staring at the about-to-hatch juvenile crab.</p><p></p><p>The juvenile crab struggled more and more violently, from the large claws to the torso, and finally its entire body was twisting and exerting force.</p><p></p><p>The ball membrane kept expanding, deforming, and twisting, until finally... pop! Accompanied by a sound similar to blowing bubbles, the semi-transparent crab egg membrane finally burst, the soft and wrinkled membrane collapsed, and the transparent viscous nutrient solution flowed out, seeping into the cracks of the wooden board.</p><p></p><p>The newly hatched juvenile crab immediately lay on the ground, pinching with its claws, bit by bit eating its own crab egg membrane, while the white jade-like soft shell on its body visibly became glossy and full.</p><p></p><p>Except for the color, which was still white due to its young age, in other aspects it was almost identical to the crab monster. The upper body stood upright, from wide to narrow in a inverted triangle shape, narrowing to the waist like a belt, the lower body had six legs, a mini version of the mini version.</p><p></p><p>Oh, the abdominal cover was also different, the male crab's was triangular, making its upper body chest look like two big pectoral muscles, unexpectedly handsome.</p><p></p><p>After the juvenile crab finished eating, Liang Qu gently touched it with his fingertip, and the shell had already gained a certain hardness, with a jade-like feel, but not too hard. He didn't dare to try, estimating it to be about as hard as thin chocolate.</p><p></p><p>The juvenile crab, the size of a fist, held its head high and chest out, its claws akimbo, obviously proud of the recognition.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was amused, tapping the juvenile crab's head with his finger: "Since you're only the size of a fist, let's call you Fist."</p><p></p><p>He reconnected with Zeding, wanting to see how much aquatic essence this little guy needed to evolve.</p><p></p><p>[Can consume 800 points of aquatic essence to evolve the stone crab into a stone crab king]</p><p></p><p>800 points!?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was shocked by the number of aquatic essence points required for the crab monster's evolution.</p><p></p><p>800 points was too much, a whole crab monster was only 100 points, 800 points required killing eight, even more. </p><p></p><p>One crab monster had already forced him and the two beasts to flee in a sorry state, it was a harrowing experience, and if it weren't for their stupidity, they would have been done for right then and there. He didn't even dare to think about facing eight of them.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps after Zeling turns blue or breaks through three levels in the Martial Dao, along with the two beasts' evolution, they might be able to reliably kill one crab monster, otherwise they would still sustain some injuries no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But this combat power is now mine.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Letting the baby crabs jump into the palm of his hand, he hoped they would grow quickly.</p><p></p><p>As a male crab, his combat power was absolutely stronger. When the time came, he would be able to walk across the shallow waters, and a five-meter-long crocodile would be no match for his pincer.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know when he could change his way of domination, as constantly snapping his fingers was really painful.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's gaze pierced through the baby crabs, seeing the wound on the tip of his three fingers slowly healing, the lotus root he had just eaten still having a lingering healing effect.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, in the battle with the crab monster, nearly a third of the lotus root field had been eaten or destroyed, and his heart was bleeding. "My lotus roots, all my lotus roots!" Liang Qu had a deep affection for the first pot of gold he had made, and the only way to make up for it was to crush the useless crab shells and bury them in the lotus root field as fertilizer.</p><p></p><p>The blue giant shell on the crab monster's back could be used as a large shield, the two giant claws as small shields, and the six jointed limbs at the bottom as spearheads, the rest was completely useless, which could be considered the final utilization of waste.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the boat, the water was boiling, and the crab eggs he had put in earlier were cooked.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu scooped up one and gulped it down with the soup, almost scalding himself.</p><p></p><p>【Water Essence +0.6】</p><p></p><p>Just this little? </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was greatly disappointed, as normally he would have been overjoyed, but now that his belly was full, this meager gain really didn't excite him.</p><p></p><p>"All yours." </p><p></p><p>Liang Qu threw the remaining crab eggs to the two beasts, letting them consume the water essence needed for their evolution.</p><p></p><p>As for the baby crabs, it was too cruel for them to cannibalize their own kind, let alone eat their own siblings.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, Liang Qu looked at the sky, it was around 4:30 pm. He didn't expect that one crab monster would have taken up so much of his time.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that he had told his senior brother that in the afternoon or evening, Master Yang would be teaching at the martial arts hall, and he couldn't miss it by dusk.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there was still time. Liang Qu told the fat catfish and the immobilized one to hurry up and catch some fish.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts disappeared underwater, leaving only the bubbles floating on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Watching the two beasts leave, Liang Qu looked at the fist on the bow of the boat and suddenly remembered something.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, crabs also needed to hibernate?</p><p></p><p>The crab monster under the water was so fierce that Liang Qu had unconsciously overlooked this fact.</p><p></p><p>He had recruited three little brothers in total, two of whom needed to hibernate. Liang Qu suddenly felt a little worried, hoping that the spiritual beasts would have a high tolerance for low temperatures, but even if their tolerance was high, the baby crab with its large fist wouldn't be much help.</p><p></p><p>Before next spring's arrival, all the fish catch would have to rely solely on the fat catfish.</p><p></p><p>A little after 5 o'clock, the fat catfish lay on the bow of the boat, spitting out three more fish, with water and all.</p><p></p><p>In an hour, the two beasts had caught a total of twelve fish, worth about thirty to forty wen.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough, any later and we won't make it in time." Liang Qu turned his head to look at the fist on the bow of the boat. "From now on, you'll live in the water with Fatty and the Immobilized One."</p><p></p><p>The baby crab tapped its large claw, walked along the side of the boat, and finally crouched down and leaped onto the Immobilized One's head.</p><p></p><p>The three beasts floated on the surface, the fist standing on the Pig Goddess Dragon's forehead, watching Liang Qu row the boat away.</p><p></p><p>Back at the dock, Lin Songbao greeted him with a welcome, then counted the money.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the Jianghuai wetlands, Liang Qu couldn't help but spread his arms, spread his legs, and his still-damp pants fluttered in the cold wind, looking extremely cool.</p><p></p><p>"The sea is wide, and the fish can leap; the sky is high, and the birds can fly!" "You seem very happy?" Lin Songbao asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Tell me so I can be happy too."</p><p></p><p>"If I tell you, you won't be happy anymore."</p><p></p><p>"?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu smiled and tossed the money bag up, catching it as it fell in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Now, time to go back and attend the class!

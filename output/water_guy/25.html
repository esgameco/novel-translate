        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A stream of energy circulated in his chest, gradually dissipating among his internal organs, bringing a faint sense of warmth and comfort.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Ape Fist is really suited for me."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu wiped the fine sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few days, he had learned all the cultivation methods, and the energy flow in his chest was now about as thick as half a chopstick, his progress exceptionally rapid. At the same time, his understanding of the "principles" of the martial arts had deepened.</p><p></p><p>Many things, without personally experiencing them, are difficult to truly grasp the intricacies of.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Three Fists for so long, Liang Qu had summarized the importance of body type. Simply put, each set of techniques has one or more ideal body proportions that it is best suited for, which he called "compatibility".</p><p></p><p>For example, his ape-like arms, wasp-like waist, and mantis-like legs were highly compatible with the Ape Fist of the Three Fists, allowing him to practice it as if following an answer key, achieving perfect results every time, and progressing smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The other two, the Tiger Fist and Crane Fist, were not as compatible. After each practice session, he felt he only achieved around 80% and 60% respectively. Over time, the gap became very apparent.</p><p></p><p>Like Li Libo, his Ape Fist was about 85% compatible.</p><p>Chen Jiechangwas more compatible with the Tiger Fist, but only around 90% level.</p><p></p><p>However, the foundation techniques in the methods could be adjusted. As long as there was a skilled enough instructor to guide him, he could make certain modifications to improve the compatibility.</p><p></p><p>"If the mountain does not come to me, I will go to the mountain myself."</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Hu Qi, his senior, could not do this, and as for Lu Shaowei, it was not even worth mentioning. Even if he could, he probably wouldn't bother. In the entire Yang Family Martial Hall, it was said that only Master Yang himself could improve one's results, and the last five days of every month, all the disciples would seek his guidance.</p><p></p><p>A good teacher is extremely important.</p><p></p><p>Of course, aside from the visible compatibility based on body proportions, there were also hidden factors in the "martial arts exam paper" that contributed to one's overall aptitude. Only by considering all of these together could one truly assess a person's full potential.</p><p></p><p>The most typical example was someone whose body proportions were not ideal, but who had an innate vitality and exceptional comprehension, able to self-modify the techniques and refine their qi and physique. These were things that could not be fully discerned from the surface.</p><p></p><p>In cultivation, these hidden factors could allow one to achieve twice the results with half the effort, potentially scoring over 100 on the "exam". This was why Hu Qi said that poor body proportions didn't matter - they did not represent the full scope of one's aptitude. Perhaps someone with terribly unsuited proportions could still excel, surpassing everyone else.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu marveled at the diversity of human potential, realizing that only by redoubling his efforts could he create miracles.</p><p></p><p>Alas, after just three days, the over hundred coins he had earned previously were already spent. If he didn't work soon, he would have no food to eat.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for hearing from his senior that Master Yang might come in the afternoon or evening, Liang Qu, having just learned the Crane Fist, would have already gone out to work on a boat. Now he could only wait for Master Yang's arrival before leaving.</p><p></p><p>He envied the wealthy disciples.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the dozens of other disciples, Liang Qu realized that after joining the Martial Hall, only he and a few others were the "poor ones" who had only paid seven taels, while the rest had paid at least ten taels, able to devote themselves fully to training without needing to work every few days. Their efficiency was several times higher.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, I haven't seen Laidao Zhang in a while."</p><p>"Yeah, he didn't even show up for the tax collection recently. Could it be that he's become a fugitive?"</p><p>"Nah, that can't be. He's always wandering around, and no one dares to bother him. Why would he be afraid of not paying taxes?"</p><p></p><p>Nearby, Li Liboand Chen Jiechangwere resting on the edge of a flower bed, chatting idly, for some reason bringing up Laidao Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Catching the key words, Liang Qu perked up his ears.</p><p></p><p>Chen Jiechangsaid unhappily, "What's it to you? It's better not to see him, he's not a good person anyway."</p><p></p><p>"That's true." Li Libodidn't think much of it, sweeping his gaze around. "Ah ah ah, look over there, there are a few young ladies, the one in the lead looks quite fierce."</p><p></p><p>"Don't stare around recklessly, they might be of some important status. Be careful."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just taking a quick look."</p><p></p><p>Relieved that the topic had shifted, Liang Qu returned to practicing the Ape Fist.</p><p></p><p>But before he had even completed half the set, the spiritual connection in his mind suddenly began frantically pulsing.</p><p></p><p>The Fatty Catfish and the Immobilized One were frantically sending him messages.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Quiet! The precious lotus roots in the water are under attack!</p><p></p><p>Is it another big guy? Liang Qu's expression changed instantly.</p><p></p><p>The lotus roots were the first pot of gold that made him rich.</p><p></p><p>Although only about 20 pieces could provide the essence of the water, the entire lotus root field was dozens of meters wide, and the remaining hundreds of lotus roots that could not provide the water essence still had good medicinal effects, which he cherished like treasures and had his guards carefully watch over them.</p><p></p><p>Even the fat catfish needed to stay by their side to keep watch.</p><p></p><p>Some small fish and shrimps that came to disturb them were all killed and eaten by the two beasts.</p><p></p><p>What kind of creature is it that even a crocodile and a six-whiskered catfish combined cannot handle, and keeps sending him urgent messages? Thinking about this, Liang Qu couldn't stay still, hastily bid farewell to Li Liboa and Chen Jiechangtwo, and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>The two were surprised and hurriedly asked, "Why are you leaving now? Master Yang might be coming soon, won't you stay and let him give you some guidance?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu hesitated for a while: "I have an urgent matter now, I should be able to come back after dealing with it."</p><p></p><p>It was morning now, if he went back and came back, he might still be able to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Liang Qu seemed really anxious, Li Liboa and Chen Jiechangtwo didn't persuade him further, and could only tell him to be careful on the way.</p><p></p><p>Watching Liang Qu's back, Li Liboa scratched his head, "How strange, it was the same last time."</p><p></p><p>"Last time?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Li Liboa nodded. "Last time, Ashui also hurriedly left in the middle of learning from Master Hu, and no one came to notify him about anything."</p><p></p><p>"Why think so much, maybe Ashui had already made an appointment."</p><p></p><p>"That's true."</p><p></p><p>The fallen leaves piled up layer by layer on the muddy ground, turning into the dark brown humus.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the martial arts hall, Liang Qu conserved his strength and jogged all the way from Pingyang Town to Yixing City, a distance of more than ten miles, in less than half an hour.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the pier, Liang Qu caught his breath and then pretended to be calm as he untied the boat, and after seeing no one around, he quickly rowed the boat to the lotus root area and tapped the surface of the water.</p><p></p><p>In a moment, a pig-nosed dragon and a six-whiskered catfish surfaced.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu patted the heads of the two beasts, let them roll around, and checked them over, relieved to find that they were unharmed.</p><p></p><p>He had previously given the two beasts an order to observe whether they could deal with whoever came to steal the lotus roots, and if they could, to go and fight, and if not, to retreat without a direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>If the land is lost, both the land and the people are lost; if the people are lost, both the people and the land remain.</p><p></p><p>Although the lotus roots were precious, they were still not as important as the two water beasts Liang Qu had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The two beasts that had eaten the precious fish had undergone a second evolution and had become even stronger. Now they were over 2.2 meters long, and the fat catfish had even reached 2.4 meters! They were several times larger, and the water essence they needed for evolution had also decreased by more than 4 points each.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their growth was a good thing, and the stronger his subordinates were, the better.</p><p></p><p>But Liang Qu was even more puzzled, what kind of creature could make the unmoving and the fat catfish have to retreat? Just as he was pondering, the fat catfish in the water suddenly arched its back, stuck its head into the boat, opened its big mouth and spat out five lotus roots, which fell onto the wooden boards with a dull thud.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu picked up one and examined it, greatly surprised: "These are lotus roots with water essence? You took them away before the monster came?"</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish and the pig-nosed dragon swished their tails, splashing water onto Liang Qu, but he didn't get angry, and even felt a little moved.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had left a few lotus roots containing water essence as a reserve, and had the two beasts focus on guarding them. He didn't expect the two beasts to be so smart that they could even transfer important assets.</p><p></p><p>They've grown up well, it wasn't for nothing that he raised them.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu climbed into the boat, grabbed a wooden spear, and the muscles on the side of his face tightened involuntarily, revealing sharp lines. He narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, let's go down and see who dares to steal my lotus roots."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

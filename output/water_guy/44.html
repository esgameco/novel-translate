        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the dock, over a hundred fishing boats were tightly moored together, like fish scales spreading out from the shore.</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the night, no one was out on the boats.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, there was no moon, no stars.</p><p></p><p>The sky today was darker than usual, an overcast day, the air also much more humid and unusually cold.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu could only pray that it wouldn't rain before he returned.</p><p></p><p>Windy and rainy, windy and rainy, rain often came with strong winds, and big winds brought big waves, making the boats easily capsize. If no one was watching, they could even drift away.</p><p></p><p>There were no anchors on the small boats, they relied on a large stone tied with ropes to secure the boat, which had some effect but not much.</p><p></p><p>There was no other choice, Liang Qu had to go out even in the rain, the precious fish were right in front of him, he couldn't not go.</p><p></p><p>Of all the precious fish he had seen so far, the vast majority had strength surpassing ordinary fish, swimming swiftly, able to tear through fishing nets even when immobilized, and were hard to catch with just immobilized catfish.</p><p></p><p>The wind wasn't too strong yet, the water waves pushing ripples, the fishing boats on the dock colliding with a dull thud.</p><p></p><p>Stepping from one boat to the next, Liang Qu leapt onto his own small boat, the entire small boat suddenly sinking down, kicking up a large splash of waves.</p><p></p><p>"Ashuai, why are you going fishing now?" Lin Songbao's voice came from the shore, but it was too dark to see his figure.</p><p></p><p>"Not fishing, the family pot can't be opened anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Can't be opened? Then come to my house for dinner? It should rain tonight, it's best not to go out on the boat."</p><p></p><p>"No need, the bigger the wind and waves, the more valuable the fish!"</p><p></p><p>"Then be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu untied the hemp rope, picked up the pole, pushed the boat out from the surrounding fishing boats, and headed out to the open lake, quickly switching to oars and rowing towards his destination.</p><p></p><p>The precious fish he had discovered this time were not in the lotus root water area, but in a water area he had never been to before.</p><p></p><p>It took Liang Qu nearly half an hour to row there, the oar striking the water surface, the immobilized Pigua Dragon floating to the surface, its head topped with "fists" clashing against its own pincers, making a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>The "fists" hadn't changed much, but the immobilized state had changed rapidly. Even with mental preparation, Liang Qu was still shocked when he saw the size of the immobilized creature.</p><p></p><p>Just a day had passed, the immobilized one had grown from the original 2.3 meters to nearly 2.7 meters, an increase of half a meter!</p><p></p><p>The immobilized one was less than 2 meters long initially, weighing only about 30 kilograms, lighter than Liang Qu, unable to even roll over him if he sat on it.</p><p></p><p>Now it was at least 60 kilograms, almost doubling in size. Liang Qu suspected that the physical energy left behind by the crab monster had not been fully digested, and was still continuing to take effect, allowing the immobilized one to continue growing.</p><p></p><p>If Liang Qu had encountered the immobilized one the first time at this size, he definitely wouldn't have been able to subdue it, he would have been defeated on the spot.</p><p></p><p>It was all a matter of fate.</p><p></p><p>Without being dominated, the body type of the immobilized Tahua Alligator would be hard to break through the 2-meter barrier, 2.2-2.3 meters being the species limit. Either they would have to take special precious medicines, or have other opportunities to grow into a spiritual monster.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the fattened catfish had turned into, but first he had to catch the precious fish.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sank the boat, secured by the stone, took off his clothes, grabbed the scoop net, and jumped into the water.</p><p></p><p>In late December, it was the middle of winter. Even with Liang Qu's water monkey spirit power, he still felt the cold, and an ordinary person would be shivering, possibly even freezing to death if they stayed in too long.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with his increased fusion, Liang Qu could still adapt, and the immobilized one, due to its growth, also had some cold resistance. Its activity hadn't increased much, but it hadn't decreased too much either, maintaining a slightly lower balance.</p><p></p><p>The man and two beasts quickly found the fattened catfish buried in the mud. The fattened catfish had grown even more rapidly, crossing the 3-meter mark, reaching 3.1-3.2 meters, several times larger. Its weight must have exceeded 100 kilograms.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed that it had not adapted to the growth of its own body, its depth of burrowing into the mud was the same as before, its entire body still sunk in the mud.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Its entire back was exposed, with no disguise or concealment. It didn't matter if Liang Qu could easily detect it through the spiritual connection - even a random fish could do it! It had become smarter, but not that smart.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu patted the fat catfish's back, and it didn't even realize anything was amiss, enthusiastically pointing out the direction of the precious fish.</p><p></p><p>This child, I'll teach it slowly over time.</p><p></p><p>Swimming a few meters forward silently, Liang Qu sensed the precious fish that Fatty had mentioned - it was a large red-finned perch, around seven or eight catties in size.</p><p></p><p>The red-finned perch and the tiger-spotted fish should be the most common precious fish species in the shallow waters near the Shangrao wharf? Liang Qu rubbed his hands, not even needing the help of the immobilized catfish, and approached the precious fish alone, stretching out his five fingers towards the red-finned perch and suddenly grasping it firmly.</p><p></p><p>The red-finned perch, which had been lying in the mud, suddenly felt the surroundings become extremely viscous, like hardened mud swamp. It tried to struggle, but its movements were extremely slow, and it could only watch helplessly as it was hooked through the gill cavity, pulled out of the mud, and placed into the fishing net.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu twisted the net opening, hugged the red-finned perch, and swam back to the boat, then transferred it into the fish basket, covering it with the lid.</p><p></p><p>Everything went smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The sky began to rain, the raindrops shattering on the surface of the water, creating a hazy gray mist.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the cold water, Liang Qu's aquatic affinity made him more afraid of the wind chill, so he simply didn't wear any clothes, stuffing his cotton jacket into the partition.</p><p></p><p>The rain was heavy, with waves over a foot high crashing into the boat, rocking it violently.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took out a stone knife and quickly gutted the fish, feeding the bones and trimmings to the three beasts.</p><p></p><p>The immobilized one and the fat catfish eagerly gulped down their own shares, while the "Fist" only nibbled at a fish intestine like eating wide noodles, steadily perched on the immobilized one's head, completely unaffected by the wind and waves.</p><p></p><p>The rain grew even heavier.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, there were splashes of colliding water everywhere, and the air was thick with moisture, as if Liang Qu had never left the water and was still at the bottom.</p><p></p><p>Even the sunken rocks could barely hold the boat, which was slowly drifting in another direction.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu had originally wanted to practice his enhanced fusion abilities at the bottom of the water, but now that plan was completely ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Immobilized and Fist, go back first and watch over my lotus root field, don't let any fish steal them again. Fatty, you lead the way."</p><p></p><p>The two beasts quickly disappeared, leaving only the fat catfish swimming towards the wharf, with Liang Qu desperately rowing behind it.</p><p></p><p>The heavy rain had shrouded everything in a hazy veil, and Liang Qu could no longer discern the direction of the wharf.</p><p></p><p>He had watched a lot of wilderness survival live streams from the Immortal Bi Fang in his previous life, but Liang Qu hadn't learned all the skills, so he could only rely on the fat catfish to guide the way.</p><p></p><p>The rainwater flowed down Liang Qu's back, his hair completely soaked, the droplets forming a string on his chin.</p><p></p><p>Lightning flickered in the clouds, and the thunder rumbled.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu rowed with all his might, when suddenly a strange sense of unease enveloped his heart. He wiped the water from his face, looking around in bewilderment, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>He asked Fatty through the spiritual connection, but Fatty didn't respond, as if the previous unease had been an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The sky was as black as ink, the raindrops colliding with each other in the air, occasionally a bolt of lightning striking the ground, briefly illuminating the sky.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu grew increasingly uneasy, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>A branching lightning bolt flashed in the clouds, a thunderous explosion ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu covered his ears, his pupils split in two by the lightning.</p><p></p><p>An unbelievably huge dark shadow suddenly appeared, blocking the blue-white lightning, the silver-bright pupils dimming again.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Liang Qu doubted whether he had seen an illusion.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

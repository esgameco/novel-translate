        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chen, are you sure that's the name?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm certain that's the name, unless someone else told me the wrong name. What's the matter, Ashui? Don't tell me you know him?"</p><p></p><p>"I do know him, but we're not on the best of terms, a bit distant."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu returned home, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>There were only three martial arts schools in the town, and martial artists were a rare sight, so there definitely wouldn't be two people with the same name.</p><p></p><p>Lu Shaohui was not as capable as Hu Qi, and he had done nothing during the recent conflict, clearly derelict in his duties.</p><p></p><p>But as a "substitute", there was nothing Liang Qu could do to him. He had somehow died. Was it two days ago, or was he just discovered today? Liang Qu pondered this question.</p><p></p><p>Lu Shaohui hadn't shown up at the martial arts school for the past two days, the time period right after the conflict when Hu Qi had tried to find him but couldn't.</p><p></p><p>No, it's still early, he should go take a look.</p><p></p><p>Thinking the matter might be related to him, Liang Qu borrowed a wooden bucket from Uncle Chen, wrapped a large demon feather in a damp burlap cloth, and placed it in the water-filled bucket, then hurried towards Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the dinner gathering tonight or consulting his senior brothers about the use of the demon feather, he had to go to town today.</p><p></p><p>The matter was urgent, and the sixteen-li journey, Liang Qu completed in just two and a half hours. He perked up his ears on the street.</p><p></p><p>"I heard he was a martial arts master, but he died in a dilapidated temple, how terrible."</p><p></p><p>"No, I heard he was just a martial artist, but he had broken through three barriers and was about to become a master."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, he wasn't an ordinary person, and he died so horribly, his entire internal organs were scooped out. The coroner said he might have been eaten by some kind of monster, not killed by a human."</p><p></p><p>"A monster? Really? Does that mean we're in trouble? What if it eats us?"</p><p></p><p>"With your scrawny body, the monster would find you too bony to chew."</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the teahouses and shops was talking about Lu Shaohui's death.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu stopped a tea scholar, "My friend, can you tell me which dilapidated temple the martial arts master Lu died in? Can you point me the way?"</p><p></p><p>The tea scholar smiled, "Would you like a cup of tea, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"No need for tea, I'm in a hurry." Liang Qu handed over five coins.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sir." The tea scholar chuckled, pocketing the money, then led Liang Qu to the street, pointing in the distance, "Do you see that Huang's cloth shop over there?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Go behind that shop, about two li down the road, you'll see a wide dirt path. That used to be the paved stone road in front of the temple, but the stones have been removed, leaving just the dirt. Follow that path for about an hour, and you'll reach the temple."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome, come have tea with us sometime."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu didn't go to the dilapidated temple, instead he turned and went to his third senior brother's shop. Lu's ironsmith shop was on the way to Huang's cloth shop, so he could first ask about the use of the demon feather.</p><p></p><p>"Third Senior Brother Lu!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Liang? What brings you here so soon, don't tell me you've changed your mind about the spearhead design?"</p><p></p><p>"No, last night while fishing, I found something rather hot to handle, and I wanted you to take a look and tell me what it is."</p><p></p><p>"Hot to handle?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiang took the burlap-wrapped item from Liang Qu, stepping away from the forge, "Come, let's go inside."</p><p></p><p>In the quiet room.</p><p></p><p>Lu Jiang closed the door, taking the burlap bundle from Liang Qu. Even through the damp cloth, he could still feel the scorching heat. His expression changed to one of surprise, "It really is quite hot."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu helped unwrap the cloth, revealing the golden-red feather whose high temperature was distorting the air around it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang's pupils contracted slightly: "Scarlet Fire Mourning Feather?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Lü, do you know about it?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang instinctively turned around, and after closing the door, he asked in a low voice, "Where did you get this from?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu recounted the two demonic beasts' battle the previous night, and how they found the bird feather the next day, but he changed the part about the two beasts discovering it to him finding it while fishing.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang, I don't even know how to describe your luck." Lü Gang sighed, "Do you know how the Scarlet Bird's Mourning Feather came about?"</p><p></p><p>"How did it come about?"</p><p></p><p>"I cannot determine the exact nature of the great demonic beast in the water, but the fierce fire giant bird you mentioned is definitely the Scarlet Fire Bird.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Fire Bird has an extremely tenacious life force. Whenever it faces a mortal danger, it will infuse its entire life essence into a part of its own feathers, scattering them in all directions to facilitate its escape.</p><p></p><p>Among those feathers, there will be one that contains the most life essence, which is the Scarlet Fire Golden Feather. It will use this feather to complete its rebirth, similar to a gecko shedding its tail, except that it sheds its entire body.</p><p></p><p>"So this one..." Liang Qu's eyes gleamed with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang chuckled, "It's naturally impossible that this is the Golden Feather for its rebirth, otherwise you and I wouldn't even be able to approach this feather."</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Liang, don't be ungrateful. The Scarlet Fire Bird only scatters a dozen or two feathers each time, and given its size, even if it's not the main part, that's still a considerable amount of life essence."</p><p></p><p>"What can it be used for?"</p><p></p><p>"It can help with cultivation, but I suspect you'll have a hard time absorbing the energy within. The life essence with fire attributes tends to be quite violent, unless you've already broken through to the Warrior Realm after the third level, I don't recommend trying.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the energy in the feather is not replenished, it will dissipate quickly. So I suggest guiding out the life energy all at once, using it as charcoal to forge a weapon, and I'm 80% confident I can imbue it with spiritual qualities."</p><p></p><p>Spiritual weapon? Liang Qu had never heard of this term before.</p><p></p><p>"Weapons with spiritual qualities are extremely rare, because materials like the Scarlet Fire Mourning Feather are hard to obtain. An adult Scarlet Fire Bird would require at least a Pinnacle Realm warrior to capture, and even then it's not guaranteed, as the Scarlet Fire Bird can fly, often requiring two or three Pinnacle Realm warriors to surround and capture it.</p><p></p><p>The main feature of a spiritual weapon is its ability to self-repair and grow. As long as it has the same source material, it can absorb it to repair itself. A nail-sized crack can be healed in about ten days.</p><p></p><p>Even the best-forged weapons will inevitably wear down over time, and the warriors who can engage in weapon-to-weapon combat are mostly of the same level. When their weapons clash, cracks are easily formed.</p><p></p><p>Like your Fourth Senior Brother, he's come to me to exchange swords countless times, and every time he's so stingy about the payment."</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang's usually calm tone had a rare hint of irritation.</p><p></p><p>"Then use it to forge my long spear."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu made the decision on the spot. Even holding the feather with his bare hands was difficult, let alone trying to absorb the energy within. Rather than letting it go to waste, exchanging it for a spiritual weapon would be a great deal.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had just stumbled upon this by chance, he couldn't expect too much.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll prepare it as soon as possible. Brother Liang, please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I have some other matters to attend to first, I'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, do you know Lü Shaohui, Brother Lü?"</p><p></p><p>"Lü Shaohui? He sounds familiar, isn't he one of our sect's two-level warriors?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Gang thought for a moment. Since he made a living as a blacksmith, he didn't really need to work at the sect, so he wasn't very familiar with the details.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but since Brother Lü doesn't know him well, never mind."</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"He's dead."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

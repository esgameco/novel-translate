        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Too stealthy, too swift.</p><p></p><p>The assailant blended seamlessly with the surrounding environment, the attack coming with lightning speed. Liang Qu could only catch a glimpse of a blurry shadow.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Liang Qu felt a weight on his shoulder, and another black shadow flew out, colliding head-on with the attacking shadow and knocking it away.</p><p></p><p>Regaining his senses, Liang Qu found that the fist that had been perched on his shoulder had vanished, leaving only six small footprints behind.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't reacted in time, but the fist had.</p><p></p><p>The fist and the black shadow fell to the ground together, the exoskeleton and stones colliding with a crisp metallic sound.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, the assailant tried to flee, flailing its limbs. The prepared fist leapt forward, grabbing the black shadow with its massive pincers.</p><p></p><p>The black shadow curled up, opening its mouth in an attempt to counterattack, but was then seized by the other massive pincer around its neck.</p><p></p><p>The fist's strength completely overpowered the assailant. As it opened its pincers wide, the black shadow's entire body was forced to unfurl, struggling violently, its midsection continuously rising and contracting, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>Having subdued the assailant, the fist moved its six feet quickly to Liang Qu, raising its pincers high as if presenting a treasure to a deity.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu, having regained his composure, was drenched in cold sweat. He had truly been startled by the sudden appearance of the black shadow - the dangers in the water were indeed unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu let the fist approach some glowing vines, then crouched down to discover that the shadow was actually a giant centipede, its translucent exoskeleton shimmering like a sapphire, reflecting the blue waves, exuding a dangerous aura.</p><p></p><p>A water centipede! Liang Qu grew increasingly apprehensive, recognizing this creature. </p><p></p><p>A highly venomous centipede that lives in the water, with a bite force that is astonishing. Just three inches long, a normal person bitten would perish in moments - a dreaded poisonous insect.</p><p></p><p>The one before him was nearly six inches long, larger than the span of an outstretched hand. Even though Liang Qu had become a martial artist, being bitten by it would not end well.</p><p></p><p>"Good job, fist!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu reached around the centipede and patted the fist's carapace.</p><p></p><p>Encouraged by the praise, the fist held the water centipede even higher.</p><p></p><p>"Can the water centipede be controlled?"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt drawn to the struggling water centipede.</p><p></p><p>Now that his cultivation had greatly increased, he had extra spiritual capacity to control a new water beast.</p><p></p><p>For fishing, the oversized catfish would be more than enough, so the focus should be on enhancing combat power.</p><p></p><p>However, Liang Qu's spiritual strength had only increased by the amount of the "immobilized" one, not the original two-meter Taihua alligator.</p><p></p><p>With such limited extra capacity, controlling a spiritual creature was impossible, as it would easily backfire and turn him into a fool. Acquiring another large fish would also be rather useless.</p><p></p><p>The venomous water insect was the best choice.</p><p></p><p>Poison. </p><p></p><p>The most efficient means for the weak to overcome the strong.</p><p></p><p>The water centipede before him was six inches long - ordinary martial artists would be in trouble if it broke through their defenses. Its small size and lack of conspicuousness compared to the fist made it easy to conceal and carry around.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked around and found a sharp stone shard, trying to cut his own finger, but the stone just shattered, leaving only a shallow wound.</p><p></p><p>Tsk, the skin had become too tough after tempering.</p><p></p><p>He would have to find time to ask his senior brother to buy him a dagger.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu sighed inwardly, painstakingly squeezing a few drops of blood from the small wound onto his fingertips, then had the fist pin the centipede flat on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The six-inch water centipede's back was too narrow, so Liang Qu stacked three fingers together in a "ÂìÅ" shape and carved a narrow water symbol on its back.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Zeding emitted a glow.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored water talisman instantly overshadowed the rippling light in the stone cave, slowly seeping into the body of the water centipede.</p><p></p><p>Stimulated, the water centipede curled up from head to tail, its limbs folding inch by inch, turning into a round blue pearl that rolled down to the bottom of the low-lying area in the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>A strong yet bearable stinging pain suddenly assaulted the depths of Liang Qu's mind, and he crouched on the ground, clutching his head and enduring it.</p><p></p><p>When he regained his senses, the spiritual connection in his mind had almost been replenished, although there was still a sliver missing, which was probably enough to control a small fish - no different from having it or not.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Controlling a water centipede takes up so much space? Like a crocodile? Communicate with Zeding.</p><p></p><p>[The water beast Tian Shui Centipede has been subdued, and it can evolve.]</p><p></p><p>Tian Shui Centipede, not just a water centipede?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu was surprised, as the name displayed by Zeding was always the common name, just like Taihua Alligator was the Taihua Alligator, not something else.</p><p></p><p>Why is this water centipede called the Tian Shui Centipede? The focus of Liang Qu's reading these past two days has been the six volumes of the "Haomu Hall Miscellaneous Notes Annotated Edition", and he hasn't come across any mention of the Tian Shui Centipede.</p><p></p><p>As if responding to his puzzlement, Zeding radiated light.</p><p></p><p>[Tian Shui Centipede: A water centipede nourished by water spirit mushrooms and the flesh and blood of cultivators, it has undergone a transformation. It can consume 1,000 points of water essence to evolve into the Great-Winged Tian Shui Centipede.]</p><p></p><p>Damn, 1,000 points of water essence!</p><p></p><p>That's more than the evolution of a Fist.</p><p></p><p>Since the Fist is already a spirit beast, the Tian Shui Centipede must be a spirit beast as well, perhaps even stronger? Liang Qu was delighted, not expecting that he had accidentally subdued another small spirit beast. No wonder it was so small, yet its mental strength was comparable to an adult Taihua Alligator.</p><p></p><p>It's the part about the cultivator's flesh and blood that Liang Qu doesn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>He knows about the water spirit mushroom - besides the head-sized one, he saw many bare rhizomes around, obviously eaten by the water centipede.</p><p></p><p>Cultivator's flesh and blood... Liang Qu gently pinched the blue pearl with his fingers, and in an instant, it unfurled and transformed into a six-inch-long centipede with a blue carapace that shimmered with a metallic luster. The centipede raised its upper body, its mouthparts fierce and imposing. Upon closer inspection, the part he had pinched showed no damage at all, the exoskeleton as hard as iron.</p><p></p><p>"You look so mighty, I'll call you Awei."</p><p></p><p>The hundred-legged Tian Shui Centipede stirred in Liang Qu's palm.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the human-shaped thing you ate?"</p><p></p><p>Through their mental connection, the now intelligent Awei easily understood Liang Qu's question and rotated its upper body, pointing towards a direction in the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>With the faint light of the vines, Liang Qu found a narrow crack, and he had to turn sideways to squeeze in, the interior overgrown with moss.</p><p></p><p>Remembering his previous experience, Liang Qu let the Fist and Awei explore the path first before attempting to enter himself.</p><p></p><p>He tucked in his waist and hips, and with the help of the wet, sticky moss, he slid in smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The ones unable to move and standing outside the crack couldn't get in no matter what they did - it was too wide, and they couldn't generate enough force by turning sideways.</p><p></p><p>The fat catfish was even floating on the water surface, unable to climb onto the platform, sighing wistfully.</p><p></p><p>After entering the crack, the initial space was extremely narrow, but after walking a few steps, he reached a tiny area of about two or three square meters, also illuminated by glowing vines.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the vines, a moss-covered skeleton sat cross-legged.</p><p></p><p>The skeleton hung its head, its teeth incomplete and the jaw half detached, leaving a grim, grinning expression.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What about the tempering? The lacquer? You said it would take three months, but how did you finish it in just half a month? And as a junior disciple, am I really able to handle something that just came out of the furnace?</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu looked puzzled, completely unaware of why the initial plan to make a three-month long spear was completed in just half a month. He tentatively asked, "Senior brother, did you forget something?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang paused, glanced at the spear, and then had a look of sudden realization: "Indeed."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt relieved, thinking, "See, I knew he had forgotten something."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, he saw Lu Gang pick up a red tassel from the table and tie it to the spear head, then hand it back to him. "Now it's done. Strictly speaking, this is not a spear, as the spear head is too long, so it should be considered a halberd. But the distinction between the two is not strict, and attaching the tassel won't cause any issues, as it can block blood."</p><p></p><p>"That's not what I'm concerned about," Liang Qu said helplessly, and directly asked, "Senior brother, didn't you say it would take two more months to lacquer it with that special lacquer?"</p><p></p><p>"That was the standard casting method. I didn't originally plan to make a spiritual weapon, so I didn't think about using the skin of a spirit beast. With the spirit beast skin as the lacquer layer, I don't need to use regular lacquer. They are completely fused together, just like a tree growing its bark, so it's already done."</p><p></p><p>"What about the tempering? Doesn't that need to be done as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual weapons don't require tempering. They can self-repair and adjust their own toughness, hardness, and balance."</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang gripped the spear, flipping it in a graceful flourish. "This spear is imbued with spirituality and is nearly perfect. Tungsten gold spear head, ivory white wooden shaft, feathers from a crimson fire spirit beast, and lacquered with spirit beast skin. I can say this is the best weapon I've ever forged. Holding it, I can almost feel a living spirit residing within it. Take a look."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liang Qu could only marvel at the wonders of the world. Lu Gang must have invested a lot of precious materials and favors to create this spear.</p><p></p><p>There are many rare metals in the Jiang-Huai wilderness, and Liang Qu thought Lu Gang would surely appreciate them. He should have his sworn brothers go search for some.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu reverently reached out with both hands to receive the grand spear. </p><p></p><p>As Lu Gang let go, Liang Qu felt his arms dip slightly. It was so heavy!</p><p></p><p>Ordinary spears only weigh around 2 to 5 jin (pounds), with only the strongest warriors using ones around 20-30 jin. Even the legendary Guan Yu's weapon was only around 30 jin when converted to modern weight.</p><p></p><p>But this spear before him was far heavier, likely close to 100 jin!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu gazed at the spear, feeling a profound connection with it. The spear head alone was 12 inches long - nearly half the length of a standard single-handed sword. Its design was quite unique, more akin to a halberd than a typical spear.</p><p></p><p>In the noon sunlight, a faint golden sheen flickered along the blade. Coiled around the spear neck was a dragon-like form, its cloudy body and sharp claws seemingly grasping the shaft, its eyes glinting with a cold light. Such artistry could only have been achieved through the use of spirit beast skin.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath and gently caressed the shaft. The ivory white wood should have been smooth and milky, but coated in the beast skin, it had become a deep, dark purple, with a thick, rubbery texture that made it hard to slip from one's grasp.</p><p></p><p>"The total length of the spear is 7 feet 5 inches, with a 12-inch spear head and an additional 2 feet 2 inches of metal extension, for a total weight of 96 jin. Given your current strength, it is a bit long and heavy, but not unusable," Lu Gang stated, having precisely measured and considered Liang Qu's physique in the design.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu nodded. Carrying a weight of nearly a hundred jin was not too difficult for him, and he wouldn't even say it was tiring. But the significance of a weapon was completely different.</p><p></p><p>For a normal adult, being able to wield a two-jin single-handed sword would already be quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the long spear did not rely too much on arm strength. Holding the well-balanced long spear felt like an extension of one's own body. As a martial artist, Zeliang's enhancement allowed Liang Qu to be stronger than the average warrior. With the added boost from the Bow Strength Technique, he could barely manage to use it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a few wooden posts in the backyard. Want to try it out?"</p><p></p><p>"Sure!"</p><p></p><p>When Liang Qu was young, he would wreak havoc on the wild grass just by wielding a wooden stick. Now that he had obtained such a formidable weapon, he eagerly agreed.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard, several thick wooden posts bound with straw stood upright. Broken logs were also scattered around, seemingly a designated area for testing weapons.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took a deep breath, channeled his strength, and swung the 2.5-meter-long spear at the wooden posts.</p><p></p><p>Chop, cover, slice, block, lift, sweep, carry, charge, smash, stab, hook - the spear's various techniques posed no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Half a wooden post fell to the ground with a dull thud.</p><p></p><p>Damn! Liang Qu almost let out a curse.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had felt no resistance at all, as if cutting through the air!</p><p></p><p>This is too amazing! Third Senior Brother, my idol! With one strike, he could probably split a person in half! If he had this spear yesterday when facing the mountain demon, even without targeting its weak point, just by chopping, he could have cleaved off the demon's head! From now on, I'll be the one leading the charge in blood sacrifices!</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang didn't know what Liang Qu was thinking. He silently pulled out the three wooden posts, aligned them together, and pressed them into the ground by a third using just his palms.</p><p></p><p>"Try again."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Liang Qu swung the spear again. There was a slight resistance this time, but it did not get stuck, and the three wooden posts were shortened by another section.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang then produced an iron rod the thickness of a forearm and inserted it into the ground. "Try again."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu felt a bit reluctant. "This..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the spirit weapon's edge can self-heal as long as there are materials. Come on, try it!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu reconsidered and thought he was still stuck in his old mindset.</p><p></p><p>He immediately swung the great spear at the iron rod, this time not completely severing it, but breaking off two-thirds.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with a slight effort, the iron rod broke apart, and the spear's edge remained unharmed.</p><p></p><p>If the chopping was this powerful, how formidable would the thrusting be?</p><p></p><p>That crab monster's steel-like hard shell would probably be pierced through, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>Both Liang Qu and Lu Gang were very satisfied with the results.</p><p></p><p>One was satisfied with his weapon, the other satisfied with his creation.</p><p></p><p>Back in the room, Lu Gang gave Liang Qu a large wooden box to store the spear and a small leather pouch.</p><p></p><p>Inside the leather pouch were a small piece of tungsten gold, a small piece of ivory-white wood, a bottle of golden oil, and a smooth silk cloth.</p><p></p><p>"The shadow beast's hide can self-repair by absorbing blood. The other two materials are for manual repair. I've prepared two pieces of each for you. Remember to use the sword oil to clean and maintain it after each use, to prevent tarnishing. The items are all inside."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother Lu! I, Qu, come from a poor background and have no way to repay your kindness. If Senior Brother Lu has any future requests, I will not refuse!"</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu understood that Lu Gang had invested a lot of precious materials to enhance his Crimson Fire Mourning Feather. The cost was probably three or four times higher.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already received the items, he could only be indebted.</p><p></p><p>Lu Gang chuckled, not thinking Liang Qu had anything he could help with, but did not refuse: "Alright, if I have anything in the future, I won't be polite."</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu clasped his fists, bowed deeply, and then carefully placed the treasures into the wooden box, carrying the two boxes as he took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I've been busy for half a month. Now I can rest a bit. You can go."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

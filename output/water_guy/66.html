        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The illustration of a mountain demon in the annotated edition of "Haomutang Miscellaneous Notes" left a deep impression on him! Its skin was cracked like the bark of a withered tree, resembling a human form, with a tanned complexion like a dead tree, impervious to blades and spears.</p><p></p><p>It feeds on livestock from a young age and delights in devouring human organs! How could there be a mountain demon here!? Pingyang Town is sixteen li away from Yixing City!</p><p></p><p>The intense sound of nine gongs echoed on the dock, the shaman swaying slowly while waving a short staff and chanting an unknown ritual song, with thousands of eyes fixed on Liang Qu, anticipating his ascent to the altar.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu momentarily doubted the reality of what he saw, but the next moment, a dark figure suddenly leaped out from behind the wall, its sharp claws tearing through the green bricks, and the dense crowd below.</p><p></p><p>The children in the crowd, looking around, saw the eerie and terrifying creature and burst into loud cries.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding people glared angrily, and the mother of the child covered his mouth apologetically, but as she glanced in the direction the child was looking, she too was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Piercing screams echoed.</p><p></p><p>It's not an illusion!!!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat!!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the roar drowned out everything.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words were spoken, more and more people saw the mountain demon on the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>News of the mountain demon's appearance had already spread from Pingyang Town to Yixing City, and there were even posters with its portrait, warning people to be cautious. In recent days, fewer people from Yixing City had gone to Pingyang Town.</p><p></p><p>That cracked, tanned skin, there was no mistaking it!</p><p></p><p>A mountain demon capable of killing martial artists!</p><p></p><p>Screams erupted one after another, and the once orderly crowd instantly descended into chaos, with cries and wails echoing endlessly, as there was nowhere to escape with the water in front of them, and some even jumped into the water! It was winter!</p><p></p><p>The elders stood up, seeing the evil appearance of the mountain demon, and shouted loudly, trying to organize the order.</p><p></p><p>The mountain demon on the eaves, startled, leaped towards the crowd, about to pounce on a woman, when a fist-sized stone ball came whistling through the air, precisely striking the mountain demon's face, sending it flying and shattering it into pieces before it hit the ground.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu pushed against the flow of the crowd, his hand trembling, with blood trickling from the base of his ulna.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the stone lion behind him had its fangs completely shattered, and the stone ball in its mouth had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Come this way!!"</p><p></p><p>The voice wave was sent against the wind, momentarily overpowering the screams of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Like a large flag raised on flat ground, it guided the chaotic crowd towards him.</p><p></p><p>The woman who had not been pounced on was terrified and fell to the ground, and the man beside her quickly pulled her up, the two of them crawling and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>The elders were equally frightened, throwing away their canes and running away, with only Chen Zhaoan and a few others quickly coming forward to comfort the people and guide them into the nearby mansion for refuge.</p><p></p><p>The area under the eaves where the mountain demon had lurked was soon cleared, and the mountain demon lying on the ground shook its head and stood up again.</p><p></p><p>The powerful stone ball had not caused it any harm at all.</p><p></p><p>With its inverted joints, thin limbs, sharp claws, and emaciated form, its cracked skin like the bark of a withered tree, its yellowish pupils the color of the pus from a festering wound, it fixed its gaze on Liang Qu, who had attacked it.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the inverted joints in its lower limbs, the mountain demon's other limbs were not much different from a human's, but this only made it more eerie.</p><p></p><p>Seeing it with his own eyes, it was much more terrifying than the illustrations in the book! Liang Qu's heart was pounding, and he didn't know where his courage came from to step forward, but now that the arrow was on the string, he had no choice but to release it, as the mountain demon had already set its sights on him.</p><p></p><p>A small mountain demon or a large one? It didn't seem small, but the one in front of him was about the same height as him, and mountain demons don't grow that fast, but it couldn't be a large one either, as a large mountain demon capable of killing two-level martial artists couldn't have been knocked away by his single stone ball.</p><p></p><p>Could it be a third type of mountain demon?</p><p></p><p>That would explain why it appeared in Yixing City, as it didn't have to travel the more than ten li from Pingyang Town. It was already here!</p><p></p><p>Damn, where did all these mountain demons come from? Are they being bred and wholesaled? Liang Qu's thoughts raced, and he even vaguely guessed the reason for this mountain demon's appearance.</p><p></p><p>The thick scent of blood in the air, combined with the gathered crowd, had successfully attracted the mountain demon.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Worshipping the River God, worshipping the River God.</p><p></p><p>The River God did not come, but the Mountain Demon came! Liang Qu was furious, his teeth itching.</p><p></p><p>On the wharf, the shamans and priests had all disappeared. The villagers hid inside their houses, crouching in the alleys, their homes already packed with people, a thick wall of people surrounding the outside, daring not to move, afraid of attracting the attention of the evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Within a radius of dozens of meters, only the empty sacrificial altar remained, with the three large sacrificial animals hanging bloodied beside it.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Demon was not lacking in intelligence, seeming to have realized that Liang Qu posed a threat to it. The two parties faced off, neither making a move.</p><p></p><p>Stared at by the yellowed vertical pupils, Liang Qu felt as if a snake was coiled around his back, silently watching.</p><p></p><p>He felt his joints gradually becoming weak, but he dared not break the silence of the standoff.</p><p></p><p>The blood had gathered at the protrusion of his ulna, flowing down his middle finger, feeling a little itchy.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's fingers trembled slightly, the blood droplet falling and rolling on the bluestone, covered in dust but not breaking.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the blood droplet burst.</p><p></p><p>"A-Shui, we're here to help you!"</p><p></p><p>No good!</p><p></p><p>"Don't!" </p><p></p><p>Recognizing the voices of Li Libo and Chen Jiezhang, Liang Qu was greatly alarmed, and immediately saw the Mountain Demon take a step forward, then disappear!</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu covered his head with his hands, the Mountain Demon's bony fingers scratching against his tungsten alloy bracers, sparks flying, a huge force striking him and sending him flying several meters away.</p><p></p><p>Kicking against the bluestone, he slid sideways, the stone slabs cracked, and another evil wind attacked from the left. Liang Qu barely protected his neck, feeling the sharp claws scrape across his forearm armor, stabbing down into his abdomen, but unable to penetrate.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Demon's claws sank into the bear fur coat, but were blocked by the ox-hide belt, unable to pierce through!</p><p></p><p>Opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu's blood courage was ignited, he rolled up the coat with his hand, swung his arm, wrapping the coat around the demon's hand, then his right fist thundered towards the demon's face.</p><p></p><p>As he struck, he already felt the powerful wind rushing towards his chest, the demon's other hand claw-like, like a steel knife, carrying a piercing chill.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Liang Qu roared, half-turning his body to avoid the vital area, his movements not slowing in the slightest, slamming his fist down on the demon's head.</p><p></p><p>The fist hit the demon's face, as if striking granite.</p><p></p><p>The claws had penetrated halfway through the coat, but were blocked by the ribs, the white robe stained red with blood.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain stimulated his brain, but Liang Qu did not flinch.</p><p></p><p>The veins on his forehead throbbed, his face contorted, yet he still had the strength to tighten his left arm!</p><p></p><p>The veins on his forearm bulged, twisting like snakes, the huge violence concentrated there, strangling the demon's right arm while his left palm transformed into a vicious snake's mouth, forcibly twisting out a segment, firmly clamping onto the demon's hand on his chest!</p><p></p><p>He had actually pinned down both the demon's arms with a single arm! His right fists rained down on the demon's face like a barrage!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The fearless and courageous spirit moved the villagers, the fear accompanying each punch dissipating like clouds, almost wanting to shout.</p><p></p><p>The water centipede lurking on Liang Qu's wrist seized the opportunity to climb onto the demon's arm, opening its mouth to bite into the gap in the brown skin.</p><p></p><p>Scarlet blood oozed from the centipede's mouth, the defense breached! With one strike, A-Wei injected all its venom, quickly retreating back into the sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The venom permeating its body, the Mountain Demon sensed the mortal threat, its legs forcefully kicking Liang Qu in the chest.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qu took the full force of the blow, his chest as if struck by a heavy hammer, the sound of his sternum and ribs almost shattering, his breathing labored and frightening, nearly collapsing on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps came from behind, he dared not look back, but saw two figures passing by his side, raising sharp knives to slash at the demon.</p><p></p><p>The knives were as if striking metal, the two butchering knives simultaneously chipping off two notches.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain Demon!</p><p></p><p>Resembling a human form, its skin brown like a withered tree.</p><p></p><p>Blades and spears could not penetrate!

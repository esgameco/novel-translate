        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's not too much, nor too little to say.</p><p></p><p>Under his command, the legion of elves can easily handle ten groups of 'five thousand' in a single day of hunting.</p><p></p><p>But from another perspective, these energy crystals can be used to train a full hundred elf archers or elf swordsmen, so it's not right to call it little.</p><p></p><p>"Using five thousand energy crystals to learn a royal-tier magic spell can save me at least two weeks of time..."</p><p></p><p>"It does seem worth it."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it will enhance my own strength."</p><p></p><p>"When I become more powerful, I can kill even more monsters."</p><p></p><p>"In the end, I can earn back these energy crystals."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Lin Yi summoned a female elf huntress who was guarding nearby, and asked, "How long has the elf legion been out hunting?"</p><p></p><p>The elf huntress respectfully replied, "Your Majesty, they have been out for nearly two hours."</p><p></p><p>"That should be enough!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi nodded and ordered, "Go bring back the energy crystals the elf legion has harvested, I have use for them!"</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Elf King!" </p><p></p><p>The elf huntress mounted a swift panther and quickly headed towards the ruins outside the plaza. Over a dozen other elf huntresses accompanied her, dispersing in different directions of the ruined relics.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, the group of elf huntresses returned one by one, handing Lin Yi leather pouches filled with energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>After counting, the total number of energy crystals amounted to over 23,000.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was somewhat surprised by this bountiful harvest in just two hours.</p><p></p><p>"Although the elf legion has expanded to over two thousand strong..."</p><p></p><p>"To obtain so many energy crystals, they must have slain tens of thousands of demonic monsters."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the number of monsters in the ruins has also been rapidly increasing?"</p><p></p><p>During the day, there were not many undead creatures in the wilderness. </p><p></p><p>This was because the inner city ruins had not yet seen the emergence of undead strongholds.</p><p></p><p>But on the outer city side, large numbers of undead could be seen near various factional strongholds, no longer slumbering underground.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty," an elf huntress reported, "The war last night seems to have disturbed the rat swarms living in the underground world. This morning, a large number of marsh giant rats have appeared on the surface world."</p><p></p><p>"They are swarming amidst the ruins in astounding numbers."</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Lin Yi suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of rat swarms, this was normal.</p><p></p><p>The most numerous demonic monsters in the ancient elf city ruins were the marsh giant rats, even more than the vampire mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>About two months ago, he had witnessed a live broadcast of a rat tide sweeping through the ruins, using the consciousness of the ancient tree - it was truly a spectacular sight.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi told the elf huntress, "Order the huntresses to set up some magical traps around the plaza, to deal with the potential rat disaster."</p><p></p><p>Being prepared in advance is not a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>Just need to make sure to clear the surrounding ruins, so that stray monsters don't accidentally trigger the magical traps, causing overkill.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Your Majesty!" The elf huntress respectfully acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>After she left, Lin Yi continued to sit cross-legged under the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>"System, consume energy crystals to learn the Fire Dragon's Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Fire Dragon's Roar was a royal-tier magic spell recorded in the magic tome.</p><p>It was a group attack type of magic skill.</p><p></p><p>【Received】 - The system responded.</p><p></p><p>Having money makes things easy.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the system received the payment, it directly transmitted all the arcane knowledge of the 【Fire Dragon's Roar】 into Lin Yi's consciousness sea, just like data transfer.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi didn't need to do anything, just wait patiently.</p><p></p><p>About a minute later, the transfer was complete.</p><p></p><p>—【Congratulations host, you have perfectly mastered the Fire Dragon's Roar magic skill.】</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately focused his mind, recalling the arcane principles of the Fire Dragon's Roar in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a gigantic dragon engulfed in scorching flames emerged in his mental landscape.</p><p></p><p>The fire dragon was of massive size, with four...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Feet, double wings, a bloated abdomen, and a long dragon tail. It looked like a winged lizard.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yi's control, the fire giant dragon suddenly disintegrated into countless magical runes, and then re-gathered, transforming into an extremely majestic fire divine dragon.</p><p></p><p>This was the perfect mastery of magic.</p><p></p><p>He could manipulate all the magical runes that made up the roar of the fire dragon as easily as moving his own arm.</p><p></p><p>As long as he linked those magical runes together, no matter what the final form was, it would still be the roar of the fire dragon, and its power would not be diminished at all.</p><p></p><p>After all, only the form had changed. The magical runes within had not been altered.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then went to the ruins outside the square to conduct a test.</p><p></p><p>He waved his magic wand, and a fire divine dragon instantly flew out. It then rapidly expanded in midair, growing to over 20 meters in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The huge fire divine dragon flew straight towards a building ruin hundreds of meters away. Countless sparks fell along the way, igniting a fire path several meters wide.</p><p></p><p>At the target location, the fire divine dragon crashed into the building ruins, accompanied by a tremendous roar. Scorching flames surged in all directions, turning the area within a 200-meter radius into a sea of fire.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the sea of fire extinguished. The building ruins within the area had all been reduced to ashes, and even some iron objects had been melted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was a crater nearly 100 meters in diameter at the center.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is a king-level magic. Its power is truly formidable!" Lin Yi exclaimed with delight.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Fire Dragon Roar magic had exceeded his expectations. Moreover, it was an area-of-effect spell, with a devastatingly large range of destruction.</p><p></p><p>Once deployed on the battlefield, the effect would be truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, the mana consumption of the Fire Dragon Roar is not high."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi didn't know if it was because he was a Sun Elf, or if all other mages were the same, but for him, continuously casting 20 Fire Dragon Roars was not a problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the destruction caused by the Fire Dragon Roar in the distance, Lin Yi felt increasingly satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"This is what a qualified mage should be like!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, how can one be called a 'battlefield cannon'?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Back in the domain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked at the remaining energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>After learning the Fire Dragon Roar magic, he still had over 18,000 energy crystals left.</p><p></p><p>He did not immediately go to train the elemental troops, but instead checked the level information of the various buildings in the domain.</p><p></p><p>The Life Tree was at the advanced level, requiring 100,000 energy crystals to upgrade.</p><p>The War Ancient Tree was at the intermediate level, requiring 50,000 energy crystals to upgrade.</p><p>The Mana Spring was at the low level, requiring 1,000 energy crystals to upgrade.</p><p>The Divine Blessing Temple was at the low level, requiring 10,000 energy crystals to upgrade.</p><p></p><p>"The Life Tree and War Ancient Tree can be excluded first."</p><p>"The Divine Blessing Temple can also be excluded, as upgrading it won't give me the money to strengthen the troops."</p><p>"Then I'll just upgrade the Mana Spring."</p><p></p><p>"The higher the level of the Mana Spring, the purer and more effective the elemental spring water it produces. Once it reaches the top level, it can even condense the Holy Water of Life, which can revive the original body of the ancient tree!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then summoned a group of elf huntresses who were stationed in the domain.</p><p>He instructed them to make wooden buckets and then drain the elemental spring water from the Mana Spring.</p><p></p><p>After completing this, Lin Yi consumed 1,000 energy crystals to upgrade the Mana Spring to the intermediate level.</p><p></p><p>After the upgrade, the Mana Spring not only emanated a more abundant aura of life and nature, but its scale had also expanded several times, allowing it to hold more elemental spring water.</p><p></p><p>Looking back into the ancient well, the spring water had already refilled.</p><p></p><p>"Just as I expected."</p><p>"It's a good thing I drained it in advance, otherwise it would have been a waste."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked at the elf huntresses behind him and said, "Continue draining."</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Elf King!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One good thing is that nurturing the little sprites does not consume resources, and it is only when training them into sprite troops that a large amount of energy crystals are required.</p><p></p><p>"The level of the Tree of Life has reached the intermediate level."</p><p></p><p>"Upgrading to the advanced level requires the consumption of a full 10,000 energy crystals."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took a look at the remaining energy crystals, which were just over 1,100.</p><p></p><p>This amount of energy crystals is obviously not enough to continue upgrading the level of the Tree of Life, but it can be used to train the sprite troops.</p><p></p><p>He immediately went to the base of the ancient war tree again.</p><p></p><p>He trained 22 sprite troops at once, of which 10 were sprite swordsmen, and the rest were all sprite archers, consuming a total of 1,100 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were sprite swordsmen or sprite archers, they were all adult great sprites.</p><p></p><p>The former wore exquisite metal armor and wielded long, sharp sprite swords.</p><p></p><p>The latter wore sexy leather armor and shorts, revealing a pair of straight and snow-white long legs. They had quivers on their backs and held sprite longbows in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Each sprite was fully armed and exuded a magical aura.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that... </p><p></p><p>All these sprites were female, without a single male.</p><p></p><p>They each had exquisite and pretty faces, as well as perfectly tall and slender figures.</p><p></p><p>Sprites are a rare intelligent race that can develop their clan without having to combine with the opposite sex. All sprites are nurtured from the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>They are born as sprite balls and grow into great sprites when they mature.</p><p></p><p>They have the innate appearance and physical structure of females.</p><p></p><p>In the entire sprite clan, the only male sprites are the most noble sun sprites.</p><p></p><p>The sun sprite king who founded the Sprite Empire in the past was a male sprite.</p><p></p><p>Now, many years later, Lin Yi has become the second one.</p><p></p><p>This is why the ancient tree said that Lin Yi is destined to become the Sprite King.</p><p></p><p>There can be many Sprite Queens, but there is only one Sprite King.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi is born to be the material for the Sprite King!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Praise to you, the great Sprite King Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The heroic sprites knelt on one knee before Lin Yi, their exquisitely beautiful faces filled with adoration and respect for him.</p><p></p><p>The sun sprite aura emanating from Lin Yi made them feel boundless awe.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, nearly a hundred small sprite balls were flying around the Tree of Life, conveying their excitement and envy. They too eagerly await the day when they will be "trained" into great sprites to serve the Sprite King Majesty.</p><p></p><p>"Rise," Lin Yi gestured with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this group of fully armed great sprites, his mood was also very good.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was no longer a lonely person.</p><p></p><p>He then checked the information of these sprite troops.</p><p></p><p>[Sprite Swordsmen]</p><p>[Level: 6th Tier]</p><p>[Innate Abilities: Heavy Slash, Agility]</p><p>[Information: Sprite Swordsmen possess extremely rich combat experience and have mastered superb sword techniques. Moreover, the sprite swords in their hands can cut through iron like mud, being extremely sharp.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Heavy Slash: Damage is doubled when striking with full force.]</p><p>[Agility: Highly nimble and agile in combat, with a certain probability of perfectly evading enemy attacks.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Sprite Archers]</p><p>[Level: 6th Tier]</p><p>[Innate Abilities: Powerful Shot, Long-range]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Elven Archers are renowned marksmen, each possessing the ability to hit their targets with unerring accuracy, even the swiftest of birds would find it difficult to evade their arrows.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Powerful Strike: Greatly enhances the power of the arrows.]</p><p>[Long Range: Significantly increases the attack range.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The initial job level is sixth-tier, which is quite high."</p><p>"Advancing one more level, and they will enter the ranks of the advanced professions."</p><p></p><p>From first to ninth tier, those of the third tier and below are considered low-level professions, fourth to sixth tier are mid-level professions, and seventh to ninth tier are high-level professions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi is currently an eighth-tier high-level mage.</p><p></p><p>In addition to their exceptionally high initial levels, these Elven Knights and Elven Archers each possess two innate talents, making their combat capabilities even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>The 1,100 energy crystals spent were indeed worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, he now only has a few dozen energy crystals left. If he had enough energy crystals, he would have trained all the other small elves into Elven troops as well.</p><p></p><p>"There are still 90 small elves left."</p><p>"Training all of them into Elven troops would require the consumption of over 4,000 energy crystals."</p><p>"Moreover, tomorrow the Life Tree will be able to birth another 100 small elves. Calculating it all, it would take nearly 10,000 energy crystals to train them all into Elven troops."</p><p>"From now on, I'll need to redouble my efforts!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a system notification once again appeared in Lin Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>[New mission issuedâ€”]</p><p>[Mission content: Clear the Elven Ancient City Ruins, defeat 1,000 monsters of level 5 or above, including but not limited to beasts.]</p><p>[Mission reward: Unlock the divine-granted palace building.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was startled.</p><p>He was not surprised by the appearance of the new mission, but rather by the significant increase in its difficulty.</p><p></p><p>"1,000 monsters, all of which must be level 5 or above, this mission is no easy feat."</p><p>Earlier that day, he had killed thousands of monsters, including vampire mosquitoes. But the mid-level monsters of level 5 were only in the double digits.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that killing 1,000 of these high-level monsters was no simple task. </p><p>The difficulty did not lie in the killing itself, but in finding them.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins he had explored so far, the vast majority of the monsters were low-level.</p><p>Mid-level monsters were extremely rare, and he had not yet encountered any high-level monsters.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what the divine-granted palace is used for..."</p><p>Just as Lin Yi was about to inquire the system, he sensed a surge of malevolent magical power coming from the northeast of the plaza. Raising his gaze, he saw a large number of green flames flickering in the darkness, like a dense swarm of ghostly fires.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Elven King, those are undead creatures!" said an Elven Archer.</p><p>Lin Yi nodded.</p><p>The area where the undead creatures appeared was along the path he had taken to return to his domain.</p><p>Clearly, they had been attracted by his presence.</p><p></p><p>"Relay my orders, prepare for battle!"</p><p>"As you command, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The Elven troops quickly assembled. </p><p>Ten Elven Knights in the front, twelve Elven Archers in the rear.</p><p>Their formation was orderly, their gazes sharp, and a sense of ruthlessness could be seen on their delicate faces.</p><p>No wonder they were considered the elite!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

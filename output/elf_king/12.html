        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked at the magic book in his hand, and his eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>The system actually had such an amazing function? Repairing items, it may not seem as miraculous as building strongholds, summoning things out of thin air, or training troops, but its help to Lin Yi was still unimaginably great.</p><p></p><p>To exaggerate a bit.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yi obtained a fragment of a divine artifact, wouldn't he be able to acquire the complete divine artifact after the system's repair?</p><p></p><p>This ability is almost on par with the legendary time reversal.</p><p></p><p>And what Lin Yi had to pay was just some energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>"System."</p><p></p><p>"How many energy crystals are needed to repair this magic book?" Lin Yi asked.</p><p></p><p>The system quickly replied, requiring ten thousand energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>"That's not a small amount either."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi frowned.</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand energy crystals could train a whole two hundred elven swordsmen or elven archers.</p><p></p><p>"However, this cost is only a bit large for my current self."</p><p></p><p>"Once my army of troops expands, I believe these energy crystals will be like a light drizzle."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then stored the magic book he was about to discard into his spatial belt, and then went to the base of the ancient war tree to start training the elven troops.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before hundreds of elven troops were trained.</p><p></p><p>The total exceeded four hundred people.</p><p></p><p>Consuming over twenty thousand energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>Almost simultaneously, a prompt from the system sounded in Lin Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations host, the number of combat troops under your command has reached one thousand.]</p><p></p><p>[You have completed Task 1]</p><p></p><p>[You have successfully unlocked the stronghold building - Mana Spring]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Mana Spring: A building that can condense elven spring water, or even holy water of life.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[New task opened]</p><p></p><p>[Task content: Possess ten thousand combat troops.]</p><p></p><p>[Task reward: Host level upgrade by one level (not exceeding the peak of the extraordinary).]</p><p></p><p>[Current task progress: 1000/10000]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"A new task."</p><p></p><p>"Have ten thousand troops?!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had reason to suspect that even clearing the entire inner city ruins might not be enough to train so many troops.</p><p></p><p>After all, the number of magical beasts and monsters is limited.</p><p></p><p>Unless he can seize the opportunity to hunt undead creatures at night.</p><p></p><p>Unlike magical beasts and monsters, undead creatures can "regenerate".</p><p></p><p>As long as the evil and dark forces underground have not been completely eliminated, there will be an almost endless supply of undead creatures for him to hunt.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite is that his strength must be strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Just like now.</p><p></p><p>Although he already has a thousand elven troops under his command, he dares not recklessly expand the hunting area.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many high-level undead are hiding in the darkness?</p><p></p><p>If he encounters a powerful one, it would not be a hunt, but him being hunted instead.</p><p></p><p>"As I continue to develop, the strength of my domain will also become stronger and stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Ten thousand troops may seem like a lot, but it's not an unreachable goal!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi didn't think much more about it.</p><p></p><p>He found an empty space nearby and built the newly unlocked building [Mana Spring], consuming one thousand energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, an ancient well appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>The well's diameter was about three meters.</p><p></p><p>The well was already filled with clear, bottomless well water, and it emanated a powerful life and natural aura.</p><p></p><p>[Mana Spring]</p><p></p><p>[Building information: A special stronghold building of the elven camp.]</p><p></p><p>[Level: Low]</p><p></p><p>[It can currently produce low-level elven spring water, and the spring water will overflow in three days.]</p><p></p><p>[Upgrade requirement: One thousand energy crystals]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[Crystal]</p><p></p><p>[Special Prompt: Upgrading the Mana Spring's level can obtain higher purity Elemental Spring Water. When the building reaches max level, you can condense the Sacred Water of Life.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The overflow period is three days."</p><p></p><p>"So if I drain the Mana Spring, it will refill in three days?"</p><p></p><p>--[Yes, Host. The Mana Spring will continuously produce Elemental Spring Water until it is full.]</p><p></p><p>In other words, if the entire well is full and Lin Yi does not use the Elemental Spring Water, no new Elemental Spring Water will be produced.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi naturally would not do such a wasteful and shameful thing.</p><p></p><p>He immediately summoned his subordinate Elementals and had them use the small Elementals' collected wood to build wooden barrels on site.</p><p></p><p>In any case, drain it first and then deal with it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Yi said to his Elemental subordinates, "This is a very magical ancient well that can currently produce Elemental Spring Water."</p><p></p><p>"Elemental Spring Water can restore your consumed mana and heal your injuries."</p><p></p><p>"You must remember to bring a cup or two when you go out hunting, in case of need."</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Elemental King Majesty!" </p><p></p><p>The Elementals excitedly performed obeisance.</p><p></p><p>Even if Lin Yi didn't explain, they knew what Elemental Spring Water was.</p><p></p><p>That was a specialty of their Elemental clan.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the functions Lin Yi described, Elemental Spring Water can also relieve hunger, with a cup lasting a day. Furthermore, long-term drinking of Elemental Spring Water can also enhance their own mana, allowing them to break through levels faster.</p><p></p><p>The even more advanced Sacred Water of Life is a divine item for level breakthroughs. </p><p></p><p>It is rumored that when Necromancers want to reincarnate as Liches, the Elemental clan's Sacred Water of Life is an essential item. Although Elemental Spring Water also has effects, the amount needs to be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Elementals had built one large wooden barrel after another.</p><p></p><p>Following Lin Yi's instructions, the Elementals completely drained the Mana Spring, filling dozens of large wooden barrels.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a well three meters in diameter and over ten meters deep.</p><p></p><p>The volume was naturally not small.</p><p></p><p>All the large wooden barrels were separately sealed by the Elementals using magic, to the greatest extent possible to ensure that the mana of the Elemental Spring Water within did not leak out. In simple terms, it was to extend the shelf life.</p><p></p><p>"Praise the Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"These Elemental Spring Waters are enough for us to drink for a month!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Elementals' low murmurs, Lin Yi couldn't help but think to himself, "A thousand Elementals can drink for a month, so wouldn't ten thousand Elementals only last three days?"</p><p></p><p>"It seems that when the Energy Crystals are abundant, I also need to continue upgrading the Mana Spring's level."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There's no hurry to upgrade the Mana Spring's level.</p><p></p><p>The urgent task is to upgrade the [War Ancient Tree], unlocking more powerful troop types.</p><p></p><p>The War Ancient Tree is currently a low-level building, and upgrading it to the intermediate level requires consuming five thousand Energy Crystals, which Lin Yi had no hesitation in providing with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>With money, things are easy to do.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the tree trunk of the War Ancient Tree began to emit dazzling brilliance.</p><p></p><p>The entire tree trunk was also visibly growing taller.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the upgrade was complete.</p><p></p><p>The War Ancient Tree had grown to a hundred meters tall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi hurriedly opened its building information for inspection.</p><p></p><p>[War Ancient Tree]</p><p></p><p>[Building Information: The troop profession building of the Elemental Camp.]</p><p></p><p>[Level: Intermediate]</p><p></p><p>[Unlocked Elemental Professions: Elemental Archer, Elemental Swordsman, Elemental Huntress, Elemental Mage]</p><p></p><p>[Upgrade Requirement: Fifty thousand Energy Crystals]</p><p></p><p>[Special Prompt: Upgrading the War Ancient Tree's level can unlock more Elemental Camp professions.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Elemental Huntress: Training Requirement - Five hundred Energy Crystals, one Small Elemental]</p><p></p><p>[Elemental Mage: Training Requirement - Three hundred Energy Crystals, one Small Elemental]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

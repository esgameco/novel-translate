            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You can complete the second one first."</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yi's strength, hunting mid-tier magical beasts was very simple.</p><p></p><p>However, he needed to be a bit faster.</p><p></p><p>It was now afternoon, and in a few hours, night would fall.</p><p></p><p>Once night came, the magical beasts in the wilderness would enter a frenzied state, with their strength doubled. Additionally, when the ancient trees died, the life protection barrier would collapse, and there was a high chance of magical beast monsters and undead creatures attacking at night.</p><p></p><p>He needed to complete the second task as soon as possible to unlock the [Ancient War Tree].</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would be able to train combat-type spirit troops to guard the territory with him.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Lin Yi opened the panel of the [Tree of Life] building and nurtured ten small spirits.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the small spirits was quite peculiar - they were light balls the size of a soccer ball, emanating the brilliance of life and nature.</p><p></p><p>The small spirits could not speak, but they possessed wisdom and consciousness.</p><p></p><p>After being nurtured from the Tree of Life, they surrounded Lin Yi, flying around him while conveying a sense of warmth and happiness.</p><p></p><p>On Lin Yi, they sensed the noble aura of a sun spirit.</p><p></p><p>This made them want to get close to him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi picked up one of the small spirits.</p><p></p><p>It felt smooth, soft, and like a glowing cotton candy.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Small Spirit]</p><p>[Faction: Elves]</p><p>[Level: Tier 3]</p><p>[Talent: Resource Gathering]</p><p>[Troop Information: Small spirits are non-combat units and the initial state of elves. To train a large-scale elf army, you need to have a sufficient number of small spirits.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Resource Gathering: Small spirits can gather resources needed for your territory.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked around, and everywhere were the ruins of collapsed ancient relics. </p><p></p><p>Apart from many ancient trees, he did not find any other useful resources to collect, such as energy crystal mines.</p><p></p><p>He instructed the small spirits not to wander off and to stay obediently guarding the territory and the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>Then, he left the square and entered the ruin of the ancient relic to search for hidden magical beast monsters.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lin Yi arrived at a street near the square.</p><p></p><p>The buildings on both sides of the street had also become ruins, with green vines crawling over the rotten wood and broken stones.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding environment was eerily quiet.</p><p></p><p>He could only hear the sound of his footsteps on the rotten wood as he walked forward.</p><p></p><p>In the past, with the support of the ancient trees, Lin Yi had explored these areas many times without encountering any danger, but now he dared not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a green magical staff appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This was a staff crafted for Lin Yi by the ancient tree using its own branch, with a royal-tier equipment level.</p><p></p><p>In the Dark Continent, the job levels ranged from Tier 1 to Tier 9, then Royal, Transcendent, Saint, Demigod, and True God. The equipment levels were the same.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Royal-tier equipment was already quite good.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi waved the magical staff in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a red glow burst forth around him, quickly forming a fiery red shield.</p><p></p><p>This was a fire magic spell - Flame Shield.</p><p></p><p>The corresponding job level was Tier 4 to Tier 6, which was considered mid-level magic.</p><p></p><p>In addition to Flame Shield, Lin Yi also mastered three other fire magic spells: Fireball, Fire Wall, and Flame Spear.</p><p></p><p>During the few months since he arrived in this world, he had spent most of his time in meditation and cultivation, improving his own level.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have been able to master even more magic skills.</p><p></p><p>Among these four spells, Flame Spear had the highest level and strongest power, reaching the level of advanced magic. It was an extremely powerful single-target attack spell.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A few kilometers away from the central square, Lin Yi suddenly heard a strange sound.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As he looked in the direction of the sound, he saw several giant black rats the size of a hundred meters searching for food in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>"Swamp giant rats!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi casually threw a fireball over.</p><p></p><p>The fireball was about one meter in diameter, burning with azure blue flames.</p><p></p><p>The fireball soon exploded at the target location, directly igniting an area dozens of meters in radius, and the several swamp giant rats of varying sizes were instantly reduced to charcoal.</p><p></p><p>"Swamp giant rats are low-level magical beasts."</p><p></p><p>"There are countless numbers of them in the Forgotten Marsh."</p><p></p><p>"A few of them are nothing, but if they form a rat tide, that would be terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had witnessed the magnificent scene of a rat tide sweeping across the land before.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yi suddenly felt a surge of energy within him, gradually increasing his mana.</p><p></p><p>"Is this... killing monsters to gain experience?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi inquired the system and received an affirmative response.</p><p></p><p>He could rapidly increase his own level by killing enemies and obtaining special energy.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, if he had troops under his command, when his troops killed enemies, he could also share a portion of the special energy, which was the privilege of a lord.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically speaking, the more troops a lord has, the more enemies they can kill, the faster the lord's level will grow.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>"I can level up just by killing enemies, no need for meditation anymore."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi grinned.</p><p></p><p>He then went to the area where the swamp giant rats had been killed.</p><p></p><p>The azure blue flames were still burning fiercely there, but when Lin Yi approached, the flames automatically parted, not harming him at all.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the flames had a consciousness, but rather that Lin Yi was immune to fire elements.</p><p></p><p>Any fire-based magic, whether man-made or from nature, could not harm him. This was an innate talent of the Sun Elves.</p><p></p><p>Beside the charred giant rat corpses, Lin Yi found several crystal-like green objects.</p><p></p><p>--[Energy Crystals: An indispensable resource for domain development, can be obtained by killing enemies and mining veins.]</p><p></p><p>"Upgrading the Life Tree requires one thousand Energy Crystals."</p><p></p><p>"Judging by this drop rate, it may not take long to gather them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi continued on his way.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later, Lin Yi had already killed nearly a hundred magical beasts, mostly swamp giant rats, with only three beasts being stone pythons hidden in the rubble.</p><p></p><p>Stone pythons were mid-level magical beasts. Adult stone pythons were about four meters long and generally at the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had no trouble dealing with the three stone pythons, taking them down with a single fireball.</p><p></p><p>"Out of the nearly hundred magical beasts, only sixteen have reached the third level."</p><p></p><p>"I still need to keep working hard!"</p><p></p><p>"But I've already collected more than seventy Energy Crystals, the collection speed is not bad."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lin Yi entered a densely forested area.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of thousands of years, many areas of the Elven Ancient City had been covered by similar forests, with countless ancient trees reaching hundreds of meters high, and spawning a large number of magical beast monsters.</p><p></p><p>"With so many towering ancient trees, I wonder if there are any tree people."</p><p></p><p>"Probably not."</p><p></p><p>"If there were, the old trees would have summoned them long ago."</p><p></p><p>Tree people were the guardians of the elves, natural allies.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Yi had tree people by his side, it would greatly enhance his personal safety and the speed of hunting magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>After entering the forest, Lin Yi used Fireball to clear a path.</p><p></p><p>He continued killing the hidden magical beasts in the forest while heading deeper into the woods.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the ruins outside, the magical beasts in the forest were clearly more numerous.</p><p></p><p>Hunting here could help him complete the task of unlocking [Ancient War Tree] faster.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

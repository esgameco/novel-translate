        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi consumed another 10,000 energy crystals to upgrade the Mana Spring to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>The advanced Mana Spring can condense high-purity Elemental Spring Water.</p><p></p><p>Its effects are over 10 times stronger than the low-level Elemental Spring Water.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Lin Yi instructed the elves to drain the Elemental Spring Water that had "refreshed" in the Mana Spring, because a full Mana Spring will not condense Elemental Spring Water.</p><p></p><p>After draining it, the Elemental Spring Water will continuously condense.</p><p></p><p>In no time, hundreds of super-large wooden barrels had accumulated on the square.</p><p></p><p>Each wooden barrel was filled to the brim with Elemental Spring Water.</p><p></p><p>"With so much Elemental Spring Water, not only a thousand elves, even ten thousand elves can use it for a long time," </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi turned to the elf huntresses and said, "Remember to seal these wooden barrels well to prevent the life and natural magic power contained in the Elemental Spring Water from dissipating."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, rest assured, we will seal them carefully," the elf huntresses respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then checked the construction information of the Mana Spring.</p><p></p><p>[Mana Spring]</p><p>[Construction Information: A special territory building of the Elf Camp.]</p><p>[Level: Advanced]</p><p>[Can currently produce advanced Elemental Spring Water, with a saturation period of 7 days.]</p><p>[Upgrade Requirement: 100,000 energy crystals]</p><p>[Special Reminder: Upgrading the level of the Mana Spring can obtain higher purity Elemental Spring Water. When the building reaches the maximum level, it can condense the Holy Water of Life.]</p><p></p><p>"The saturation period has been extended, which is also normal, after all, the scale of the Mana Spring has expanded many times, and it can accommodate more Elemental Spring Water."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, the territory buildings only have four levels: low, medium, high, and top."</p><p></p><p>"Just need to upgrade one more level, and the Mana Spring will be at the maximum level."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the consumption is a bit large, requiring a full 100,000 energy crystals."</p><p></p><p>"And even if I have 100,000 energy crystals, I should first upgrade the Life Tree to the maximum level..."</p><p></p><p>Although the Holy Water of Life can revive the main body of the old tree and give Lin Yi two life trees that can nurture little elves, the cost-effectiveness is obviously not as high as upgrading this life tree in his own territory.</p><p></p><p>Because when the Life Tree reaches the maximum level, it can nurture 10,000 little elves every day.</p><p></p><p>Even if the two Life Trees both reach the advanced level, they can only nurture a total of 2,000 little elves.</p><p></p><p>The cost-effectiveness of upgrading the Life Tree is naturally higher.</p><p></p><p>"Let's take it one step at a time."</p><p></p><p>"After all, it's just one before the other, no need to rush."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then went to the base of the War Ancient Tree and trained the remaining 7,000-plus energy crystals into elf troops, obtaining a total of more than 100 elf archers and elf swordsmen.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the number of elf troops under his command has reached nearly 2,500.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there was still time, Lin Yi left the territory and entered the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has been promoted to the King Realm, there is almost nothing in the ruins that can threaten him. </p><p></p><p>At least not in the inner city.</p><p></p><p>Even that Zombie King from last night, he could send it to the underworld with just one Fire Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi walked on the weed-covered streets.</p><p></p><p>On both sides of the road were dilapidated building ruins, some of which had completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he did not encounter any magical beasts or monsters, because this area had already been cleared by his elf army.</p><p></p><p>After walking for several kilometers, Lin Yi finally heard the sound of battle.</p><p></p><p>Upon approaching, he found that it was an elf troop in combat.</p><p></p><p>The entire troop consisted of nearly a hundred elves, including swordsmen, archers, mages, and huntresses - all four elf professions were present.</p><p></p><p>Their formation was very strict.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The elven knights were at the front. </p><p></p><p>The elven archers and elven mages were at the back.</p><p></p><p>The elven huntresses rode on swift leopards, patrolling the periphery of the formation, occasionally penetrating the enemy ranks to disrupt their formation.</p><p></p><p>Whenever a large number of enemies flanked the rear of the formation, the elven huntresses would immediately withdraw to join the elven knights in protecting the elven archers and mages at the rear.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi watched for a long time, but never saw any enemies able to break through the battle line of this elven troop.</p><p></p><p>"The elves trained by the system indeed have rich combat experience."</p><p></p><p>"However, there is still one flaw."</p><p></p><p>"That is, the defense is not strong enough."</p><p></p><p>"Among these four elven professions, only the elven knights can be considered a melee troop. Most of the pressure from the enemy is borne by them. Once the defensive line is breached, the elven archers and mages at the rear will be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this problem can be easily solved."</p><p></p><p>"One is to unlock the Ancient Tree, train the Treant Warriors and Forest Giants."</p><p></p><p>"The other is to upgrade the War Ancient Tree and unlock new elven professions..."</p><p></p><p>After watching for a while, Lin Yi bypassed the battlefield and continued to delve deeper into the ruins.</p><p></p><p>The enemies fighting this elven troop were a large group of swamp giant rats.</p><p></p><p>Numbering in the hundreds, not a small force.</p><p></p><p>But their strength was not very strong, mostly low-level monsters, posing no threat to his elves, so he naturally did not need to intervene.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After advancing several hundred meters in the ruins...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a shrill cry sounded overhead.</p><p></p><p>It was a gray-black owl, circling high in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The shrill cry was a warning.</p><p></p><p>It was reporting to Lin Yi that there were enemies nearby.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, soon after, a slight movement came from the ruins of a distant building.</p><p></p><p>Although it was more than 200 meters away, it still could not escape Lin Yi's spiritual perception.</p><p></p><p>The sound was approaching.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a group of plump swamp giant rats appeared in Lin Yi's field of vision.</p><p></p><p>About thirty or so, mostly at the second and third levels.</p><p></p><p>These levels of monster beasts were obviously not a concern for Lin Yi. He casually threw out a fire ball several meters in diameter, instantly annihilating those swamp giant rats.</p><p></p><p>Only three or five swamp giant rats managed to escape the scorching flames, scurrying away in panic.</p><p></p><p>After collecting the energy crystals that burst out, Lin Yi continued to delve deeper.</p><p></p><p>About an hour later, Lin Yi successfully arrived at the area where the lord's manor was located.</p><p></p><p>The original lord's manor was no longer visible, only ruins remained.</p><p></p><p>He knew the location of the lord's manor here because the ancient tree had told him about the history of the ancient city when it was recounting it to him - a momentous battle had taken place here.</p><p></p><p>"A Bone Palace?"</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lin Yi discovered that on the ruins of the lord's manor, a white bone palace stood.</p><p></p><p>The Bone Palace was built from the bones of various creatures, and it was not a small structure.</p><p></p><p>"This Bone Palace must have been built by that Lich King."</p><p></p><p>"But now it is empty and abandoned."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked around, but did not see any signs of the Lich King or the high-level undead, not even any ordinary undead.</p><p></p><p>"They fled so decisively."</p><p></p><p>"They even abandoned their newly built stronghold."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was somewhat admiring of the Lich King's decisiveness, or rather, his caution.</p><p></p><p>He did not participate in last night's battle, and now he has even directly abandoned his lair, disappearing to who knows where.</p><p></p><p>"This guy is too prudent!" </p><p></p><p>"Let me go check if there are any remnants left in the treasury."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

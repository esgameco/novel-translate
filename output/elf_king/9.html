        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ending did not happen unexpectedly.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if it were not for this magic plant having a thick blood volume and possessing massive magical power to contend with Lin Yi's fire magic, it would have been reduced to ashes long ago.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a piercing scream, only a scorched, withered tree remained on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As the victor, Lin Yi simultaneously harvested a large amount of special energy. Not only did it help solidify his Ninth-Tier magical power, but it also propelled him forward on the path towards becoming a Monarch-Tier professional.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then cleaned up the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He collected over 5,000 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>Among them, this magic plant alone had exploded out dozens of energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the energy crystals, Lin Yi also harvested more than 100 magic cores.</p><p></p><p>Magic cores are the byproducts of magical beasts and monsters, hidden within their bodies. However, not all magical beasts possess magic cores - only those that have reached a certain level can condense this kind of thing within their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Magic cores have many uses:</p><p></p><p>They can be embedded into equipment, enhancing the power of the gear.</p><p>They can be ground into powder and used to inscribe magic scrolls.</p><p>In short, they are items of considerable value.</p><p>Lin Yi collected all the magic cores, as he would surely find a use for them in the future.</p><p></p><p>Combined with yesterday's harvest, he now had nearly 300 magic cores in reserve, the majority of which came from mid-level magical beasts, with only a small number from high-level ones.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, Lin Yi used a Fireball spell to completely burn the scorched tree body of the magic plant into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the ashes, he found a glowing green gemstone.</p><p></p><p>About the size of a baby's fist, it emanated an extremely dense life force.</p><p></p><p>This was the magic plant's life essence, containing a massive amount of life magic power - a rare and precious find.</p><p></p><p>Its primary function is to heal injuries. It is said that a life essence of Saint-Tier quality can have effects no less than the Elven race's sacred life water, capable of reviving the dead and restoring flesh to bone.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi collected the life essence, and after a brief rest, he set out again on his monster hunting journey.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As dusk fell, Lin Yi was the first to finish the day's hunting work and return to the domain.</p><p></p><p>Before the darkness enveloped the land, the Elven squads that had gone out also gradually returned.</p><p></p><p>Many Elves had bulging packs made of animal hides on their backs, filled to the brim.</p><p></p><p>"Not having spatial equipment is indeed inconvenient," Lin Yi thought. He should find a way to provide his Elven team with a batch of spatial equipment to store their spoils.</p><p></p><p>He himself had a spatial belt.</p><p></p><p>Two months ago, he had accidentally found it while exploring the inner city ruins. The spatial dimension within the belt was not large, only about two meters square, but it was more than enough to store some energy crystals, magic cores, and other items.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient city ruins of the Elven Empire have weathered thousands of years of time."</p><p></p><p>"Most of the items have already decayed, but some have fortunately been preserved, like the magic book I previously obtained, as well as the magical equipment like this belt I'm wearing."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's intuition told him that when he started to clear out the inner city ruins, he would definitely be able to acquire many good things, especially from the Elven Empire's treasury, the location of which he knew but had not yet visited.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!" </p><p></p><p>The Elven squads gathered and neatly arranged their packs in front of Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of packs, some containing large quantities of energy crystals and magic cores, others filled with the fresh fruits, edible flower petals, and honey that the Elves had collected.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi first counted the number of Elves.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One hundred and ten, not one more, not one less.</p><p></p><p>As of now, there are still relatively few monster threats to the elf squad within the inner city ruins. That level 9 magic plant was an unexpected discovery.</p><p></p><p>Most of the monster creatures are roughly at the same level as those vampire mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>And the elves under his command, the lowest are at level 6.</p><p></p><p>Some elves have even reached level 7, entering the realm of advanced professions.</p><p></p><p>With this level of strength and hunting environment, the safety factor is naturally very high.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also discovered that after a day of hunting, many elves had achieved breakthroughs in their levels. The number of level 7 elves has already exceeded half.</p><p></p><p>There have not yet appeared any level 8 elf troops.</p><p></p><p>But it shouldn't be too far away.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then checked the energy crystals brought back by the elves.</p><p></p><p>The total reached more than 14,000 pieces.</p><p></p><p>Much more than his own harvest.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was just one person.</p><p></p><p>Today, he had harvested nearly 8,000 energy crystals in total, most of them from the vampire mosquito swarm. If not for the contributions of those vampire mosquitoes, his energy crystal harvest would have been cut in half.</p><p></p><p>"Adding it all up, I now have a total of more than 22,300 energy crystals."</p><p></p><p>This amount of energy crystals can directly train more than 400 elf troops.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there are not enough little elves.</p><p></p><p>He currently only has 100 little elves under his command.</p><p></p><p>Even if he waits until after midnight to birth a new batch of little elves, he can only train 200 elf troops.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he needs to continue to upgrade the level of the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Lin Yi immediately went to the base of the Tree of Life and, at the cost of 10,000 energy crystals, upgraded the Tree of Life from intermediate to advanced level.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Tree of Life】</p><p>【Building Information: The Tree of Life is the core building of the elf camp. Before other buildings are destroyed, the Tree of Life is in an invincible state. Its ability is to gestate little elves and revive fallen elf troops.】</p><p>【Level: Advanced, can gestate 1,000 little elves per day】</p><p>【Upgrade Requirement: 100,000 energy crystals】</p><p>【Special Prompt: Upgrading the level of the Tree of Life can increase the number of little elves gestated.】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Tree of Life towering over 200 meters high in front of him, Lin Yi felt very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Gestating 1,000 little elves per day.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as the energy crystals are abundant, he can train 1,000 elf troops every day, directly completing the 【Task One】 issued by the system.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately gestated those 1,000 little elves.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he used the remaining 12,000 energy crystals to train elf troops.</p><p></p><p>Harvesting elf swordsmen and elf archers, a total of 246.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the total number of elf troops under Lin Yi's command has reached more than 350, doubling in size in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Praise you!"</p><p>"The great Elf King, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The more than 200 newly trained elf troops knelt and saluted in front of Lin Yi, each exquisitely beautiful face filled with adoration and reverence for Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Such a large number of elves kneeling and saluting together was quite a grand sight.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Yi was also in a very good mood.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, he may soon be able to clear the inner city and even occupy the entire ancient city ruins.</p><p></p><p>He plans to turn this capital city that once belonged to the Elf Empire into his stronghold in this world.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

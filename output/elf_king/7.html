        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The number of elven troops under Lin Yi's command has grown to 110.</p><p></p><p>Last night, the elven troops killed some undead creatures near the central square, and the energy crystals they harvested were used by Lin Yi to train new elven troops.</p><p></p><p>In addition to troop training...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also birthed 100 young elves from the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>His goal today is to train all 100 of these young elves into elven troops as well.</p><p></p><p>When that is done, the total number of elven troops under his command will exceed 200.</p><p></p><p>Early this morning, the elves went out on a hunting expedition.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi divided the 110 elven troops into 10 small teams, with each team consisting of about 4 elven swordsmen and 7 elven archers.</p><p></p><p>This combination of close-range and long-range fighters is well-suited to handle the monsters lurking in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also set out. </p><p></p><p>His hunting ground for today was still the forest that was not fully cleared yesterday.</p><p></p><p>The forest is teeming with monsters, and the vampire mosquitoes that attacked last night also originated from this forest. Lin Yi plans to find and completely destroy their nest.</p><p></p><p>As a fire mage, Lin Yi greatly enjoys hunting these numerous but weakly-defended monsters. A single burst of flames can incinerate a large area.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving the territory, Lin Yi also assigned a task to the newly birthed young elves - to harvest the ancient trees growing in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>As the number of trained elven troops continues to grow, Lin Yi also needs to consider building houses for them. They can't keep sleeping outdoors.</p><p></p><p>The young elves have a very unique way of collecting wood. In small groups, they surround a target ancient tree and spin around it, causing the tree to disappear at a visible pace, leaving only a smoothly cut tree stump behind. </p><p></p><p>Once the harvesting is mostly done, the young elves will automatically fly back to the territory. They then "summon" the finished wooden materials out of thin air and neatly pile them up in the square.</p><p></p><p>"Their efficiency is truly impressive," Lin Yi couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Deep in the dense forest, raging flames engulf everything around.</p><p></p><p>Even hundred-meter-tall ancient trees are set ablaze, burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi is quite measured in his actions. His sole purpose is to hunt the monsters hiding in the forest, so once the targets are eliminated, he actively controls and extinguishes the burning flames.</p><p></p><p>The ancient trees in the forest can now be used to build residential houses.</p><p></p><p>This forest is vast in area, concealing all kinds of magical beasts and monsters.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi starts from the southern part of the forest, first clearing the outer perimeter of monsters, then gradually delving deeper.</p><p></p><p>By noon, he has already slain over 2,000 monsters, dozens of which are level 5 or above.</p><p></p><p>Checking the progress, Lin Yi sees the total count is nearing 200. Clearly, the other elven teams have also achieved good harvests.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, with more people, the power is greater!" Lin Yi mutters to himself. He then picks some wild fruits and roasted beast meat before continuing his hunting.</p><p></p><p>The elven troops also need to eat. But it's worth noting that elves are vegetarians and do not consume meat.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fresh fruits and honey are the favorites of the elves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Lin Yi is not included, even though he has now become an elf, he cannot change his habit of eating meat. The fresh fruits collected in the forest, he always has an insatiable appetite for them.</p><p></p><p>The food problem of the elf team needs to be solved by themselves for the time being.</p><p></p><p>But the problem is not big.</p><p></p><p>There are a large number of fruit trees growing in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Because this is the ruins of the ancient elf city.</p><p></p><p>Many fruit trees have even grown for hundreds or thousands of years, and the fruits they bear are not only abundant in quantity, but also extremely delicious.</p><p></p><p>In the short term, Lin Yi does not need to worry about the food problem of the elves.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's hunting work is progressing very smoothly.</p><p></p><p>With his eighth-level advanced mage's strength, combined with the magical talent of the sun elf, and the king-grade quality magic wand in his hand, he is completely unmatched in this forest.</p><p></p><p>The occasional encounter with a high-level magical beast is also easily killed by his Flame Spear.</p><p></p><p>After hunting for an unknown period of time, Lin Yi finally heard a familiar buzzing sound.</p><p></p><p>It was the sound of a large number of vampire mosquitoes flapping their wings.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi followed the sound and soon found the lair of the vampire mosquitoes. It was a towering ancient tree, at least two hundred meters high, with huge black mosquito nests hanging on its branches.</p><p></p><p>Around each nest, there were dense swarms of vampire mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>Estimated to be more than ten thousand in total.</p><p></p><p>"If I can deal with this group of vampire mosquitoes, my level will definitely break through to the ninth level!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was extremely delighted, but he did not rush in.</p><p></p><p>Because the ancient tree where the vampire mosquitoes gathered was very strange, with countless drooping branches, and although there was no wind in the forest, those branches were still swaying gently.</p><p></p><p>Within a radius of several hundred meters around the ancient tree, a large amount of white bones were piled up on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi also sensed fluctuations of magical power from this ancient tree.</p><p></p><p>"This is a magical plant!"</p><p></p><p>"The magical power level has reached the ninth level."</p><p></p><p>Compared to magical beasts and monsters, magical plants, these mutated trees, are much rarer. But at the same level, the strength of magical plants is generally higher than that of magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>Their internal magical power reserves far exceed those of magical beasts.</p><p></p><p>Especially this large magical plant in front of him, its magical power is even more colossal.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi did not act rashly. He was evaluating whether he could handle this magical plant with his current strength. As for those vampire mosquitoes, he didn't even pay attention to them.</p><p></p><p>He ignited a fire, burning as many of the low-level magical beast vampire mosquitoes as he could.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi vaguely heard a faint voice.</p><p></p><p>The voice was very soft and intermittent, making it difficult to hear clearly.</p><p></p><p>He released his spiritual consciousness, and the voice immediately became clearer.</p><p></p><p>"Elf, this is the territory of this tree, you must leave immediately, this tree will not trouble you!"</p><p></p><p>"It's that magical plant!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>As if in response to Lin Yi, the swaying amplitude of the drooping branches of the hundreds of meters away magical plant became even greater.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately used his spiritual consciousness to communicate with it: "The entire ruin is the territory of my elf clan, you dared to take root and grow on my clan's land, and you still have the audacity to speak so arrogantly, do you think my elf clan is easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>The magical plant responded: "The elves can no longer dominate this land."</p><p></p><p>"That was in the past, now I am the master of this land!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi raised his magic wand, instantly condensing a huge fireball over two meters in diameter.</p><p></p><p>He planned to test the strength of this magical plant.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were hundreds of meters apart, if he couldn't handle it, he could just retreat.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

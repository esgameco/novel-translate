        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>An Elven Mage, with a training cost of 300 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>An Elven Huntress, with a training cost as high as 500 energy crystals, which is ten times that of an Elven Swordsman and Elven Archer. Can the words "a little expensive" even describe it? However, there must be a reason for the high cost.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the Elven Mage or the Elven Huntress, their strength must be greater than that of the Elven Swordsman and Elven Archer.</p><p></p><p>After all, they are upgraded troop professions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi trained an Elven Mage and an Elven Huntress, and planned to first take a look at their information panels before deciding how to train them specifically.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two beautiful figures appeared before Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>One was wearing a exquisite magic robe, with a refined and elegant demeanor. Her shimmering green hair was draped behind her, her figure tall and slender, her skin as white as snow, and her face stunningly flawless. In her hand, she held a wooden magic staff.</p><p></p><p>The other Elven, her appearance looked much more imposing.</p><p></p><p>She was actually riding on the back of a Swift Panther.</p><p></p><p>The Swift Panther is a high-level magical beast, with extraordinary natural talents and magical abilities.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the training cost is so high.</p><p></p><p>Buying one and getting one free is really worth it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Elven Mage]</p><p>[Level: 8th Tier]</p><p>[Innate Abilities: Enchantment, Wisdom]</p><p>[Information: The Elven Mage is an extremely powerful profession, with the mastery of magical powers that can make enemies on the battlefield shudder.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Enchantment: During combat, can add various magical runes to the magic staff, enhancing the power of magical skills.]</p><p>[Wisdom: Elven Mages who have mastered the mysteries of life and nature can greatly reduce the chanting or charging time when casting magical skills.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Elven Huntress]</p><p>[Level: 9th Tier]</p><p>[Innate Abilities: Swiftness, Hunting Hawk, Magic Trap]</p><p>[Information: As highly professional jungle hunters, Elven Huntresses can harvest the lives of their enemies in the jungle without being noticed. Their trained Hunting Hawks can easily locate the positions of their enemies.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Swiftness: Speed increased by 50% in the jungle.]</p><p>[Hunting Hawk: Can summon an owl to scout the surrounding area.]</p><p>[Magic Trap: The power of the magic traps set by the Elven Huntress will be greatly enhanced.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"They are truly upgraded troop professions!"</p><p></p><p>As for the Elven Mage, there's no need to say more.</p><p></p><p>As a profession that wields AoE skills, their role on the battlefield is self-evident.</p><p>With an 8th Tier level and enhanced magical skills, they can definitely inflict unimaginable pain on their enemies.</p><p></p><p>As for the Elven Huntress, she's even more powerful.</p><p>Her initial level is directly at the 9th Tier, on par with Lin Yi.</p><p>Most importantly, the Elven Huntress's mount, the Swift Panther, is also a 9th Tier magical beast.</p><p>This combination...</p><p>No wonder the training cost is as high as 500 energy crystals.</p><p>Thinking about it carefully, it's really a bargain!</p><p></p><p>"The Elven Huntress can also summon an owl for scouting purposes."</p><p>"Whether it's going out to hunt, searching for monsters, guarding the territory, or defending against intrusion, the Huntress's owl will be of great use!"</p><p>"I can only say, this money is well spent!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was in a great mood.</p><p>He then calculated how many Elven Mages and Elven Huntresses he could train separately.</p><p>Originally, he had about 60,000 energy crystals, and after the previous operations, he still had around 31,000 crystals left.</p><p></p><p>"Half and half, then."</p><p></p><p>Soon, a group of beautiful figures appeared before Lin Yi.</p><p>Fifty Elven Mages, consuming 15,000 energy crystals,</p><p>And fifty Elven Huntresses, consuming another 15,000 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fifteen thousand crystals of energy. Thirty-two elf huntresses consumed sixteen thousand crystals of energy.</p><p></p><p>The amount may seem small, but it is indeed not much.</p><p></p><p>More than thirty thousand crystals of energy, if used to train elf swordsmen and elf archers, could train more than six hundred of them. But the number of elf mages and elf huntresses combined is not even a hundred.</p><p></p><p>"Although these two elf professions are powerful, elf swordsmen and elf archers cannot be ignored."</p><p></p><p>"Each troop type has its own role to play."</p><p></p><p>"Elf swordsmen can serve as the front line, guarding the ranged troops in the rear on the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"The rain of arrows from elf archers is also a deadly weapon."</p><p></p><p>"The most crucial point is that elf swordsmen and elf archers are cheap!"</p><p></p><p>"To complete the system release tasks as soon as possible, we need to train more elf swordsmen and elf archers!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Praise to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Elf King, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>A group of elf mages and elf huntresses gathered and respectfully saluted Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Their ways of saluting were different.</p><p></p><p>The elf mages held their wands to their chests and bowed their heads to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>The elf huntresses knelt on one knee before Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the magic pets, the swift panthers beside them, also prostrated on the ground, obediently burying their heads.</p><p></p><p>As advanced ninth-tier magical beasts, they had already gained intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Rise," Lin Yi gestured.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the beautiful faces of the elves.</p><p></p><p>He then issued the tasks for tonight.</p><p></p><p>He reserved nearly a hundred elves to build wooden houses on the square.</p><p></p><p>He then divided the remaining thousand elves into twenty teams, ensuring that each team had one or two elf huntresses.</p><p></p><p>Night hunting, the owls of the elf huntresses would be very useful.</p><p></p><p>With the owls, the elf teams would not have to worry about being ambushed by magical beasts or undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>If powerful enemies approached, the elves could also quickly retreat from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, the elf teams gathered and set out one by one. They would still hunt in the ruins around the square, but the hunting range could be expanded a bit, as the teams had grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>Following Lin Yi's instructions, each elf carried a cup of elf spring water.</p><p></p><p>They were temporary cups made of wood.</p><p></p><p>The capacity was not large, just enough for use.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the effect of elf spring water is truly powerful. Elves injured during the day would heal quickly after drinking the elf spring water, and their inner magic power would even increase a bit.</p><p></p><p>This was just the low-grade elf spring water.</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine how astonishing the effects of the higher-grade elf spring water, or even the holy water of life, would be.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After the elves went out to hunt,</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi checked the tasks released by the system.</p><p></p><p>He now had two tasks.</p><p></p><p>One was to have a force of ten thousand combat troops under his command.</p><p></p><p>The other task was to kill one thousand monsters of level five or higher.</p><p></p><p>The current progress was 639/1000.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I kill another three hundred or so level five or higher monsters, I can complete the task and simultaneously unlock the divine-granted palace building."</p><p></p><p>"It's almost done."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't finish it tonight, I can get it done tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was very interested in the divine-granted palace.</p><p></p><p>Just from the name, he knew this building must have an extraordinary function.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After spending another full day, Lin Yi finally finished clearing the entire forest.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few demonic beasts and monsters that managed to escape, the rest were all killed by Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>In total, he harvested over 6,000 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>"This harvest is still not as good as yesterday!"</p><p></p><p>Yesterday, he had wiped out a swarm of vampire mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>Just from those vampire mosquitoes alone, he had harvested thousands of energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>This forest area is ultimately not very large, and it cannot accommodate too many demonic beasts and monsters. Aside from the vampire mosquito swarm, he did not find any other large-scale demonic beast territories, so today's harvest was a bit less.</p><p></p><p>"I need to change hunting grounds tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"The area around the Overlord's Manor is provisionally decided."</p><p></p><p>The Overlord's Manor is located to the northwest of the inner city ruins.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi chose the Overlord's Manor area, not primarily because there were a lot of demonic beasts there, but because the Elven Empire's treasury was located in that position.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, that area was also once the most prosperous part of the entire ancient city ruins.</p><p></p><p>Although thousands of years have passed, the vast majority of things have decayed and disappeared with the passage of time, but Lin Yi still wanted to try his luck.</p><p></p><p>What if he was blessed by the Goddess of Fortune and encountered treasures that had escaped the ravages of time?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi walked out of the forest.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it was already late and night was approaching, he gave up the idea of continuing to hunt.</p><p></p><p>It was still several kilometers away from his territory, and there would be a large number of undead creatures roaming at night.</p><p></p><p>He didn't think he should be overly bold.</p><p></p><p>Even if he were to hunt at night, it would be in the areas around his territory.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, Lin Yi suddenly heard the sound of battle.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it was an Elven hunting party, he went to take a look, only to find that the two sides fighting were undead and demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>It was dozens of undead knights besieging a group of swamp giant rats.</p><p></p><p>The number of swamp giant rats was in the hundreds, more than ten times that of the undead knights.</p><p></p><p>However, it was the rat horde that was being slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Those undead knights were all high-level undead.</p><p></p><p>Their lowest rank was 7th tier, and one of them had even reached the 9th tier.</p><p></p><p>A single charge by the undead knights could kill a large number of swamp giant rats. When the swamp giant rats tried to break through, their speed was no match for the knights, and they quickly fell into pools of blood.</p><p></p><p>In less than a few minutes, the battle was over.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of undead knights suffered no casualties.</p><p></p><p>The rat horde was completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with the rat horde, the undead knights quickly departed, disappearing into the gloomy ruins.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the undead knights left, another undead creature appeared, holding a bone staff and wearing a tattered robe. It waved its bone staff, releasing a greenish-glowing light that enveloped the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>In just a few seconds, the hundreds of dead swamp giant rats on the ground stood up again.</p><p></p><p>But unlike before...</p><p></p><p>Now some of them had become skeletons, while others had become rotting corpses.</p><p></p><p>They had been transformed into undead creatures! "An undead mage!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's expression became somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two nights, he and his Elven troops had killed a large number of undead creatures. But he had never encountered high-level undead knights or undead mages like these before.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the undead he had hunted were only ordinary, mostly low-level, with a few mid-level ones.</p><p></p><p>But now, he had suddenly encountered dozens of high-level undead.</p><p></p><p>"It must be because the ancient tree's demise has allowed the evil and dark forces beneath the ruins to no longer be suppressed, so powerful undead have gradually emerged."</p><p></p><p>"I need to accelerate the development of my territory."</p><p></p><p>"I can't let these undead creatures get ahead of me."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, not only clearing the entire ancient city ruins, but just dealing with the undead in the inner city will be a daunting task."</p><p></p><p>Who knows, after some time, there might even be king-tier or even transcendent-tier undead creatures appearing in the inner city?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In front of the ancient tree, this level of undead was nothing.</p><p></p><p>But for the current Lin Yi, that was a big trouble.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the necromancer was preparing to leave with hundreds of revived giant undead rats. Seeing this, Lin Yi immediately threw a flame spear.</p><p></p><p>The flame spear pierced through the space.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it pinned the necromancer who couldn't dodge in time onto the ruins behind him.</p><p></p><p>Ghostly blue flames engulfed his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the necromancer was reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>With the necromancer dead, the giant undead rats became like headless flies, scattering in all directions.</p><p></p><p>After using the fire wall technique combined with the fireball technique to kill most of them, Lin Yi let the remaining scattered giant undead rats escape into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>They were all just small fry, low-level monsters, chasing them would be meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Killing that necromancer was enough.</p><p></p><p>This type of undead creature poses a greater threat on the battlefield than that group of undead knights.</p><p></p><p>Because it can revive the fallen undead.</p><p></p><p>As long as the soul fire of the undead creature has not been completely extinguished, even if it has become fragments, the necromancer can use magic to reassemble it, forming a new soul fire and reviving the fallen undead.</p><p></p><p>After cleaning up the battlefield, Lin Yi directly returned to the domain.</p><p></p><p>"The elf hunting team should have all come back."</p><p></p><p>"Go see how their harvest is today."</p><p></p><p>"If the energy crystals are sufficient, upgrade the War Ancient Tree and unlock more powerful elf troops!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Soon after Lin Yi's return, the elves who had gone out hunting also gradually returned.</p><p></p><p>Just like yesterday, many elves had bulging leather pouches on their backs. The difference was that today the number and size of the pouches were greater.</p><p></p><p>As usual, the personnel were counted.</p><p></p><p>No elf troops were lost, but a few were injured.</p><p></p><p>Inquiring, they learned that they had encountered powerful enemies during the hunt.</p><p></p><p>Some were attacked by high-level magical beast monsters, and some, like Lin Yi, encountered high-level undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>The latter was the majority.</p><p></p><p>"As expected, my guess was correct."</p><p></p><p>"Powerful undead creatures have been gradually reviving."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi knew that the plan to upgrade the War Ancient Tree was now urgent.</p><p></p><p>He not only needed to expand the scale of the elf team, but also needed to have more powerful elf troops.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, upgrading the War Ancient Tree is the only shortcut.</p><p></p><p>Soon, an elf brought the spoils counted to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, we harvested a total of 53,749 energy crystals and 352 magic cores today. Additionally, a team found this in the ruins..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, the tall elf took out a gray-black magic book.</p><p></p><p>The magic book was made of unknown beast skin.</p><p></p><p>It looked very thick and heavy overall.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took the magic book and opened it.</p><p></p><p>The use of magic books is mostly to record knowledge, or magic skills, alchemy insights, forging techniques, and so on. With the help of magic books, the cultivator can understand and master them faster.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, as long as the spiritual consciousness is connected to the magic book, the information recorded in it can be obtained.</p><p></p><p>The magic book found by the elf team recorded magic skills.</p><p></p><p>This is exactly what Lin Yi urgently needs now.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, most of the pages were eaten by insects, and many pages were even missing more than half. The magic array used to establish the spiritual connection was also long damaged, making it almost useless.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity."</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yi was about to return the magic book to the elf and let her handle it as she pleased, the system's voice suddenly sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【The host can consume energy crystals to repair the damaged magic book.】</p><p></p><p>【Not only magic books, but the vast majority of damaged items can be repaired by consuming energy crystals. The higher the item's level, the greater the consumption.】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

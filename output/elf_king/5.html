        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dark continent, the number of undead is extremely large.</p><p></p><p>They exist all over the world.</p><p></p><p>Even in the barren deserts, the frigid ice fields, and the vast oceans, their presence can be seen.</p><p></p><p>Especially at night, the undead are most active.</p><p></p><p>As night falls, countless undead creatures sleeping beneath the earth awaken.</p><p></p><p>There are many types of undead, such as skeletons, rotting corpses, phantoms, zombies, and abominations.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary undead creatures have a muddled consciousness and almost no intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, only high-level undead of rank seven or above possess a certain degree of intelligence.</p><p></p><p>At the king rank, the intelligence of the undead is no less than that of humans.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Thousands of undead creatures were approaching.</p><p></p><p>In the sky and on the ground, their figures could be seen, surging like a dark tide.</p><p></p><p>The scene was more shocking than a swarm of vampire mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>"A huge wave of experience!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi said to the group of elven swordsmen and archers, "You are free to fight, but you must protect your own safety."</p><p></p><p>Thousands of undead creatures, most of them low-level. </p><p></p><p>The number of mid-level undead creatures was not high, only around tens.</p><p></p><p>With Lin Yi, an advanced level-8 mage, in their midst, this undead army posed no threat to his domain.</p><p></p><p>However, the sheer numbers were still a concern.</p><p></p><p>The Tree of Life had the ability to revive elven troops. </p><p></p><p>But Lin Yi had inquired the system, and while the elven troops could be revived, it would consume energy crystals, the same amount as when they were initially trained.</p><p></p><p>Right now, what Lin Yi lacked the most were energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>He naturally did not want to see any accidental casualties among the elven troops.</p><p></p><p>The elven swordsmen and archers responded in unison to Lin Yi's order. They did not rashly charge out, but gathered not far in front of Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Compared to destroying this undead army, they were more concerned about the safety of their elven king.</p><p></p><p>Soon, thousands of undead poured into the square, charging straight towards Lin Yi and the others.</p><p></p><p>The first to arrive were the undead creatures with the ability to fly, mostly undead birds, and a few wisp-like phantoms.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the corporeal undead creatures, the phantoms were the most troublesome.</p><p></p><p>These undead, invisible and intangible, were immune to almost all physical attacks.</p><p></p><p>But there were also many ways to counter phantoms, such as light-based magic and soul domain techniques.</p><p></p><p>Especially the former, which not only targeted phantoms, but was essentially effective against all types of undead.</p><p></p><p>Facing the attacking undead, twelve elven archers took the lead in launching their assault. They skillfully nocked and released arrows, sending a volley of green-glowing elven arrows into the sky.</p><p></p><p>The whistling sound of the arrows was sharp and piercing.</p><p></p><p>Twelve arrows, like twelve green lightning bolts, instantly crossed hundreds of meters and struck their targets with incredible precision.</p><p></p><p>The undead creatures hit by the arrows suddenly exploded.</p><p></p><p>The phantoms let out agonizing screams and dissipated into gray smoke.</p><p></p><p>The corporeal undead creatures were also forced to disintegrate, their bodies breaking into countless fragments falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The arrows of the elven archers contained pure life and natural magic power, which had a certain degree of control over the undead, especially when there was a significant level difference.</p><p></p><p>Even the soul flames within the undead were forcibly dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The whistling of the arrows continued, one after another, as the elven archers moved in perfect synchronization, releasing arrow after arrow from their fingertips.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Long-range shooting, making their shooting distance even farther.</p><p></p><p>Powerful strikes, making their arrows even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the elven archers were all expert marksmen, with nearly every shot hitting the target. In the blink of an eye, close to a hundred undead flying creatures were killed by the elven archers.</p><p></p><p>Following closely, Lin Yi also took action.</p><p></p><p>He waved his wand, and a series of massive fireballs flew towards the airborne undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>Each fireball had a diameter of over two meters.</p><p></p><p>Burning with azure flames.</p><p></p><p>Although the fireball spell was a low-level magic, when cast by Lin Yi, its power was no less than that of a high-level spell.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>The fireballs exploded in the sky, bursting forth with a brilliance even brighter than fireworks.</p><p></p><p>The scorching fire waves swept across everything around them.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a large number of undead creatures were ignited and quickly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the ground forces of the undead legion charged forward, and the first thing they encountered was a series of fire walls over 20 meters tall.</p><p></p><p>The undead knew no fear.</p><p></p><p>They rushed towards the fire walls one after another.</p><p></p><p>Some slightly more intelligent undead tried to go around the fire walls, but Lin Yi did not give them that chance. He continuously waved his wand, creating even more fire walls in the path of the undead legion.</p><p></p><p>The fire walls were arranged in a curved formation, like a massive funnel, trying to trap the entire undead legion inside.</p><p></p><p>However, the number of undead creatures was simply too great.</p><p></p><p>As a large number of undead creatures charged into the fire walls, the elemental magic within the walls was quickly consumed, and their destructive power rapidly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Finally, some undead creatures broke through the fire wall blockade.</p><p></p><p>They charged towards Lin Yi and the others, their bodies still burning.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it was time for the elven swordsmen to take action.</p><p></p><p>They instantly crossed the distance of tens of meters, and their elven swords unleashed a series of beautiful sword lights. Each sword strike directly slew an undead creature.</p><p></p><p>Their sixth-tier strength was far beyond what these low-level undead could withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>A beast-like undead creature lunged towards an elven swordsman. This was a ghoul.</p><p></p><p>Around three meters long, with sharp claws and fangs, and a rank of five.</p><p></p><p>Among this undead legion, such high-level undead creatures were not numerous.</p><p></p><p>The elven swordsman's figure flickered as she evaded the ghoul's lunge, and with a backhand strike, she severed the ghoul's neck. Accompanied by a sound like clashing metal, the ghoul's head was cleanly cut off.</p><p></p><p>But despite this grievous injury, the ghoul did not die.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it used its claws to grab its fallen head, preparing to reattach it.</p><p></p><p>This scene perfectly demonstrated the undying nature of undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>What would be a fatal wound for most intelligent beings was nothing to the undead.</p><p></p><p>The vital point of undead creatures was their soul fire.</p><p></p><p>Unless their soul fire was extinguished, the undead were difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>Even if their bodies were destroyed, as long as their soul fire remained, the undead had a chance to revive and regenerate.</p><p></p><p>The elven swordsman did not give the ghoul a chance to reassemble its body. With a powerful strike, she directly impaled the ghoul's head with her elven sword, and the sword tip released a powerful magical force, forcibly dispersing the ghoul's soul fire.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the ghoul finally collapse to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Around the corpse, scattered green soul fire fragments and dozens of energy crystals could be seen.</p><p></p><p>The higher the monster's rank, the more energy crystals it would release upon death.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

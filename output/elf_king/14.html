        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Night had fallen, and all manner of demons and monsters had crawled out from their hiding places.</p><p></p><p>Shrouded in darkness, the ruins of the ancient relic were dotted with eerie green ghostly flames, and the roars of monstrous beasts echoed through the black night.</p><p></p><p>Given such circumstances, how could the Old Tree possibly ask him to cross the Forgotten Marsh and the Dark Forest, and venture to the Chaotic Plains to take the Elf Queen as his wife?</p><p></p><p>If his luck was even a little off, he might not even make it out of the inner city ruins.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Lin Yi had managed to catch the hem of the Goddess of Fortune's dress, activating the system at the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could steadily develop and strengthen his domain, he need not worry about lacking the opportunity to bring the Elf Queen into his bed.</p><p></p><p>"I should get back to work."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi waved his hand, and the few elves who had been giving him a massage quickly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi rose from the grassy ground.</p><p></p><p>The original stone tiles that had covered the plaza had all been removed, and within the radius of several hundred meters centered on the Tree of Life and the Ancient War Tree, the area was now lush with green grass and vibrant flowers.</p><p></p><p>The living environment was steadily improving.</p><p></p><p>It's worth mentioning that there had once stood a statue in the plaza.</p><p></p><p>The statue, exquisitely beautiful, had withstood the passage of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>The Old Tree had once told him that this was a statue of the Elf Goddess.</p><p></p><p>The Elf Goddess was the mother deity of the Elf Clan, revered by the intelligent races allied with the Elves, such as the Unicorns, Treants, Phoenix Guards, and Elf Dragons.</p><p></p><p>The previous night, the statue of the Elf Goddess had been toppled by the Elves under Lin Yi's command, and thrown into the nearby ruins along with the removed stone tiles.</p><p></p><p>The Elves under his command did not believe in the Elf Goddess - their only loyalty was to him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Deep in the night, the Overlord's Mansion located to the northwest of the inner city ruins was bustling with activity, despite the dilapidated state of the original structure.</p><p></p><p>Now, a Bone Palace had appeared amidst the ruins, its every brick and pillar constructed from accumulated bones, appearing all the more ominous under the eerie green ghostly flames.</p><p></p><p>Within the Bone Palace, dozens of figures had gathered - all of them high-level undead beings. The types were varied, including skeletons, zombies, gargoyles, and wraiths. Some had human forms, others monstrous, and some were mere clouds of black smoke or deformed creatures of rotting flesh.</p><p></p><p>At the head of the Bone Palace was an enormous white bone throne, over five meters wide. Seated upon it was a gigantic figure, nearly ten meters tall, clad in thick black metal armor that covered its entire body, save for its skeletal head, which was covered in a layer of hardened chitin. Beneath its hollow eye sockets burned the green flames of a soul.</p><p></p><p>This was an undead being of the Zombie Clan. Such undead had impressive defenses, but were also painfully slow in their movements, a weakness that could only be overcome by reaching the Transcendent or even Saint-Rank realms.</p><p></p><p>"So far, how many undead beings have we gathered?" the enthroned figure asked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King on the throne trembled his spiritual consciousness and asked, "What news do you have to report?"</p><p></p><p>After a moment, a skeletal knight stepped forward and replied, "Your Majesty, we have gathered over 100,000 undead creatures. If not for the elves who have been slaughtering the undead at night in the city center, we would have even more undead under our control!"</p><p></p><p>"Elves!" </p><p></p><p>The green spirit flames in the Zombie King's eye sockets flickered violently.</p><p></p><p>It asked, "Have you investigated where these elves have come from?"</p><p></p><p>The ancient Tree of Life had ceased to give birth to elves hundreds of years ago, and now it had completely perished. Otherwise, even a Monarch-class undead like the Zombie King would not have been able to revive. </p><p></p><p>Prior to this, only ordinary undead had been reviving. It was only after the ancient tree died that higher-level undead began to awaken.</p><p></p><p>As for the group of elves in the city center, they seemed to have simply appeared out of nowhere.</p><p></p><p>"We are still investigating," the skeletal knight replied, his spiritual consciousness trembling as he spoke. "Your Majesty, the rate of advancement of these elves is absolutely monstrous. Just yesterday, their highest level was only 7th rank. But by this evening, I encountered an elven squad where some had already reached 8th rank."</p><p></p><p>Among the elves under Lin Yi's command, there were indeed quite a few who had advanced to 8th rank, numbering over a dozen. They were mostly from the first batch that Lin Yi had summoned.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, a wisp of gray smoke drifted out - a wraith. It too trembled the spiritual consciousness as it said, "These elves are still weak now, but we cannot let them grow stronger, or they will undoubtedly pose a threat to us!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the green spirit flames in the Zombie King's eyes flickered ceaselessly. It deeply agreed with this sentiment.</p><p></p><p>Elves were a rare highly intelligent race, with powerful bloodlines and combat strength. The ruins they stood upon were once the capital of the Elven Empire.</p><p></p><p>If those elves were allowed to grow stronger, they would undoubtedly cleanse this ancient ruined city. Elves hated evil and dark creatures the most, and the undead were among them. They were natural enemies, and the problem should be dealt with preemptively.</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King asked, "How many elves are in that area, and what is their strength?"</p><p></p><p>The skeletal knight replied, "Rough estimate, there are around 300 to 400 elves there, mostly 6th rank, with a few 7th and 8th rank."</p><p></p><p>"Their strength is average," the Zombie King assessed.</p><p></p><p>An undead echoed, "With this level of power, we can easily annihilate them!"</p><p></p><p>"Since our revival, we haven't had the chance to savor the taste of the living, let alone elves. As a highly intelligent race, the elves' flavor must be even more delectable!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, give the order!"</p><p></p><p>"We are impatient to begin."</p><p></p><p>The undead clamored in unison.</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King did not hesitate, "Relay my command - gather the army and march towards the central square, and ensure that all the elves there are slaughtered."</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Your Majesty!" the undead reverently obeyed.</p><p></p><p>The wisp of smoky wraith said, "Your Majesty, rest assured, those elves will have no chance of survival! With our 100,000-strong army, we can simply bury them in numbers!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, the undead army mobilized. Under the moonlight, they surged forth like a black tidal wave towards Lin Yi's domain.</p><p></p><p>The greatest strength of the undead race was not individual combat power, but their human wave tactics. Once deployed, it was a sea of bodies, a raging torrent.</p><p></p><p>Especially when there were undead mages who mastered resurrection spells, the human wave tactics of the undead army would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>(PS: New book, seeking data, seeking readers!)</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

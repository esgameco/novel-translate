        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The demonic plant seemed to come alive in an instant, hastily waving countless branch-like tentacles and flinging out streaks of afterimages, blasting the fireball out of the air.</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion rang out as the fireball detonated.</p><p></p><p>The resulting fragments of flame ignited the vast expanse of white bones on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Raging flames began to burn.</p><p></p><p>The scorching heat made the demonic plant feel extremely uncomfortable. Especially the branches that had directly contacted the fireball were now on fire, forcing it to sever them to prevent the main body from burning.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit, you have successfully angered me!"</p><p></p><p>The demonic plant's spiritual consciousness became extremely agitated. Even the entire tree body was violently shaking, awakening countless vampire mosquitoes sleeping in their nests.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him, drain the spirit's blood from his body!"</p><p></p><p>With the order given, countless vampire mosquitoes surged out of their nests, forming a black wave rushing towards Lin Yi. At the same time, thousands of branches like sharp spears crossed hundreds of meters, instantly stabbing towards Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was well-prepared, quickly retreating. He soon left the range of the demonic plant's attacks.</p><p></p><p>This kind of mutant creature has a major flaw - it is difficult to move, or even immobile. As long as he stayed out of its attack range, it would be powerless.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, countless vampire mosquitoes charged towards him, but Lin Yi played his old trick again. He waved his hand to erect four walls of fire, firmly protecting himself within.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he condensed a series of massive fireballs and hurled them into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom...</p><p></p><p>With each fireball exploding, scorching flame waves swept across the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, countless vampire mosquitoes were burned to ashes. Densely packed charred corpses fell from the sky like raindrops.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Lin Yi felt his inner magical power surging. This was the accumulation of a large amount of "experience." The sensation was as exhilarating as consuming an immortal elixir.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the battered vampire mosquito swarm did not retreat, but instead pressed on even more frantically than the previous night, as if they would not turn back until they had drained Lin Yi's spirit blood.</p><p></p><p>Finally, some higher-level vampire mosquitoes, escorted by countless companions, successfully pierced through the channel in the wall of fire. They were now just a hair's breadth away from Lin Yi, separated only by the layer of flame shield.</p><p></p><p>Rows of sharp proboscises stabbed at the flame shield, accompanied by the whistling of wind blades - the magical skills wielded by the vampire mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>Under the attack, the flame shield enveloping Lin Yi shook violently, spraying out a shower of sparks. But Lin Yi remained calm and confident in his defense.</p><p></p><p>These invading vampire mosquitoes were not low-level, mostly ranging from the fourth to sixth tier, belonging to the category of mid-level magical beasts. There were nearly a hundred of them, but breaking through his flame shield would still be quite difficult for them.</p><p></p><p>The crucial factor was that they did not have much time left. The surrounding walls of fire were constantly scorching them. Even with magical power shielding their bodies, the vampire mosquitoes could not endure for long.</p><p></p><p>True enough, in just ten seconds, some of the vampire mosquitoes had their magical power collapse, their bodies directly exposed to the flames. Their wings on both sides were the first to catch fire, and then their entire bodies were ignited.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more vampire mosquitoes could not hold on. They turned into fireballs falling around Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown length of time, the buzzing sound diminished. Most of the vampire mosquitoes had fallen on the path of their charge.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Lin Yi saw that the surviving vampire mosquitoes were retreating, led by one in the front.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The vampire mosquito, which was only about a meter tall, was actually a high-level seventh-rank monster. This vampire mosquito was clearly the leader of the mosquito swarm.</p><p></p><p>It was an advanced magical beast with relatively high intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it could not defeat Lin Yi, it decisively led the surviving vampire mosquitoes to flee.</p><p></p><p>No matter how furiously the magic plant roared, it did not look back.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, a several-meter-long flaming spear shot towards the vampire mosquito leader, moving as fast as lightning, instantly piercing and pinning it to a large tree.</p><p></p><p>The vampire mosquito leader let out a miserable scream and struggled, but it was to no avail. Its body was soon engulfed in flames.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other vampire mosquitoes were terrified and scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi continuously threw out more than a dozen huge fireballs, managing to kill some, but unable to completely wipe them out, helplessly watching as over a thousand experienced mosquitoes successfully escaped his sight.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>"My attack methods are still too simple."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, if it weren't for the orders of that magic plant, and the low intelligence of the low-level magical beasts, my fire wall would have had a hard time killing so many vampire mosquitoes."</p><p></p><p>The fire wall technique was more inclined towards defensive magic.</p><p></p><p>If the vampire mosquito swarm hadn't been stupid enough to throw themselves at him, how could he have achieved such a battle record?</p><p></p><p>"After clearing the magical beasts and monsters from the inner city, I need to thoroughly scavenge around and see if I can find any surviving magic books to master more magical skills..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a relatively large amount of magical power surged within Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>And with the appearance of this magical power, Lin Yi's level finally broke through, successfully advancing to the realm of a ninth-rank mage.</p><p></p><p>Ninth-rank, which could be considered the peak of an ordinary profession.</p><p></p><p>To break through further would be to reach the royal rank.</p><p></p><p>Royal rank professions had no distinction from first to ninth rank, only divided into four realms: junior, intermediate, advanced, and peak. The subsequent realms of transcendent and sacred were the same.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-rank mage!"</p><p></p><p>"Both the strength and reserve of my magical power are now several times that of eighth-rank."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi sensed the changes within him.</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, he was far more powerful than before.</p><p></p><p>Although his methods were still "simple," the power of each type of magic had increased proportionally.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's your turn!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi, holding his magic staff, walked towards the distant magic plant.</p><p></p><p>The magic plant trembled violently, its drooping branches all twitching, as if it had gone mad. It shook its spiritual consciousness, hoping to make peace with Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Its rank had also reached ninth-rank.</p><p></p><p>But the problem was that it could not move, and its attack range was very limited.</p><p></p><p>The most fatal thing was that Lin Yi was a fire-attribute mage.</p><p></p><p>As a magic plant, it feared fire the most.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit, I've cultivated for over a hundred years, which is truly no easy feat. If we can live in harmony, I'm willing to manage this forest for you, and even cultivate the fruit trees your clan needs..."</p><p></p><p>In fact, until now, this magic plant still didn't know where Lin Yi had come from.</p><p></p><p>The center of the ruins only had an ancient, no longer fertile, life tree.</p><p></p><p>The spirits had long since disappeared from these ruins.</p><p></p><p>And the legends said that all spirits were female, so where did this male spirit come from?</p><p></p><p>"No need, I have plenty of spirits serving me!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi remained unmoved, raising his hand to send a huge fireball several meters in diameter flying towards the magic plant...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wise races of the Dark Continent dare not provoke the majesty of our Elven Empire.</p><p></p><p>Even the clan leader of the Dragon race must put away his arrogance when facing the Sun Elf King.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the Forgotten Swamp,</p><p></p><p>In an ancient ruin, an old tree is telling a young man the most glorious history of the Elven race.</p><p></p><p>The young man's name is Lin Yi, with a head of golden hair like flames and the signature pointed ears of the Elven race.</p><p></p><p>He is tall and youthful, his aura surging and intense.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi listens quietly as the old tree recounts its tale.</p><p></p><p>From the old tree, he has gained much knowledge about this world.</p><p></p><p>This is the Dark Continent - a world already shrouded by evil and dark forces.</p><p></p><p>The Elven race was once glorious, but now it is the demons and evil races that dominate this world. The races of goodness, order, and light have become the targets of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The old tree is the life tree of the Elven race, also known as the Mother Tree of the Elves, with the ability to nurture nature spirits.</p><p></p><p>Its trunk stands hundreds of meters tall, a testament to its former grandeur and magnificence.</p><p></p><p>But now its leaves are withered, exuding a decaying aura.</p><p></p><p>It is too old, with only a breath of life remaining.</p><p></p><p>The old tree's trunk has an aged human face, telling Lin Yi, "Child, you are a pure-blooded Sun Elf. You are destined to become a great Elven King, to restore the glory of the Elven Empire!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's heart surges with passion, but it soon fades.</p><p></p><p>To be an Elven King in this world ruled by demons and evil would be easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>He plans to grow stealthily and quietly ascend to godhood.</p><p></p><p>Once he becomes a god, he can leave this world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the old tree speaks again, "The remaining Elves are scattered across the world. Even the Chaos Plains have given birth to a legitimate Elven Queen. They are all waiting for your call.</p><p></p><p>"As a Sun Elf, you are destined to marry the Elven Queen and command the Elven forces!"</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Yi can respond,</p><p></p><p>The old tree's trunk suddenly emits a glowing green light.</p><p></p><p>The green light gathers in front of Lin Yi, transforming into a crystal-like tree seed.</p><p></p><p>"This is the seed of the Life Tree. Nurture it with Elven spring water or sacred life water, and it will birth nature spirits to serve and obey you!"</p><p></p><p>"Child, take this seed and seek your destiny!"</p><p></p><p>"I will pray for you."</p><p></p><p>The old tree suddenly coughs a few times.</p><p></p><p>The aura of decay around it grows even thicker.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi can clearly sense the life force within the old tree rapidly fading, but he has no way to save it, only watching as the tree's life reaches its end and it completely withers.</p><p></p><p>This is not sudden.</p><p></p><p>The old tree had foreseen its own fate half a month ago.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi takes the seed of the Life Tree.</p><p></p><p>As for the old tree's expectations, he can only try his best.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he cannot even leave the Forgotten Swamp, let alone traverse the Dark Forest ruled by Dark Elves and Cyclopes to reach the Chaos Plains.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation, the Elven Queen will just have to wait a little longer.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The ground trembles slightly.</p><p></p><p>Many ruined ancient buildings around are collapsing.</p><p></p><p>As the old tree's power fades, these structures eroded by time can no longer stand.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looks around.</p><p></p><p>He is standing in a plaza, surrounded by building ruins and crumbling walls.</p><p></p><p>This was once the capital of the Elven Empire.</p><p></p><p>Spanning over hundreds of kilometers, it was once a vast metropolis.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, it was home to countless Elves, unicorns, wyverns, treants... until the angelic and demonic forces of the divine war destroyed it all.</p><p></p><p>After millennia of passing...</p><p></p><p>The ancient city has become a complete ruin.</p><p></p><p>As for the outside of the ruined city, it is the boundless Forgotten Swamp, occupied by a multitude of evil and dark creatures.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even many evil creatures had already infiltrated the ruins.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the power of the old tree had prevented evil creatures from daring to approach the square.</p><p></p><p>Now that the old tree was dead and the protective barrier had collapsed, he could only rely on himself.</p><p></p><p>"My level is seventh-tier, and my profession is a fire magic mage."</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline of the Sun Elves can greatly enhance my magical power, making my magic power no weaker than an eighth-tier mage. As long as I'm careful, I shouldn't have any problem surviving in these ruins."</p><p></p><p>"But it's dangerous outside."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had only been in this world for a few months.</p><p></p><p>It was already quite difficult for him to become a seventh-tier mage. </p><p></p><p>This was because he was a Sun Elf with amazing natural talent.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary nature elf, it might take years to reach this level.</p><p></p><p>He planned to cultivate in the ruins for a while, and then consider crossing the Forgotten Swamp once his strength had grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>Just at this moment...</p><p></p><p>A mechanical voice suddenly sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[System loading... Activating...]</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations, host, you have obtained a seed of a unit building for the Elf camp.]</p><p></p><p>[The host can choose to plant the seed of the Tree of Life right here and become the lord of the Elf camp, summoning elves and dominating the world. Or you can continue to wait and find the unit building seeds of other camps...]</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi paused for half a second, then his face lit up with delight.</p><p></p><p>As a transmigrator, the system might be late, but it would never be absent.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a lord, I'm afraid I can't just hide and wait anymore."</p><p></p><p>"But since the system has appeared, there's no reason not to use it..."</p><p></p><p>After briefly considering, Lin Yi decided to "follow the guidance of the Goddess of Fate." Under the system's guidance, he found an open space and planted the seed of the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>As a Sun Elf of the Elf race and the Elf King, becoming the lord of the Elf camp was naturally the first choice.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>The seed took root and grew rapidly. </p><p></p><p>In just a short while, a towering Tree of Life dozens of meters high appeared before Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>The trunk of the Tree of Life was sturdy and vigorous, with lush foliage, like a canopy, emanating a rich life and natural aura, in stark contrast to the nearby withered old tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked up.</p><p></p><p>The information of the Tree of Life appeared in the form of a virtual panel.</p><p></p><p>[Tree of Life]</p><p>[Building Information: The Tree of Life is the core building of the Elf camp. Before other buildings are destroyed, the Tree of Life is in an invincible state. Its ability is to nurture young elves and revive fallen elves.]</p><p>[Level: Low, can nurture 10 young elves per day]</p><p>[Upgrade Requirement: 1,000 energy crystals]</p><p>[Special Prompt: Upgrading the Tree of Life can increase the number of young elves it can nurture.]</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It can even revive fallen elves, something the old tree couldn't do!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi exclaimed, then asked, "System, how do I obtain energy crystals?"</p><p></p><p>--[The host can obtain energy crystals by killing enemies, mining energy crystal mines, etc.]</p><p></p><p>After responding to Lin Yi, the system began to issue lord tasks.</p><p></p><p>[Task 1: Have 1,000 combat-type units in your territory.]</p><p>[Task Reward: Unlock the territory building - Mana Spring]</p><p>...</p><p>[Task 2: Clear the Elf Ancient City ruins and kill 100 monsters of level 3 or above.]</p><p>[Task Reward: Unlock the territory building - War Ancient Tree]</p><p>...</p><p>[Mana Spring: Can condense precious elf spring water, even holy water of life.]</p><p>[War Ancient Tree: A unit building of the Elf camp, can train combat-type elf units.]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

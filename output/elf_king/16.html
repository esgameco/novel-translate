        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the night sky, it seemed as if thunderbolts were flashing across.</p><p></p><p>The earth trembled, and ghostly creatures howled in rage.</p><p></p><p>A massive army of the undead surged forth like a black flood.</p><p></p><p>Wherever they passed, the dilapidated ruins were razed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The first to reach the central square were still the flying undead monsters and wispy phantoms.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the previous night's assault, the number of undead creatures this time was particularly large.</p><p></p><p>It could almost be described as an overwhelming deluge.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha..."</p><p></p><p>"Charge in and kill all the elves in the square, topple their Tree of Life!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!!"</p><p></p><p>Countless undead beings were agitated in their spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a large number of dark shadows descended from the sky, accompanied by a thick aura of death.</p><p></p><p>Almost simultaneously, surges of magical power filled the heavens and earth, and various elemental magic skills exploded in the sky, decorating the night with a riot of colors.</p><p></p><p>These magic skills included ice storms, explosive fireballs, wind dragons, and more.</p><p></p><p>All of them came from the elven mages under Lin Yi's command.</p><p></p><p>And they were all high-level magic skills.</p><p></p><p>Possessing immense power.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, a large number of undead beings were torn to shreds.</p><p></p><p>The undead creatures with physical forms suffered heavy losses, and the ghostly undead also suffered significant losses. They could ignore physical attacks to a certain extent, but they were not immune to magical attacks.</p><p></p><p>Although the elemental attributes did not form a counter, the damage from the magical power still existed.</p><p></p><p>Many of the phantoms rushing at the forefront had not even had a chance to let out a miserable scream before being shredded by the raging elemental magic in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Just then...</p><p></p><p>A dense barrage of arrows rained down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Each arrow emanated the radiant glow of elemental magic.</p><p></p><p>After a few rounds of arrow attacks, thousands of flying undead creatures were killed.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, whose intelligence did this come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Are they trying to kill us?"</p><p></p><p>"There are not just three or four hundred elves here, but definitely over a thousand! And among them are a large number of high-level elven mages... And what about those elves riding black panthers? Are they the rumored elven druids who can commune with nature?"</p><p></p><p>A single preemptive attack had resulted in the death of at least thousands of undead beings.</p><p></p><p>The slightly more intelligent undead creatures were so frightened that they fled in a panic, not daring to continue their dive-bombing.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the well-organized and well-equipped elven army gathered in the square, which was clearly an elite force, many high-level undead creatures were terrified to their core.</p><p></p><p>The intelligence was seriously flawed!</p><p></p><p>Not only had the enemy's numbers doubled, but they were also individually powerful.</p><p></p><p>Especially those elves riding the magical beast panthers, all of whom were ninth-tier professionals, numbering nearly sixty. And those elven mages, all of whom were eighth-tier professionals, numbering over 150.</p><p></p><p>What a terrifying power!</p><p></p><p>In their ten-thousand-strong undead army, it seemed they did not have so many high-level undead of the same caliber.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had just recently awakened, and their strength had not yet had time to increase.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this time, the ground forces of the undead army were also approaching the central square.</p><p></p><p>Their numbers were truly staggering.</p><p></p><p>To the west and north, the entire fan-shaped area was filled with a dense mass of undead beings - skeletons, zombies, corpses, ghouls, and so on, every type imaginable.</p><p></p><p>This scene was absolutely grand in scale.</p><p></p><p>However, just as they were about a hundred meters away from the central square, a sudden...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>A deafening explosion suddenly echoed through the darkness, and at the same time, towering pillars of flame illuminated the entire night sky.</p><p></p><p>These were massive columns of fire, scattered among the ranks of the undead army.</p><p></p><p>All undead creatures, whether ordinary or high-level, that were within the range of these pillars of fire were quickly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>With a single strike, thousands of undead beings were slain.</p><p></p><p>These pillars of fire were magical traps set up by the elven huntresses, with a power so overwhelming that they could instantly kill even high-level undead.</p><p></p><p>Even undead on par with the elven huntresses could not withstand the magical traps for long if trapped inside.</p><p></p><p>More and more of these magical traps were then activated.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the elven huntresses had set up more than two hundred of these traps. If they had more time, they could have placed even more. With the support of elven springs, they had no concerns about running out of magical power.</p><p></p><p>After all the magical traps were fully triggered...</p><p></p><p>The number of undead beings, both directly and indirectly killed, reached at least thirty thousand.</p><p></p><p>The battle achievements were dazzling.</p><p></p><p>"The power of these magical traps is almost on par with my advanced magical spear of fire," said Lin Yi, who was in the rear of the elven legion, amazed by the towering pillars of flame appearing on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>He knew the magical traps set up by the elven huntresses would be powerful, amplified by their [Talent Ability], but he didn't expect them to be this strong. Not only could they instantly kill high-level undead, but they were also large-scale area-of-effect skills.</p><p></p><p>This could be considered a devastating weapon on the legion's battlefield.</p><p></p><p>However, the elven huntresses' magical traps were not without their flaws.</p><p></p><p>Flaw one: fixed position, they could only be triggered where they were placed.</p><p></p><p>Flaw two: passive activation, the traps would be triggered regardless of whether one or many enemies entered them.</p><p></p><p>This time, facing the massive undead army, the traps could inflict such heavy casualties. If it were just scattered monster beasts, it would be like using a cannon to kill mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, if there were undead beings proficient in magical runes and seals within this undead army, there was a chance the elven huntresses' traps could be disassembled.</p><p></p><p>But of course, there are no "ifs" in the world.</p><p></p><p>The brilliant achievements of the magical traps have already become a reality.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>More than two hundred pillars of flame illuminated the entire battlefield.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the undead army's formation had been fragmented into different-sized pieces by the pillars of fire.</p><p></p><p>If it were other intelligent races, their formation might have completely collapsed.</p><p></p><p>But the undead have little intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Especially the ordinary undead, their consciousness is muddled, and they have no concept of death or fear.</p><p></p><p>Their actions are either based on instinct or following the orders of higher-level undead.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the undead army continued to advance courageously.</p><p></p><p>Guided by their sense of danger, the undead on the battlefield scattered, avoiding the pillars of fire and forming a long dragon-like formation charging towards the central square.</p><p></p><p>Soon after,</p><p></p><p>The ground forces of the undead army successfully entered the central square.</p><p></p><p>Together with the flying undead creatures in the air, they surged towards Lin Yi's elven army.</p><p></p><p>"The real intense battle has begun!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lin Yi waved his magic wand, hurling massive fireballs into the undead army's formation.</p><p></p><p>With a series of thunderous booms, a large number of undead beings were blasted into fragments, and the resulting waves of fire also continued to damage the advancing undead army...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

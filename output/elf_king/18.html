        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dark ruins, a high-level undead corpse trembled with spiritual consciousness and asked a question.</p><p></p><p>The other high-level undead beings also turned their gaze towards the massive zombie king.</p><p></p><p>Their levels had all reached the 9th rank.</p><p></p><p>There were dozens of them.</p><p></p><p>Together with the zombie king at the king-level rank, rescuing that group of undead mages would not be a problem, and they even had a high probability of defeating those elven knights.</p><p></p><p>However, the zombie king had never issued any orders.</p><p></p><p>He watched helplessly as those undead mages were slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>The most critical point was that they were originally supposed to follow the zombie king onto the battlefield. But before they even reached the square, the zombie king ordered them not to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Until now, the undead army had suffered heavy losses, and these "bigshots" were still just watching the show.</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave this place," said the zombie king.</p><p></p><p>"This war should never have happened."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a pity that these warriors who followed me have been lost!"</p><p></p><p>The undead were instantly shocked. They were retreating?</p><p></p><p>The decaying undead hurriedly said, "Your Majesty, our army has not been defeated. As long as you personally take action, it would only be a matter of time before we wipe out the elves on the battlefield."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Your Majesty," others chimed in. "Those elves are no match for you!"</p><p></p><p>The zombie king said, "The Sun Elf has been born, and we should show him some courtesy."</p><p></p><p>"The Sun Elf?" The undead were all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>They either had incomplete memories from their previous lives, or they did not have any memories at all.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they did not know any information about the Sun Elves.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that the lower the level of the undead, the more blurred their memories from their previous lives. </p><p></p><p>Most undead beings do not even have memories from their previous lives. They were born in the burial grounds, and the spiritual fire within their bodies was purely formed by the dense death energy and fragments of spiritual power in the burial grounds.</p><p></p><p>These undead have no past lives.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, only those who were powerful in their previous lives have a chance of retaining fragments of their memories when they are transformed into undead, and as their ranks rise, their memories from the past will gradually become clearer.</p><p></p><p>The zombie king was one of these undead. And his rank had already reached the mid-king level. His memories from the past had been largely restored.</p><p></p><p>The zombie king thought for a moment and then said with a trembling spiritual consciousness, "It is a common belief that there are no male elves in the elven clan."</p><p></p><p>"But among the elven clan, there is only one type of male elf, and that is the extremely rare Sun Elf."</p><p></p><p>"This type of elf is the template for the Elven King the moment it is born."</p><p></p><p>"When the Elven Empire had not yet fallen, the ruler of the entire elven camp was a Sun Elf King. His strength was so powerful that he could even cover the radiance of the gods."</p><p></p><p>"It was only after an ancient Demon God intervened that this Sun Elf King was finally slain."</p><p></p><p>"And thus the Elven Empire collapsed!"</p><p></p><p>The decaying undead was terrified, "Your Majesty means that he is a Sun Elf King?"</p><p></p><p>The other undead were also filled with dread.</p><p></p><p>The zombie king said, "Clearly, he should have just been born and has not yet truly ascended the throne of the elven clan. Otherwise, this ruin would have long been occupied and guarded by the powerful of the elven clan, protecting their king."</p><p></p><p>"Although the Elven Empire has fallen, the elven clan has not been submerged in history."</p><p></p><p>"They are still scattered throughout the world."</p><p></p><p>"If they learn that a Sun Elf has been born here, they will undoubtedly rush here without hesitation."</p><p></p><p>"However, although he has not truly become the Elven King, he is still a Sun Elf."</p><p></p><p>"The bloodline and talents of the Sun Elves are terrifyingly powerful, their combat strength can rival the purest high-level demonic clans..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the undead present immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Whether to show courtesy or not was secondary.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was that their king did not have the confidence to defeat that "Sun Elf King."</p><p></p><p>Even though one was a king-level and the other was only 9th rank.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty is wise!" said a 9th rank undead knight. "We must show respect to the current Sun Elf King."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"We have just revived, and our strength is at its weakest stage. There is not much benefit in directly confronting a Sun Elf."</p><p></p><p>These words struck a chord with the Zombie King.</p><p></p><p>Having just revived, it did not even possess one-thousandth of its former strength.</p><p></p><p>It indeed did not want to provoke a Sun Elf at this time.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that it realized that if it had discovered this earlier, it would not have even initiated this war, wasting that hundred thousand-strong army.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The decaying undead said, "While that Sun Elf has not yet discovered us, we should leave as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Another undead said, "After leaving, where do we go? Back to the Bone Palace? If that Sun Elf is truly so formidable, they will eventually lead an army of elves to attack us."</p><p></p><p>"We cannot stay in the inner city, nor the outer city."</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King said, "The entire ruin is not a place for us to linger. We must go to the swamp region outside, for that is the paradise of us undead!"</p><p></p><p>The undead looked at each other in silence.</p><p></p><p>Originally, their plan was to gather the undead in the inner city, establish a powerful undead monarch-level force, and then gradually conquer the outer city ruin.</p><p></p><p>But now, their king directly stated that they should distance themselves from the entire ruin.</p><p></p><p>A Sun Elf actually scared their king to this extent?</p><p></p><p>After a moment of silence, an undead said, "We must give in to the Sun Elf. We will follow Your Majesty and leave the ruin."</p><p></p><p>"Well said."</p><p></p><p>The undead all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Without the Zombie King taking the lead, they did not dare to charge into the battlefield. It would be better to obey the Zombie King's orders, as it was just a matter of changing the place to develop their forces.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an undead said with a trembling spiritual consciousness, "Your Majesty, the elves on the battlefield seem a bit strange. Their breakthroughs seem too easy."</p><p></p><p>"So far, I have seen more than ten elves break through their levels in the battle."</p><p></p><p>Normally, a breakthrough in cultivation requires meditation and seclusion in a secluded place.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough during battle is extremely rare and carries risks.</p><p></p><p>But the elves on the battlefield were breaking through their levels one after another, which was truly unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with us."</p><p></p><p>"This group of elves is inherently strange!"</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King had also noticed this earlier, but it did not want to delve deeper into it.</p><p></p><p>It now only wanted to leave this ruin as soon as possible and find a suitable place to properly improve its own strength. In its prime, it was a peak Saint-tier powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The group of undead did not hesitate and followed the Zombie King's massive and terrifying figure as it disappeared into the dark depths.</p><p></p><p>As for the undead army still battling on the square, they had no intention of recalling them.</p><p></p><p>In this world, what is most abundant is undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>Wherever the strength is strong enough, an undead army can be easily gathered.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if they recalled them, it would easily attract the attention of that Sun Elf.</p><p></p><p>It's better to come quietly and leave quietly.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully, they will never meet again in the future.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, that group of undead has retreated."</p><p></p><p>An elven huntress appeared beside Lin Yi and respectfully reported, "The leading Zombie King, whose true body should be the Behemoth of the beast tribe, is not weak in combat power. But for some reason, it did not enter the battlefield and chose to leave."</p><p></p><p>Thousands of years ago, the beast tribe was also an extremely powerful intelligent race.</p><p>The characteristic is that there are many branches.</p><p>The Behemoth tribe belongs to one of the top combat tribes of the beast tribe.</p><p>In the past, all tribes gathered in the capital of the Elven Empire to fight against demons and evil creatures. It is not surprising that undead creatures transformed from the beast tribe's Behemoth appear in the ruin.</p><p></p><p>"Let them leave, no need to pursue."</p><p></p><p>"Clearing the undead creatures on the square is more important."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi waved his wand and responded calmly.</p><p></p><p>The area within a radius of ten kilometers was under the monitoring of the owls, and the figures of the Zombie King's group had been detected long ago.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had originally planned to wait for the Zombie King to enter the battlefield and then immediately send it a version 9.0 Flame Spear. With his magical destructive power, it would at least be a heavy blow, if not an instant kill.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, that Zombie did not know why it changed its mind and did not give him that opportunity.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

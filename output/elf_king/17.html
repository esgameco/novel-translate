        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The fireball released by Lin Yishi was several meters in diameter, exaggeratedly large, and with terrifying power, instantly annihilating hundreds of undead creatures. This immediately attracted the attention of many high-level undead.</p><p></p><p>"A spirit, a male one?"</p><p></p><p>"And he's a level 9 fire mage!"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't all elves female? How can there be a male elf?"</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't matter, charge in!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill all the elves, topple the Tree of Life!"</p><p></p><p>High-level undead were issuing orders, shaking their spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The vast undead army surged towards the gathered elf legion in the central square, carrying countless magical attacks and a dense barrage of arrows.</p><p></p><p>During the process, a large number of undead creatures fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Especially the magic skills from over a hundred elf mages inflicted massive casualties on the undead army.</p><p></p><p>But even so, the undead army did not retreat a single step.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the two armies collided.</p><p></p><p>The metallic clanging sounds were dense and piercing.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of elf swordsmen formed a solid defense line, stubbornly resisting the undead army's charge. Even the undead knights charging in were forcefully cut down from their mounts.</p><p></p><p>Each elf swordsman possessed superb sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Their figures were agile, flashing past with afterimages, weaving through the enemy's blades and swords.</p><p></p><p>The sharp elf swords in their hands traced out dazzling sword lights.</p><p></p><p>In no time, a large pile of dismembered undead bodies accumulated around them.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the number of undead creatures was simply too many.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more undead poured into the battlefield, and under the command of some high-level undead, they surrounded the elf legion.</p><p></p><p>The elf legion could only be forced to change their formation.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the elf legion's formation was square, with the elf swordsmen at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>Now the formation had become circular.</p><p></p><p>The elf swordsmen still stood at the outer perimeter, guarding the elf archers and elf mages in the inner circle.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, the difference may not seem significant, but it was actually very disadvantageous for the elf swordsmen, as their defensive line was now longer, and they had to face more enemies at the same time.</p><p></p><p>The only good news was that the destructive power of the elf mages was quite astonishing.</p><p></p><p>The high-level magic they unleashed could kill a massive number of undead creatures every second.</p><p></p><p>And with the elf fountain replenishing their mana, they could continuously cast various magical skills without worrying about depletion, constantly increasing the casualties of the undead army.</p><p></p><p>This could greatly alleviate the pressure on the elf swordsmen.</p><p></p><p>As for the elf archers, most of their attention was focused on the sky.</p><p></p><p>As the elf mages shifted their attack targets, the threat from above could only be left for them to resolve.</p><p></p><p>"This is a highly elite elf legion."</p><p></p><p>"Every elf has excellent equipment and rich combat experience."</p><p></p><p>"So far, we have lost over 50,000 undead..."</p><p></p><p>In the rear of the battlefield, a group of undead mages wielding bone staves were communicating through their spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"What we undead fear the least is elite forces!"</p><p></p><p>"We can just wear them down!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said!"</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, a group of undead mages simultaneously waved their bone staves, releasing a swath of eerie green light.</p><p></p><p>Where the light passed, piles of undead creatures rose from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Some were healed undead, while others were newly revived undead.</p><p></p><p>At this time, there were many fragments of soul fire scattered across the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, these soul fire fragments would gradually dissipate and return to the world's origin.</p><p></p><p>But under the guidance of the undead mages' necromancy, these soul fire fragments converged and fused with the nearby remains, ultimately transforming into new undead.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the most terrifying aspects of the undead.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Though appearing fragile, the "vitality" of the Tree of Life is extremely tenacious. "The Tree of Life is the spiritual pillar of the elves."</p><p></p><p>"We should send a group of undead to cut down the Tree of Life, to crush the morale of those elves."</p><p></p><p>"There are two giant trees there, which one is the Tree of Life?"</p><p></p><p>"Who cares, let's just cut down both!"</p><p></p><p>"Makes sense!"</p><p></p><p>On the order, a large number of undead creatures immediately swarmed towards the distant Tree of Life and the War Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi, who was at the center of the battlefield, also saw this scene.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not take it to heart.</p><p></p><p>Because he had taken precautionary measures in advance.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, just as the undead approached the two ancient trees, a series of towering flame pillars suddenly erupted around the War Ancient Tree, within a radius of hundreds of meters.</p><p></p><p>The undead were caught off guard and were burned to ashes in large numbers.</p><p></p><p>This was a magical trap set up by the elf huntresses.</p><p></p><p>And it was very dense, directly protecting the War Ancient Tree at the center, even high-level undead could not break through the flame pillars to attack the War Ancient Tree.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tree of Life, there were no flame pillars.</p><p></p><p>This attracted a large number of surviving undead creatures to surround it.</p><p></p><p>But the result was, no matter how hard they tried, they could not harm the Tree of Life at all, and instead received the mockery of the little elves hiding in the tree.</p><p></p><p>The Tree of Life is the core building of the territory.</p><p></p><p>The system had told Lin Yi earlier that before the other buildings in the territory were destroyed, the Tree of Life would be in an invincible state. Not to mention a group of mid-to-low-level undead creatures, even saints or demigods would not be able to touch a single leaf of the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Lin Yi did not have the elf huntresses set up magical traps around the Tree of Life.</p><p></p><p>As long as the War Ancient Tree was protected, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>If the War Ancient Tree was cut down, he would still have to consume energy crystals to rebuild it.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then summoned an elf huntress and said to her, "Find a way to cross the battlefield and eliminate those undead mages, they cannot be allowed to continuously revive the undead on the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Your Majesty!" The elf huntress bowed and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, dozens of beautiful figures riding on swift panthers gathered together, and then tore through the ranks of the undead army like sharp arrows.</p><p></p><p>During the process, a team of high-level undead knights came to intercept them.</p><p></p><p>But they were instantly pierced through by the elf huntresses.</p><p></p><p>With their ninth-tier level, plus the ninth-tier magical beast mount Swift Panther, this combat power was simply something the undead knights could not withstand.</p><p></p><p>They were defeated in a single encounter.</p><p></p><p>Those who were slower were torn to shreds along with their undead mounts by the elf huntresses.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! They're targeting us!" </p><p></p><p>"Retreat!"</p><p></p><p>The undead mages summoned more undead creatures to intercept, while retreating with their companions towards the darkness outside the square.</p><p></p><p>The Zombie King they served was hiding in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh...</p><p></p><p>Countless bone spikes came piercing through the air.</p><p></p><p>This was the magic cast by the undead mages.</p><p></p><p>The elf huntresses swung their short blades, precisely shattering all the bone spikes, and then without slowing down, continued the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the elf huntresses finally intercepted a group of undead mages at the edge of the square, and without further ado, raised their slaughter blades.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, save us!"</p><p></p><p>Some undead mages cried out for help from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely visible.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, a pair of ghostly green flames were floating.</p><p></p><p>However, until all the undead mages present were slain, the reinforcements from the darkness did not appear.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the Zombie King never intervened.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

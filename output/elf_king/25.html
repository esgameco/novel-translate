        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This trip to the treasure vault was not in vain after all."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had already left the treasure vault and returned to the surface.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sun spirit king's scepter in his hand, which seemed to be made of white jade, he grew more and more satisfied with it.</p><p></p><p>The scepter was engraved with the floral patterns of the spirit clan, and the top was inlaid with a jade-green magic gem, which seemed to be an extremely rare life gem.</p><p></p><p>The entire scepter looked very exquisite and magnificent.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to significantly enhancing the power of my magic skills..."</p><p></p><p>"It also has an extremely important symbolic meaning."</p><p></p><p>"This is the scepter of the Sun Spirit King, representing the highest authority of the spirit camp, as well as the power to judge evil and dark forces!"</p><p></p><p>"Now, the only thing I lack is strength!"</p><p></p><p>A king-level Sun Spirit King is indeed a bit embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>After all, one must be at least a demigod.</p><p></p><p>The previous Sun Spirit King was an immortal deity who could fight against ancient demon gods.</p><p></p><p>Although he was ultimately defeated, he still displayed unparalleled power in this world.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi wants to become the true Sun Spirit King and rule the spirit camp, so he naturally cannot be too weak.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I can go hunting now."</p><p></p><p>Holding the scepter, Lin Yi walked towards the distant ruins.</p><p></p><p>The magic staff that the old tree had made for him had already been put away.</p><p></p><p>Until he obtains a more powerful or more suitable magic wand, this Sun Spirit King's scepter will be his personal magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>As for the repair, he'll deal with it later.</p><p></p><p>Three hundred million energy crystals are not even enough for the upkeep of his entire domain.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the ruins.</p><p></p><p>A fire spirit dragon dozens of meters long was coiled in the sky, its roars echoing with dragon cries.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the fire spirit dragon was a raging sea of flames.</p><p></p><p>Numerous demonic beasts were struggling within the sea of fire, quickly turning to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"The roar of the fire dragon has increased its destructive power and range by at least five times!"</p><p></p><p>"It is truly a divine artifact!"</p><p></p><p>"Even though it is already damaged and its power is only a thousandth of its former glory, it is still far beyond the capabilities of ordinary magical equipment."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then tested out his other magic skills.</p><p></p><p>With the amplification of the Sun Spirit King's scepter, the power of each of his magic skills had increased dramatically. Even a low-level spell like Fireball could now rival the previous Fire Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>"Clothes make the man, and the saddle makes the horse."</p><p></p><p>"With the enhancement of this equipment, my strength will naturally grow as well."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi grinned and continued to clear the demonic beasts from the ruins.</p><p></p><p>After some time, a towering city wall suddenly appeared in his field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The wall was a deep blue-black color, over a hundred meters high, and covered in countless vines.</p><p></p><p>Many places had collapsed, revealing gaps leading to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>"That's the inner city wall!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi walked straight towards it.</p><p></p><p>He found a staircase and climbed to the top of the wall.</p><p></p><p>Since he had not yet reached the transcendent level and was not a wind mage, he did not have the ability to fly.</p><p></p><p>"This is truly a world of swords and magic..."</p><p></p><p>"The quality of this city wall is really impressive, withstanding thousands of years without weathering. Even the collapsed sections were not due to the erosion of time, but the result of past wars."</p><p></p><p>"The remaining walls are still as solid as ever."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unbelievable! </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi knew that the massive stones used to build this city wall were not ordinary rocks, but were manufactured through magical means, with a large amount of magical materials added.</p><p></p><p>The physical and magical resistance were both extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Because when he fired a fireball over 10 meters in diameter at the wall, it had no effect whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>If it were ordinary stones, they would have been melted long ago.</p><p></p><p>"I want to turn this ancient city ruin into my main base, and a city wall like this is naturally indispensable."</p><p></p><p>"After clearing the ruins in the inner city and expanding my domain, I'll find an opportunity to repair this city wall. Not only can it protect my territory, but it can also withstand attacks from the evil forces outside the city."</p><p></p><p>"And not just the city wall, I also need to find a way to set up a magical barrier that covers the entire inner city."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the city wall can only defend against those monsters that cannot fly."</p><p></p><p>"Only with both the city wall and the magical barrier can my domain be provided with comprehensive protection!"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Lin Yi's mind was racing as he considered many things.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi turned his gaze towards the outside of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, there were vast stretches of dense forests, with countless tall and thick ancient trees, and even mountains of white bones, with hardly any visible ruins of buildings.</p><p></p><p>However, in the midst of those dense forests, he could vaguely see scattered, village-like structures.</p><p></p><p>"The forests are teeming with magical beasts and monsters."</p><p></p><p>"The mountains of white bones are the stronghold of the undead. Even during the day, those areas are swarming with a massive number of undead."</p><p></p><p>"As for those village-like strongholds..."</p><p></p><p>"They were established by the evil faction's intelligent races."</p><p></p><p>"The vast majority of them are Lizardmen!"</p><p></p><p>Long ago, when Lin Yi used the power of the ancient trees to overlook the entire ancient city ruin, he had already grasped the general situation of the outer city.</p><p></p><p>So when he saw the completely different scenery of the outer city compared to the inner city, he was not surprised at all.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a flock of birds suddenly took flight from the dense forest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked up, and soon discovered that there were many figures darting about in that forest.</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes, those figures emerged from the forest and headed straight for a breach in the distant city wall.</p><p></p><p>"They are indeed Lizardmen!"</p><p></p><p>After recognizing those figures, Lin Yi murmured.</p><p></p><p>Lizardmen, the intelligent beings of the evil faction.</p><p></p><p>They have lizard-like heads and tails, but can stand and walk on two feet like humans. Their front limbs have also evolved into arms similar to human ones.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Lizardmen's bodies are covered in a layer of black scales.</p><p></p><p>Especially on their backs, the scales are the hardest.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yi's gaze, hundreds of Lizardmen began to move the piles of rubble accumulated at the breach in the city wall, and a Lizardman holding a wooden staff was shouting, "You useless trash, hurry up! We must finish reinforcing the wall of our tribe before the Blood Moon arrives. Whoever dares to slack off, I'll be the first to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"Blood Moon?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He had actually forgotten about this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he recalled the rat plague from two months ago.</p><p></p><p>The Calamity of the Blood Moon is a disaster that sweeps across the entire Dark Continent.</p><p></p><p>It occurs once every three months.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the Blood Moon appears, the evil powers of the abyss will ravage the entire Dark Continent, causing countless living beings to descend into madness.</p><p></p><p>The lower the intelligence, the more severe the madness.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those magical beasts, they are the most susceptible to the influence of the Blood Moon. The "severe patients" may even transform into Demonic Servants.</p><p></p><p>Demonic Servants, also known as Magicbanes! (End of this chapter)</p>

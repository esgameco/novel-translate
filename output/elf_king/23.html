        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Information about the treasury of the capital of the Elven Kingdom was only revealed to Lin Yi after the old tree told him about it.</p><p></p><p>It was not that the old tree intentionally wanted to keep it a secret.</p><p></p><p>It was because when the Elven Empire collapsed, the entire capital was completely looted, let alone the national treasury. Finding even half a gold coin in there would be considered good luck for Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the old tree did not voluntarily mention anything about the treasury.</p><p></p><p>He thought Lin Yi would just be wasting his time.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was eager about the treasury, as he also wanted to try his luck.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew the treasury might be as clean as his face, he still couldn't help but feel unsatisfied if he didn't go take a look.</p><p></p><p>"The old tree said the treasury is under the governor's mansion."</p><p></p><p>"But it has long been buried under the ruins of the buildings..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi released his spiritual consciousness to search the bone palace and the surrounding architectural ruins.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"It must be buried quite deep."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't matter, I'll dig three feet deep today to find the entrance to the treasury."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lin Yi waved his magic wand.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a fireball nearly 10 meters in diameter rapidly flew towards the bone palace in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Now that Lin Yi had reached the king-level, the power of the magic he wielded had become much stronger.</p><p></p><p>As the fireball hit the bone palace, a huge rumbling sound immediately rang out.</p><p></p><p>It was accompanied by a terrifying wave of fire surging in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In the wake of the fire wave, whether it was the architectural ruins or the white bones, everything was reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then continuously released several more fireballs, quickly destroying the bone palace and burning the surrounding architectural ruins clean.</p><p></p><p>When the flames subsided, what appeared before Lin Yi was a vast expanse of scorched black earth.</p><p></p><p>There was no sign of any treasury entrance.</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Yi did not give up. He waved his magic wand again.</p><p></p><p>In moments, dozens of over 20-meter-long fire dragons appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Although these fire dragons were magical constructs, they still exuded an indescribable aura of power.</p><p></p><p>Under Lin Yi's control, several fire dragons swooped down from the sky, slamming into the blackened ground.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the earth trembled and roared. Terrifying waves of fire mixed with billowing smoke swept across hundreds of meters, even engulfing Lin Yi, making him disappear from sight.</p><p></p><p>It was only after a long time that the flames finally subsided.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's figure then reappeared, completely unharmed. Even his robes were untouched.</p><p></p><p>The flames had automatically parted ways when they were just a few meters away from him.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi walked to the area attacked by the fire dragons, where a crater over 200 meters in diameter had formed.</p><p></p><p>After searching for a long time, he finally found a sunken spot.</p><p></p><p>Clearing away the debris in the sunken area, a dim passageway appeared in his field of vision.</p><p></p><p>The passageway was several meters in diameter, clearly man-made.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it have stairs leading deep inside, but the two sides of the passageway also had long-extinguished bronze candle holders, now covered in cobwebs and dust.</p><p></p><p>"This is it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi waved his magic wand, and a half-meter diameter fireball appeared at the tip, illuminating the way forward.</p><p></p><p>He followed the stairs and walked into the depths of the passageway.</p><p></p><p>The passageway was not long, only about a hundred meters.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the passageway, Lin Yi found himself in a slightly larger space, facing a stone door. One side of the door was completely open, while the other side was shattered.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true main entrance to the treasury."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi approached the open stone door and ran his hand over it.</p><p></p><p>He could faintly see a faint glow on the surface of the stone door.</p><p></p><p>"This is the magical seal of the Elven Clan, able to withstand magical attacks and verify Elven bloodline... Unfortunately, the magical seal here is already damaged and decayed, its power almost completely dissipated."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lin Yi seemed to have thought of something.</p><p></p><p>He communicated with the system and asked, "How much energy crystal is needed to repair the magical restriction on this?"</p><p></p><p>—— [This is a magical restriction set up by a group of demigod-level powerhouses. Repairing it requires 300,000 energy crystals.]</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi rolled his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had wanted to repair the magical restriction and see if he could learn something from it.</p><p></p><p>Since he had the system, he didn't need a brain to learn things.</p><p></p><p>But upon hearing the system's response, he immediately abandoned the idea.</p><p></p><p>The magical restriction set up by demigods must contain a vast amount of "knowledge," but he'll wait until he has the money to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he can't afford it!</p><p></p><p>He then passed through the stone gate and entered the treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely vast underground cave. Lin Yi summoned more than ten huge fireballs and placed them above the cave, but still could not illuminate the entire expanse.</p><p></p><p>"Back in the day, this place must have been filled with the treasures of the Elven Empire."</p><p></p><p>"Countless gold coins, gems, magic metals, gold and silver vessels..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi murmured as he walked through the dim treasure vault, summoning a giant fireball every so often to light up the surrounding area.</p><p></p><p>Under his perfect control, the fireballs remained suspended above the vault, unwavering as long as his magic power held out.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Lin Yi had finally finished exploring the entire treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>Just as the old tree had said, he couldn't even find a single gold coin.</p><p></p><p>The items in the treasure vault had been completely looted, leaving not even a single broken remnant behind.</p><p></p><p>"Damn demons and evil races."</p><p></p><p>"If only they had left behind even a little bit of debris!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi complained. With the system backing him up, as long as he could afford the energy crystals, he could repair anything.</p><p></p><p>But the entire treasure vault was nothing but dust on the floor - cleaner than even his own face.</p><p></p><p>He searched the corners reluctantly one more time, but still came up empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems easy wealth is not so easily obtained after all."</p><p></p><p>"I should just go back and develop my territory honestly..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi adjusted his disappointed mood, preparing to leave the treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>Not being able to find the "legacy" of the Elven Empire was disappointing, but not too difficult to accept. The old tree had warned him earlier, and he had mentally prepared himself.</p><p></p><p>But just at that moment, Lin Yi suddenly noticed specks of starlight appearing before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>These starlights had no trace of magical fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>He tried to touch them with his magic wand, but they passed through as if they were illusions.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, more and more of these starlights emerged from the ground beneath him, floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was puzzled and confused, his body instinctively leaning towards the stone gate, ready to flee at the slightest sign of danger.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, to Lin Yi's utter astonishment, the floating starlights began to merge with each other, gradually revealing illusory figures.</p><p></p><p>These figures included beautiful and pure elves, towering tree people, dazzling and colorful fairy dragons, snow-white unicorns, and a giant bird burning with golden flames.</p><p></p><p>"That giant bird..."</p><p></p><p>"It should be the Phoenix Guardian mentioned by the old tree."</p><p></p><p>"Also belonging to the Elven faction, with terrifying combat power!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi took a deep breath, the scene before him was too fantastical.</p><p></p><p>And as time passed, more and more figures appeared, all belonging to the Elven faction. He also saw Elven dragons, forest giants, elemental spirits, flower spirits, and more.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

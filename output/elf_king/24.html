        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every figure was formed by the gathering of countless stars, emanating a bright radiance. Even without the suspended celestial orb, they could illuminate the entire treasury.</p><p></p><p>"What are they?"</p><p></p><p>"Ghosts? No, there are no fluctuations of magical power, nor the slightest trace of evil aura."</p><p></p><p>"Nor are they real intelligent life forms."</p><p></p><p>"They resemble projections, seemingly within reach, but in reality, they are illusory."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi pondered in his heart, but could not determine what they were.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he possessed a system, so he directly inquired.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he received a reply from the system - [Host, they are neither undead nor living beings of this world, but rather Heroic Spirits. A product of spiritual will, or the power of the mind.]</p><p></p><p>The system then provided Lin Yi with detailed information about the Heroic Spirits.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Lin Yi finally understood.</p><p></p><p>"Every intelligent life form has a unique soul and physical body."</p><p></p><p>"This is the basic foundation of life."</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, intelligent beings possess the power of spiritual will. This thing, though seemingly ethereal, is indeed real. When the power of spiritual will reaches a certain level of strength, it can manifest as Heroic Spirits... of course, after the original body has perished."</p><p></p><p>"To put it simply."</p><p></p><p>"It means that although the soul and body have perished, the will lives on in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"The system says that in special circumstances, Heroic Spirits can appear. However, the Heroic Spirits before me are only the initial manifestation of spiritual will, and they cannot yet influence reality."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi looked at the dense Heroic Spirits before him.</p><p></p><p>"Special circumstances..."</p><p></p><p>"The only special circumstance here is me."</p><p></p><p>"It should be related to me being a Solar Elf."</p><p></p><p>At that moment,</p><p></p><p>The dense Heroic Spirits suddenly turned their gaze towards Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, they knelt down before him.</p><p></p><p>There were countless beautiful elves, as well as groups of unicorns, treants, forest giants, elf dragons, and phoenix guardians...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi knew that they were worshipping him.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were elves or the intelligent beings belonging to the elf faction, they were all kneeling before him, the "Solar Elf King".</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Yi could not hear what they were saying, he could understand the expressions in the Heroic Spirits' eyes, filled with endless sorrow, but at the same time, excitement, as if they had found hope.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi felt a sense of sadness in his heart.</p><p></p><p>These Heroic Spirits must have been the citizens of the Elf Empire who sacrificed themselves in that war.</p><p></p><p>Their souls may have already departed to the underworld.</p><p></p><p>Their physical bodies have long since perished.</p><p></p><p>But their spiritual will has endured, waiting for him, or rather, waiting for a Solar Elf.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years, they have finally found what they were waiting for, their inextinguishable spiritual will manifesting as Heroic Spirits before him.</p><p></p><p>"Rise!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi raised his hand with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>He held these Heroic Spirits in the utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>To persist and wait for thousands of years, what a powerful spiritual will was required to achieve this? Without an unwavering belief, they would have long since disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Heroic Spirits slowly rose.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the sorrow in their eyes had vanished, replaced only by unyielding determination.</p><p></p><p>Some of the beautiful elves even raised their weapons...</p><p></p><p>And the dragon-like creatures and phoenix guardians roared towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi understood, and spoke solemnly, "Rest assured, I will become the Solar Elf King of this era, restoring the faith of the elf faction, expelling demons and evil beings, and rebuilding the mighty Elf Empire!"</p><p></p><p>"The vengeance for the downfall of the ancient Elf Empire, I will wash away with the blood of demons and evil races!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Heroic Spirits erupted in excited cries.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although silent, their excitement and fervor could be seen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spirit warriors knelt before Lin Yi again and did not get up for a long time. Until the end, their bodies gradually dissipated and finally merged back into the earth as countless stars.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Lin Yi couldn't help but sigh, "The person has passed away, but the spirit lives on. Even time cannot erase that steadfast belief... Damn those demons, one day I'll destroy them!"</p><p></p><p>Now, he has become the lord of the elven camp. </p><p></p><p>Sneakily becoming a god and staying away from the turmoil is obviously not very likely.</p><p></p><p>There will be a battle in the future.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lin Yi suddenly found that brilliant light lines were appearing on the floor of the treasure vault, quickly outlining a huge magic array.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's gaze was fixed on the magic array.</p><p></p><p>His instinct told him that he was about to harvest a surprise.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as the magic array successfully activated, a dazzling golden light slowly appeared at the center. Floating in that golden light was a magic staff that was entirely white jade-like.</p><p></p><p>"I knew this trip wouldn't be in vain!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was overjoyed: "Although the treasure vault has been completely looted, there are still imperial legacies left for me. This magic staff must be extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the magic array disappeared. The white jade-like magic staff was still floating in midair.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately walked up and grasped the magic staff in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, countless ancient information appeared in his mind, not only including the details of the magic staff in his hand, but also many secrets about the war that took place back then.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!" </p><p></p><p>"One by one, they are not good things. I'll get rid of you all sooner or later!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi cursed angrily.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at the white jade magic staff in his hand...</p><p></p><p>"The Scepter of the Sun Elf King!"</p><p></p><p>"It represents the highest authority of the Elven Empire, even the entire elven camp!"</p><p></p><p>"Back then, when the Sun Elf King was surrounded and killed by the demon gods, he used spatial divine power to seal this scepter in the treasure vault. Only the pure-blooded Sun Elves can break the seal."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately I came, otherwise this scepter would have remained sealed..."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, the Sun Elf King's Scepter was the mightiest divine artifact in the Dark Continent."</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, it was severed by those demon gods!"</p><p></p><p>The complete Sun Elf King's Scepter was about 1.8 meters long, but now it barely reaches 1 meter. At the end of the scepter, there is an obvious fracture, showing that it was forcibly cut by a sharp weapon.</p><p></p><p>"This scepter has long lost the might of the divine artifact of the past."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the divine artifact's spirit, the inherent divine power laws, or the magical divine patterns, they have all disintegrated and disappeared. Only the lifeless half-staff remains..."</p><p></p><p>"However, the materials used to forge the scepter are all divine-level."</p><p></p><p>"Even though it no longer has the power of a divine artifact, it can still greatly enhance the power of my magical skills."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining this Sun Elf King's Scepter, his strength will undergo earth-shattering changes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, for others, a complete divine artifact and a broken divine artifact are completely different concepts. If they obtain the latter, they will be heartbroken, because repairing a divine artifact is harder than ascending to the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But for him, it's just a matter of how much energy crystal it will cost.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi asked, "System, how many energy crystals are needed to repair this scepter?"</p><p></p><p>——【Three million】.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's smile instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He retracted his previous idea, and now he too was heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

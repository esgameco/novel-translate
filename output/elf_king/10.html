        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Forgotten Swamp was not yet a swamp.</p><p></p><p>The distant Dark Forest was not yet called the Dark Forest.</p><p></p><p>These regions were once part of the territory ruled by the Elven Empire.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Forgotten Swamp, which was the core domain of the Elven Empire.</p><p></p><p>From where one falls, one should get up from there.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, many regions of the Dark Continent have already been occupied by evil and dark creatures, such as the Dark Forest, which has now become the domain of evil races like the Drow and Cyclopes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the forces of demons are deeply rooted in those regions.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Western Sea and the Far Northern Icy Region, one can see the presence of demons.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the Forgotten Swamp is relatively safer.</p><p></p><p>Although there are still many evil and dark creatures living here, at least demons rarely appear... This is what the ancient tree told Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>So, this place is very suitable for him to establish his main base.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Demon Clan is extremely terrible.</p><p></p><p>Even the holy angels have been defeated.</p><p></p><p>Before he has enough strength, Lin Yi does not want to be targeted by the Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, you can venture out of the square appropriately."</p><p></p><p>With the increase in his strength, Lin Yi's courage has also grown.</p><p></p><p>He said to his elven followers: "Form several teams and hunt the undead creatures that appear near the square. Remember to take turns resting and recovering your consumed magic power."</p><p></p><p>Nighttime belongs to the evil and dark creatures.</p><p></p><p>At night, a large number of undead will appear in the ruins, which is very difficult to see during the day, at least in the inner city ruins.</p><p></p><p>Hunting magical beasts and monsters during the day requires searching all over the place.</p><p></p><p>At night, just by making some noise, you can attract a large number of undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>As long as you are careful, you can definitely harvest a lot.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, Your Majesty!" </p><p></p><p>The elves respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, they gathered into several teams and went into the darkness outside the square.</p><p></p><p>About forty elves were left behind, as Lin Yi had instructed.</p><p></p><p>Under his command, these elves began to engage in large-scale construction, building wooden houses in the square.</p><p></p><p>The little elves were also helping.</p><p></p><p>They used their meager magic power to lend a hand to the working elves.</p><p></p><p>Today, the little elves had collected a large amount of wood from the ruins, so building dozens of wooden houses was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, there will be even more little elves joining the resource collection work.</p><p></p><p>The supply of wood will be endless.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had also asked the system whether he could use the system's power to build the wooden houses, similar to constructing the Tree of Life or the Ancient War Tree. </p><p></p><p>By paying some energy crystals, the construction could be completed instantly, which would be very convenient.</p><p></p><p>But the system gave a negative response, stating that it only provides construction and upgrades for [Special Domain Buildings], and ordinary buildings like wooden houses need to be handled by the lord himself.</p><p></p><p>Well, Lin Yi can only do it himself then.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the elves under his command are all professionals with magic power.</p><p></p><p>Using magic power to cut, stack, and reinforce the wood is very convenient.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, one wooden house after another appeared on the square.</p><p></p><p>The elves even carved many elven-style patterns on the exterior of the wooden houses, making the neatly arranged houses look more exquisite.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the bricks and stones laid on the square were also carefully polished by the elves.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spirits stripped away the soil, exposing the earth beneath.</p><p></p><p>Some elves asked Lin Yi for permission, hoping to plant some fresh flowers and green grass around the wooden houses to beautify the living environment... This request was naturally granted by Lin Yi, as he also hoped his domain would be beautiful.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time arrived at the dead of night.</p><p></p><p>The elves had built a total of more than fifty wooden houses. </p><p></p><p>Each wooden house had two floors, with three rooms on each floor, easily accommodating more than a dozen elves.</p><p></p><p>"For now, we'll just build these wooden houses."</p><p></p><p>"Later, after occupying the inner city and even the entire relic, we can consider a comprehensive reconstruction plan."</p><p></p><p>His domain in the future will definitely not be like this.</p><p></p><p>All the buildings must be exquisite and perfect.</p><p></p><p>He not only wants to build a powerful domain, but also make his domain the most beautiful place in the entire Dark Continent. Even the wild grass by the roadside must grow beautifully.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A new day has arrived.</p><p></p><p>The elves have also tallied up their nighttime harvests.</p><p></p><p>In total, they harvested over 9,000 energy crystals and roughly eliminated over 20,000 undead creatures.</p><p></p><p>The undead appearing near the square have basically been cleared out by the elves.</p><p></p><p>However, this was only last night.</p><p></p><p>By tonight, new undead will appear in this area again. As long as the evil and dark forces beneath the relic have not been eliminated, the undead will continue to be born endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Even the ancient tree does not know how many skeletons are buried beneath the relic.</p><p></p><p>Among them are not only elves, but also other intelligent beings of different races.</p><p></p><p>Humans, dwarves, beast tribes, gnomes, and so on.</p><p></p><p>This place is not only the capital of the Elven Empire, but also a very important battlefield where the allied forces of various races once resisted the invasion of the demonic race and evil beings.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, if the ancient tree had not been consuming its power to suppress the evil and dark forces underground, the number of undead beings born would have been even greater, many times more.</p><p></p><p>The over 9,000 energy crystals harvested were, as usual, used by Lin Yi to train elven swordsmen and elven archers.</p><p></p><p>He obtained nearly 200 elven troops.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the number of elven troops under his command has reached more than 500.</p><p></p><p>The progress of Task One is half complete.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi plans to upgrade the War Ancient Tree and unlock new troop types after completing Task One. After all, upgrading the War Ancient Tree requires a large amount of energy crystals, which will delay the completion of the task.</p><p></p><p>The reward for Task One is the unlocking of the [Mana Spring]. He urgently needs this building.</p><p></p><p>The reason is simple.</p><p></p><p>The elven spring water condensed by the Mana Spring can quickly restore the mana of the elven troops, indirectly improving their hunting efficiency.</p><p></p><p>If there are injured elves, the elven spring water can also be used for rapid healing.</p><p></p><p>"If all goes well," </p><p></p><p>"the harvests during the day today will be enough for me to gather a thousand elven troops!"</p><p></p><p>Compared to the just over a hundred elven troops hunting yesterday, the number of elven troops today has quadrupled, so the harvests will naturally be much greater.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the morning, after the elves leave the domain in batches, Lin Yi also prepares to start his day's hunting work.</p><p></p><p>Before that, he has bred new little elves.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the number of little elves in his domain has reached more than 1,600.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the dazzling little elves shining like stars in the sky, Lin Yi couldn't help but feel a surge of heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>As long as he trains all these little elves, he will have an elven army of over 2,000 in number, and he can soon reclaim the ancient city relic.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

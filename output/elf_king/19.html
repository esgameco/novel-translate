        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The army of 100,000 undead spirits was finally successfully eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few high-level undead spirits with a bit of intelligence who managed to escape, the rest of the undead spirits were completely wiped out.</p><p></p><p>The participating elves almost all leveled up.</p><p></p><p>They generally reached the 7th rank.</p><p></p><p>There were also more than 200 elf soldiers who had advanced to the 8th rank.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, there were five elves who had reached the 9th rank.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's rank also increased, entering the initial stage of the King Rank.</p><p></p><p>At the King Rank level, one can be considered to have surpassed the scope of ordinary professionals and be barely qualified to be called a local strongman, eligible to establish a small force, just like the Zombie King.</p><p></p><p>In general, the overall strength of Lin Yi's domain has greatly increased after this war. If a few more such battles were to occur, it would be easy for his elf legion to sweep across the entire inner city ruins.</p><p></p><p>However, while the gains were substantial, there were also casualties.</p><p></p><p>The number of injured elves is not mentioned, but with the elf spring water, they can recover in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The main issue was the fallen elf soldiers. After a thorough count, Lin Yi learned that 47 elf soldier types had perished in this battle, most of them being the elf swordsmen at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>They faced the onslaught of the undead army and suffered the most severe losses.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Tree of Life has the ability to revive the fallen elves. Whenever an elf soldier dies on the battlefield, their body disintegrates into pure elemental energy, and their soul returns to the Tree of Life, directly transforming into a young elf.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi only needs to consume a bit of energy crystal to revive them. After being revived, their previous memories remain, with the only issue being that their level resets to the initial stage. But with the "kill enemies to gain experience" ability, their levels can quickly rise again.</p><p></p><p>As usual, some elves cleaned up the battlefield and collected the energy crystals that had dropped. Another group of elves transported the undead corpses to be incinerated by elf mages with mastery of fire elemental magic, greatly easing the cleanup process.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the post-battle cleanup work was completed. The elves handed over the 98,300 energy crystals they had collected to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were also more than 500 relatively complete and reusable weapons and equipment.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi praised the elves and instructed them to have everyone drink elf spring water, whether to heal injuries or restore magic power.</p><p></p><p>After the elves left, Lin Yi opened the system task interface and found that the task of "hunting 1,000 monsters of level 5 or above" had been completed. He had successfully unlocked the domain building - the "Divine Bestowed Temple".</p><p></p><p>If it had not been for the ongoing battle, Lin Yi would have immediately constructed the Divine Bestowed Temple to see what functions it possessed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bestowed Temple is described as a special building that can comprehensively enhance the domain's war capabilities, with an initial construction requirement of level 1.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Thousands of Energy Crystals】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Comprehensively enhance the power of the domain?"</p><p>"This building is great!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately found an open space near the Tree of Life and constructed the Divine Bestowed Palace.</p><p></p><p>Just as the name suggests.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bestowed Palace is a palace-type building.</p><p></p><p>Although its scale is not large, it emanates a faint golden glow, making it clear that it is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>【Divine Bestowed Palace】</p><p>【Building Information: The Divine Bestowed Palace is indispensable for a domain to become stronger.】</p><p>【Level: Low】</p><p>【Currently Unlocked Reinforcement Categories: Troop Types - Low Physical Attack, Low Physical Defense, Low Magic Attack, Low Magic Defense】</p><p>【Upgrade Requirement: 10,000 Energy Crystals】</p><p>【Special Prompt: Upgrading the level of the Divine Bestowed Palace can unlock more reinforcement categories and improve reinforcement levels.】</p><p>【Note: Reinforcement levels for different troop professions do not share.】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>【Low Physical Attack: Strengthens the physical attack of the corresponding troop profession by one fold, requires 50,000 Energy Crystals.】</p><p>【Low Physical Defense: Strengthens the physical defense of the corresponding troop profession by one fold, requires 50,000 Energy Crystals.】</p><p>【Low Magic Attack: ...】</p><p>【Low Magic Defense: ...】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The ability to strengthen both the physical and magical attack and defense is indeed comprehensive."</p><p>"Moreover, this is just a part of the categories."</p><p>"As the level of the Divine Bestowed Palace increases, more reinforcement domains can be unlocked, and it's possible that buildings may also be reinforced."</p><p>"Additionally, even the low-level reinforcement can provide a full one-fold increase."</p><p>"It's truly overpowered!"</p><p>"The only downside is that it's a bit expensive..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi sighed.</p><p>The nearly 100,000 Energy Crystals he had just obtained on the battlefield were enough for only about two reinforcements, and this is just the low-level reinforcement.</p><p>When the "Intermediate Reinforcement" and "Advanced Reinforcement" come out, they will undoubtedly be more expensive.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then communicated with the system to fully understand the reinforcement function of the Divine Bestowed Palace.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, a reinforcement lasts for life.</p><p>For example, if Lin Yi performs a "Low Physical Attack Reinforcement" for the Elven Archer troop, then not only the existing Elven Archers, but also any Elven Archers trained in the future, will permanently carry this aura buff.</p><p>The same applies to other troop types, but the reinforcements do not share across different troop types.</p><p></p><p>"The reinforcement function of the Divine Bestowed Palace is more beneficial the more troop types I have."</p><p>"But my current troop types are still too few."</p><p>"Even the most numerous Elven Archers are only a few hundred."</p><p>"Spending 50,000 Energy Crystals on a single reinforcement is better used to train and expand the Elven Archers to a thousand."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi plans to wait until the number of a certain troop type reaches the thousands, and then perform the reinforcement. Before that, he will focus on training more troop types.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still has a task to accomplish.</p><p>At the end of the day, it's because he doesn't have enough Energy Crystals.</p><p>If he had an unlimited supply of Energy Crystals, he would have arranged physical attack, magic attack, and everything else for all the troops under his command, regardless of their usefulness.</p><p>It's just that he is still far from being able to indulge himself.</p><p>He cherishes every single Energy Crystal, wishing he could split each one into two.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

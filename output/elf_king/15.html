        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So it was quickly detected by the owls soaring in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The elven huntresses received the intelligence, and immediately called the elves in their squad to withdraw back to their territory, while also reporting the news to Lin Yi in a timely manner.</p><p></p><p>"There is an undead army gathering, with the target being my territory?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi, who was hunting monsters, received this news and his expression suddenly turned serious.</p><p></p><p>This attack was completely different from the previous thousands of undead that came.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the scale was massive and the momentum was fierce.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it was premeditated, and the purpose was very clear.</p><p></p><p>The saying "the one who comes is not good, the good one does not come" applies here.</p><p></p><p>"I need to hurry back to organize the defense!"</p><p></p><p>While muttering to himself, Lin Yi waved the magic wand in his hand, and a huge fireball suddenly flew into the air and then exploded in the distant ruins.</p><p></p><p>The resulting fire wave swept through an area dozens of meters around.</p><p></p><p>The undead creatures within this range were quickly reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Among these undead creatures, some clearly exhibited elven characteristics.</p><p></p><p>In the great battle thousands of years ago, countless elves had sacrificed themselves here.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, undead creatures with elven characteristics were also born.</p><p></p><p>They were elves in their previous lives.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, these were just ordinary undead creatures, without the memories of their previous lives, and they simply charged towards Lin Yi, leaving him no choice but to show no mercy.</p><p></p><p>While hunting, Lin Yi could also feel his magical power rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Not only was it his own harvest, but more came from sharing the experience of other elves killing the enemies.</p><p></p><p>This was the benefit of having a larger number of troop types.</p><p></p><p>The more troop types, the more monsters they could kill.</p><p></p><p>Accordingly, the experience he shared would also be greater.</p><p></p><p>Even if he did nothing now, did not go out hunting, it would not take long for him to break through and advance to the king-level realm.</p><p></p><p>"The news says there are at least tens of thousands of undead creatures..."</p><p></p><p>"Among them are high-level undead."</p><p></p><p>"If I win this battle, I should be able to advance to the king-level!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi quickly cleaned up the battlefield and then returned to his territory.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Just as Lin Yi returned to the territory, the elven troops had already assembled on the square.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of elven swordsmen stood in the front, they were the only front-line troop type Lin Yi currently had.</p><p></p><p>Behind the elven swordsmen were the neatly arranged elven archers.</p><p></p><p>Following them were the elven mages.</p><p></p><p>As for the elven huntresses riding on swift panthers, they were scattered on the two wings of the army.</p><p></p><p>The entire elven army had a total strength of over a thousand.</p><p></p><p>It could be vaguely seen that dozens of owls were still circling in the sky above.</p><p></p><p>They were the owls released by the elven huntresses.</p><p></p><p>Even in the pitch-black night, the elven huntresses' owls could see things thousands of meters away. After all, they were not ordinary owls, but magical creations.</p><p></p><p>On one side of the elven army, there was a large pile of leather-wrapped packages.</p><p></p><p>They were the spoils of war brought back by the various elven teams.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>A slender and curvaceous elven mage came before Lin Yi, saluting respectfully: "The army has assembled, and all the elves have drunk from the elven spring, their magical power is at its peak, ready for battle at any time!"</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi praised.</p><p></p><p>The elven troops trained by the system were all seasoned veterans. Whether in individual combat or army combat, they had been instilled with the system's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lín Yī didn't need to worry at all, as he could entrust the war completely to them. He only needed to do one thing, and that was to train.</p><p></p><p>Train more troop types! Immediately, Lín Yī began to count the harvest of each elf troop.</p><p></p><p>Twenty elf troops, with a total harvest of nearly 40,000 energy crystals and over 30 magic cores.</p><p></p><p>The reason for the relatively few magic cores was that the main enemy in the darkness was undead creatures, and the hunting time was too short.</p><p></p><p>In the original plan, the elf legion was supposed to hunt until around 3 a.m. before returning to the territory to rest, but now it was only 10 p.m., and they had only hunted for a few hours.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly 40,000 energy crystals..."</p><p></p><p>"How many undead creatures would it take to produce that many?"</p><p></p><p>"If the plan remains unchanged, wouldn't we be able to harvest at least 100,000 energy crystals in one night?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Lín Yī's mood immediately improved.</p><p></p><p>The number of troops under his command had increased dramatically, and the harvest of his territory had also skyrocketed.</p><p></p><p>After eliminating this wave of invading undead army, the snowball of his territory would roll even faster.</p><p></p><p>Lín Yī then went to the base of the War Ancient Tree, opened the information panel, and began to train the elf troops.</p><p></p><p>Adding his own hunting harvest, he now had about 42,000 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>"The enemy's numbers are a bit high."</p><p></p><p>"However, their levels are generally not high."</p><p></p><p>"Very suitable for a covering artillery strike."</p><p></p><p>"So, this training should focus on elf mages. Secondly, train a batch of elf huntresses to mainly hunt those high-level undead creatures."</p><p></p><p>In the end, the 42,000 energy crystals were used up all at once, leaving only a small amount.</p><p></p><p>He obtained 100 elf mages and 24 elf huntresses.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the number of elf mages under his command had reached 151, and the number of elf huntresses was close to 60.</p><p></p><p>With this combat power, it would be enough to give the invading undead a good beating.</p><p></p><p>Especially the 151 elf mages, who had the ability to severely damage the undead army.</p><p></p><p>One more thing to mention.</p><p></p><p>The elf mages did not all possess the same elemental magic powers.</p><p></p><p>In total, they included wind, fire, water, earth, and wood, five elemental magic powers.</p><p></p><p>The main one was wood element.</p><p></p><p>A minority had other elements.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the enemy's trace appeared.</p><p></p><p>An elf huntress reported to Lín Yī, "Your Majesty, the vanguard of the enemy army has approached our territory by about 2,000 meters. In addition, the scale of the undead army has grown even larger."</p><p></p><p>"The total scale is at least over 100,000!"</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lín Yī was not surprised.</p><p></p><p>Undead creatures were everywhere, and it was normal for a large undead army to rush over, picking up some undead along the way.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare for battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>"We will defend Your Majesty to the death!" the elves said with fervent battle spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Elf King was the spiritual pillar of their elf clan, and also their creator. Even if they were to be trapped in a desperate situation and destined to perish on the battlefield, they would not retreat a single step, for this was the supreme mission they had been trained for.</p><p></p><p>Lín Yī also raised his magic wand and replied, "I, Elf King Lín Yī, will be with you!"</p><p></p><p>"Praise the King!!"</p><p></p><p>The elves were extremely excited, bordering on fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

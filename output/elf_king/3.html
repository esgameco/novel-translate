        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi had already killed hundreds of demonic beasts in the forest.</p><p></p><p>He had harvested over 300 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>He had also defeated more than 80 level 3 and above demonic monsters, and he was about to complete the second task.</p><p></p><p>"It's about to get dark soon."</p><p></p><p>"If I hunt all the way back, I should be able to reach 100 kills."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Lin Yi quickly turned back.</p><p></p><p>He hunted the nearby demonic beasts while retreating from the forest.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the ruins area, Lin Yi let out a light sigh. The dark and damp forest did not make him feel very safe, as he always felt something was watching him from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only missing 7 more task monsters now!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's spirits were lifted, and he intensified his search for demonic monsters in the ruins.</p><p></p><p>As a high-level rank 7 mage, his perception was quite keen. He could detect even the slightest movement within a few hundred meters, which greatly enhanced his ability to search for demonic monsters.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Lin Yi managed to complete the required number of monster kills before nightfall.</p><p></p><p>He then unhesitatingly rushed towards the central plaza.</p><p></p><p>"It's dark now!"</p><p></p><p>When he was about a kilometer away from the plaza, the enveloping darkness descended like the shadow of a demon.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding environment became even more ominous and eerie.</p><p></p><p>The vines crawling over the ruins looked like winding, twisted black snakes, sending chills down his spine.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, distant roars and growls could be heard from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi even saw numerous green eyes appearing out of nowhere among the ruins.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is this?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately hurled a massive fireball.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous explosion, the raging flames consumed everything, illuminating the area.</p><p></p><p>The owners of the green eyes were all reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In the bright firelight, Lin Yi clearly saw that these creatures were undead, some in human form and some in animal form, mostly skeletal undead and a few decaying corpse-like undead.</p><p></p><p>Although they were a bit frightening, their levels were not high, and they were all instantly sent to the underworld by Lin Yi's fireball.</p><p></p><p>However, this attack did not scare off the other undead creatures in the area. Instead, it was like stirring up a hornet's nest, as a large number of undead creatures with green ghostly flames rushed towards Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>"Disgusting things!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi ran while waving his magic wand, hurling one massive fireball after another.</p><p></p><p>Explosions kept ringing out as the azure flames consumed one ruin after another.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a large number of undead creatures were killed by Lin Yi, and he also harvested a lot of special energy, helping him continuously advance towards the rank of an 8th-tier mage.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a buzzing sound suddenly came from behind.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi turned around and saw a massive black shadow hovering in the sky above the forest.</p><p></p><p>The shadow was constantly changing shape, and it seemed to be attracted by the fire, rapidly approaching Lin Yi's location.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately threw a fireball towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>The fireball exploded in the air, creating a fire wave dozens of meters in diameter.</p><p></p><p>The firelight revealed the true form of the shadow - a swarm of blood-red mosquitoes the size of a palm.</p><p></p><p>"Vampire mosquitoes, low-level demonic beasts!"</p><p></p><p>"Thousands of them!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi was not frightened, but rather delighted.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the vampire mosquito swarm angered by the fireball and rushing towards him, he did not bother with the undead creatures in the ruins and ran towards the plaza at his fastest speed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he returned to the central plaza of the territory.</p><p></p><p>The terrain around him suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the vampire mosquito swarm caught up to him in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of vampire mosquitoes with their needle-like proboscises dove down towards Lin Yi, accompanied by the buzzing sound of their flapping wings, resembling a swarm of miniature fighter jets.</p><p></p><p>This many vampire mosquitoes could instantly drain the life from a massive demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Yi was not the least bit afraid, instead feeling overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He continuously waved his magic wand, hurling one massive fireball after another into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous roar, one fireball after another exploded, instantly reducing countless vampire mosquitoes to ashes. The scattered flames also fell around Lin Yi, forming a sea of fire that surrounded him.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, scorching hot fire walls appeared around Lin Yi on all sides.</p><p></p><p>The fire walls were over ten meters high.</p><p></p><p>They were more than two meters thick.</p><p></p><p>It was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The 360-degree fire walls completely enclosed Lin Yi within.</p><p></p><p>Only a small opening remained above his head.</p><p></p><p>But for the low-level vampire mosquitoes to traverse the over ten-meter-long fire passage and suck Lin Yi's solar spirit blood was clearly unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>The vampire mosquitoes that entered the fire passage could only last about two seconds.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the charred corpses of the vampire mosquitoes fell onto Lin Yi's body like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>This was only a small portion, as the majority were burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>At some point, a surge of powerful magic power erupted from Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>This indirectly caused the surrounding fire walls to grow several meters taller.</p><p></p><p>His level had broken through! He had advanced to the realm of an eighth-tier mage.</p><p></p><p>"Awesome!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Yi let out a loud laugh and waved his wand again.</p><p></p><p>A fireball over two meters in diameter quickly condensed.</p><p></p><p>The fireball exploded in the sky, directly decimating the vampire mosquito swarm, with at least a thousand vampire mosquitoes instantly killed by Lin Yi. The remaining vampire mosquitoes were frightened and quickly retreated with their remnant forces.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Everything had settled.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi quickly cleaned up the battlefield and harvested over 1,800 energy crystals.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the energy crystals he had previously obtained, the total reached over 2,300.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect!"</p><p></p><p>"Now the Life Tree can be upgraded!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a system notification sounded in Lin Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations, host, for successfully killing 100 or more level 3 or higher monster beasts, completing the system-issued task, and unlocking the territorial building - War Ancient Tree.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[War Ancient Tree: A building used by the Elf Camp to train various military professions.]</p><p></p><p>[Initial construction requirement: 100 energy crystals]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi immediately constructed the War Ancient Tree near the Life Tree.</p><p></p><p>[War Ancient Tree]</p><p>[Building Information: A profession building for the Elf Camp's military units.]</p><p>[Level: Low]</p><p>[Unlocked Elf Professions: Elf Archer, Elf Swordsman]</p><p>[Upgrade Requirement: 5,000 energy crystals]</p><p>[Special Prompt: Upgrading the War Ancient Tree's level can unlock more Elf Camp professions.]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>[Elf Archer: Training Requirement - 50 energy crystals, 1 Little Elf]</p><p>[Elf Swordsman: Training Requirement - 50 energy crystals, 1 Little Elf]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The War Ancient Tree's training has no numerical limit, but the prerequisite is to have enough Little Elves."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I need to accelerate the upgrading of the Life Tree's level!"</p><p></p><p>"The higher the Life Tree's level, the more Little Elves it can nurture."</p><p></p><p>"And then there's the energy crystals..."</p><p></p><p>"I need a large amount of energy crystals, otherwise, even if I raise the Life Tree's level, with enough Little Elves, I won't have enough money to train them."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then consumed 1,000 energy crystals to upgrade the Life Tree to the intermediate level.</p><p></p><p>The intermediate-level Life Tree had a trunk reaching 100 meters high.</p><p></p><p>The aura of life and natural energy it emanated became even more dense.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi could clearly sense that the Life Tree's magic power had enveloped the entire central square, shielding it from external evil and dark forces.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Life Tree could now nurture 100 Little Elves per day.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with this upgrade, the Life Tree's daily nurturing cycle had been reset, so he could now nurture those 100 Little Elves immediately, without having to wait until the next day.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

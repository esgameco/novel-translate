        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The invasion of the thousands of undead creatures into the square was completely eliminated.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because the levels of these undead creatures were not high, and their intelligence was very low, being extremely stubborn. Even though the legion suffered heavy casualties, not a single undead creature escaped the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>This gave Lin Yi and the others the opportunity to annihilate them completely.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, all the undead have been completely cleared up!" </p><p></p><p>The elf troops gathered and reported to Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>Out of the twenty-two elf troops, not a single one perished, and the injured were very few, it was just that their magical power was heavily consumed.</p><p></p><p>They had to forcibly extinguish the soul flames of the undead creatures on the battlefield to prevent their resurrection, and thus consumed a large amount of magical power.</p><p></p><p>However, this was just a minor issue. </p><p></p><p>They only needed to meditate near the Tree of Life for one night, and their magical power would be fully restored. </p><p></p><p>The natural and life force emanating from the Tree of Life was greatly beneficial to the elves.</p><p></p><p>It is worth mentioning that...</p><p></p><p>Among these twenty-two elf troops, eight of them achieved a level breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Five of them were elf archers, and three were elf swordsmen. </p><p></p><p>They had all reached the 7th tier, entering the ranks of advanced profession holders.</p><p></p><p>Although the other elf troops did not break through and advance, they also gained a large amount of "experience rewards", and were not far from breaking through to the 7th tier.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Lin Yi also reaped a bountiful harvest from this battle.</p><p></p><p>As the lord, not only could he gain a large amount of experience by personally killing the enemies, but he could also share in a portion of the experience rewards when his troops killed the enemies.</p><p></p><p>In summary, his harvest was the greatest.</p><p></p><p>It was just a pity that the levels of those undead creatures were too low, with less than a hundred mid-level undead, which prevented him from achieving a breakthrough on the battlefield, as his level was relatively high.</p><p></p><p>"Understood," Lin Yi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He said to his elf troops, "Clean up the battlefield and collect the fallen energy crystals. As for the bodies of the undead creatures, pile them up."</p><p></p><p>He planned to burn those undead bodies. </p><p></p><p>This could effectively prevent the undead creatures from reviving.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the battlefield was covered with countless fragments of soul flames besides the undead bodies. If those soul flame fragments were to fuse together, and with the undead corpses as revival materials, there was a high probability of new undead beings being born.</p><p></p><p>The soul flame fragments did not need to be cleaned up intentionally. </p><p></p><p>Without the corpses, those soul flame fragments would gradually dissipate on their own.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a towering fire appeared in the northern area of the square, and all the corpses were reduced to ashes by Lin Yi.</p><p></p><p>The energy crystals were also collected, totaling more than three thousand.</p><p></p><p>The drop rate was far higher than the vampire mosquitoes Lin Yi had previously killed.</p><p></p><p>With such a bountiful harvest of energy crystals, Lin Yi was naturally in a great mood, and immediately went to the base of the War Tree to train nearly seventy new elf troops.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the number of elf troops under his command had reached a full ninety.</p><p></p><p>Among them, two-thirds were elf archers.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi preferred this highly lethal long-range troop type.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the elf swordsmen were also indispensable. When facing direct enemy assault, the elf swordsmen needed to stand out and provide escort for the elf archers in the rear.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The night patrol is entrusted to you all," </p><p></p><p>"For now, do not leave the square's perimeter. If any evil creatures invade the square area, eliminate them immediately!" Lin Yi said to the newly trained elf troops.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, great lord."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Elf King!" The elves respectfully answered the summons.</p><p></p><p>When they looked at Lin Yi, their gaze was filled with adoration and awe.</p><p></p><p>To the trained elf troops, Lin Yi was almost a divine creator-like existence.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the elves divided themselves into several small teams, patrolling around the plaza centered on the Tree of Life and the Ancient War Tree.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi then opened the system-issued tasks and took a look.</p><p></p><p>There were two tasks, both currently in the initial stage.</p><p></p><p>The first task was to have one thousand combat-type troops, with the current progress at 90/1000.</p><p></p><p>The second task was to kill one thousand enemies of at least level five, with the current progress at 36/1000.</p><p></p><p>"These two tasks are not something that can be completed immediately."</p><p></p><p>"However, this does not affect my ability to expand the power of my domain."</p><p></p><p>"Starting tomorrow, expand the scope of relic clearing. The temporary target is to completely clear the inner city of the relic within seven days, not leaving any monster behind!"</p><p></p><p>This ancient city relic belonging to the Elf Empire was divided into an inner city and an outer city.</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi's current location was at the very center of the inner city.</p><p></p><p>In fact, compared to the outer city, the danger level of the inner city was much lower.</p><p></p><p>Due to the existence of the ancient trees, many monsters or evil creatures dared not approach.</p><p></p><p>The closer one got to the central plaza, the fewer the monsters.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, the further out, the more there were.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the outer city, where the ancient trees could not exert their deterrence, it was teeming with monsters and evil creatures.</p><p></p><p>This was not just Lin Yi's speculation, he had once used the ancient tree's consciousness to overlook the entire relic of the Elf Ancient City and knew the situation in the outer city.</p><p></p><p>"Without the ancient tree, there is no more deterrence..."</p><p></p><p>"Once the monsters in the outer city realize this, they may surge into the inner city."</p><p></p><p>"I must quickly develop my domain."</p><p></p><p>A sense of urgency arose in Lin Yi's heart.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had become the lord, his every action was related to the fate of the entire domain.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he turned his gaze to the ancient tree standing not far away and asked the system, "System, is there a way to revive this Tree of Life?"</p><p></p><p>If the ancient tree could be revived, it would be a great help to his domain.</p><p></p><p>【Yes.】</p><p></p><p>The system replied - 【When the domain's Magic Spring building reaches the top level and produces the Holy Water of Life, by pouring the Holy Water of Life to nourish it, you can assist in its revival.】</p><p></p><p>【However, the soul of this Tree of Life has already entered a different dimensional world.】</p><p></p><p>【After being revived, this Tree of Life will only have the ability to nurture young elves, and will not be able to transform into a tree-person form.】</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Yi felt a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But his joy outweighed it.</p><p></p><p>The ancient tree had not deceived him, it had indeed gone to the goddess of the elves' divine realm, and could not return. But its physical body had a chance to revive, and it could still nurture young elves for him.</p><p></p><p>Two Trees of Life, double the nurturing capacity.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had enough energy crystals, he could train more elf troops.</p><p></p><p>"Reviving the ancient tree's body requires a top-level Magic Spring."</p><p></p><p>"I haven't even unlocked any buildings yet."</p><p></p><p>"I can only take it one step at a time."</p><p></p><p>Lin Yi did not think any further, picking up his magic staff and heading to the edge of the plaza.</p><p></p><p>Normally at this time, he would have already entered a meditative state under the supervision of the ancient tree. But now he no longer needed that, as one night's meditation was not enough to make up for killing dozens of monsters.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

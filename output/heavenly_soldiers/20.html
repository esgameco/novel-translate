        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His consciousness touched the purple radiance, and Luo Zhongxian received a message: "Gather the seven 'Immortal Talismans' to open the Immortal Path and return home."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the purple radiance dissipated, revealing a token on the ground with the word "Immortal" written on it.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself: "Are there really immortals? Otherwise, why would there be this token?"</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had unintentionally become involved in a major project, but this token didn't seem to be of any use for now...</p><p></p><p>"I should draw from the system first and see if there are any good items. System, let me draw equipment. It seems I don't have any equipment other than the Emperor's Sword."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Confounding Mask, unranked, able to change aura, physique and appearance, creating illusions."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Life and Death Zither, (Sacred rank, upgradeable), the zither that decides life and death, extraordinarily domineering."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Emperor's Seal (for sealing and releasing destiny aura)."</p><p></p><p>"Great! Apart from the Emperor's Seal which can only be used after establishing an imperial dynasty, the other two can be used immediately. This is really too good!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm really looking forward to the effect of the Life and Death Zither combined with the 'Apocalypse Zither Scripture'..."</p><p></p><p>"System, open the pet cards. I'm not greedy, any divine beast or immortal beast will do..."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Blood-devouring Mosquito. When it reaches its pinnacle, it can devour immortals and gods... But its growth requires a vast amount of fresh blood."</p><p></p><p>A mosquito appeared in Luo Zhongxian's palm, lowering its head affectionately and giving his palm a little kiss.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the shining, long proboscis, Luo Zhongxian gasped. This thing was definitely formidable and needed to be nurtured carefully. With a thought, the blood-devouring mosquito appeared in his system space.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the surging bloody aura and beast carcasses, the blood-devouring mosquito became extremely excited. Its eyes turned red, and it transformed into a streak of mosquito energy, plunging into the sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Perceiving the increasingly powerful aura of the blood-devouring mosquito with each passing moment, Luo Zhongxian narrowed his eyes in satisfaction. This was definitely a powerful weapon worth nurturing!</p><p></p><p>"System, let me draw the remaining five lucky cards."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"No, no, congratulations to the host for obtaining a Pinnacle Ability Card, lasting for one moment."</p><p></p><p>Good, another trump card gained.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was very satisfied with this lottery draw!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian took out a mask of confusion. He saw a mysterious glow flowing on the surface of the mask. After putting it on his face,</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian picked up a mirror and looked at himself. In the mirror, his face appeared extremely rugged, with three sword scars on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Taking off the mask, he returned to his original appearance. Putting it on again, he turned into the appearance of a lecherous old man.</p><p></p><p>After trying it a few times, Luo Zhongxian grasped the essence of it. He could sculpt an appearance according to his own mentality, and the mask would form the corresponding appearance.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the mask in his hand, a mysterious smile flashed across his face.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, he found Zhang Xiaohang from the Purple Gold Auction House and directly stated his intention:</p><p></p><p>"I want to make a deal with you. I know you're about to break through to the Divine Ability Realm. I have a Divine Ability Fruit that can help you enter the Divine Ability Realm, but I need the corpses or blood of one million demonic beasts at the Shedding Mortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian showed Zhang Xiaohang the Divine Ability Fruit in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Divine Ability Fruit immediately attracted Zhang Xiaohang's attention. This was a brand-new type of pill that she had never heard of before. What kind of pill could help break through to the Divine Ability Realm?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Divine Ability Realm wouldn't be so rare. This Divine Ability Fruit had an immense temptation. If handled well, she could even be promoted to become the head of a major region, gaining access to vast resources.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohang thought for a moment and said, "Okay, but I need two of them. I know you have more; otherwise, you wouldn't have taken one out. I want two, and I'll give you one thousand demonic beast corpses and one hundred Divine Ability demonic beast corpses."</p><p></p><p>"One hundred Divine Ability demonic beast corpses!" Luo Zhongxian felt like he was witnessing the growth of a Pinnacle-level bloodthirsty mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, but I have one more condition. I'll give you one day to prepare. The sooner, the better!" Luo Zhongxian thought for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaoran said in a subdued voice, "Good, our Purple Gold Auction House has plenty of corpses of demonic beasts and fierce beasts. It won't take a day, I just need three hours to deliver them to Mr. Luo before sunset." </p><p></p><p>"Okay," Luo Zhongxian said, leaving behind a spirit communication fruit before departing.</p><p></p><p>Watching Luo Zhongxian's departing back, Zhang Xiaoran fell into deep thought: "What does he want so many fierce beast corpses for? Is he cultivating some kind of martial art? He's really a mysterious man."</p><p></p><p>"Someone come here. Quickly take this spirit pill to the Immortal Shen for analysis. Also, tell the people below to put one million corpses of fierce beasts or demonic beasts, and one hundred corpses of spirit communication realm demonic beasts into a space ring and give it to me. If anyone asks, just say I ordered it! You have two hours to prepare, there will be a reward!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaoran summoned a man and instructed him.</p><p></p><p>"Got it."</p><p></p><p>Before sunset in the afternoon, Luo Zhongxian received two space rings, one containing one million corpses of the defying-mortal realm fierce beasts, the other containing one hundred corpses of the spirit communication realm fierce beasts.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian returned to his room. In the system space, a mosquito with an ever-expanding aura was devouring a vast amount of fresh blood and corpses.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a black hole appeared above the system space, and huge corpses of fierce beasts or demonic beasts fell into the sea of blood like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>The gigantic blood-devouring mosquito made an excited "shh shh" sound, transforming into tens of thousands of tiny mosquitoes, flapping their wings and burrowing into the corpses to devour them.</p><p></p><p>With a "pop" sound, a tiny mosquito absorbed a huge fierce beast corpse, leaving only an empty skin floating in the sea of blood, before rushing towards another corpse.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian felt his scalp go numb watching this.</p><p></p><p>"This little thing is too monstrous."</p><p></p><p>In Zhang Xiaoran's room, the Immortal Shen said excitedly while holding the spirit communication fruit, "Miss, this is definitely a groundbreaking spirit pill, so perfect, it's hard to imagine!"</p><p></p><p>I've updated it. I thought about the name "blood-devouring mosquito" for this pet for a long time, losing 7 or 8 strands of hair, but I finally came up with this powerful and dominating name.</p>

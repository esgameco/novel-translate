        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining the Xin Mo body. The Xin Mo body is one of the three thousand Dao bodies, corresponding to the Dao of Demons. It possesses an unfathomable power. If anyone swears an oath in the host's name and breaks it, they will be devoured by the Xin Mo and die."</p><p></p><p>His body was undergoing a transformation. He grew taller by a foot, and his hair lengthened inch by inch, becoming even darker than before.</p><p></p><p>With a "rip" sound, his clothes tore open, revealing his strong body. His eyes, in particular, became even more profound, with bright black pupils that made one's heart race.</p><p></p><p>The ground could not withstand the explosive increase of power within Luo Zhongxian's body. With him at the center, the floor of the room was covered with cracks that extended outward.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, a blurry black human figure appeared in the sky above the Manbang Continent, its immense pressure spreading throughout the entire continent. All those above the Shen Tong realm could sense it.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains, a figure sat on a throne, holding a cup filled with a bright red liquid. Sensing the changes in the universe, the figure drank the liquid and muttered to himself:</p><p></p><p>"The blood brewed by this human child is truly delicious. The mysterious substance it contains makes me feel like I'm about to break through to the next realm. Hahaha!</p><p></p><p>However, in the past half month, two peerless geniuses have emerged one after another. The Manbang Continent is likely to be embroiled in conflict again. But what does that have to do with me? Hahaha, the more chaos, the better... Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>In the forbidden area of the Tianxin Gate, the old Tianxin man was fishing by the lake when he suddenly sensed something. He looked up at the massive black figure in the sky, and a voice rang out:</p><p></p><p>"The world is about to descend into chaos, with heroes vying for supremacy. Who will be the true dragon? In these turbulent times, what path should the Tianxin Gate take?"</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Great Shang Dynasty, at the residence of the Prime Minister, the current Prime Minister Zhang Qiming stood atop a tall building, gazing at the blurry black figure in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Staring at it, suddenly his face showed great alarm: "A demon, a demon, it's a demon! Quick, report to the Emperor. A demon has entered the wilderness, we must prepare early."</p><p></p><p>The black figure in the sky seemed to have sensed something, the figure flickered, the blurred face turned towards the residence of the Grand Preceptor of the Great Shang Dynasty, then the huge black figure disappeared, and the sky returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Puh" The Grand Preceptor Zhang Qiming suddenly coughed up a mouthful of hot blood and fainted.</p><p></p><p>It gave the surrounding soldiers quite a fright. They hurriedly carried the Grand Preceptor into a room and laid him on a soft bed, summoning a divine physician to treat him.</p><p></p><p>At the Luo tribe's residence of the young master, Liu Fang sensed something amiss and ordered everyone to stay away from the young master's residence, violators would be executed. He personally guarded outside the gate.</p><p></p><p>If one looked down from above at the young master's residence, one would see cracks crisscrossing everywhere on the ground, resembling a spider's web. Looking closer, they were indeed cracks intersecting each other.</p><p></p><p>Inside, Luo Zhongxian carefully sensed the differences between the Heart Demon Body and the Devouring Body. If the strength of the Devouring Body was absorbing the realms of all beings, then the main ability of the Heart Demon Body was to control others for one's own use.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Demon Body could produce little things called "Heart Demon Worms" that could control people.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at the soft little worm crawling around on his hand and thought: "So this is the Heart Demon Worm. It does seem quite special. I should find an opportunity to try it out."</p><p></p><p>"Swish" The Heart Demon Worm disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"System, I want to summon talents. Open the talent cards." "I hope I can get a fierce warrior like the God of War Bai Qi, the War God Xiang Yu, or the Military Sage Han Xin. Any of them would do," Luo Zhongxian muttered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining the allegiance of Fan Li."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was overjoyed. Who was Fan Li?</p><p></p><p>Why, he was the famous strategist and merchant of ancient times!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Ancestor, help King Goujian of Yue devise strategies. With three thousand Yue soldiers, he can swallow up the existence of Wu.</p><p></p><p>This is a rare talent. He can devise strategies in the front, lead soldiers into battle, and then engage in business to become wealthy. It is a talent rarely seen in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"System, where is he now? I want to meet him." Luo Zhongxian was somewhat impatient, because the Luo tribe currently really needed a virtuous and talented person. Liu Fang could lead soldiers into battle, but he couldn't develop the economy.</p><p></p><p>"Host, Fan Li is on his way here, please wait a moment..."</p><p></p><p>"System, show me Fan Li's information."</p><p></p><p>"Fan Li</p><p>Title: God of Commerce  </p><p>One of the Three Thousand Tao Bodies: Immortal Body</p><p>Martial Arts Cultivation: Mastered the Shen Tong Realm</p><p>Strength: The power of one thousand dragons"</p><p></p><p>"What? He even has a title, possesses an Immortal Body, has mastered the Shen Tong Realm, and his strength is outrageous, reaching the power of one thousand dragons." Luo Zhongxian's eyes were wide open.</p><p></p><p>"Good, the stronger the better, haha." Luo Zhongxian seemed very pleased. For a tribe, the more profound the foundation, the stronger it is.</p><p></p><p>"System, I have one more Martial Arts Card left, let me draw it."</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations to the host for obtaining the 'Apocalyptic Zither Scripture'."</p><p></p><p>"The 'Apocalyptic Zither Scripture'? The words 'apocalyptic' indicate how powerful this martial art is, but I don't have a zither, how can I practice it...let me set it aside for now..." Luo Zhongxian, who was originally excited, looked dejected like a frost-bitten eggplant.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, there is an old man outside who claims to be Fan Li, and he wants to see you..." Liu Fang's voice came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"What, Fan Li? He's here so quickly? Haha, bring him to the guest hall, I'll be right there."</p>

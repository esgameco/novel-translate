        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Owww" A beast as huge as a small mountain was letting out a low wail. There was a massive sword wound in its belly, with blood gushing out, as if a giant sword had previously descended from the sky and pinned it here!</p><p></p><p>Not far from the giant beast, an intense battle was raging on a battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of beast the size of small mountains surrounded a young man, who was standing on the corpse of a giant beast, gasping for breath.</p><p></p><p>There were also a few more beast corpses the size of small mountains nearby. The ground was uneven, as if it had been trampled by some large animal, showing that an intense battle had taken place here before.</p><p></p><p>This young man was Liu Fang. However, he was really annoyed now. The Heavenly Sword had pinned down the Beast God who was casting a secret technique, but the Beast God fell right next to a Beast Valley, shaking out the beasts that were resting inside.</p><p></p><p>"The beasts here are a bit mutated. They've all reached the ninth level of Moulting Mortality. What's going on? I hope the Young Master doesn't come here."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, human, I don't think you can make it," a beast opened its big mouth.</p><p></p><p>A cold smile appeared on Liu Fang's firm face: "Killing you is not a problem!"</p><p></p><p>"This human is a bit different from previous humans, be careful, don't get stuck here! Killing him is a small matter, but if we delay the great affairs of the great person, we'll all be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>One of the beasts was communicating with all the others through its divine consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go all out together, kill him," suggested one beast.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah" "Okay" "Let's go..."</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of beasts the size of small mountains launched their full power attack. Facing such an assault, Liu Fang's expression turned solemn:</p><p></p><p>"I may never see the Young Master again, but I won't let you have an easy time either! Take this move - the ninth form of the Chaos Sword Technique: Man and Sword Become One."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang's figure slowly disappeared, leaving only a huge ancient sword without any decorations at the original spot. If you looked carefully, you could vaguely see Liu Fang's shadow on the sword's body.</p><p></p><p>"Swish" The huge sword vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Swish" The huge sword reappeared behind a beast's back, "Shick" cutting the beast the size of a small mountain in half. "Swish" The huge sword disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Swish" The huge sword reappeared behind another beast, the blade piercing straight through its back.</p><p></p><p>"Ugh" The beast let out a low growl, looking at the huge sword penetrating its belly with a puzzled look in its large eyes, which then dimmed, losing their light.</p><p></p><p>"Boom" The sound of the beast crashing to the ground rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Swish" The huge sword vanished again.</p><p></p><p>"Swish" It reappeared in the sky, unleashing a chilling sword qi that slashed towards ten beasts, then turned into a sword light chasing the sword qi to kill those ten beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone be careful, he's in the air!" one of the beasts shouted a warning.</p><p></p><p>The ten beasts hastily defended against the giant sword qi in front, but there was still a huge sword behind.</p><p></p><p>"Pffft pffft pffft..." The huge sword pierced through the ten beasts, pinning them dead to the ground and dragging out a trench a kilometer deep.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, attack the sword body quickly..." said one beast.</p><p></p><p>Beast Shaking Nine Heavens, Beast Sound Wave, Beast Fist Technique, Beast Stinger...</p><p></p><p>One beast after another unleashed their full power on the huge sword, which violently shook for a moment before dimming and revealing...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>His hair was disheveled and his eyes were dim. "Vomit" Liu Fang spat out a mouthful of fresh red hot blood. "Vomit", "Vomit" he vomited two more mouthfuls of hot blood in succession.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang still wanted to draw his sword, but he had no strength left in his body.</p><p></p><p>"Is it going to be over soon?"</p><p></p><p>A huge beast beside him said, "This kid is formidable. This kid faced us, over a hundred people, alone and killed so many of our brothers! I think he's about to be finished. Let me send him on his final journey."</p><p></p><p>Opening its bloody big mouth, it bit towards Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>"Is it going to end?" Liu Fang looked at the huge bloody big mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to hurt my people!" A voice came from far and near, rapidly approaching. A sound of breaking air, a sword light slashed.</p><p></p><p>"Puff", a huge beast's head rolled down! Hot blood splashed on Liu Fang's face, but he was very happy!</p><p></p><p>The one who came was Luo Zhongxian, following the trail of blood, tracking all the way here. Seeing so many giant beasts, he was also taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, open your mouth"</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang opened his mouth. "Drip" It was the nine-turn undying liquid, a new player big gift, with an amazing healing effect.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Liu Fang's body was revitalized, his eyes gradually regaining color.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for saving my life, young master."</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk first, rest here!" Luo Zhongxian comforted.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned around, "Dare to hurt my people, it's a good opportunity to test the sword skills I've learned. Let me try them out on you, the withering sword."</p><p></p><p>A huge sword energy rose from nowhere, slashing towards the beast group.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone block it, he can't unleash such a huge sword skill many times."</p><p></p><p>The huge sword energy swept through the beast group, without any casualties.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, this guy's sword energy is useless," a beast laughed, its big mouth askew.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>"No, why did you get old?" a beast cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>"You too, you got old too."</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" a beast howled miserably.</p><p></p><p>"It's him, it must be him, kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, kill him."</p><p></p><p>Watching the beast group charge over.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Human Emperor Sword, he unleashed the 'Withered Leaf Sword Skill' second sword decay! The huge sword energy swept through the beast group again.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the beasts' speed suddenly slowed down, as if their bodies were weighed down by huge mountains, struggling to move forward carrying those mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Time, it's the passage of time! This person must have a great secret. Capture him, offer him to the great one, and we can definitely obtain the nine-colored grass." One beast was excited.</p><p></p><p>"At this point, should I say you're smart or ignorant of the situation? The third sword, soul severing."</p><p></p><p>Another huge sword energy swept through the beast group.</p><p></p><p>The beast group suddenly stopped crawling, each and every one motionless, maintaining their original posture, even their ferocious expressions could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"No, their eyes have lost color, their fur and claws have lost luster, they look like they've been dead for decades," Liu Fang was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Just half a day, has the young master become so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Devouring Body is so perverted! Overbearing! Growing stronger with each battle!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining 30,000 battle merits."</p><p></p><p>The pleasant system prompt sounded, making Luo Zhongxian feel delighted. So many battle merits.</p><p></p><p>"There's still one left over there, let's deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I haven't become a spirit-realm beast yet, how could I die here? No, roar!" The beast was anxious, but still couldn't change its fate.</p><p></p><p>A huge sword slashed down!</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations on gaining 30,000 battle merits."</p><p></p><p>System, how many total battle merits do I have now?</p><p></p><p>"Host, a total of 2,760,000 battle merits."</p><p></p><p>"2,760,000 battle merits, system exchange for the Degree Demon Scripture and a Spirit Fruit."</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations host on obtaining the Degree Demon Scripture, Spirit Fruit, they have been placed in the system space, please check. 1,660,000 battle merits remaining."</p><p></p><p>"System, help me cultivate the Degree Demon Scripture to the great perfect realm, how many battle merits are needed?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, 70,000 battle merits are needed."</p><p></p><p>"Exchange them for me."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations host on cultivating the Degree Demon Scripture to the perfect realm, 1,590,000 battle merits remaining."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian took out the Spirit Fruit from the system space. It was a round, reddish fruit-like pill that emitted an attractive pill fragrance. The Spirit Fruit's surface flickered with faint lights.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Spirit Fruit? Indeed extraordinary. Liu Fang, this is for you, quickly become a spirit-realm expert. The young master still needs you to protect him, haha." He threw the Spirit Fruit to Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang hurriedly and carefully caught it, carefully putting it into his space ring.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young master."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, enough talk, let me clean up these corpses first. Devour!"</p><p></p><p>As Luo Zhongxian's realm improved, the Devouring Body's power grew stronger. A one-foot black hole appeared in front of Luo Zhongxian, emanating tremendous suction force, rapidly shrinking and pulling the beast corpses into the black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations host on breaking through to the Eighth Realm of Shedding Mortality, breaking through to the Great Perfect Realm of Shedding Mortality!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations host on attaining the strength of 1,000 elephants, a perception of 1,000 li, and a lifespan of 1,000 years."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The young master has broken through again, such powerful pressure!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the Ninth Realm of Shedding Mortality. Luo Meng, Luo Changtian, I'll be back soon. Have you cleaned up and prepared?" Luo Zhongxian said hatefully!</p><p></p><p>At the Luo Clan, Luo Meng was harassing a young lady when he suddenly felt a chill on his neck. "Who's there?" he roared, scaring the lady on the bed who looked flustered and anxious.</p><p></p><p>Luo Meng turned around but saw nothing, then pounced on the lady again.</p><p></p><p>Far away, tens of thousands of li from the Manic Mountains perimeter, in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian and Liu Fang looked towards the beast cave in front of them.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, there must be something amiss here. So many Ninth Realm of Shedding Mortality beasts gathered, there must be a reason. During my battle with them earlier, one beast accidentally mentioned 'the great one', so I think there must be something in this beast cave below."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, head down and see what's inside!"</p>

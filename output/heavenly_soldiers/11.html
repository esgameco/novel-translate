        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Luo clan; the Jiang clan; the Huang clan; the Jiang clan; the Lin clan; the Li clan; the Xing clan; the Yan clan; the Hua clan.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Luo clan was the strongest (when Luo Shentong was around).</p><p></p><p>Next were the Jiang clan, Xing clan, and Hua clan.</p><p></p><p>The Hua clan was a clan composed entirely of women, with a relatively small number of only five hundred members. However, these women's martial arts cultivation was quite profound.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored among the eight major clans that these women came from the outside world and fled here in difficult times.</p><p></p><p>Originally there were 1,300 of them, but now only 500 remained. The Hua clan's ability to bear children was an enigma to the other clans.</p><p></p><p>Their main cultivation method: The "Seductive Heart Sutra"</p><p></p><p>It was said that once a licentious person, relying on his high level of cultivation, tried to enter the Hua clan to "seek flowers and inquire about willows."</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Hua clan's leader, Hua Rong, appeared. The women of the clan called her "Sister Hua."</p><p></p><p>She was a woman with lingering charm, a beautiful face, moving eyes, a jade-like nose, and willow-like eyebrows. She truly lived up to her name: like clouds adorning her clothes and flowers adorning her countenance.</p><p></p><p>The licentious person immediately fixed his eyes on Hua Rong, feeling his blood boiling within, wishing he could embrace her tightly and indulge in intimacy.</p><p></p><p>He did not sense any danger from Hua Rong and cheerfully walked towards her.</p><p></p><p>A hint of annoyance flashed across Hua Rong's face, but she quickly regained her composure and smiled at the licentious person before her.</p><p></p><p>In a place the licentious person did not notice, a mysterious pinkish aura emanated from Hua Rong's body and drifted towards him, entering his body through his nose.</p><p></p><p>He seemed completely oblivious, already almost within half a meter of Hua Rong, about to reach out and touch her body.</p><p></p><p>Hua Rong wore a thin veil over her face, her eyebrows slightly furrowed. She let out a light sigh, and another pinkish aura entered the man's body.</p><p></p><p>The man's body suddenly froze, his eyes showing confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Hang his head at the entrance of the clan, and throw his body into the sea of flowers to feed the flowers," Sister Hua said as she walked back to the clan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sister Hua..." several women responded.</p><p></p><p>From then on, the people of the eight major clans never dared to underestimate the women of the Hua clan, especially the beautiful ones.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On this day, in the ancestral land of the Flower Tribe, at the sea of flowers, stood several youthful and energetic women.</p><p></p><p>They were conversing: "Sisters, did you know? Recently, a 'Sword Demon' appeared in the outer regions of the Hundred Thousand Wildlands. I just heard about it from another tribe..."</p><p></p><p>"Sword Demon? What Sword Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, what are you talking about? We practice our skills here every day and haven't left the tribe for a long time..."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah, Hua Feihua, hurry up and tell us," one of the women urged.</p><p></p><p>Hua Feihua was the daughter of Hua Jie, thirteen years old, at the second level of transcendence.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay, I know it's not easy for you to practice your skills. Let me tell you, this Sword Demon appeared just in the past couple of days.</p><p></p><p>He's called the Sword Demon because his swordsmanship is mysterious, yet extremely powerful. Any living being that has encountered him is already dead.</p><p></p><p>You know that the highest level in the outer Wildlands is the ninth level of transcendence, right?</p><p></p><p>But he seems to be tireless. In just two short days, he slaughtered more than a dozen large Beast Valleys.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists with insight noticed huge sword marks left inside the Beast Valleys.</p><p></p><p>From the continuously exposed Beast Valleys, only bloodstains, collapsed valleys, and fallen mountains could be seen. Strangely, there were no beast corpses to be found.</p><p></p><p>You have to know that in a large Beast Valley, there are dozens of transcended beasts the size of small hills, just at the transcended realm alone. Where did so many beast corpses go? It has become an unsolved mystery.</p><p></p><p>Some say he is the nemesis of the beasts, some say he is the gospel for the human tribes of the Wildlands, and some call him the Sword Demon. But so far, no one has seen him in person, and it's unknown whether he is male or female."</p><p></p><p>Hua Feihua spoke slowly, a hint of admiration showing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, so powerful! Slaughtering more than a dozen large Beast Valleys, I'm afraid our nine major tribes combined wouldn't be his match. So powerful, I wonder where this person came from..." one woman exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, but at least this Sword Demon has done a good deed. We don't have to worry about beast attacks for the time being."</p><p></p><p>"That's true. I do want to catch a glimpse of this Sword Demon and see who he really is."</p><p></p><p>"After slaughtering so many beasts, isn't he afraid that a major power from inside the Hundred Thousand Wildlands will come out?"</p><p></p><p>The few women continued...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Because of the topic of the Sword Demon, they chatted noisily together.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard of the Young Master of the Luo Clan, Luo Zhongxian was holding a pen and writing something fervently.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Demon that the few young ladies from the Flower Clan were discussing was precisely Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>These past two days, he had swept through the outskirts of the Hundred Thousand Savage Mountains, eliminating twenty large savage beast valleys and over a hundred medium-sized savage beast valleys.</p><p></p><p>He did not bother with the small savage beast valleys, as the battle merits gained were too little. It was better to leave them to grow, or for the young people of the clan to challenge them, lest they lose their edge.</p><p></p><p>In total, he slew one thousand beasts at the ninth stage of Shedding Mortality, tens of thousands of beasts at the Shedding Mortality stage, and innumerable beasts at the Tempering Body stage.</p><p></p><p>The frenzied slaughter of these two days brought in over eight hundred million battle merits.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian successively purchased:</p><p></p><p>The Reincarnation Fist; Remnants of the Nine Cycles of Body Refinement; The Enlightenment Formation; The Cloud Concealment Formation; The War God Formation;</p><p></p><p>Essence Consolidating Liquid: one hundred bottles</p><p>Spirit Fruit: ten</p><p>Shedding Mortality Pills: one thousand</p><p>Tendon Transforming Liquid: ten thousand bottles</p><p></p><p>Total cost: 133,200,000 battle merits, leaving 680,000,000 battle merits remaining.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this, within Luo Zhongxian's system space of ten li, savage beast corpses were piled up like mountains.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian had long since reached the perfect ninth stage of Shedding Mortality, but he did not want to advance too quickly. He wanted to lay a solid foundation, even re-practicing martial arts from the beginning to build an unwavering base.</p><p></p><p>Without a firm foundation, even mountains could shake. From a long-term perspective, advancing too quickly was not necessarily a good thing.</p><p></p><p>The piles of savage beast corpses in his system space were "provisions" prepared for re-practicing his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I have notified everyone in the clan. Tomorrow morning at sunrise, they will gather at the practice grounds," Liu Fang came over and said to Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Good. You've worked hard these past few days. Take these three tea leaves from the Enlightenment Tea Tree," Luo Zhongxian looked at the resolute Liu Fang and handed him three Enlightenment Tea Tree leaves.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master. I will definitely break through to the Spirit Realm," Liu Fang said emotionally. Having encountered such a master, what more could one ask for?</p><p></p><p>After Liu Fang left, Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself, "It's time for the Luo Clan to 'reboot'."</p>

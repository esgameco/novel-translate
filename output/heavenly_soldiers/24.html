        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The auction venue spanned from the 5th to the 10th floor, towering over ten meters high. Below were five floors, each with rows of seats, which were now gradually being filled as people came in and took their places.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was led to a private room marked with the number nine. The room was extremely luxurious, fully furnished with all the amenities, and even had servants attending to it.</p><p></p><p>The room had a massive window-like glass panel through which one could clearly see the auction taking place outside.</p><p></p><p>If viewed from the outside, no one could see into the private room, as there was a force shielding it, adding a sense of mystery and nobility for the room's occupant.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood before the huge glass panel, looking down at the dense crowd streaming in and finding seats to sit closely together.</p><p></p><p>Most of these people were there just to watch the spectacle. Those with real power had usually already been discovered and registered by the auction house and would have a private room like his.</p><p></p><p>After a while, a graceful figure slowly walked into the center of the red carpet prepared by the auction house and calmly began speaking:</p><p></p><p>"Welcome everyone to the Purple Gold Auction House. On behalf of our auction house, I express my gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Our mission has always been to let buyers purchase with confidence and sellers sell with ease. We have been operating for a thousand years now and are deeply beloved by the residents of the Wildlands.</p><p></p><p>This is our Purple Gold Auction House, Tianhuan City branch. As you all know, we hold a major auction event every ten years, with countless treasures. I hereby announce the start of today's auction event, and hope everyone will return with great spoils."</p><p></p><p>In private room number nine,</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian watched the graceful figure on the red carpet: "What impressive delivery."</p><p></p><p>"Ladies and gentlemen, hello, I am the auctioneer hosting this auction event, Rongyi.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, the first item up for auction is a bag of: Sword Rice."</p><p></p><p>An enormous image appeared high in the air, clearly visible to both the crowd below and those in the private rooms.</p><p></p><p>In room number nine,</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian suddenly looked up sharply. The first auction item, Sword Rice?</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this just rice from my previous life?" Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself, seeing in the image grain-like objects contained in a bag.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the rice made him feel a bit hungry - he had almost forgotten what it felt like to eat.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why children born into major clans, royal families or sects have better innate qualities than children of the poor?</p><p></p><p>We've discovered that Spirit Rice contains a special element that can improve one's physical constitution and strengthen the body.</p><p></p><p>Our first auction item, Sword Rice, has the same effect as Spirit Rice, but differs in that it can also help one comprehend the Sword Intent - a rare ability, as you know!</p><p></p><p>I don't need to explain its benefits further. Sword Rice is the top choice for major powers! Alright, let's begin the auction.</p><p></p><p>Starting bid: 100,000 spirit stones!" The auctioneer brought down his hammer, signaling the official start of bidding.</p><p></p><p>Murmurs arose from below.</p><p></p><p>"This is good stuff..."</p><p></p><p>"I bid 110,000 spirit stones," a voice called out from below.</p><p></p><p>"Psh, where are you from..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Come on, you poor wretches, I'll bid 1 million spirit stones!" A voice came laughing from private room 13.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked over, it was private room 13.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, 1 million spirit stones, big deal? I'll bid 5 million spirit stones!" A voice came from private room 7.</p><p></p><p>"These people in the private rooms are too rich, we have no chance at all..." Someone down below complained.</p><p></p><p>Someone behind advised: "Brother, don't be silly, we common folk can't afford items at a major auction like this. We just came to open our eyes and brag a bit when we go back..."</p><p></p><p>"The current bid is 500,000, any higher bids?"</p><p></p><p>"1 million spirit stones," a female voice came from private room 2.</p><p></p><p>"I've also taken a fancy to this sword rice. 3 million spirit stones!" An overbearing male voice came from private room 3.</p><p></p><p>In one of the private rooms, a middle-aged man covered a young man's mouth with his hand, afraid he would bid again.</p><p></p><p>When the young man stopped struggling, the middle-aged man said in a deep voice: "Remember our purpose! It's not to buy these things! You understand? Don't waste spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The young man lowered his head weakly: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Third and final call for 3 million spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>The crowd below:</p><p>These people are so rich, bidding spirit stones in the millions...</p><p></p><p>"Third and final call for 3 million spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"3 million spirit sto--"</p><p></p><p>"5 million spirit stones!" A calm voice interrupted the auctioneer.</p><p></p><p>"5 million!" People turned to look at private room 9. Indeed, that was about the price Luo Zhongxian expected to bid.</p><p></p><p>The people in the other private rooms also looked over, remembering private room 9.</p><p></p><p>"Going once at 5 million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"10 million spirit stones!" An old voice came from private room 1.</p><p></p><p>"A bag of sword rice sold for 10 million spirit stones! The world has turned upside down!" The people below felt their worldview shattered.</p><p></p><p>"20 million spirit stones!" Luo Zhongxian glanced at private room 1 and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Going once at 20 million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Inside private room 1:</p><p>There was a child beside the old man. The old man looked towards private room 9: "The young man is quite bold. I'll let you have the sword rice."</p><p></p><p>"Going twice at 20 million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"Third and final call at 20 million spirit stones! Sold to the client in private room 9 for a bag of sword rice! Let's give them a warm round of applause!" The auctioneer said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>He could also take a commission, the higher the sale price, the more commission he got. This commission would let him take it easy for several years!</p><p></p><p>"Good, now let's move to the second auction item, a holy sword. The previous owner was a Saint-realm expert who was killed, so this sword was sent here for auction. The sword body is undamaged, an extremely powerful sword artifact. Please bid with confidence.</p><p></p><p>Starting bid: 10 million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd below:</p><p>"A Saint-realm sword artifact!!"</p><p>"Damn, the second item up for auction is that powerful!"</p><p>A...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Inside the private room, a man looked at the sword with burning eyes. If he had this sword, he could avenge his family!</p><p></p><p>"One billion spirit stones!" the man opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"What, it's already up to one billion so quickly!" The crowd below felt even more excited than the people in the private rooms.</p><p></p><p>"Two billion!" A domineering male voice came from Room 3.</p><p></p><p>"Three billion!" The previous man said with red eyes, if it went any higher, he would have to give up and find another way to take revenge!</p><p></p><p>"Four billion!" The domineering male voice continued from Room 3.  </p><p></p><p>"Four billion going once!"</p><p></p><p>"Four billion going twice!"</p><p></p><p>"I bid five billion!" A female voice came from Room 10.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" A domineering figure from Room 3 frowned towards Room 10, then seemed to think of something and took a deep breath without bidding further.</p><p></p><p>"Five billion going once!" The auctioneer was so excited he almost cried. Even sacred-realm weapons didn't sell for this much on the market, though they were hard to obtain.</p><p></p><p>"Five billion going twice!"</p><p></p><p>"Five billion spirit stones going for the third and final time! Sold! Congratulations to the guest in Room 10 for winning the sacred-realm weapon! Let's give her a warm round of applause!" The auctioneer excitedly shouted. He could work a few less years now, how could he not be excited?</p><p></p><p>For the second auction item, Luo Zhongxian watched the whole time without saying a word, because he had the Emperor's Sword and didn't need any other swords or weapons.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's move on to the third auction item, an ancient treasure map. This treasure map is incomplete. The appraisal team believes three parts are missing. If you can complete the three missing parts, you can find the location of the hidden treasure. That's where the value lies. You can explore it yourselves!</p><p></p><p>The starting bid is one million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>From the crowd below:</p><p>"Are you kidding? An incomplete ancient treasure map for that much...who would want that?"</p><p></p><p>"It will probably go unsold."</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer saw no one was bidding and felt a bit awkward and uncomfortable. </p><p></p><p>"One million and one spirit stones," Luo Zhongxian calmly said.</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer quickly looked towards the Room 9 private room with a grateful expression, then said, "One million and one spirit stones going once!"</p><p></p><p>There were whispers from below.</p><p>"The person in Room 9 must be an idiot to buy that."</p><p>"Yeah, yeah."</p><p></p><p>"One million and one spirit stones going twice!"</p><p></p><p>"One million and one spirit stones going for the third and final time! Sold! Congratulations to the guest in Room 9 for winning a copy of the Valley Treasure Map! Let's give him a warm round of applause," the auctioneer excitedly said. At least it didn't go unsold!</p><p></p><p>Before the auction started, he didn't have high hopes for it either, but it was still on the auction list.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, now for the fourth auction item: A young demonic beast left over from a Great Realm expert, the Ice Fierce! Difficult to tame! Even harder to reach the Great Realm! The Ice Fierce has the bloodline of a Great Realm, at minimum it will reach the Spirit Realm, with a chance to even reach the Great Realm!</p><p></p><p>Seize the opportunity while it's young, use your divine arts to make it recognize you as master. The opportunity is right before your eyes!</p><p></p><p>Let's start the bidding now, opening bid: Ten million spirit stones!" The auctioneer shouted with all his might.</p>

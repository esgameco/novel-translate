        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man wearing a blue long robe was holding a book and reading it softly:</p><p></p><p>"The enemy is slow, I am fast. The enemy is fast, I dodge. Among thousands of people, swords and blades cannot touch me."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, it's no wonder that the 'Ethereal Sword Technique' can only be practiced by the patriarchs of our clan. Luo Shentong probably didn't expect that ten years later, I, Luo Changtian, would also be able to enter the ancestral hall, haha." The man chuckled lightly, revealing a hint of pride in his words.</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged man in a blue long robe was Luo Meng's father, Luo Changtian.</p><p></p><p>After killing Luo Qianqun and Luo Zhongxian, he came to the ancestral hall to read the 'Ethereal Sword Technique' that only the patriarchs could practice.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changtian still remembered when he was young, during a martial arts competition, Luo Shentong used an extraordinarily ethereal sword technique to easily defeat him.</p><p></p><p>You could say he was defeated, but Luo Shentong didn't even look at him with a noble expression, which left Luo Changtian feeling resentful for over a decade, and sometimes he even dreamed of Luo Shentong's disdainful expression.</p><p></p><p>Just as Luo Changtian was about to practice this sword technique, a hurried voice came from outside:</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, patriarch, it's not good, it's not good!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Changtian flashed out of the ancestral hall and saw the panicked clansman: "Why are you so flustered? What's the matter, speak slowly..."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, it's terrible, the young master (Luo Meng) has been crippled by Luo Zhongxian, and now Luo Zhongxian is in the young master's room."</p><p></p><p>"What, Luo Zhongxian is not dead?" Luo Changtian was shocked and swiftly disappeared like a shadow.</p><p></p><p>In the young master's room, a woman in tattered clothes, her face streaked with tears, hugged the blanket in a corner of the bed, occasionally revealing her white and tender arms.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah!"</p><p></p><p>Piercing screams broke the frozen space. In the middle of the room, a young, sturdy man with disheveled hair and blood at the corner of his mouth tightly covered the lower half of his body with both hands.</p><p></p><p>A yellowish liquid mixed with red could be seen flowing out, and a strange smell lingered in the air.</p><p></p><p>This sturdy man was Luo Changtian's son, Luo Meng.</p><p></p><p>The woman on the bed was Luo Meili, the most beautiful woman in the tribe. Luo Meng had long coveted her, but considering his father's "grand plan," he had restrained himself from acting on his desires.</p><p></p><p>After Luo Changtian became the patriarch, Luo Meng could no longer hold back his lust, and amid Luo Meili's screams, he brought her into the young master's room to commit a despicable act.</p><p></p><p>In a corner above the room, Luo Zhongxian sat quietly sipping tea, with Liu Fang standing behind him.</p><p></p><p>This scene before them was naturally Luo Zhongxian's doing. After silently returning to the tribe, he used his divine awareness and discovered that Luo Meng was actually forcing himself on Luo Meili in his room!</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had to teach him a lesson!</p><p></p><p>To Luo Meng's shock and confusion, Luo Zhongxian crippled his cultivation with a palm strike, then thrust a sword toward his lower body as Luo Meng looked on in horror.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Luo Meng screamed, clutching his lower body as his body convulsed!</p><p></p><p>Looking down at Luo Meng's miserable state, Luo Zhongxian said, "Luo Meng! Before, you struck me with a palm and a sword, now I've returned a palm and a sword to you. Fair and square!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah!" The screams from the young master's room soon attracted the guards outside, but at first they didn't take it seriously, because for the past two days the young master's...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The depraved life of the young master, they all saw it with their own eyes, wondering what new antics this young master would get up to.</p><p></p><p>Until ten minutes later, they realized they were wrong and rushed in, seeing the young master clutching his lower body and convulsing on the ground, while the former young master Luo Zhongxian sat above him. Instantly, they were shocked.</p><p></p><p>They hurriedly went to notify Luo Changtian.</p><p></p><p>Luo Changtian came and saw his own son twitching motionlessly on the ground, bleeding from below, his expression extremely painful, with the veins on his face protruding!</p><p></p><p>Looking at his son's miserable state, then looking up at Luo Zhongxian calmly drinking tea,</p><p></p><p>"Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p></p><p>"You're here, clan elder, no, I should call you Luo Clan Leader now!" Luo Zhongxian took a sip of tea, not even looking at him!</p><p></p><p>"What do you want? Let Meng'er go," Luo Changtian clenched his fists and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What do I want? Let your son go? Then who let Luo Qiankun go? Who let a 15-year-old unarmed child go?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Changtian suddenly thrust out a sword.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" Luo Changtian moved fast, but retreated even faster, as a shadowy figure "banged" into the ground, immediately shattering it into a spider web pattern and kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>"So strong, cough cough..." Luo Changtian coughed up blood, looking at the wound on his chest in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian remained motionless, the attack coming from Liu Fang behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, are you okay..." Someone went to help Luo Changtian up.</p><p></p><p>"Clan leader, there are only two of them, we can fight them..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, clan leader."</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh!" Looking at these people, who were once his father's subjects that he risked his life to save, Luo Zhongxian truly felt his father was unworthy.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough," Luo Changtian looked at Luo Zhongxian and the young man Liu Fei behind him, knowing today would likely not end well.</p><p></p><p>Then looking at his son lying on the ground, Luo Changtian suddenly closed his eyes, reopening them with a cold gaze. Pushing away the few clansmen supporting him, he disappeared into the sky without looking back.</p><p></p><p>"Want to run? Liu Fang, leave him a breath," Luo Zhongxian understood at a glance when others wanted to flee!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master!" Liu Fang disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The clan leader ran, the clan leader ran!"</p><p></p><p>"What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone don't be afraid, there's only one Luo Zhongxian, and his cultivation is only at the third level of Body Refinement, any one of us has higher cultivation than him. Now that his backer has left, let's capture him."</p><p></p><p>A man spoke loudly, immediately gaining agreement from many people.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this Luo Zhongxian is just a waste, let's all go together and capture him."</p><p></p><p>On the ground, Luo Meng was anguished to discover his father Luo Changtian had abandoned him and fled.</p><p></p><p>As he was feeling dejected, he heard someone say Luo Zhongxian's cultivation was low. "Ahh....(pained voice) You big dummy, I was at the seventh level of Body Refinement before being crippled by one palm strike..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the clansmen raising their weapons to attack, Luo Zhongxian made a decision in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Kill Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p></p><p>"Capture Luo Zhongxian, don't let him escape!" The room was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's expression was icy and emotionless, then a sword beam swept out.</p><p></p><p>"Pu, pu..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Pu, pu"</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations host for gaining one thousand five hundred military merits."</p><p></p><p>The crowd fell with a sound, some fresh blood sprayed onto the ceiling, some fresh blood gushed straight into the crowd, splattering people's faces, the hot blood spraying on their frightened faces made them shudder. Some fresh blood splattered on the ground and tea tables nearby.</p><p></p><p>It looked like a scene from hell on earth.</p><p></p><p>"Ah" a woman's scream came, it was Luo Meili on the bed, pale with fear, trembling all over. Today's events had already exceeded her imagination...</p><p></p><p>The people behind were trembling too, because those who had charged forward included acquaintances at the eighth level of body tempering, as well as the third level of discarding mortality, yet they were all slashed by a single sword stroke. Luo Zhongxian's cultivation had become so powerful, what exactly had happened these past few days?</p><p></p><p>"Bang", a azure figure heavily slammed onto the ground, creating a large pit.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the young master, subordinate has brought Luo Changting back." The one lying on the ground was indeed Luo Changting.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Changting what's wrong with you, get up ah, haha, get up!" Luo Zhongxian's expression was ferocious.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Changting, I'll give you a chance for a quick death, tell me your plan of action in full detail, and I'll give you and your son a quick death!" Luo Zhongxian took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough, what do you want me to say, cough cough, I won't say it."</p><p></p><p>"Ah" wielding the Human Sovereign Sword, he stabbed Luo Changting's thigh, pulling out tufts of fresh blood, Luo Changting couldn't help but scream loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Good ah, if you don't say, I have many ways to make you talk, no need to fear you not talking." Luo Zhongxian laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss" "Ah"</p><p></p><p>Luo Changting was in so much pain his face was all scrunched up. He had never imagined that this son of Luo Shentong, the usually quiet son, could be so vicious.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss" "Ah, I'll say it, I'll say it, just give us a quick death.</p><p></p><p>About about Luo Zhongxian being an ominous being, actually ah..actually it was fabricated..ah, fabricated by me. I, I later on..</p><p></p><p>also assassinated..Luo Qianqun, Luo Zhongxian..was my doing." Luo Changting said painfully in fragments.</p><p></p><p>"Wah" The surrounding crowd from the Luo Clan immediately exploded into chaos. So the young master (Luo Zhongxian) being an ominous being was fabricated by Luo Changting, this was undoubtedly a huge piece of news.</p><p></p><p>He had also assassinated Luo Qianqun, the former clan leader's subordinates as well as Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder..I said it before, I said the young master (Luo Zhongxian) couldn't possibly be an ominous being but you all didn't believe me." A voice came from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah I felt the same way too." More voices chimed in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Ah ah...Luo Zhongxian, I've said it so give me a quick death." Luo Changting said painfully.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, hiss" Two sword slashes rang out, and Luo Changting and Luo Meng's bodies suddenly stopped struggling, their hands loosened, their heads tilted, a trickle of blood flowers flowing from their necks...</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations host for gaining thirty thousand military merits..."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Qun, did you see that, I have already avenged you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian murmured softly. Having killed Luo Changting and Luo Meng father and son, he felt no sense of satisfaction from avenging, only a faint sadness.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, you were previously the Marquis Pingfan of the Sui Dynasty, now I leave this place to you to handle. Kill those who disobey. In three days I want to see a brand new Luo Clan, can you do it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, subordinate can do it."</p>

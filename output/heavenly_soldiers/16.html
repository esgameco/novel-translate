        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The sunlight is so glaring...wow, how many hours have I slept..." This was the most restful sleep Luo Zhongxian had had in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Master Luo, there is a woman outside who says she was raped and is requesting that you enforce the law..." While Luo Zhongxian was washing his face, Liu Fang came in and said to him.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I said it's only been a few days, but they couldn't hold back and had to do this kind of thing! Bang..." After washing his face, Luo Zhongxian threw down the washbasin and said viciously.</p><p></p><p>"Take her to the living room. Also, find out who the man is and bring him to me!"</p><p></p><p>"Got it." Liu Fang exited the room.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the washbasin from the floor, taking a deep breath, changing into a black long robe, Luo Zhongxian hurried to the living room. You have to handle this matter for her. You can't let her wait too long, I guess everyone is waiting for an answer, for justice.</p><p></p><p>When Luo Zhongxian arrived at the living room, he saw a 28-year-old woman, graceful and pitiful-looking, but her clothes were tattered, as if someone had torn at them. He could vaguely see handprints on her thighs.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid. If it's true, I will uphold justice for you. First answer me, what is your name and family? Who did this?"</p><p></p><p>"In response to Master Luo, my name is Luo Chuchu, 26 years old, a widow whose husband died in battle at 'Hunshendi' ten years ago under the clan leader. For the past ten years, the neighbor Luo Qin has been constantly harassing me. Just this morning at 5 am, he came again...wuwu...please uphold justice for me, Master Luo."</p><p></p><p>As Luo Chuchu spoke, recalling the heartbreaking events, she began to cry.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian pulled over a chair:</p><p></p><p>"Don't cry. I will uphold justice for you. I've already asked General Liu Fang to arrest this Luo Qin. He'll be back soon. Please, have a seat first."</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Liu Fang brought in a rugged-looking man who appeared to be in his thirties, strong bodied, but his eyes were constantly shifting, as if trying to avoid something.</p><p></p><p>"It's him, it's this beast...wuwu..." Upon seeing the man, Luo Chuchu stood up pointing at him, as if recalling something, and began crying again.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at the man: "You are Luo Qin? You know what you did to Luo Chuchu this morning, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, Master Luo, I don't even know her. She's lying," the man protested.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, in front of..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"He still doesn't want to be honest in front of me, and insists on making me take action?" </p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's eyes became profound as he looked towards the man. When the man's eyes met Luo Zhongxian's, suddenly, his whole body froze, appearing very strange.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, speak up, tell me everything you did today."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master," the man spoke as if he had lost his self-awareness, his voice sounding somewhat mechanical. Even though Luo Chuchu had heard this guy's voice many times, she felt it was strange, and stopped crying to look over.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Luo Qin, thirty-three years old, unmarried. Last night I couldn't sleep due to a whim. At five o'clock this morning, I went to Luo Chuchu's house and did..." Luo Qin recounted in full detail.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Liu Fang, tie up Luo Qin in the martial arts field, and notify everyone to gather there. Today I will give Luo Chuchu an explanation, and give one to the tribe as well," Luo Zhongxian said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Reform requires bloodshed, it requires upholding the law. To make some people see the situation clearly, those who cannot change, kill them!</p><p></p><p>Kill to establish a bright world, kill to bring civilization to the tribe!</p><p></p><p>Twenty minutes later, Luo Zhongxian arrived at the martial arts field, which was already full of people - some came to watch the excitement, some came to see how this young master would handle it, and some even had expectations, though it was unclear what they expected...</p><p></p><p>"Tribespeople, I am your young master. Today at noon I received a report from Luo Chuchu that Luo Qin went to her house at five o'clock today and committed...against her. Just a while ago, I also summoned Luo Qin to confess publicly. Luo Qin has already admitted his crime.</p><p></p><p>Now, let's hear Luo Qin's account one more time. Luo Qin, say it again." Luo Zhongxian stood beside Luo Qin, speaking to the surrounding crowd, and finally looked at Luo Qin.</p><p></p><p>"I am Luo Qin. This morning at five o'clock, I went to Luo Chuchu's house and committed indecency against her." As soon as Luo Qin finished speaking, the crowd below erupted:</p><p></p><p>"This guy, beat him to death!"</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought, this guy seems so honest and sincere, but he's actually this kind of person. What a waste..."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah, who could have imagined?"</p><p></p><p>"This young master is still better."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crowd's agitated state, Luo Zhongxian gestured for silence, then said:</p><p></p><p>"A few days ago, I said here that every family has rules, and without rules, nothing can be accomplished properly.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Who still remembers how I said I would punish him that day?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" A child's voice quickly rang out from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Good, whose child is this? After the crowd disperses later, go find General Liu Fang and get a bottle of muscle-dissolving liquid for this child."</p><p></p><p>Hearing someone quickly answer the question and give the answer, Luo Zhongxian seemed very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the last meeting was effective," Luo Zhongxian thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I now officially announce, in my capacity as the young master, that Luo Qin has undeniably violated the rules set by the tribe and is sentenced to death to be carried out immediately!" Luo Zhongxian announced with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Reform requires killing one as a warning to a hundred. Human nature is complex; without restraint, it would open Pandora's box and release the demons within, endangering society and causing serious harm to others' lives.</p><p></p><p>After Luo Zhongxian finished speaking, a large half-naked man holding a huge axe walked forward, spat into his palm, forcefully poked his hand, and then swung the axe towards Luo Qin's head.</p><p></p><p>With a "hiss" sound, half a meter of hot blood spurted from the neckless body. Luo Qin's severed head rolled onto the ground, and a member of the crowd immediately spat on it. Those nearby also spat on it one after another.</p><p></p><p>The crowd seemed very excited, some even rushing forward and stabbing Luo Qin's corpse with swords...</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes, the crowd regained their senses and turned towards Luo Zhongxian, loudly shouting, "Young Master, Young Master, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian made a quieting gesture and then slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"Luo Chuchu's husband followed the chieftain to the 'Place of Demise' ten years ago to fight for the protection of the tribe and died on the battlefield as a hero. As the spouse of a hero, she should be respected by the people.</p><p></p><p>I declare that from today onward, to protect the tribe, the families of heroes who died in battle will be protected.</p><p></p><p>I declare: Luo Chuchu will work in the Young Master's residence, and the families of those who died protecting the tribe ten years ago can also work in the Young Master's residence. Next, you will go to General Liu Fang for registration and verification."</p><p></p><p>As Luo Zhongxian left, people were still shouting behind him: "Young Master, Young Master, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian knew he had done the right thing. Only when you have the people's interests at heart and work towards benefiting the people will they be willing to follow you, because they know you are an enlightened leader.</p><p></p><p>A new civilization was being built bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"I'm so hungry, haven't eaten yet. After eating, there's still a lot to do..." Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This is Tianhuang City, we've finally arrived!"</p><p></p><p>In a tea house in Tianhuang City, many people were discussing the prodigies who had come to the city in the past two days. Tianhuang City hadn't been this lively for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Did you know, I heard that Li Xuantong, ranked 90th on the Divine Power Ranking, arrived last night wielding an iron sword through the air..."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't know that, but I heard from the people guarding the teleportation array that a current Buddhist prodigy named Liao Chen rushed over."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I've heard about that too. Early this morning, a celestial maiden riding a giant bird appeared in Tianhuang City. I heard her name is Mu Qin."</p><p></p><p>"You've all just heard rumors. Let me tell you, I saw with my own eyes a huge man carrying a coffin forged from mystical iron, walking step-by-step into an inn to stay. Oh right, his name is Zang Tian."</p><p></p><p>"Zang Tian, what an audacious name...!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, I heard that in the past day or two, Luo Zhongxian, ranked first on the Shedding Mortality Ranking, still hasn't shown up..." a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I heard there were already many people who went to the Purple Gold Auction House, but no one has seen him. Those who caused trouble were beaten out. I heard a few at the Divine Power Realm who made a bigger ruckus were severely injured on the spot by a young man wearing gray clothes with just a palm strike...Now no one dares to go there unless they actually need to buy something from the auction house. What do you all think, is Luo Zhongxian afraid and doesn't dare to come out?"</p><p></p><p>"Heheh, how can we know? With so many prodigies appearing now, they're looking for him for no other reason than to stand on his shoulders and become famous!"</p><p></p><p>"You're mistaken there. There are rumors that Luo Zhongxian possesses an earth-shattering physical constitution and is a peerless prodigy! Some people want to extract his bloodline's divine powers."</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk...they really dare. Don't they fear that if Luo Zhongxian survives this ordeal and grows up, he'll take revenge?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? A prodigy that doesn't grow up is just a clod of dirt in the end. Ah, enough talk, let's drink..." One person shook his head and didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Inside a luxurious room, a few individuals...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>They were discussing something, with both old and young present.</p><p></p><p>"At tomorrow's auction, that item will appear. This time we must obtain that item!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>A bald-looking youth sat cross-legged on the ground, murmuring to himself: "I heard from the master that at this auction in Tian Huang City, a Buddha's relic will appear."</p><p></p><p>In a dark room, a conversation arose: "The target has been confirmed, in the VIP room on the third floor of the Purple Gold Auction House. Now one of us needs to go in and pretend to be buying and selling, to observe the situation and be responsible for tracking them. After leaving Tian Huang City, we will take action..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you all understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>In a VIP room on the third floor of the Purple Gold Auction House, Luo Zhongxian withdrew from the system space. After devouring over ten thousand Shentong realm experts, over a hundred great ability realm experts, and countless other corpses, the Immortal Mosquito successfully advanced to the great ability realm.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian thought about how there was still one day left until tomorrow's auction, and the day after that he would face millions of talented experts, perhaps even great ability realm experts...</p><p></p><p>"System, let me cultivate the 'Apocalypse Zither Scripture' to the highest level," Luo Zhongxian planned to increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Ding, insufficient martial merits!"</p><p></p><p>"What? System, I still have over 500 million martial merits," Luo Zhongxian was startled, hearing 'insufficient martial merits' for the first time when he still had 500 million.</p><p></p><p>"Ding, host, to cultivate the 'Apocalypse Zither Scripture' to the highest level requires 10 billion martial merits."</p><p></p><p>"Ten...what! Ten billion, system, are you scamming me?" Luo Zhongxian looked astonished, then doubted it.</p><p></p><p>"Ding, the 'Apocalypse Zither Scripture' is a Supremacy technique. 500 million martial merits is not even enough to cultivate the first level!"</p><p></p><p>"A Supremacy technique!" Luo Zhongxian's heart pounded. A Supremacy technique, from an era when Supremes still existed and dominated the ages.</p><p></p><p>"System, let me cultivate the 'Reincarnation Fist' to the perfect realm instead."</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations to the host for comprehending the Reincarnation Realm. 10,000 martial merits remaining."</p><p></p><p>A mysterious force emanated from Luo Zhongxian's body - this was the Reincarnation Realm!</p><p></p><p>When battling...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After a while, the cyclical realm aura filled his fists with profound and mysterious power, even affecting the opponent's mind.</p><p></p><p>When masters fight, it often comes down to a single move, a single moment that can snatch the opponent's life...</p><p></p><p>The Great Way has three thousand paths, and the Cyclical Dao is absolutely ranked among the top ten divine abilities. The cyclical realm aura is still a hundred thousand li away from the true Cyclical Dao, but Luo Zhongxian was still very satisfied. At the very least, he had made a start.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Luo Zhongxian calculated in his heart:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the system said to influence millions to complete the mission.</p><p></p><p>Got it."</p><p></p><p>"Number one on the Taoists' Genius List: Luo Zhongxian, invites all Taoists' geniuses and Divine Ability geniuses to battle outside Tianhuang City after the auction! Life and death disregarded!"</p><p></p><p>A paper signed by Luo Zhongxian flew out and landed on a martial artist, who picked it up and read: "What? Luo Zhongxian is challenging all the geniuses to a battle!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see."</p><p>"Me too."</p><p>"Don't snatch it, everyone."</p><p></p><p>Very soon:</p><p></p><p>"Number one on the Taoists' Genius List: Luo Zhongxian, invites all Taoists' geniuses and Divine Ability geniuses to battle outside Tianhuang City after the auction! Life and death disregarded!"</p><p></p><p>This news spread through Tianhuang City at an astonishing speed. It was destined to be a sleepless night.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Purple Gold Auction House, Zhang Xiaohan looked puzzledly towards Luo Zhongxian's room: "Why does he actively challenge all the geniuses by himself?"</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that just within Tianhuang City, there were a vast number of martial artists at the Taoists' realm. If this unknown martial artist became number one on the Taoists' Genius List, there would definitely be a great many who wouldn't accept it!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luo Zhongxian's divine consciousness discovered that everyone was discussing the news of his challenge to the geniuses, and he felt very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>To influence a million people, he had to first get everyone's attention and stir up public opinion. Heheh, the first step is complete.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow is the auction. I wonder if there will be anything I want. I heard there are some good items," Luo Zhongxian thought to himself, as the lights flickered and the room fell into darkness.</p>

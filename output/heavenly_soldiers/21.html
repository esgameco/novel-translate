        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan fell into deep thought: "Just now, the Immortal Master told her that this kind of elixir pill can help people break through the realm of divine abilities, but the Immortal Master himself could not analyze what the specific ingredients were, making it very difficult to imitate or replicate..."</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Immortal Master proposed how to view Luo Zhongxian, whether to win him over or kill him.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan recalled Luo Zhongxian's performance on the Celestial Genius Ranking, as well as the large number of ferocious beast corpses needed recently. It's possible that Luo Zhongxian had already figured it out and expected someone would come after him, so he would further break through his cultivation!</p><p></p><p>"Ranked first on the Celestial Genius list, this is the physique of an peerless genius! Just don't know what kind of physique this Mr. Luo has..."</p><p></p><p>Late at night in Tianhuan City, the lights were bright at the Wang Family, one of the four great clans.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I will definitely make you die a miserable death!" Wang Teng howled lying on the bed, wrapped in a thick layer of white gauze.</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng's father, Wang Dahuo, although his name contained "fire", was a cautious and meticulous person, otherwise he couldn't be the clan leader of the Wang Family.</p><p></p><p>"Dear husband, look at how badly our son Teng is injured and how much blood he has lost. You must avenge this grievance for our son."</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng's mother, a noble lady around fifty years old.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I know. Let me tell you and Teng on the bed to listen carefully. This matter is over, and you are not allowed to mention it again, understand?" Wang Dahuo looked dejected.</p><p></p><p>His wife looked at him with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, are you afraid? Our son was beaten, and you don't dare speak up?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Dahuo angrily said:</p><p></p><p>"You silly woman, what do you know? First, this incident was provoked by your precious son. And do you know who the other person is? The number one genius on the Celestial Genius Ranking who has reached the Realm of Transcendence, Luo Zhongxian!</p><p></p><p>His name contains 'Immortal', the number one genius! It's not that simple, is it? Use your brain before speaking to me, okay!</p><p></p><p>As for our son, once his wounds heal, he is not allowed to go out for a month, that's my order!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng stopped crying on the bed. The number one genius on the Celestial Genius Ranking!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He never expected that he would actually want to fight with such a freak, just thinking about it made him feel afraid!</p><p></p><p>The Gai Shi physical constitution could cross levels for battle! Although the Wang family had spiritual realm, they didn't have the foundation for higher levels!</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I've already spread the news about Teng'er's matter. Even if we don't take action, others will naturally help us take action. I believe the talents from nearby cities will very much want to challenge this number one genius on the Talent List!" After saying this, Wang Dahuo left the room.</p><p></p><p>Tian Huang City had four huge teleportation formations. Relying on formation techniques, they could teleport across regions and reach instantly.</p><p></p><p>In front of one teleportation formation, several soldiers were guarding it.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, how many batches have come through already?" one soldier said.</p><p></p><p>"The twelfth batch, I think."</p><p></p><p>"There will be even more people coming over the next two days, an endless stream."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Luo Zhongxian, the number one genius on the Talent List! And the once-a-decade big auction event, they're both worth paying attention to."</p><p></p><p>"Are you guys going to participate in this auction event?"</p><p></p><p>"Participate? Can you afford it? Never mind, more people are coming."</p><p></p><p>They saw brilliant light shining on the teleportation formation. After a moment, the light faded, and a monk in his twenties appeared on the formation, smiling faintly and wearing a Buddhist robe. They heard him murmur:</p><p></p><p>"So this is Tian Huang City. Number one genius on the Talent List in the Tui Fan Realm, let me see your ability!"</p><p></p><p>Then his figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't just this one formation - at the other three formations, a few more young people arrived as well.</p><p></p><p>There were sword-carrying swordsmen, tall burly men, elegant ladies - they had all spent a great deal to teleport here because of Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>Many more such people were still on their way.</p><p></p><p>It was destined to be a sleepless night.</p><p></p><p>In his room, Luo Zhongxian was observing the spirit-devouring mosquitoes in his system space.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that the 1,100 million bodies of savage beasts that were put in during the afternoon had now been devoured by more than half by the Immortal-Devouring Mosquitoes.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, they would be completely devoured by morning.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian sensed the power of the Immortal-Devouring Mosquitoes, he was no longer a match for them now.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal-Devouring Mosquitoes had devoured hundreds of bodies of spirit-realm demonic beasts, as well as a vast number of bodies of savage beasts at the mortal-shedding realm. Whether they had reached the great ability realm, Luo Zhongxian was not clear, but they had certainly reached the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>What shocked Luo Zhongxian was that the Immortal-Devouring Mosquitoes did not need to undergo heavenly tribulations. As long as they had an unceasing supply of blood food, they could continue to evolve.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was very clear about the situation he was facing now. Surely there were many people inquiring about his whereabouts. This was also why he had made a deal with Zhang Xiaohuan from the Purple Gold Auction House, using the Spirit-Realm Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Although this woman Zhang Xiaohuan had always kept her face veiled, and he had not known her for long, he had a premonition that she would not betray him out of greed for the Spirit-Realm Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Facts proved that he was right. Of course, even if he was wrong, Luo Zhongxian still had a trump card!</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow, I'll make another big deal with Zhang Xiaohuan!" Luo Zhongxian thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In the city, a huge teleportation array shone with light, and several figures walked out. A voice rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Is this Heavenly Wilderness City?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord, this is Heavenly Wilderness City," a soldier hurriedly replied upon seeing the people emerge.</p><p></p><p>Only extraordinary individuals had the ability to teleport long distances, as ordinary people lacked such financial resources.</p><p></p><p>"Good, this is a reward for you all." Some spirit stones flew towards the soldiers, and they excitedly scrambled to grab them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, find a place to rest for the night. Tomorrow, we'll investigate the news about Luo Zhongxian, the number one on the Heaven's Genius List!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord."</p><p></p><p>"This is a secret operation to capture Luo Zhongxian. The news must not be leaked, or it will bring great disaster!"</p><p></p><p>"You can only blame yourself for having a transcendent physique, Luo Zhongxian."</p>

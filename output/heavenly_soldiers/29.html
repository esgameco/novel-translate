        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's really the Young Master, everyone look, the Young Master has returned..."</p><p></p><p>"Where, let me see. Oh it really is the Young Master, the Young Master has returned..." </p><p></p><p>"The Young Master has brought back a woman as beautiful as a celestial fairy..."</p><p></p><p>In front of the Luo clan's village, Luo Zhongxian looked ahead towards the village, having finally returned.</p><p></p><p>He had broken through to the realm of supreme spiritual attainment, traveling a hundred miles in a single step. He rushed back to the village in the early morning of the second day.</p><p></p><p>The first to discover Luo Zhongxian were the bear children playing in front of the village gate. The bear children used to be extremely lazy, but now they drink evolution water every day, and each one is full of energy.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian carefully observed these bear children, noticing their martial arts cultivation had reached at least the eighth level of body tempering! And each one had a sturdy build like an ox.</p><p></p><p>"Good, the future of the children is the future of the clan..."</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Li Jiayu's spiritual eyes gazed at the frolicking children ahead.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the place where the Young Master grew up."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian turned to look at Li Jiayu.</p><p></p><p>"What Young Master? From now on, call me Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Li Jiayu replied reluctantly. Calling him Young Master gave her a chance, but calling him Lord...</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian took the lead, walking into the village.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Lord."</p><p>"Greetings, Lord."</p><p></p><p>A crowd of adults and children surrounded them, loudly calling out "Lord."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stopped, looking at the clansmen who had gathered around, their eyes full of anticipation, gazing at him like an idol.</p><p></p><p>"Haha...everyone is well. Just a few days apart and all of you have improved in cultivation. Your faces are glowing red with abundant energy. Haha...you are well, that is truly good."</p><p></p><p>"Lord, I passed the admission test the day before yesterday and started training at the martial arts academy yesterday," an excited child jumped up.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was also very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, that's great news. How many more of you were successfully admitted?"</p><p></p><p>"Me, Lord, me..."</p><p>"I was too, I was the third one admitted. Yesterday I learned the Horse Stance and punching from the headmaster."</p><p>"Lord, I was admitted to the Academy of Thought to learn writing from the headmaster. Now I can recognize many characters..."</p><p>"Me too."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the children vying to share their accomplishments, Luo Zhongxian set aside the major task on his mind. Liu Fei and Fan Li had done well.</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, they had already started the academies, working with incredible efficiency. The original plan was to open them in a month.</p><p></p><p>"Good."</p><p></p><p>Extending his spiritual sense, he saw two new buildings erected to the left and right of the training grounds, with the words "Martial Arts Academy" and "Academy of Thought" written above them.</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>Retracting his spiritual sense, Luo Zhongxian looked into the distance and nodded at Liu Fei and Fan Li.</p><p></p><p>Two figures stood at the back of the crowd, watching Luo Zhongxian surrounded by people.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fei wore a blue robe, a resolute smile on his stern face.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master has grown stronger again."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Young Master is now even stronger than me," said Fan Li wearing a white robe, his wise eyes carrying a hint of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Fan Li...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>I sensed Luo Zhongxian's aura, a surge of blood energy shooting straight into the sky!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, since everyone is here, let me share some good news. From now on, we don't have to eat those unpalatable beast meats anymore. We have spirit rice to eat."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian took out a handful of tall rice from the Hundred Herb Garden's secret realm and held it up high.</p><p></p><p>This was sword rice. After obtaining it, Luo Zhongxian immediately planted it in the Hundred Vegetable Garden's secret realm.</p><p></p><p>One day was equivalent to one year!</p><p></p><p>Now the Hundred Herb Garden was a dense golden rice field, with straight rice plants bearing plump grains of sword rice.</p><p></p><p>"This is spirit rice! The spirit rice of our Luo clan. You may not have heard of spirit rice before, so let me tell you.</p><p></p><p>Why are the major clans, royal aristocrats, and large sects so powerful, with everyone having better physiques?</p><p></p><p>It's because they grew up eating this spirit rice. Not only is it delicious, but eating it long-term can also enhance one's physique!</p><p></p><p>If a woman eats it for an extended period, the children she gives birth to will have much better physiques too."</p><p></p><p>The auction claimed the sword rice could help comprehend the sword intent, but Luo Zhongxian didn't find it very convincing. If sword intent could be attained by eating rice, why were there so few people who understood it?</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, does our family also have this spirit rice to eat?" A mumbling male voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked towards the voice and saw a man wearing tattered clothes with several patches, his face dirty, his eyes filled with longing.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, of course. Now go back and get the water jars you usually use to carry water, come to the martial field to line up, and I'll distribute them one by one."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Young Master is giving out spirit rice..."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go get the water jars."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master. May the Young Master be well."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian watched the clansmen hurriedly run back to their homes to get water jars, shaking his head and laughing.</p><p></p><p>For a martial cultivator, a water jar was like carrying a bag, feeling no weight at all.</p><p></p><p>After the crowd left, Luo Zhongxian looked at Liu Fang and Fan Li, saying sincerely:</p><p></p><p>"You've both worked hard during this period, managing the academy and protecting the clan's safety. And Liu Fang, you've even broken through to the Divine Ability Realm! When did you break through?"</p><p></p><p>"No hardship, no hardship," Liu Fang hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I broke through to the Divine Ability Realm the day before yesterday. At that time, there were a few people from the Divine Ability Realm with ill intentions, but fortunately Mr. Fan helped me, allowing me to successfully break through to the Divine Ability Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The day before yesterday? I broke through yesterday evening, one day faster than you. Good."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about the Divine Ability Realm cultivators, Luo Zhongxian's gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know which forces those Divine Ability Realm cultivators belonged to?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Li stroked his chin. </p><p></p><p>"Young Master, they were originally beasts who underwent tribulation to become human. I've investigated, and they don't belong to any force. When Liu Fang the General was breaking through, the upheaval attracted them, thinking it was an opportunity, so they came to contend for it."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian nodded, took out a spatial ring, and handed it to Liu Fang, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, there are a thousand pounds of spirit rice here. Distribute it to everyone later. Make sure everyone gets some. If it's not enough, come find me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." He said to the somewhat bored A Yu.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He said,</p><p></p><p>"Ohh..." Li Jiayu came back to her senses and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is really lucky to have found such a beautiful and jade-like lady," Liu Fei murmured.</p><p></p><p>"This woman..." A gleam of insight flashed in Fan Li's wise eyes as he stroked his chin in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Field</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, or there might not be any left!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, this spirit rice sounds like good stuff, I wonder what it tastes like..."</p><p></p><p>"You, you only think about eating..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's none of your business."</p><p></p><p>One by one carrying large water buckets, they ran towards the martial arts field.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang and Fan Li exchanged a smile, then flew towards the martial arts field.</p><p></p><p>The Young Master's Mansion</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian sat alone in the study.</p><p></p><p>"System, view information."</p><p></p><p>"Human Race - Luo Zhongxian, Physical Constitution: Devouring Body, Heart Demon Body, Thunder God Body (Embryonic Form), Martial Arts Cultivation: Deity Realm Great Perfection - Five Thousand Dragon Powers</p><p></p><p>Divine Abilities: Sword Intent; Reincarnation Fist; Soul Severing; An Inch Apart; Primordial Chaos Power; Indestructible Divine Ability; Lifespan: Ten Thousand Years  </p><p></p><p>Equipment: Human Emperor Sword (Sealed); Human Emperor Seal (Sealed); Mask of Confusion; Life and Death Zither</p><p></p><p>Talents: Liu Fang (Initial Deity Realm); Fan Li (Deity Realm Great Perfection/Immortal Body)</p><p></p><p>Pet: Immortal-Devouring Mosquito (Highly Capable); Battle Merits: Four Billion</p><p></p><p>Remaining Cards: Talent Card*2; Good Luck Card*3; Equipment Card*1"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the full screen of information.</p><p></p><p>"When did I become so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't lack divine abilities or equipment!</p><p></p><p>"Four billion battle merits!" Slaying 800,000 celestial talents plus eight highly capable beings, Luo Zhongxian didn't expect to gain so many battle merits!</p><p></p><p>Now he had enough merits, but the system shop hadn't refreshed. He had bought everything he could, except for some consumable spirit pills for his clan's daily use. It seemed there was nothing else to buy!</p><p></p><p>"It looks like it's time to establish my own dynasty!" Luo Zhongxian raised his head, revealing a handsome face and profound eyes.</p><p></p><p>Only by establishing a dynasty would the system update with new goods and more privileges.</p><p></p><p>He took out a map from his spatial ring, over a meter long when unfolded. This was the latest map he had asked Zhang Xiaohang to sell him at the auction house. Zhang Xiaohang gave him her own copy.</p><p></p><p>The map still carried the scent of a young lady. It was densely marked with forbidden areas, existing dynasties, land divisions, etc. - extremely detailed.</p><p></p><p>Such a map was currently the most lacking resource. To establish a dynasty, he first needed to know the powers in the world and where to develop his own forces. </p><p></p><p>This map would be of great strategic importance.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian studied it for a long while, rubbing his dry eyes. At some point, Li Jiayu had entered again, carrying a teapot to pour him a cup of hot tea.</p><p></p><p>Sipping the hot tea, he thought about the map and establishing a dynasty, and couldn't help but slap his thigh.</p><p></p><p>"Good, go and summon Liu Fang and Fan Li to discuss this great matter."</p><p></p><p>Updated, Luo Zhongxian returned to the tribe, intending to build a nation!</p>

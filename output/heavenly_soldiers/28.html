        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Creak creak</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? This side is almost cooked." Luo Zhongxian skillfully flipped over the meat. Beside him, Li Jiayuwas leaning against a tree, staring blankly at him.</p><p></p><p>She was wondering, how is he so powerful? Why did I awaken the Chaos Body, but not only did I not gain any power, my family was ruined and my life essence was extracted by the Underworld. I was even sent to an auction house to be auctioned off as someone's slave!</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for meeting Luo Zhongxian, with so many hungry wolf-like gazes below that stage that day, it would have been so hopeless...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, her stomach let out a "woo" sound. She rubbed her belly - it had been many days since she last had a full meal.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, what are you spacing out for? Hungry, right? Here, catch this." Luo Zhongxian cut off a piece of meat and tossed it over.</p><p></p><p>She clumsily caught the thrown meat, yelping from how hot it was:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so hot! Why didn't you wait before giving it to me? Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian held a piece of meat up to his mouth as he ate and said indistinctly:</p><p></p><p>"Hey, if you didn't talk, I would have thought you were a mute. If you were mute, then I'd be at a disadvantage."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you're the mute one! Your whole family are mutes..." Li Jiayuwent beet red.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so hot..." She had just taken a bite of the meat when she spat it back out, sticking her tongue out because it was too hot...</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew over, and Luo Zhongxian smiled at her disheveled appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's not hot now, hurry up and eat."</p><p></p><p>Looking into the distance, his gaze was deep and profound.</p><p></p><p>"We'll have to fight after eating."</p><p></p><p>"I'm full..." Li Jiayuwas happier than she had been in a long time, having finally eaten her fill, and more importantly, without those hateful shackles.</p><p></p><p>This was a world full of the air of freedom. Even more importantly, this young master who had bought her treated her well, giving her a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stretched lazily.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..." How comfortable. With a thought, a mosquito appeared in front of him and grew larger, carrying Li Jiayuinto the air to fly away.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what is this thing?! Put me down!!" Cries of fright and shouting came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Be good and stay up there. It's my pet, it won't hurt you. Be good now." Luo Zhongxian's voice rang in her mind, causing her to quiet down.</p><p></p><p>"Gentlemen, I have one more piece of meat here. Who wants to eat it?" Luo Zhongxian seemed to be talking to the air.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, not bad for someone with the Peerless Physique! Your reactions are much sharper than that so-called Chaos Body from before! Hahaha."</p><p></p><p>A booming laugh came, and eight men dressed in long black robes with the words "Underworld" walked out of the darkness, looking towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>The burly leading man, seeing Luo Zhongxian just calmly watching them, couldn't help but say: "Good, befitting of the Peerless Genius who slew 800,000 of his peers with a single sword!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the group wearing Underworld robes, a glimmer of realization flashed in Luo Zhongxian's eyes:</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you want to capture me, then extract my Origin Power like you did with the Chaos Body?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct, smart ones really are different! If you cooperate, we'll leave you a chance to live. If not...heh heh."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the eight figures, Luo Zhongxian's gaze suddenly deepened.</p><p></p><p>"Eight Greats, you really do think highly of me..." "If I'm not mistaken, you have a page of the Imperial Scripture on you! Coming all this way in the middle of the night, thank you for delivering the Imperial Scripture! I'll gladly accept the Dao Scripture."</p><p></p><p>"Devouring the Saint Realm demon, breaking through to the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Within his spirit space, a huge python appeared above, with a black hole rapidly devouring its flesh and blood...</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's power was rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>One hundred Dragon Forces.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred Dragon Forces. </p><p></p><p>Three hundred Dragon Forces!</p><p></p><p>"Crack!" The tree beside him could not withstand the formless power in the air and toppled over. Below, with Luo Zhongxian at the center, huge cracks were appearing in the ground...</p><p></p><p>"Boss! This guy's power is rising fast, let's attack!" A black figure shouted urgently.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, even a lion needs full strength to catch a rabbit!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, good idea, attack nâ€”no wait, run!!" The lead black-robed man had wanted to kill Luo Zhongxian quickly to complete the mission, but suddenly remembered he was at the Mortal Defying Realm, about to break through to Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm came with Heavenly Tribulations!</p><p></p><p>The higher one's talent, the more powerful the Heavenly Tribulation. Especially with the eight of them Greats standing in Luo Zhongxian's Tribulation aura, the Heavens might mistake them for the one undergoing Tribulation and intensify its might even further!!</p><p></p><p>"Heh, want to run? Too late!" Luo Zhongxian said indifferently. Everything was within his calculations - he had already reached the peak of the Mortal Defying Realm long ago, and was just waiting for an opportunity. Now that opportunity had arrived!</p><p></p><p>He would use this chance to directly break through to the pinnacle of the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" Another thunderous sound came from his body.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The third layer of the Nine Cycles Body Refinement Tattered Scripture, the Celestial Abilities layer, has been achieved! Physical strength reaches the power of one thousand dragons, gaining the Undying Celestial Ability!</p><p></p><p>As long as there is a drop of fresh blood remaining, rapid resurrection is possible. As the Nine Cycles Body Refinement is perfected, one can even be reborn from the endless river of time through someone else's thought!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom!" A tremendous pressure suddenly transmitted from thousands of miles around. Streaks of lightning rapidly formed, striking downwards!!</p><p></p><p>The black-robed leader and others felt the urge to curse.</p><p></p><p>They had just shielded themselves from eight miles out, thinking they were beyond the celestial tribulation's range!!</p><p></p><p>An ordinary celestial abilities realm was one hundred miles. For a celestial prodigy it was around five hundred miles.</p><p></p><p>Even a formidable peerless celestial prodigy was just one thousand miles!But now they saw the entire sky densely covered in lightning bolts!</p><p></p><p>Each lightning bolt had a wisp of flames attached! Smashing towards the black-robed people!</p><p></p><p>"We're finished, we might perish here! This celestial tribulation has mutated!" After a bolt of lightning flashed by, seeing the sky full of flaming lightning bolts, the leading black-robe's heart was about to explode!</p><p></p><p>In the center of the lightning tribulation</p><p></p><p>"Break through this celestial abilities realm for me!" Luo Zhongxian let out a low roar, his power rapidly increasing.</p><p></p><p>One thousand two hundred dragon powers!</p><p></p><p>Two thousand dragon powers!  </p><p></p><p>Three thousand dragon powers!! It stopped there. Feeling the power within his body, so this was the celestial abilities realm? Truly formidable.</p><p></p><p>In Luo Zhongxian's consciousness sea, apart from a spirit tablet, a bright shining pearl had appeared. But this pearl was excessively large!</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary celestial abilities realm, the consciousness sea just had a pearl the size of a grain of rice. But his was many times larger than that!</p><p></p><p>The difference between an ant and the bright moon!</p><p></p><p>This pearl was the celestial abilities realm, the source of divine power. As the realm increased, it would grow larger, emanating even stronger divine power!</p><p></p><p>In the distant sky, an enormous mosquito with a sword-like blood vessel emanating cold light carried a graceful figure, hovering and looking towards the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Li Jiayu covered her mouth, two streams of tears flowing out. With a crying voice she said:</p><p></p><p>"You won't come to any harm. You're so powerful, slaying eighty million with a single sword strike...you won't come to any harm, wuwu..."</p><p></p><p>In the center of the celestial tribulation</p><p></p><p>Divine power enveloped Luo Zhongxian's body as he floated towards the distance. His eyes saw a bolt of lightning strike down, directly annihilating a beast at the ninth level of Mortal Shedding in the mountains!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed formidable!"</p><p></p><p>"Footsteps Between Worlds!" A hundred mile step brought him before a black-robed person, now wearing tattered robes with a hundred holes from the intense and dense lightning force he could not withstand!</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luo Zhongxian approach, he was both startled and enraged!!</p><p></p><p>"Heh, so even you underworld folks have fearful expressions. Just a moment ago you were so arrogant, looking like you had me in the bag! I'll start with you."</p><p></p><p>Devouring!</p><p></p><p>A black hole appeared, sucking in the nearby lightning bolts!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah! Boss save me!! Boom--"</p><p></p><p>The black-robe disappeared into the black hole in utter despair!</p><p></p><p>After reaching the celestial abilities realm, the Devouring ability also became stronger!</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations host, you have gained 500,000 martial merits!"</p><p></p><p>So a celestial abilities expert was worth 500,000 martial merits? Here there were eight, four million martial merits, heh heh!</p><p></p><p>Devouring the lightning bolts could also increase his strength? Luo Zhongxian's eyes went wide! This Devouring Constitution was too domineering!</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, you underworld small fries, I'm coming for you!" Luo Zhongxian's body transformed into a black hole charging towards the black-robed figures one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard, what kind of ability is this! What constitution!" A burly man revealed a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>He was the celestial abilities expert leader in charge of capturing Luo Zhongxian this time.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a black hole that could devour lightning and all things, for a moment he truly didn't know how to deal with it. Too domineering!</p><p></p><p>"Wait, Devouring! It's the Devouring Constitution!" The large man's face turned ashen. Rumor had it the Devouring Constitution was best dealt with at a high realm, using overwhelming force to suppress it. Otherwise, the more the Devouring Constitution fought, the stronger it became!!</p><p></p><p>"It's already lost control, we must find a way to escape!" The large man flashed past a lightning strike and transformed into a beam of light, fleeing into the distance!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations host, you have gained 500,000 martial merits!"</p><p></p><p>"Physical body strength three thousand five hundred dragon powers!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, this guy wants to run!" In his divine sense, a large man was rapidly escaping, trying to leave the celestial tribulation's range.</p><p></p><p>"Too bad, you think this celestial tribulation only goes this far? I have a dual constitution, come forth Heart Demon Body!" An enormous black shadow appeared behind Luo Zhongxian's back. The black-robed figures seemed to be controlled, instead charging towards the large man to kill him!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" The celestial tribulation changed, no longer flaming lightning bolts but starting to rain down!</p><p></p><p>A rain drop landed on the large man! A chunk of his flesh instantly vanished!</p><p></p><p>"This is! This is Bone Corroding Water!! Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The large man was inadvertently struck by a few more drops on his body, and his flesh began disintegrating!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the bodies of several powerful beings controlled by the demonic spirits began to dissipate!</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Luo Zhongxian looked at his own shoulder, where a drop of blood had actually melted a lump of flesh. Even Luo Zhongxian had to take this so-called rainwater seriously!</p><p></p><p>Devouring!</p><p></p><p>A black hole enveloped Luo Zhongxian, giving a sense of being impervious to all laws. The surrounding corrosive water was completely devoured, instead becoming his foundation!</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations to the host for obtaining 500,000 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>They were all dead! Only the leader of the big men remained. Luo Zhongxian looked over!</p><p></p><p>This time, the big man was wearing several treasures, but unfortunately, the spiritual light of the treasures soon disappeared, leaving him missing arms and legs!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe..." The big man let out a miserable cry, watching Luo Zhongxian turn into a black hole approaching him, and the huge demonic shadow behind!</p><p></p><p>He knew it was over! Everything had ended!</p><p></p><p>The hunter who chased the swan was finally pecked!</p><p></p><p>"Devouring"</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>The black hole swallowed the big man in one gulp under his despairing expression!</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations to the host for obtaining 800,000 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>It was over!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian revealed his original body, the flesh that had disappeared from his body had regrown!</p><p></p><p>Indestructible Bodily Immortality!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The rainwater from the sky, as if finding its target, poured down on Luo Zhongxian!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian dispelled the Devouring Technique and the Demonic Spirit Technique, leaving only his true self to face the endless corrosive rainwater from the sky!</p><p></p><p>"Sasa"</p><p></p><p>A piece of flesh disappeared from his head, but regrew in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>A toe disappeared from his foot, but regrew in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>An arm fell off and dissipated! But regrew in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood under the heavenly tribulation, allowing the corrosive rainwater to fall, using the heavenly tribulation to temper his body! The dissipation and regeneration of his flesh produced even greater power!</p><p></p><p>"Bodily Strength of 3,600 Dragons!"...</p><p></p><p>"Bodily Strength of 3,900 Dragons!"...</p><p></p><p>"Bodily Strength of 4,500 Dragons!"...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" The heavenly tribulation let out a tremendous roar, and the rainwater stopped falling! Thunder clouds began to gather!</p><p></p><p>From a million-mile thunder cloud, it shrank to a thousand miles, then further to one mile!</p><p></p><p>The thunder cloud turned a brilliant black! A sword formed from lightning was condensing, as if to strike down the freak below!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's expression became solemn when he saw this!</p><p></p><p>A quantitative change had led to a qualitative change!</p><p></p><p>In the sky below the thunder cloud, a huge sword one mile long formed, its body flickering with streaks of lightning!</p><p></p><p>"Shi"</p><p></p><p>The giant sword, carrying lightning, made a piercing sound as it slashed down towards Luo Zhongxian's head!</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>"No!" A heart-wrenching cry came from afar!</p><p></p><p>A huge mosquito appeared outside the heavenly tribulation, "No!" A graceful figure collapsed on the mosquito, as if all her strength had dissipated along with the strike of the heavenly sword!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly sword struck the ground, creating a bottomless black hole. Streaks of lightning danced around the edge of the black hole, dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly tribulation seemed unable to sense Luo Zhongxian's aura! The heavenly sword gradually dissipated, and the heavenly tribulation was about to disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Boom"</p><p></p><p>From the black hole below, another black hole appeared, dark purple in color, with streaks of lightning dancing within it!</p><p></p><p>"Think you can leave! It's not that easy!" Luo Zhongxian's voice rang out!</p><p></p><p>Li Jiayun heard the sound and looked over, overjoyed to the point of tears, using her hand to wipe the tears from her face!</p><p></p><p>She didn't want him to see her embarrassing state.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian turned into a black hole, charging straight into the dissipating heavenly tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had also narrowly escaped! If not for his Indestructible Immortality Technique, he would have been shattered by that one sword strike!</p><p></p><p>Within the heavenly tribulation, huge streaks of lightning continuously danced around.</p><p></p><p>A black hole appeared in the center, its immense gravitational pull devouring the power of the lightning!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's bodily strength was rapidly increasing! His divine power was also rapidly growing!</p><p></p><p>The heavenly tribulation was visibly dissipating at a rapid pace! The sky gradually returned to clarity.</p><p></p><p>"Bo" The heavenly tribulation dissipated, revealing Luo Zhongxian's figure, his eyes tightly closed, with an S-shaped lightning mark appearing on his brow!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, this one splash really profited greatly from the heavenly tribulation. Not only did I gain 4 million battle merits and break through to the Perfected Realm of divine abilities, but I also condensed the embryonic form of the Thunder God Body and obtained a volume of the Dao Scriptures!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the glowing page of scripture in his hand, Luo Zhongxian thought,</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>The huge mosquito disappeared, Luo Zhongxian hugged Ayun and vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Thirty minutes later, a few figures rushed over, looking at each other, then at the pitch-black bottomless black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Just who was it that broke through the heavenly tribulation here? Are they dead or alive?..."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>From time to time, a low roar echoed out from within the valley, adding a layer of mystery to the entire valley.</p><p></p><p>In front of the valley, under the shining sun, two figures stood silently. They were Luo Zhongxian and Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, ahead lies the Barbarian Beast Valley. There are nearly a thousand barbarian beasts inside, with ten at the Molt Realm. The strongest cultivation is at the third level of the Molt Realm."</p><p></p><p>Even before the battle started, Luo Zhongxian began calculating.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand barbarian beasts would be worth ten thousand merit points. I wonder how many merit points the Molt Realm beasts are worth?"</p><p></p><p>He gestured towards Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>"You stay by the side and provide support. Don't engage in any life-threatening combat."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>"System, check my current information."</p><p></p><p>"Human Luo Zhongxian, age fifteen, Devouring Body, Weapon: Human Emperor Sword (sealed), Comprehension: Sword Intent, Tempered Body Eight Layers, ninety thousand pounds of strength, Subordinate: Liu Fang."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, an ordinary Tempered Body Eight Layers has three thousand pounds of strength, but I have ninety thousand pounds of strength!"</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, how much physical strength do you have now?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Young Master, this subordinate has one million pounds of strength at the Molt Nine Layers, equivalent to the strength of an elephant. An ordinary Molt Nine Layers only has one hundred thousand pounds of strength."</p><p></p><p>In the Barbarian Wilderness Continent, there was a creature called the Barbarian Elephant, with incredibly powerful physical strength. A single stomp from an adult could exert one million pounds of force. Thus, in the Barbarian Wilderness, having strength reaching one million pounds was simply called "the strength of an elephant."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang was ten times stronger than an ordinary human, befitting a great general of the Sui Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"So apart from prodigies, I have greater strength than any ordinary Molt Realm cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" A massive sword energy struck the mountain peak, causing a deafening rumble. Huge boulders rolled down the mountain, "Bang!" forming large craters in the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Roar, roar, roar, roar!" From the dark valley, a red light suddenly appeared, looking exceptionally ominous. Among it were ten basketball-sized red beams of light, bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, humans have come," a voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I'll take the young ones out to greet them," an angry voice said.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, these humans wouldn't rashly attack our Barbarian Beast Valley without confidence."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, big brother. The third and I will go out and make sure they can never return, filling our bellies with their flesh."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful..."</p><p></p><p>The barbarian beasts could actually speak. They were the Molt Realm barbarian beasts. Molt, molt! From ordinary to extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>"Roar, roar, roar!" As if receiving some signal, one barbarian beast after another charged out of the valley like madmen.</p><p></p><p>Massive barbarian beasts rushed out, their crimson eyes, drooling foul saliva. Their huge paws stomped the ground, causing thunderous booms.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect timing." Luo Zhongxian let out a loud roar, then drew the Human Emperor Sword and charged into the barbarian beast horde, unleashing a massive sword energy that swept through the front ranks.</p><p></p><p>The barbarian beasts in the very front suddenly stopped, a streak of fresh blood gushing from their bodies. Before they could fall, they were trampled underfoot by the beasts behind, their lives unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining ten merit points. Congratulations on gaining ten merit points."</p><p></p><p>A stream of system notifications rang in Luo Zhongxian's ears, but he had no time to calculate them now.</p><p></p><p>A barbarian beast with huge fangs charged towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" He let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>Stretching out his hand, he grabbed...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He grabbed its ferocious fangs, and with a sudden pull, the entire brutal beast was lifted up by Luo Zhongxian, who wielded it like a weapon to strike.</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom" came a series of huge sounds, the ground was pounded into large pits, and huge cracks appeared under Luo Zhongxian's feet where he stood.</p><p></p><p>At the back of the brutal beast horde, three huge brutal beasts were conversing.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, this kid is too powerful, we're no match for him. Quickly notify the boss to come reinforce us."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I've already passed the message to the boss earlier. The boss will be out soon."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang stood on a huge rock.</p><p></p><p>"The young master's power is truly brutal!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang looked at the brutal beasts and seven huge brutal beasts rushing out of the valley and said in a low voice, "They've all come out, good."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining ten battle merits, congratulations on gaining ten battle merits."</p><p></p><p>In the center of the battlefield, Luo Zhongxian threw aside the poor brutal beast he had been using as a weapon, causing the ground to shake.</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations on gaining ten battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Through the horde of brutal beasts, Luo Zhongxian vaguely saw the huge brutal beasts behind the horde, which must be the ten Tui Fan Realm brutal beasts that Liu Fei mentioned.</p><p></p><p>When brutal beasts reached the Tui Fan Realm, their bodies would become much larger than ordinary brutal beasts. The higher the realm, the larger the body, and they would also gain intelligence and the ability to speak.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, when his father fought against a million brutal beasts in front of the tribe, there were brutal beasts as big as mountains, extremely ferocious. Ordinary swords and weapons could not harm them at all.</p><p></p><p>"They've all come, this feeling of power is truly exhilarating. Time to clear the field."</p><p></p><p>"Miao Miao Sword Technique."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Luo Zhongxian became three, then ten, then a hundred figures, weaving through the horde of brutal beasts!!</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Luo Zhongxian could split himself, but rather his body was moving so fast that it created afterimages.</p><p></p><p>"Slash, chop, cut."</p><p></p><p>At the back of the brutal beast horde, ten huge brutal beasts with basketball-sized crimson eyes flickered with intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, this kid clearly only has the Toughening Realm cultivation, how is his speed and strength so powerful? He's more brutal than us brutal beasts. Even my first Tui Fan Realm isn't as powerful as him."</p><p></p><p>"This kid must be a peerless genius of the human race. Only our tribe's peerless geniuses can match him at the same realm," the largest brutal beast said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Let's flee, we can't defeat him. It's normal for peerless geniuses to kill across realms," the largest brutal beast then said.</p><p></p><p>"What? Boss, did I hear that right? This kid is only in the Toughening Realm, but the ten of us in the Tui Fan Realm can't beat him?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes."</p><p></p><p>"That's right boss, this kid killed so many of our young, we can't let him go."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how terrifying peerless geniuses are? If you don't run, I'll run first..." The largest brutal beast thought to itself.</p><p></p><p>It then let out a "boom" and ran towards the distance, not looking back.</p><p></p><p>The remaining nine brothers were dumbfounded, disheveled in the wind. The boss had fled.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining ten battle merits! Congratulations on gaining ten battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood in the center of the brutal beast horde, sheathing his sword, a gentle breeze ruffling his long robe.</p><p></p><p>One huge brutal beast after another froze in place. "Boom, boom, boom" the brutal beasts' eyes instantly lost their color as they collapsed to the ground, creating large pits.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's gaze drifted towards the distance, watching the largest brutal beast's fleeing back.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Can you run away?"</p><p></p><p>Charging towards the nine dazed Tuitianfan realm beast monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Let me experience the power of the Tuitianfan realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Not good, this kid is charging up" one beast monster roared, shaking the void itself.</p><p></p><p>"The distance is too close, there's no time, brothers fight him with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Miaomiao Sword Technique" Luo Zhongxian turned into nine shadows charging towards the nine beast monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Bang" His left fist collided with a beast monster's paw, the entire monster's paw was smashed through, blood spraying everywhere. "Argh" the beast monster let out a horrifying scream.</p><p></p><p>His right hand wielded a sword, slashing towards the charging beast monster. The Human Sovereign Sword was covered in sword light, reflecting a dazzling ray under the sun's illumination.</p><p></p><p>"Puff" With a sound, one beast monster spat out a mouthful of blood, an incredulous look on its face. Its crimson eyes saw a flash of light before going dark. The last thought in its mind was: "So this is the peerless genius of the human race."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining one thousand battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian briefly clashed with the Tuitianfan realm beast monsters and discovered that at this realm, the beast monsters had stronger defenses and more powerful physical strength. The biggest difference was that they now had intelligence - the crimson eyes showed fear and shock.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what Tuitianfan realm beast monsters are like? But still..." Drops of fresh blood flowed down the Human Sovereign Sword, splattering on the beast monsters' fur, staining it red.</p><p></p><p>"Human, don't be so arrogant. The peerless experts of my race will eventually slay you for revenge," the beast monster opened its bloody mouth.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this!"</p><p></p><p>"Miaomiao Sword Technique"</p><p></p><p>A hundred Luo Zhongxians wielding the Human Sovereign Sword instantly pierced through the remaining eight huge beast monsters.</p><p></p><p>"Humans, you're so vicious..." one beast monster looked down at the huge wound on its chest and said as its vision went dark.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining one thousand battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Eight system prompts sounded consecutively. He calculated in his heart:</p><p></p><p>"This battle yielded one thousand nine hundred battle merits. A few more battles and I can redeem the 'Withered Leaf Sword Technique'.</p><p></p><p>That's a technique with a chance to comprehend the Time Realm. Now is the time to break through to the Tuitianfan realm."</p><p></p><p>He jumped off the huge beast monster corpse, placed his palm on it and activated Devouring Physique to devour it.</p><p></p><p>In front of the valley, beast monster corpses lay scattered on the ground, with large pits showing signs of previous great battles. Blood covered the earth, and chunks of flesh were scattered in the bushes.</p><p></p><p>A fifteen-year-old youth leapt among the beast monster corpses. Whenever his palm touched a huge beast monster, it would rapidly shrink, as if something was devouring it.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for breaking through the ninth level of Body Tempering, strength reaching that of one elephant. Congratulations to the host for breaking through two levels of the Tuitianfan realm, strength reaching that of twenty elephants."</p><p></p><p>An immense force of pressure transmitted over.</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master's body is rapidly transforming, his strength swiftly increasing."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood on the battlefield, a powerful force surging from the depths of his heart. With no wind, his hair danced.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the power within his body, Luo Zhongxian flew into the sky! He clenched his fist!</p><p></p><p>"So powerful, is this the Tuitianfan realm? My strength has reached twenty elephants!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, my spiritual sense can probe ten miles around, my eyes see more clearly than in the Body Tempering realm. My body feels lighter, as if I can fly!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Liu Fang standing on a rock:</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, let's go hunt down the beast monsters that escaped!"</p>

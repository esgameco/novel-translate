        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He saw that there were cracks on both sides of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>"The young master has become powerful again."</p><p></p><p>And the silver-haired old man behind him had a calm gaze.</p><p></p><p>This silver-haired old man was Fan Li, looking to be in his sixties, with a kind and honest face. Under his silver-white eyebrows were a pair of bright and penetrating eyes that seemed to see through everything. He was dressed in simple and modest clothes.</p><p></p><p>Walking through a corridor, Liu Fang thought to himself, "Could he be the business sage Fan Li from the late Spring and Autumn period? Or is it just a coincidence that they have the same name? No, if I can appear in this world, why can't Fan Li?"</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, he led Fan Li through several corridors and arrived at the living room.</p><p></p><p>The living room was also in a mess, with broken pieces of teapots and teacups on the floor, as well as chairs and tables that had fallen over.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li smiled slightly, and without any visible movement, the cracks on the floor disappeared, the teapots and teacups reassembled and flew onto the tea table, and the chairs, stools, and tables all returned to their original state.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang was greatly astonished. "I didn't sense any fluctuation in his cultivation at all. He must have far surpassed me. I must hurry and break through to the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang brought a new pot of tea and brewed some for Fan Li. He then asked Fan Li, "May I ask if you are the General Fan Li who helped King Goujian of Yue regain his kingdom during the late Spring and Autumn period?"</p><p></p><p>Fan Li stroked his white beard and said mildly, "There's no need for the general to be so polite. Those are just past events, no need to mention them."</p><p></p><p>"So it really is the business sage Fan Li!" Liu Fang was filled with immense admiration.</p><p></p><p>"It is truly an honor for me, Liu Fang, to be able to work with General Fan Li. May I ask if the general has already broken through to the divine realm?" Liu Fang asked with a mix of excitement and complexity.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li did not speak, only nodding slightly.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang understood. As expected, he was formidable, having already reached the divine realm. He felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a hearty voice came from outside the door, "Haha, you two seem to be having a good chat." Then Luo Zhongxian, dressed in a black robe, walked in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Liu Fang and Fan Li about to stand up and pay respects, Luo Zhongxian quickly said, "Sit, sit."</p><p></p><p>Then, pointing at Liu Fang with his right hand, he said to Fan Li, "Let me introduce him to you. This is General Liu Fang, a great hero from the Sui Dynasty who quelled the Rebe..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"General..."</p><p></p><p>Fan Li looked towards Liu Fang: "So you were a general from a later period, a vindicated great general, impressive."</p><p></p><p>He was not boasting, but expressing sincere admiration. How many ordinary people could become a general?</p><p></p><p>It's easy to get a thousand soldiers, but hard to find a capable general!</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang felt embarrassed: "No, no, you flatter me."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian then introduced Fan Li to Liu Fang: "I'm sure you've recognized him just now. He is indeed General Fan Li, known as the 'Sage of Commerce' by later generations. He is the foremost scholar-merchant, at the level of great spiritual attainment and perfection."</p><p></p><p>"More formidable than I imagined, the level of great spiritual attainment and perfection..." Liu Fang was dazed.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, I wonder what you'd think if you knew Fan Li was an immortal," Luo Zhongxian thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's fortunate that Mr. Fan Li has arrived. Let me announce something. Liu Fang, you are appointed as a first-rank general of the Forbidden Guards, responsible for the tribe's security. You may recruit able-bodied young men to enlist, with generous treatment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, you are appointed as the first dean of the Martial Arts Academy, responsible for teaching the children martial arts and laying a solid foundation. The tribe's future rests in your hands. You'll have to work hard during this period."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian said solemnly to Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir, I vow to guard the tribe's safety with my life and train a batch of new soldiers who can endure hardship and fight battles," Liu Fang said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Good." Luo Zhongxian then took out a spatial ring containing condensed liquid, molting elixir, and tendon-transforming liquid, and handed it to Liu Fang. There were many similar small spatial rings found in the Demonic Beast Valley.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and use them without fear of wasting them. Come find me anytime if you need more. I hope more martial arts talents will emerge in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Yes sir." Liu Fang scanned the spatial ring's contents with his spiritual sense, instantly understanding the functions of the elixirs. He tightly clutched the ring, deeply moved, and then left the lord's residence hall.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li had been listening to the conversation between Luo Zhongxian and Liu Fang. He was not surprised but admired Luo's generosity. Although the Luo tribe seemed to be in decline currently, with such a leader, along with General Liu Fang and his own guidance, its future prospects were promising to achieve great things.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Fan Li, you've witnessed the current state of the Luo tribe on your journey here. Do you have any good suggestions?" Luo Zhongxian asked.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li promptly replied:</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Fan Li is untalented. Young master, you can just call me by my name. I just passed by the Luo clan's village. I think we can do three things: one, promote wisdom; two, build roads; three, practice martial arts.</p><p></p><p>One, promote wisdom. Just now Fan Li saw that most of the villagers had cloudy eyes and spoke without thinking. I think we can establish a school to educate and enlighten them.</p><p></p><p>Two, build roads - the roads of economy. I saw the villagers trade goods for goods, which risks disputes and makes calculation and division difficult. We should establish currency, engage in foreign trade, find usable resources, and develop prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Three, practice martial arts to defend against enemies and protect the village's safety, using martial arts to govern."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, haha, you know me, Fan Li."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was very happy. Soldiers are easy to obtain, but generals are hard to find. This is the principle. He also longed for true talented people. The more such talented people, the better to achieve great deeds.</p><p></p><p>"Fan Li, currently Liu Fang is responsible for developing martial arts and protecting the village. I want you to be in charge of the village's commerce and educating the people's minds. What do you think?" Luo Zhongxian asked Fan Li.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li nodded, "Yes, I will definitely do it."</p><p></p><p>"Good, haha, I appoint Fan Li as the first dean of the 'Academy of Thought', responsible for educating the people's wisdom. At the same time, as the chief strategist of the Great Luo Commerce, responsible for the economic development of the Luo clan village. You are allowed to recruit workers within the clan and carry out work."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was very happy. Finally, he could develop this academy and the economy. Only then could the villagers prosper and live better lives.</p><p></p><p>Then Luo Zhongxian gave Fan Li a spatial ring containing beauty pills, metamorphosis pills and other medicinal pills as development capital and fruits to motivate people.</p><p></p><p>After Fan Li left, Luo Zhongxian's voice echoed throughout the Luo clan village:</p><p></p><p>"I appoint Liu Fang as the dean of the 'Martial Arts Academy' and a first-rank general of the Imperial Guards. I appoint Fan Li as the dean of the 'Academy of Thought' and the chief strategist of the Great Luo Commerce."</p><p></p><p>A man with a big beard was eating meat. Upon hearing the young master's voice, he couldn't help but think:</p><p></p><p>"I know General Liu Fang, but who is this Dean Fan Li, the chief strategist? I've never heard of him."</p><p></p><p>Similar voices rose and fell in the village, but it wouldn't be long before they all recognized Fan Li's wisdom.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to practice the remnant chapters of the 'Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique', this divine ability."</p><p></p><p>A low murmur echoed in the living room, and then Luo Zhongxian's figure disappeared.</p>

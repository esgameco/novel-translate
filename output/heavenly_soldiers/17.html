        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Twenty-three young people, both men and women, stood in the main hall of the Lord's mansion, curiously looking around.</p><p></p><p>It was their first time at the Lord's mansion, and it didn't seem extraordinary at all - just a main seat and a few tables and chairs.</p><p></p><p>As they were whispering among themselves, Luo Zhongxian walked in, saying as he approached:</p><p></p><p>"You are all very young with great potential ahead of you. You are all descendants of heroes. Your elders fought against ferocious beasts to protect the tribe. For your future, they were willing to shed blood and sacrifice their lives. This hard-won freedom should be cherished. At the same time, you should learn from your elders' spirit of self-strengthening and dare to struggle against enemies.</p><p></p><p>Alright, tell me your names."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Lord mention their elders, they all looked at Luo Zhongxian. When asked about their names, they said one after another:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings Lord, I'm Luo Susu; I'm Luo Qi; Luo Chuchu; Luo Mengran; Luo Jian; Luo Xiao; Luo Meirong."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at these young faces full of hope and expectations, the best age of life.</p><p></p><p>"Good, all nice names. Your names carry your elders' wishes for you to be happy or strong. For example, Luo Jian means being steadfast and persevering; Luo Xiao hopes you'll be happy; Luo Meirong wishes you to be radiant and graceful; Luo Susu is simple and natural."</p><p></p><p>As Luo Zhongxian spoke, he took out twenty-three bottles of Moulting Spirit Pills from his ring and handed them out, instructing:</p><p></p><p>"These are Moulting Spirit Pills that can help you break through the Moulting Realm, and they are also effective for further breakthroughs within that realm. Take them and from now on, you'll all work at the Lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>You can live at home or stay here - there are a few vacant rooms that can be cleaned up for living. Men and women must live separately. Men cannot enter the women's area, and women cannot enter the men's area either. This is the rule. Any violation will result in immediate expulsion from the Lord's mansion."</p><p></p><p>"Let me assign today's tasks. Luo Susu, Luo Qi, and Luo Chuchu, you three form a group. Carry the Lord's token and conduct a population survey of the tribe. Register the names, cultivation realms, and household sizes of all tribespeople. After completing this, you can return. If you have any questions, you can ask me or your teammates. Open your minds and communicate more."</p><p></p><p>Luo Susu, Luo Qi, and Luo Chuchu went to prepare and discuss how to complete the Lord's first task.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Mengran, Luo Jian, Luo Xiao, you three...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"One group, go investigate public opinion, ask everyone what they are unsatisfied with, what areas need improvement, if they have any good suggestions, you can all speak up. Your job is to ask questions, guide everyone to speak their minds, and then record it. Come back and report to me."</p><p></p><p>"Got it." Luo Mengran, Luo Jian, and Luo Xiao, the three of them, also went out to prepare, intending to complete this first task assigned by the young master.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Shuaishuai, Luo Meirong, you five form a group. Go inquire from the people about the locations for establishing the 'Martial Arts Academy' and the 'Academy of Thought.' Ask them where they think would be a better place to establish them, what format would be better for running them, what expectations they have for the academies, and so on. After completing this, make three copies of the materials, give one copy to me, and the other two copies to Dean Liu Fei and Dean Fan Li. If there's anything you don't understand, you can also come and consult me."</p><p></p><p>"Got it." Luo Shuaishuai and the others then went out to prepare.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at the remaining twelve people, seeing their expectant yet slightly nervous expressions, and slowly said, "Is there anyone among you who is good at cooking?"</p><p></p><p>"Me."</p><p>"Me."</p><p>"Me too."</p><p>"I am too."</p><p></p><p>"Good, from now on, you four will be the chefs of our young master's manor. You don't need to do any other work, just prepare our meals every day. If you need any food, come find me.</p><p></p><p>Um, this is a spatial ring, it contains the meat of demonic beasts. Tonight, we'll eat meat. Let's see how good your cooking skills are. Everyone will be very hungry by then. You can start preparing now, think about how to cook it."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at the four of them.</p><p></p><p>"Got it." They received the ring, bowed, and withdrew.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining eight people, he said, "You have an even more important task. Today, our companions who went out will either go door-to-door for the investigation, or conduct street interviews, or go cook meals.</p><p></p><p>But when night falls, they will also be very tired. Our young master's manor has a few rooms. You should tidy them up, sweep and clean where necessary, change the bedding if needed.</p><p></p><p>In short, just make sure that everyone can have a good night's sleep tonight. If there's anything you need my help with during the process, you can all come find me. I'll be in the study this afternoon."</p><p></p><p>"Got it," the remaining eight people responded, and then went to tidy up the rooms. They had to finish cleaning and preparing warm, tidy rooms before their companions returned.</p><p></p><p>After everyone had left, Luo Zhongxian felt pensive: "It still requires people, after all."</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Today I will do the investigation myself, do the public visit, but now there are people for that. He only needs to allocate resources to motivate everyone's behavior, tell everyone the general direction of what to do, and then he doesn't need to do it himself.</p><p></p><p>No wonder so many people liked to be leaders in their previous life, because being a leader means not having to do any specific task, yet still being able to do what they enjoy, such as reading books, thinking about the future path, how to proceed...</p><p></p><p>In the evening, the young master's mansion was brightly lit. The aroma of grilled meat wafted from the rooms. Everyone sat together eating barbecue. Luo Zhongxian was also there. He watched everyone quietly eating meat without saying a word, thinking about something in his mind. He found an excuse and left.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, not long after Luo Zhongxian left, the young people on site began to chat. They had never done anything like this before - investigation, public imitation, gathering together to eat, and even having meat to eat. More importantly, the young master's attitude towards them made them feel warmth...</p><p></p><p>They had so much to say, but with the young master present, they felt shy to speak up. So when Luo Zhongxian left, they began whispering, their voices growing louder and more lively.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian smiled secretly, recalling some past events from his previous life, and then headed to the study.</p><p></p><p>On the desk were the materials collected by the young people.</p><p></p><p>"I hope I can eat my fill every day."</p><p>"I hope I can go to the Martial Arts Academy to study and protect everyone in the future."</p><p>"I hope for more equal trade."</p><p>"I hope the academy is built near the martial arts grounds..."</p><p>"I hope the tribe has more spiritual energy."</p><p>"I hope there are fewer diseases in the tribe."</p><p>"I want to learn to read and write."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the materials, Luo Zhongxian's eyes became moist. The tribe was more backward and impoverished than he had imagined, with all trades waiting to flourish.</p><p></p><p>The issues the masses cared about were the issues Luo Zhongxian needed to prioritize and address as a qualified tribal leader. He must worry about the worries of all under heaven before enjoying their joys. If he keeps the masses in mind, the masses will naturally keep him in their hearts. He cannot be careless about matters concerning the interests of the masses.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Luo Zhongxian blew out the lights in the room and entered a sleep state. He had no cultivation, so he still needed rest.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow I'll go to the outside world to exchange for food and necessary supplies," thought Luo Zhongxian as he lay on his side in bed, not falling asleep for a long time...</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's quote: "If you don't have the corresponding resources, you must go and exchange for resources, seek opportunities for development..."</p>

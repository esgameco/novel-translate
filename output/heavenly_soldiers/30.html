        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian then picked up a cup of tea poured by Li Jiayu, brought it to his lips, and slowly savored it.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang's eyes were fixated on the map, his face furrowed as he tried to find any clues.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li stroked his chin pensively on the side, his sagacious gaze fixed on a certain direction of the map.</p><p></p><p>They had come to the Lord's manor to observe this map of the power dynamics on the Barbarian Continent, and three hours had already passed. When they first arrived, they were also awed by the information contained in this map.</p><p></p><p>According to the map, the Barbarian Continent could be divided into:</p><p></p><p>Six Great Forbidden Grounds: Purple Mountain; Underworld; Heart-Devouring Palace; Great Wilderness; Heaven's Weeping Gate; Heaven's Heart Gate</p><p></p><p>Eight Leading Sects: Kunxu Sect; Sword Sect; Artifact Sect; Buddhist Sect; Heart-Questioning Academy; Plain Girl Goddess Sect; Demon Sect; Kunxu Sect</p><p></p><p>Nine Great Imperial Courts, Thirty-Two Royal Courts, One Hundred Kingdoms</p><p></p><p>Central Imperial Court; Eternal Imperial Court; Primordial Imperial Court; Great Change Imperial Court; Great Evolution Imperial Court; Great Zhou Imperial Court; Great Yong Imperial Court; Great Xuanxuan Imperial Court</p><p></p><p>Four Extremities: Eastern Sea, Desert, Volcano, Glacier</p><p></p><p>Four Sceneries: Heaven-Reaching River, Blood Sea, Ten Thousand Barbarian Mountains, Demonic Domain</p><p></p><p>"Have you finished looking?"</p><p></p><p>"Finished, Young Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Finished, you speak first, Liu Fang." Luo Zhongxian glanced at Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang's resolute face revealed a hint of wisdom, and he pointed at the map with his finger.</p><p></p><p>"Young Lord, this subordinate believes that to establish a kingdom, we must first leave the Ten Thousand Barbarian Mountains!</p><p></p><p>There are three reasons:</p><p></p><p>First, within the Ten Thousand Barbarian Mountains, there exist beings surpassing the Great Ability Realm, and even remnants of Paramount Beings.</p><p></p><p>Second, the surrounding areas of the Ten Thousand Barbarian Mountains have scarce spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Third, ahead lies the Great Xuanxuan Imperial Court.</p><p></p><p>In summary, our tribe's current location is not conducive to developing our power! With the Imperial Court ahead and Paramount Beings behind, survival is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>The only way is to leave and seek..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"A good land to develop our forces!" </p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian clapped his hands: "Correct, correct, but where shall we develop our forces?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang's expression froze for a moment, then a glimmer flashed in Fan Li's wise eyes as he pointed to the locations of the Tongtian River and the Hundred Kingdoms, saying:</p><p></p><p>"In my humble opinion, we can borrow passage through the Great Xuandi Dynasty to reach the Tongtian River. Following the river downstream, we can go directly to the Qunxingdao Islands. </p><p></p><p>There is only one reason to develop our forces here:</p><p>This place backs onto the East Sea, right across from the Hundred Kingdoms. I believe we can establish a great enterprise here, and once we have swallowed up the Hundred Kingdoms, we can dominate all under heaven!"</p><p></p><p>"Bravo..." After hearing this, Luo Zhongxian couldn't help but clap his hands in admiration. No wonder this was the strategist who guided King Goujian of Yue to become a hegemon - impressive!</p><p></p><p>When Luo Zhongxian previously saw the map, he was also taken aback by the clusters of red markings dividing up the regions.</p><p></p><p>This was the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains area, marked on the map, but there was also a red demon's head, indicating that a Supreme Being slumbered in this land.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Luo Zhongxian had planned to develop his own Luo clan, swallow up the nine major clans, expand, then unify the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains before marching outwards to conquer other kingdoms!</p><p></p><p>But on the map, he saw that within the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains, not only did a Supreme Being slumber, but there were also transcendent demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Tianhuan City belonged to the training grounds of the Great Xuandi Dynasty, which had an Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The map showed clusters of marked regions that were either forbidden lands or occupied by powerful forces.</p><p></p><p>He could not see any place for his own forces to develop! This was the reason he had called Fan Li and Liu Fang over.</p><p></p><p>"Three cobblers together can outdo Zhuge Liang." He rather agreed with Fan Li's proposed method.</p><p></p><p>"Good, it's settled then. We'll relocate to the Qunxingdao Islands and complete the swallowing of the Hundred Kingdoms!"</p><p></p><p>He put away the map and waved for them to withdraw.</p><p></p><p>He pondered the remaining tasks he needed to complete...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Card, didn't draw yet.</p><p></p><p>"System, draw two talents." Seeing the nine great imperial courts and six great forbidden grounds! There were so many powerful forces, the pressure was really immense! Too few talents!</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations to the host for obtaining the talents Bai Qi and Guo Jia."</p><p></p><p>The tea water in Luo Zhongxian's hands spilled out.</p><p></p><p>"What! Bai Qi!!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Qi had always been the great general that Luo Zhongxian yearned for! The Martial Marquis, the God of Slaughter Bai Qi, was the foremost of the four great generals of the Warring States period! He had massacred four hundred thousand soldiers!!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's face was full of joy!</p><p></p><p>"System, quickly look at Bai Qi's information."</p><p></p><p>"Ding,</p><p></p><p>Ren Tu Bai Qi, title (God of Slaughter)</p><p>Physical constitution: Slaughter Body (absorb killing energy from the battlefield to improve realm! Seek the Way through slaughter!)</p><p>Weapon: Slaughter God Sword</p><p>Martial arts cultivation: Great Ability Realm, perfect</p><p>Strength: The force of one hundred thousand dragons!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha! With the immortal body Fan Li in the front and the God of Slaughter Bai Qi in the back, a great cause can be expected, haha."</p><p></p><p>"System, look at Guo Jia's information too."</p><p></p><p>"Ding,</p><p></p><p>Guo Jia</p><p>Skilled in battle formations</p><p>Martial arts cultivation: Divine Ability Realm, great perfection</p><p>Strength: The force of five hundred dragons"</p><p></p><p>"Profited! Also skilled in battle formations!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian had spent several hundred thousand military merits just to buy battle formations, and what he valued more was not Guo Jia's battle formations, but Guo Jia himself.</p><p></p><p>Guo Jia had once helped Cao Cao unite the north as his strategist. Cao Cao had evaluated Guo Jia, saying, "The one who helped me achieve a great cause must be this person!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, should be able to see them tomorrow, really looking forward to it..."</p><p></p><p>"It's also time to unify the nine tribes." Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Puff" The room fell into darkness.</p>

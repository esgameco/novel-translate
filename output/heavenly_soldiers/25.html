        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was indeed the young of the great Bingmang beast!</p><p></p><p>When Luo Zhongxian saw it, he thought to himself: "Who captured and brought this to sell? How daring!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd below went crazy. Most of them were at the Tuifan realm, and their ancestors were the same. Without special opportunities, they would remain at the Tuifan realm their entire lives!</p><p></p><p>Even the four great families of Tianchuang City were only at the Shentong realm!</p><p></p><p>The people below began to fantasize that if they could own this Bingmang and raise it, it could become the foundation of their family, a killer move that would allow them to become an existence like the four great families, or even far surpass them!</p><p></p><p>However, in the private room, except for a small portion, most people appeared very calm!</p><p></p><p>The crowd below began to bid higher and higher prices in the auction!</p><p></p><p>"Twenty million spirit stones!"</p><p>"Thirty million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian withdrew his gaze, leaving only a spiritual sense outside to observe.</p><p></p><p>"You come here, give this spatial ring to your Miss Zhang," Luo Zhongxian called over a servant, who was also exquisitely beautiful, with cultivation at the ninth level of the Tuifan realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Mr. Luo," the servant left the private room.</p><p></p><p>In a luxurious private room, Zhang Xiaohan and the management team of the Zijin Auction House were watching the entire auction venue. If any accidents occurred, they could deal with them promptly!</p><p></p><p>*Knock knock*</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, Mr. Luo from room nine asked me to give this to you. He said to use it for the auction, and also instructed that he doesn't have extra spirit stones on him, so use this first for the auction, and they'll settle the payment together after the auction ends," the servant said cautiously after entering and seeing so many high-level people she rarely encountered.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan took the spatial ring and scanned it with her spiritual sense, then waved the servant away.</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan took out a tea leaf from the spatial ring and handed it to the senior pill master.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you recognize this tea leaf?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, this is..." The senior took the tea leaf and examined it carefully. He was startled, then exclaimed excitedly: "Congratulations, Miss! If I'm not mistaken, this tea leaf is from one of the ten great divine trees, the Enlightenment Tea Tree!</p><p></p><p>It is said that the Enlightenment Tea Tree is famous for helping people enter a state of enlightenment. There are rumors that three existences achieved the Dao by relying on the Enlightenment Tea Tree in the past!</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Enlightenment Tea Tree became known and was listed as one of the ten great divine trees!</p><p></p><p>Everyone, look at this tea leaf." The senior's words attracted everyone's attention, including Zhang Xiaohan's, though as a ninth-level Tuifan cultivator, she couldn't see anything special. However, those at the Shentong realm and above revealed solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Dao patterns!" An expert exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The senior looked at everyone's astonished eyes and said: "This tea leaf has a layer of mysterious Dao patterns flowing on its surface, which only those at the Shentong realm and above can perceive. The Dao is formless, yet this tea leaf can bear the Dao and manifest patterns - it is truly a miracle of nature!</p><p></p><p>By the way, Miss, may I ask how many tea leaves are in this spatial ring?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan regained her composure and said, "Nine leaves."</p><p></p><p>"Nine leaves! It can be the finale auction item," the senior pondered.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an expert spoke up: "The person that the headquarters has taken notice of and decided to support is indeed extraordinary, even able to produce the Enlightenment Tea Leaves!"</p><p></p><p>The others nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then let it be the finale item," Zhang Xiaohan said.</p><p></p><p>In the auction venue, the Bingmang was eventually purchased by a client in a private room for 1 billion spirit stones! This client was the same man who previously wanted to buy a sacred weapon for revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Next, we'll start the fifth auction item. Please pay attention, everyone. This is a special auction item. Bring it up," the auctioneer said mysteriously, attracting everyone's gaze.</p><p></p><p>A burly man led a woman in chains onto the red carpet in the center, and when the lights shone on her, she squinted for a moment before her beautiful appearance was revealed to everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The crowd below murmured in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Although she is in a wretched state, covered in mud, I can still tell she is a breathtakingly beautiful young woman!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, she's so beautiful, I've never seen such a pretty face before."</p><p></p><p>"How did such a beauty end up being auctioned off here?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian also felt curious after seeing her, "Is it really just auctioning off an extremely beautiful woman? Or is there a special reason?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the crowd discussing animatedly below, the auctioneer felt satisfied that he had successfully piqued everyone's curiosity. He excitedly announced, "This is a former peerless genius!"</p><p></p><p>"What peerless genius?!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh my god! A peerless genius is being auctioned off!!"</p><p></p><p>"Swish" Even the people in the private rooms stood up in astonishment! A peerless genius!</p><p></p><p>This refers to an extraordinary physique! When fully cultivated, they could rival supreme lords, with even the possibility of becoming immortal!</p><p></p><p>It's known that peerless geniuses exist in Buddhist sects, the Underworld, the Heavenly Lamentations Sect, and the Purple Mountain Forbidden Lands! Only these transcendent organizations possess peerless geniuses. Other peerless geniuses are either sealed away or still in confinement!</p><p></p><p>Now they heard that in the remote Heavenly Wilderness City, a peerless genius has appeared! If it's true, countless people will lose sleep regretting not attending this auction!</p><p></p><p>"How dazzling." After adjusting for a moment, Li Jiayun looked around at the hungry wolf-like gazes from all directions, feeling flustered. She wanted to grab onto something but could only grasp the cold chains.</p><p></p><p>"Clank clank..." The chains rattled, making a grating sound on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The burly man behind her saw this and used a supernatural force to restrain the woman, not letting her move.</p><p></p><p>Li Jiayun ended up lying prone on the ground, but everyone could still see the tears and despair in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The beauty's tears were heart-wrenching!</p><p></p><p>Countless people in the audience felt their hearts shatter, wanting to rush up and beat down that evil man, then tenderly embrace the beauty.</p><p></p><p>"The beauty on stage is named Li Jiayun, from an unnamed small town. Her family fell into decline, with no ancestors possessing spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>On her 18th birthday, she awakened an extraordinary physique - the Chaos Body! Who would have thought her good friend betrayed her, informing the Underworld about her status as a peerless genius?</p><p></p><p>The Underworld killed her whole family after learning this and took her back to extract a mysterious primal power from her body!</p><p></p><p>Then they discarded her and sold her to our Purple Gold Auction House." The auctioneer slowly explained.</p><p></p><p>Gasps of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"She's actually a Chaos Body!!"</p><p></p><p>Voices erupted from below! The Underworld was so vicious, extracting the primal power from a peerless genius' body - what were they doing?!</p><p></p><p>In Room 1,</p><p></p><p>An old man looked at Ayun lying prone on stage and muttered, "The poor ill-fated child, meeting the wrong person."</p><p></p><p>"This sister is so pitiful, grandpa please save her." Beside him, a child cried after hearing the tragic story.</p><p></p><p>"You naughty kid, alright, grandpa promises." The old man patted the child's head.</p><p></p><p>"Yay, grandpa is the best!" The delighted child waved his little arms, unknowingly releasing a mysterious force. The old man quickly enveloped the boy with his spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, be good and don't move, or grandpa won't save her," the old man said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh," the child stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Just tell us if this woman still has an extraordinary physique or any cultivation!" Someone shouted impatiently at the auctioneer after he spoke for a few minutes, getting agreement from many others demanding he get to the point.</p><p></p><p>"Alright..." Seeing so many opposed to him continuing the story, the auctioneer moved on.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"We at the Purple Gold Auction House have conducted professional appraisals and analyses on this woman. She has been ruined!!</p><p></p><p>Her strength is only that of an ordinary tempered body of 500 jin! If she were an ordinary person, she could still recover her constitution with special medicinal materials, but she has already awakened her Chaos Body, her body is abnormal and different from humans. Currently, there are no suitable medicinal materials for her!</p><p></p><p>A great master once declared: 'This woman is ruined! Only an immortal can save her!!'</p><p></p><p>But this woman has an otherworldly talent and once had an extraordinary constitution. She is the ideal choice for a maidservant. Young masters, don't miss out, once this opportunity is gone, it's gone forever!!</p><p></p><p>Now I announce the starting bid at one million spirit stones!!" It was evident the auctioneer was trying hard to find selling points.</p><p></p><p>From below, the crowd:</p><p></p><p>"Immortal! Where are there immortals? Even the Emperor can't be seen, let alone immortals?!"</p><p></p><p>"What immortals! She's beyond saving, a ruined body that will turn to ashes in a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>"She's been ruined!"</p><p></p><p>"She's ruined, what does it matter? As long as she looks good, just buy her as a warm bed maid."</p><p></p><p>"I bid two million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I quite fancy this woman, five million spirit stones!" A lecherous male voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred million spirit stones!" The old man in private room one made a bid. He didn't want to listen to those words anymore. Alas, what a chaotic world. Being beautiful, having an otherworldly talent, was a mistake. Without absolute power, everything was like flowers in a dream, a moon in water.</p><p></p><p>Prosperous cities rise and fall day and night, mighty dynasties replace each other in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Three hundred million," the arrogant man in private room three bid. He fancied her looks. Hmm, she could be a little concubine to warm his bed. Hehe.</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred million," the old man in room one bid again.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's hard to understand how these rich people think. A ruined body, just because she looks good, fetching a price of five hundred million spirit stones!!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly can't deny the power of the rich!!"</p><p></p><p>"The rich can be willful."</p><p></p><p>"One billion!" Luo Zhongxian bid. He had gone through a similar experience, tasted the pain of being a ruined body. At the same time, he had his system, which others didn't have access to. A subordinate with a Chaos Body was absolutely worth his investment!</p><p></p><p>"It's him..." The old man in room one was about to bid again but hearing the voice from room nine, he thought it over and didn't speak up. Patting the child's head, he said, "Follow him, it may be better than following me."</p><p></p><p>"Oh," the child didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>"One billion, first time!"</p><p></p><p>"Two billion!" The arrogant male voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Five billion!" Luo Zhongxian calmly said.</p><p></p><p>"Eight billion!" The arrogant voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Ten billion!" Luo Zhongxian steadily said.</p><p></p><p>"They've gone mad! Bidding up to ten billion spirit stones for a ruined body!! I'm going to faint..." Someone below couldn't take the shock.</p><p></p><p>Ten billion spirit stones! Wouldn't it be better to buy a powerful slave or sacred weapon?! Why insist on buying this good-looking but ruined woman?!</p><p></p><p>"Ten billion," the arrogant man in room three muttered to himself, then didn't bid further. Although ten billion wasn't that much for him, he still had to weigh the pros and cons of just buying a woman, a ruined body at that.</p><p></p><p>"Ten billion, first time!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten billion, second time!"</p><p></p><p>"Ten billion, third and final time!! Sold!! Congratulations to the guest in room nine for obtaining this former peerless genius, now an unmatched beauty. Let us give him the warmest applause."</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer felt the guest in room nine was his benefactor. These big transactions alone were enough for him to live comfortably in Heavenly Wilderness City for the rest of his life!</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, didn't expect to acquire a Chaos Body on this trip. Just ten billion!" Luo Zhongxian mocked the ignorance of mortals.</p><p></p><p>"Sacred swords, divine weapons! Treasure maps, offsprings of great masters, peerless constitutions!..." Luo Zhongxian became even more interested in this auction.</p>

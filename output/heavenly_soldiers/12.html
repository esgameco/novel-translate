        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On the thousand-meter wide open ground, there were many wooden stumps placed, and on the left side there was an enormous water barrel, as tall as ten grown adults.</p><p></p><p>The barrel was filled with water, and nearby there were three rows of wooden racks with empty cups placed on them.</p><p></p><p>In front of the arena, there was a three-foot high stage.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty Wang, Fatty, wake up now. Today we have to gather at the arena in the morning, hurry up, if we're late we'll be punished."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man was urging his son to wake up in the room. Normally he could sleep in as late as he wanted, but...</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man thought of a young man with a resolute face and suddenly shuddered, too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his son still asleep, he got angry and punched him, making the son cry out "Wah".</p><p></p><p>"What are you crying for? It's just me hitting you now, wait until General Liu comes, then you'll know what's good..." the middle-aged man scolded.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the three words "General Liu", the fat kid shuddered, immediately stopped crying, put on his clothes and ran towards the arena.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was dazed for a moment, then reacted and hurriedly ran towards the arena too.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing happened in many of the Luo tribe's villages. When there was no good way to wake someone up, just mentioning "General Liu" would make them shudder, instantly sober up, and rush to the arena at top speed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the once quiet arena became lively.</p><p></p><p>"Fatty, I didn't expect you to get up so early today, haha, I thought you were still sleeping," a tall, thin kid said with a laugh when he saw a round, plump fatty running over.</p><p></p><p>"Skinny, what the heck, trying to make fun of me by talking nonsense here?" The fatty rolled up his sleeves menacingly as he spoke to the skinny kid.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, you two don't make a fuss. Don't forget what General Liu said yesterday, sit down properly," a middle-aged man who was maintaining discipline at the arena that day reprimanded them.</p><p></p><p>"Oh oh" The two kids hurriedly found spots to sit down.</p><p></p><p>Slowly more and more people gathered at the arena, each finding a spot. At this point, Liu Fang also appeared at the arena. Seeing General Liu today dressed in a black long robe, the entire arena instantly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Some people looked fearful; some had unnatural expressions; some didn't dare look at General Liu and kept their heads down; while others stared directly at him.</p><p></p><p>The past two days, Liu Fang had captured a few masked assassins who tried to kill Luo Zhongxian, and forced them to reveal the remaining accomplices of Luo Changtian's branch of the Luo clan. On the first day, Liu Fang beheaded fifty people.</p><p></p><p>Fifty heads flew up, blood spurting skyward in columns over a meter high.</p><p></p><p>In the minds of the crowd, Liu Fang, General Liu, became synonymous with a demon.</p><p></p><p>Those with weaker psyches vomited on the spot, especially the young women - they really regretted coming to watch the spectacle...</p><p></p><p>"Da da da"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian, dressed in a white long robe, with sword-like brows and starry eyes, carrying a scholarly air, strode in with steady steps from outside the arena.</p><p></p><p>"The young master is here", "Shhh, don't speak loudly"</p><p></p><p>"Da da da" Luo Zhongxian walked step-by-step through the arena, up to the very front, and climbed onto the three-foot high stage.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the many people below, filled with all sorts of emotions - fear, terror, confusion, anxiety...</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian slowly opened his mouth, his voice full of magnetism, confidence, sunshine:</p><p></p><p>"Hello everyone, thank you all for attending today's clan meeting on time.</p><p></p><p>I am Luo Zhongxian, you all know me, the 'disabled waste' as you call me.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, my father Luo Shentong was killed in battle at the 'Falling God Realm' while protecting you all.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Luo Changtian deceived me into becoming an ill-fated body.</p><p></p><p>Then recently, you all abandoned me and I left the village.</p><p></p><p>On the way after leaving, Luo Changtian and his son, along with some assassins, tried to kill me and my uncle Kun.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Kun was killed in battle, and I barely escaped with my life.</p><p></p><p>Today I've come here to speak with everyone..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>There are three things to discuss with them.</p><p></p><p>First: Let the past go.</p><p></p><p>Second: Without rules, nothing can be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>Third: What should we do in the future?</p><p></p><p>First, regarding the past events, let them drift away with the wind. I know that among you, there are still some who harbor resentment, jealousy, and hatred towards me. But from this moment on, I, Luo Zhongxian, will no longer hold you accountable for the past.</p><p></p><p>The managers on site handed out water to everyone. "Drink this bowl of water, and I hope everyone can let go of grudges. One cup can dissolve a thousand worries."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang organized the on-site staff to quickly scoop water from the barrel into empty bowls and distribute them to the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian also held a bowl filled with water. Seeing that everyone had received a bowl of water, he shouted loudly, "Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang responded first, "Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>The managers and the crowd immediately reacted, echoing, "Cheers!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian gulped down the water in his bowl and observed the crowd's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Soon, an old man sitting in the front row, emanating a powerful aura, broke through to the eighth level of mortal transcendence.</p><p></p><p>His name was Luo Sange. He had lived long enough, but his innate talent was limited. He hadn't intended to attend, but after drinking the bowl of water, he unexpectedly broke through his cultivation level. He could feel his body becoming younger and regaining its full strength.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" A sound came from a chubby boy, who broke through to the fifth level of body tempering.</p><p></p><p>At the back row, a person afflicted with snake venom, with snake scales covering his face, suddenly stood up excitedly.</p><p></p><p>He touched his face and realized it no longer had the uneven, rough texture. It was smooth. His face had recovered. He cried tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>There were many such cases happening among the crowd below. Some broke through their cultivation levels, some recovered from physical ailments, and others became younger. It was a remarkable sight.</p><p></p><p>The entire arena became lively. Luo Zhongxian noticed Liu Fang wanting to intervene and gave him a look.</p><p></p><p>Five minutes later, the crowd fell silent, their eyes fixed on Luo Zhongxian above.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were filled with gratitude, excitement, and enthusiasm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, someone in the crowd shouted, "Thank you, Young Master! May the Young Master live long!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master! May the Young Master live long!"</p><p></p><p>The unified voices echoed through the clouds. Even Liu Fang couldn't help but change his expression, reevaluating the Young Master's abilities.</p><p></p><p>"How terrifying... One bowl of water can dissolve a thousand worries and win people's hearts. What a formidable technique..."</p><p></p><p>"Good, it's worth my one billion merit points."</p><p></p><p>The water in the barrel was no ordinary water. It was a combination of Bone-Washing Elixir, Beauty Pill, Body-Refining Liquid, and Mortal Transcendence Pill.</p><p></p><p>Drinking it could enhance beauty, restore youth, increase cultivation levels, and improve physical fitness.</p><p></p><p>"Rise," Luo Zhongxian said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master." Everyone took their seats.</p><p></p><p>Looking into their eyes, Luo Zhongxian said, "The water you just drank, I call it the Evolution Water. It can help those below the Divine Realm improve their realms and enhance their physical fitness.</p><p></p><p>From today onwards, I announce that everyone can come to the arena and drink a bowl every day. Everyone will have a share, but there is a small requirement: those who drink the water must practice martial arts in the arena for one hour.</p><p></p><p>To ensure no one drinks the water privately, General Liu will arrange personnel to monitor and control it. If anyone is caught stealing or robbing others' water, they will be prohibited from drinking the water for a year.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, those who report others for stealing or robbing water will be rewarded by being allowed to drink an extra bowl every day for a month."</p><p></p><p>After Luo Zhongxian finished speaking, whispers arose from below as people discussed the so-called Evolution Water and the rules for drinking it with those around them.</p><p></p><p>Three minutes later, the crowd fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian continued, "Second: Without rules, nothing can be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>Any member of the tribe who commits rape will be executed.</p><p></p><p>Any man who beats his wife without reason will be punished for one year, and in severe cases, imprisoned for life.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Anyone over the age of 18 must go to the Lord's manor to apply for a tribal identity card, to be implemented next month.</p><p></p><p>Anyone over 18 must choose one from among labor, agriculture, commerce, military, and government as their future occupation.</p><p></p><p>Every three years there is an opportunity to make a new choice. For those who are able to commit to and deeply cultivate one field for life, the tribe will provide an annual subsidy. If they make a major discovery, they will receive a large one-time subsidy and a personal award from the Lord.</p><p></p><p>If enemies invade, tribal members must raise their knives, swords, and clench their fists, having the courage and spirit to fight the enemy. Brave warriors will be rewarded based on their martial exploits. Warriors who bravely fight and sacrifice themselves, their families will receive a hundredfold spiritual consolation, and their children will be granted admission to the academy. Those who are afraid to fight and retreat will be punished by the tribe through exile. Those who are afraid to fight and betray will be killed.</p><p></p><p>Children and youths can enroll in the 'I Am a Genius Academy' and choose either the Martial Arts Academy or the Contemplation Academy. (To be implemented in one month)"</p><p></p><p>After a while of whispering below, five minutes later, seeing that no one else spoke, the crowd quieted down. Luo Zhongxian slowly opened his mouth again: "Third, what will we do in the future?</p><p></p><p>In the future, we will unify the 100,000 wilderness tribes.</p><p>In the future, we will go out from here and unify the dynasties and sects.</p><p>In the future, we will become the greatest dynasty, and you will be the earliest group of meritorious officials.</p><p>I hope you can all become enlightened and gain longevity.</p><p>I hope your children will all be like dragons.</p><p>This is what we will do in the future."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Luo Zhongxian silently looked at the crowd below, when suddenly a voice came from below: "Lord, why should we believe you?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked in the direction of the voice to see a big fellow sitting on a wood stump, staring at him intently, quite a fierce warrior.</p><p></p><p>"Good, reward him ten bowls of evolutionary water," Luo Zhongxian seemed very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Why, just because of this." After speaking, a black hole appeared in front of Luo Zhongxian, and everyone suddenly felt like they were being sucked away, but in the blink of an eye the black hole disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?" "Such a terrible feeling." More whispering started below.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the eyes of the crowd, "This is my physical constitution, the Devouring Physique, the legendary physique that can be mentioned alongside the Chaos Physique and Supreme Physique. When cultivated to the extreme, it can reach the Supreme Realm."</p><p></p><p>"What Devouring Physique?"</p><p>"Never heard of it."</p><p>"But it seems quite formidable."</p><p>"Okay, I believe the Lord," suddenly a voice emerged from the crowd. Looking closely, it was that big fellow from before.</p><p></p><p>"I also believe the Lord." "I also believe the Lord."</p><p>Everyone started saying it.</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?" Luo Zhongxian asked the big fellow.</p><p></p><p>"My name is Luo Shuaishuai," the big fellow answered a bit shyly.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Shuaishuai, that name..." "Haha, such a big guy with a name like that, you're cracking me up."</p><p></p><p>"Quiet," Luo Zhongxian stopped the crowd from further discussion, because he knew the speaker might be unintentional, but the listener could take it to heart, causing this Luo Shuaishuai's martial arts to stagnate, unable to break through to the next realm due to demonic inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Luo Shuaishuai, you will follow General Liu tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you Lord," the big fellow said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, today's tribal meeting ends here. Everyone go take care of your business."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for completing the mission to kill Luo Changdian father and son, becoming the chieftain (actual controller) of the Luo Tribe. Congratulations to the host for completing the mission to win over the people's hearts, achieving unity!</p><p></p><p>Congratulations to the host for obtaining one Physique Card, one Talent Card, and one Divine Skill Card."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, it seems I've obtained some incredible things. Let me try drawing them later." Luo Zhongxian's eyes were full of anticipation, not in vain for this performance and the merit points worth 100 million.</p>

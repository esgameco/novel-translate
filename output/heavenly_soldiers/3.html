        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian suddenly opened his eyes and saw a group of ferocious beasts with red eyes and drooling mouths crawling towards Kun Shu's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Enraged!</p><p></p><p>With a "clang" sound, he stood up and drew the Imperial Sword.</p><p></p><p>Why was the Imperial Sword black? Why did it feel just like an ordinary sword, only lighter? He had many doubts in his mind, but there was no time now!</p><p></p><p>Holding the black Imperial Sword, he looked coldly at the group of ferocious beasts in front of him.</p><p></p><p>These beasts looked strange, some looked like pigs from the previous world but had bony spikes on their backs; others looked like alligators but had two thick teeth that were half a meter long!</p><p></p><p>The ferocious beasts brought him gray memories, his father died because of them!</p><p></p><p>His right hand skillfully drew a sword flower and charged towards the group of beasts!</p><p></p><p>He had a conviction in his heart: "I absolutely cannot let the ferocious beasts defile Kun Shu's corpse!"</p><p></p><p>Although his martial arts cultivation had not progressed in these years, he did not give up in the slightest, practicing sword techniques and boxing in the young master's courtyard every morning.</p><p></p><p>He often practiced until his whole body trembled and he could no longer hold the sword, only then would he pick up the towel prepared by Kun Shu to wipe off his sweat!</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Sword slashed towards a ferocious beast's head.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The beast's head fell to the ground, its blood spurting out a meter long! Even Luo Zhongxian was splattered all over with blood!</p><p></p><p>That's not right! How could I kill a ferocious beast with one sword strike! Although this was the lowest level body tempering beast!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian examined carefully and had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>It was because my physical constitution had changed, no longer a defective body but a devouring body!</p><p></p><p>My body became lighter! My strength increased tenfold! And this sword...</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the still dripping Imperial Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's still in a sealed state! But I can still sense its sharpness! Imperial Sword, you will accompany me to conquer the world from now on!"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Sword shook, as if responding!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 10 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>Oh, killing ferocious beasts gives battle merits? Although I don't know what use they are, it's definitely...the more the better!</p><p></p><p>Kill! The Imperial Sword swept horizontally.</p><p></p><p>"Roar"</p><p></p><p>The ferocious beasts smelled the blood and their eyes shone with bloodlust as they charged madly towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Roar"</p><p></p><p>They rushed towards Luo Zhongxian, their thick paws stomping frantically.</p><p></p><p>Some beasts opened their huge bloody mouths, wanting to swallow Luo Zhongxian whole..</p><p></p><p>Other beasts lowered their heads to the ground, opening two huge teeth, wanting to skewer Luo Zhongxian to death...</p><p></p><p>"Hmph"</p><p></p><p>What a bunch of ferocious beasts with undeveloped intelligence! Such naive attacks! How adorable!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>A figure flashed by like a stream of light, and six huge ferocious beasts fell with a loud noise. The ground shook three times, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host, you have gained 60 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>He narrowly avoided a ferocious beast dropping from the sky, its impact causing a crater in the ground.</p><p></p><p>His figure flickered, and a sword beam slashed down.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host, you have gained 10 battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian had an enlightening realization! This was a feeling he couldn't experience when his body was crippled! No wonder they say a good physique allows for rapid cultivation!</p><p></p><p>He recalled a sword technique!</p><p></p><p>The 'Miao Miao Sword' was a sword cultivation method passed down from the ancestors of the Luo clan, famous for its ethereal and peerless sword technique.</p><p></p><p>His father said that if someone had exceptional talent, they could even grasp the sword intent from it.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, he went back to his childhood, his father in white teaching him the Miao Miao Sword technique.</p><p></p><p>"Xian'er, remember to practice the 'Miao Miao Sword'.</p><p></p><p>The secret lies in being ethereal, in changing. If the enemy is slow, I'm fast. If the enemy is fast, I flicker. Amidst thousands of enemies, the blades won't touch my body."</p><p></p><p>As he reminisced, his figure also transformed, an abstruse aura appearing around him!</p><p></p><p>He had practiced this sword technique countless times in the young master's courtyard, thoroughly mastering it.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely diligent! He just lacked an opportunity! An opportunity to elevate his quality!</p><p></p><p>The system gave him that chance, the peerless Devouring Physique!</p><p></p><p>Now he had an enlightening realization, his figure like a ghostly specter!</p><p></p><p>Like a flash of light, "Boom!" Dust flew as ten ferocious beasts spurted blood high into the air!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 100 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a figure stood on a treetop, watching the scene before him.</p><p></p><p>"The young master actually gained enlightenment through slaughter."</p><p></p><p>The person was Liu Fang of the Ninth Heavenly Layer of Tui Fan. Liu Fang wore a black robe, his body as sturdy as an ox. He wore a white headpiece and had a stern face. Upon arriving and seeing the ferocious beasts attacking Luo Zhongxian,</p><p></p><p>he was about to help when he sensed an unusual fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Carefully observing, he realized the young master had entered the envied state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the young master is not in danger. I'll guard here and prevent any beasts from disturbing his enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>Wisps of formless aura pervaded the battlefield, originating from Luo Zhongxian's body.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were tightly shut, yet he seemed able to perceive the beasts' attacks, narrowly dodging each one.</p><p></p><p>He constantly moved around the beasts, sometimes even stepping on their heads,</p><p></p><p>yet did not draw his sword, as if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom!"</p><p></p><p>A group of ferocious beasts attacked Luo Zhongxian like madmen, but...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Every time it was a narrow escape from an extremely dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, wisps of formless aura were coalescing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly a small blade of grass stood up with a "swish" sound.  </p><p></p><p>"Swish, swish, swish"</p><p></p><p>One blade of grass after another stood up like swords.</p><p></p><p>At one moment, Luo Zhongxian's eyes suddenly opened wide.</p><p></p><p>"I'm done playing with you all, I'll use the sword intent I've newly comprehended to send you on your final journey..."</p><p></p><p>"Shring"</p><p></p><p>"A flash of bright light"</p><p></p><p>The twelve ferocious beasts abruptly stopped moving, as if space had frozen for an instant.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze blew by, "peng" "peng" "peng"...</p><p></p><p>The entire earth was shaking.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations host, you have gained 120 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>From afar, a deep resounding voice rapidly approached.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations young master, felicitations young master, you have comprehended sword intent, your sword path has promise! I am Liu Fang, I am late to your guard, please punish me severely."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at the man kneeling before him, truly sturdy, with a body like steel pillars and iron posts.</p><p></p><p>"You are Liu Fang?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's me."</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you young master."</p><p></p><p>Too many ferocious beasts died here, the stench of blood is overpowering! We must leave quickly.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood before a ferocious beast corpse, placed his palm on its body, and activated the innate divine ability he just gained as a Devourer!</p><p></p><p>"Devour"</p><p></p><p>The huge beast corpse visibly shrank at a visible speed, as if some force was devouring it.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was the innate divine ability of the Devourer physique - devouring all living beings to strengthen oneself.</p><p></p><p>This was a physique called forbidden and terrifying! If not killed on the spot, one would grow stronger the more they were attacked, like Xiao Qiang!</p><p></p><p>"Pop"</p><p></p><p>The beast vanished, replaced by a ripple emanating from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations host, you have broken through to the 4th level of Body Tempering."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was extremely excited. Finally, after over ten years, he could cultivate martial arts and break through his cultivation realm. It felt wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Dad, Uncle Kun, I will soon avenge you. Oh right, Uncle Kun's corpse is still lying there.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, bring Uncle Kun's corpse with us when we leave."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian quickened his pace, replicating the process, devouring the remaining beasts. "Congratulations host, you have broken through to the 5th level of Body Tempering; 6th level; 7th level; Congratulations host, you have broken through to the 8th level of Body Tempering!!"</p><p></p><p>Hahaha! A voice resounded brazenly.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, bring Uncle Kun's corpse, let's go."</p><p></p><p>On the way, "Hey System, what are these battle merits about?"</p>

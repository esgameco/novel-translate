        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A huge image appeared in the air, depicting a bone in the shape of a right hand.</p><p></p><p>Private Room No. 15</p><p></p><p>A bald man wearing a yellow robe, looking up at the Buddha's bone relic in the air, murmured to himself: "The Buddha's bone relic has appeared."</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer enthusiastically introduced it: "It is said that in ancient times, there was a great Buddha master named Emperor Tian. In the first half of his life, he was an emperor in a dynasty, and in the second half, he left home to become a Buddhist monk. There are few records about Emperor Tian, except that it was recorded that before he attained enlightenment, he had a bloody battle with a great enemy. He suddenly realized the Buddha's dharma of 'One Hand Covering the Sky,' with which he struck down his enemy in the starry sky, displaying unparalleled dominance. This bone relic is said to have come from Emperor Tian's tomb and was excavated by grave robbers, who died mysteriously three days later. Even a great cultivator has tried to move this relic but failed to budge it an inch.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this is truly Emperor Tian's bone relic, and whether it possesses the divine power of 'One Hand Covering the Sky,' the Purple Gold Auction House has no way to verify. Therefore, we advise everyone to bid cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Now I announce the starting bid: one billion spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"One hundred billion!" A voice came from Private Room No. 15.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below:</p><p>"Buddha's bone relic..."</p><p>"Is it real or fake, Emperor Tian?"</p><p>"Jumping straight to one hundred billion, isn't that too extravagant?"</p><p></p><p>Private Room No. 1</p><p>The old man looked at the Buddha's bone relic: "Emperor Tian... fake."</p><p></p><p>"One hundred billion, is it just a rumor? No need to spend so many spirit stones to test it, the cost is too high," a voice whispered from Private Room No. 3.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian silently observed everything. Anything that couldn't help him, he didn't need.</p><p></p><p>"One hundred billion, first call!"</p><p>"One hundred billion, second call!"</p><p>"One hundred billion, third and final call! Sold! Congratulations to the guest in Private Room No. 15 for obtaining the Buddha's bone relic..."</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer continued:</p><p></p><p>"Next is the seventh auction item, the Beauty Pill. It can help women maintain their youthful appearance. With repeated use, it can restore one's former beauty! There are nine bottles of the Beauty Pill in total, with nine pills in each bottle. They will be auctioned in sets of three bottles. Alright, now we begin the auction for the first set of Beauty Pills, with a starting bid of nine hundred million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd below:</p><p>"Wow, sisters, look quickly!"</p><p>"I want to buy it! I like this..."</p><p>"Haha, buy this and give it to her, she'll definitely love it!"</p><p></p><p>Private Rooms:</p><p>"Why is there such a thing?" A female voice murmured from Private Room No. 2.</p><p>"Buy one set to try..." Private Room No. 10.</p><p>Luo Zhongxian: "Isn't this my Beauty Pill? It seems to be quite popular among women. I wonder how many spirit stones it will sell for."</p><p></p><p>The crowd below immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"One billion two hundred million spirit stones!"</p><p>"Two billion spirit stones!" A cold voice came from Private Room No. 2.</p><p>"Ten billion spirit stones!" Private Room No. 10.</p><p></p><p>"Ten billion spirit stones, first call!"</p><p>"Ten billion spirit stones, second call!" </p><p>"Ten billion spirit stones, third and final call! Sold! Congratulations to the guest in Private Room No. 10. Let's give her a warm round of applause."</p><p></p><p>The first set of three bottles of Beauty Pills sold for ten billion - bought by Private Room No. 10.</p><p>The second set sold for twelve billion - bought by Private Room No. 2. </p><p>The third set sold for thirty billion - bought by Private Room No. 13.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian calculated that he had fifty-two billion spirit stones, which was still not enough for what he wanted to buy, as he had spent one hundred billion on the Chaos Body alone. He would have to see if the Enlightenment Tea would give him a boost.</p><p></p><p>"Next is the eighth auction item: nine pieces of Enlightenment Tea. As everyone knows, there are ten great divine trees on the Primordial Continent, one of which is the Enlightenment Tea Tree. The Enlightenment Tea Tree grows leaves that resemble tea leaves. After being authenticated by our appraisal team, these are..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"These nine pieces of enlightenment tea leaves are genuine articles."</p><p></p><p>"The tea leaves have the pattern of the Dao imprinted on them. Everyone, please look at the real items."</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer clapped his hands, and a graceful figure cradled a tray, with nine tea leaves placed on the tray.</p><p></p><p>At least those who came here had reached the ninth stage of transcendence. They activated their spiritual awareness and looked towards the tea leaves.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing there."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, they just look ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Voices rang out one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, what do you understand? Without reaching the realm of spiritual powers, you can't see the pattern of the Dao on these tea leaves at all."</p><p></p><p>"What? There's actually a pattern of the Dao on them?"</p><p></p><p>The auctioneer was very satisfied with everyone's reactions: "The starting bid is one hundred billion. Now we begin the auction."</p><p></p><p>"One trillion!" The old man in room number one spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Whew..." Everyone below gasped in astonishment. There was simply no opportunity for them to bid.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was delighted to see this. The higher the bid, the better.</p><p></p><p>"One point two trillion!" A domineering male voice came from room number three.</p><p></p><p>"Three trillion!" The old man calmly stated.</p><p></p><p>"You..." The overbearing man from room number three was rendered speechless...</p><p></p><p>If you want to raise the bid, just raise it. But to increase it by that much all at once!</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was stunned by the old man's voice!</p><p></p><p>"Three trillion, first call!"</p><p></p><p>"Three trillion, second call!" </p><p></p><p>"Three trillion, third and final call! Congratulations to the guest in room number one for winning the enlightenment tea leaves." The auctioneer felt this was the most glorious day of his life!</p><p></p><p>Inside room number one:</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa will let you try a very delicious tea later," the old man said, patting the child's head.</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes..."</p><p></p><p>Room number nine:</p><p></p><p>"YES!" Luo Zhongxian clenched his fist tightly. Three trillion spirit stones exceeded his expectations! But then again, divine treasures are priceless!</p><p></p><p>"Good, now we come to the most exciting moment of this auction. What could the grand finale be? Let's take a look..."</p><p></p><p>They saw a thin piece of paper lying in an open box.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Countless people wondered, just what could it be? For a single piece of paper to be the grand finale, streams of spiritual awareness probed towards it.</p><p></p><p>But to no avail, as they were blocked by a powerful force.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was also very curious. No matter how he looked at it, it was just a piece of paper.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, I'm sure everyone is wondering what this is. Now, let me tell you - this is a page from the Emperor's Scripture!" The auctioneer deliberately piqued everyone's interest.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor's Scripture!!"</p><p></p><p>"You're even auctioning off the Emperor's Scripture?!"</p><p></p><p>"Insane!"</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the crowd or the people in the private rooms, everyone found it unbelievable. The Emperor's Scripture is not something to be known by ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Wouldn't those with the Emperor's legacy keep the Emperor's Scripture well-hidden, as the foundation for passing it down?</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I won't keep you all in suspense any longer. This page of the Emperor's Scripture is called 'The Scripture of the Dao.' It was written by the Dao Clan's Emperor, Dao Yichengdi. The complete Emperor's Scripture has three pages. After the Dao Clan Emperor died, the new Emperor exterminated their clan ten million years later!</p><p></p><p>The first page of the Scripture is said to be in the Underworld!</p><p></p><p>The second page's whereabouts are unknown. This third page is the one right here!</p><p></p><p>If you can gather all three pages of the Emperor's Scripture, you can gain an additional legacy!</p><p></p><p>The guest who brought this page to auction has had it for many years but finally realized that all three pages must be combined in order to cultivate it! That's why it's being auctioned off - this person lacks the power to confront the Underworld!</p><p></p><p>It is said that when the Dao Clan Emperor was alive, no one dared to disobey! He destroyed the four great forbidden grounds!" The auctioneer said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The crowd:</p><p></p><p>"What? It actually..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's the Imperial Scripture of the Emperor of the Dao Clan!"</p><p></p><p>"The second half of the Imperial Scripture!"</p><p></p><p>"Now I announce the starting auction price, one million pounds of divine liquid!"</p><p></p><p>"What? It's not spirit stones being used for the transaction, but divine liquid!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, divine liquid is much rarer!"</p><p></p><p>"It's said that divine liquid is helpful for cultivation above the great ability level!"</p><p></p><p>"Two million pounds of divine liquid!"</p><p></p><p>"Five million pounds of divine liquid!" </p><p></p><p>"One hundred million."</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what the crowd below thought, the price was rapidly climbing!</p><p></p><p>Divine liquid has value, the Imperial Scripture is priceless! The people in the private rooms understood very clearly, as long as one becomes powerful enough, what can't be obtained?</p><p></p><p>"One billion..."</p><p></p><p>"One trillion pounds of divine liquid! Third and final call! Sold, congratulations to the guest in private room twenty for obtaining the Imperial Scripture!"</p><p></p><p>Private room twenty, several people wearing long black robes with the words "Underworld" embroidered on the hems!!</p><p></p><p>"We got it!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Now we're only missing Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe..."</p><p></p><p>A series of terrifying voices rang out from the private room!</p><p></p><p>In another private room:</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luo, here are your two trillion nine hundred billion spirit stones, after deducting the spirit stones you spent at auction, I've rounded it up for you!" Zhang Xiaohan smiled and handed Luo Zhongxian a spatial ring.</p><p></p><p>Scanning it with his divine sense, the spatial ring was completely filled with spirit stones, starting to emanate a milky white spiritual air.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was very happy, this trip to Heavenly Desolation City was really worth it!</p><p></p><p>"Miss Zhang, do you have the latest maps and information about the Barbarian Wilderness here?"</p><p></p><p>"I just so happen to have a copy here, let me give it to you." Zhang Xiaohan took out a map and gave it to Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Come in." Hearing the young lady's voice, three maidservants entered, followed by a woman bound in iron chains - it was the former Chaos Body, Li Jiayu!</p><p></p><p>"Sword rice, treasure map, the Chaos Body Li Jiayu."</p><p></p><p>"Release her." Seeing Luo Zhongxian's gaze fall on Li Jiayu, Zhang Xiaohan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Here."</p><p></p><p>"Clink clink..." Several chains fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Luo, I hope we have another opportunity to cooperate in the future." Zhang Xiaohan glanced at Luo Zhongxian, then left the room with a graceful stride.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian pocketed the sword rice and treasure map, looking towards Li Jiayu.</p><p></p><p>She was wearing tattered clothes, her body covered in bruises, with marks left by the chains she had been bound in for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The once beautiful face still bore traces of tears, her eyes holding a glimmer of despair as she kept her head lowered, saying nothing...</p><p></p><p>She knew that from now on, she would follow this young man, only hoping that he would treat her well.</p><p></p><p>"Put this on," Luo Zhongxian tossed her one of his own black robes.</p><p></p><p>"Drink this," Luo Zhongxian threw her a bottle of "Solidifying Body Liquid" to treat her injuries.</p><p></p><p>Li Jiayu swallowed her shame, slowly changing into the black robe and downing the "Solidifying Body Liquid."</p><p></p><p>She could feel her internal and external injuries healing, the marks left by the chains quickly fading away.</p><p></p><p>"This person seems different," she thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps encountering him isn't a bad thing?" A notion flashed through Li Jiayu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at Li Jiayu in her changed attire, the contrast from before was huge.</p><p></p><p>The black robe accentuated her tall, slender figure, complementing her exquisite beauty - an unknowing person might mistake her for the precious daughter of some great clan!</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the auction house matters have been taken care of, but there's still a tough battle ahead!" Luo Zhongxian mused inwardly, not forgetting that later he would face the great talents of Heavenly Desolation City!</p>

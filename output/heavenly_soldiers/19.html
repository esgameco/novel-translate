        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? The four major families will all be participating in the once-in-a-decade auction this time."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, in the last decade, there were quite a few good items. It's said that there were medicinal ingredients that could help break through to the Realm of Great Ability, and they were auctioned off at astonishing prices. In the end, they were bought by a young man from the capital city. I wonder if they were upset about that..."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah, of course they were."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I heard that this time there will be an amazing spirit pill that will appear in the final round as the highlight."</p><p></p><p>"Really? I've also heard that an extraordinary weapon will appear this time."</p><p></p><p>"Landlord, check please." After paying, he walked out. This information wasn't very valuable. To auction off truly good items required a massive amount of resources.</p><p></p><p>He prepared to go take a look at the Talent Rankings.</p><p></p><p>In the center of Heavenly Wasteland City, there stood a tall monument over ten meters high, with the words "Heavenly Talent Rankings - Mortal Shedding Realm" inscribed at the top.</p><p></p><p>These Heavenly Talent Rankings were mainly for the Mortal Shedding Realm. Those listed on the rankings were considered talents, with the potential to enter the Divine Ability Realm. Once in the Divine Ability Realm, one could live an immortal life.</p><p></p><p>When Luo Zhongxian arrived, there were already many people gathered around the Talent Rankings, pointing and discussing.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, do you think the Young Master of the Wang Family, Wang Teng, has a chance to get on the Talent Rankings?" A voice came from the crowd, sparking debate.</p><p></p><p>"It's very possible. Wang Teng reached the Ninth Heaven of the Mortal Shedding Realm a year ago, so he should have a good chance."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, so what if it's the Ninth Heaven of the Mortal Shedding Realm? How many people in our Heavenly Wasteland City are at that level? There are tons of them. But only one person made it onto the rankings, the daughter of the Zhang Family, Zhang Tingting."</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Tingting is truly formidable. She was born with a Nine Star-level physique. It's incomparable..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph." Wang Teng, standing in front of the Talent Rankings, felt very disgruntled in his heart. Not just him, the other two families felt the same way. How could she, just a woman of the Mortal Shedding Realm, make it onto the Talent Rankings while they could not?</p><p></p><p>Especially since the elders in his family often used her as a comparison, it was unbearable. So this time, after breaking through his cultivation to the Great Perfection of the Mortal Shedding Realm, he prepared to give it a try and see if he could leave his name on the Talent Rankings!</p><p></p><p>"Heh!" Wang Teng let out a loud shout, then channeled all his strength to strike at the Talent Rankings.</p><p></p><p>The Talent Rankings showed no reaction.</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng's face darkened. "Heh!" He shouted loudly again, once more mustering all his strength to strike the Talent Rankings.</p><p></p><p>Still, the Talent Rankings remained completely unresponsive.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below reacted intensely.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I told you, this Wang Teng can't do it..."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'm dying of laughter here. Look at Wang Teng's face, it's all black!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, don't say anymore. Can't you see Wang Teng's murderous look?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian also saw this. The Talent Rankings only recorded true talents. Ordinary peak cultivators of the same realm could never provoke a reaction from it.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian no longer paid attention to Wang Teng, instead turning his gaze to the Talent Rankings.</p><p></p><p>First place: Central Celestial Emperor</p><p>Second place: Emperor Yao  </p><p>Third place: Zhu Ba</p><p>Fourth place:</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Name: Sword Unordinary</p><p></p><p>Fifth Name: Demon Child</p><p></p><p>Sixth Name: Yang Qianqian</p><p></p><p>Seventh Name: Ye Hongchen  </p><p></p><p>Eighth Name: Su Xin</p><p></p><p>Ninth Name: Zhao Xuan</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian felt this person must be extraordinary upon seeing this name, especially the first three - Central Celestial Emperor, Emperor Yao, Overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining a new mission. Please take the first place on the Heavenly Talent List in the Taohua Realm. Become famous with one move that shocks the world. Complete the mission and receive a reward."</p><p></p><p>A slight smile appeared on Luo Zhongxian's face, finally a new mission was issued.</p><p></p><p>"First place huh, the Taohua Realm..." Luo Zhongxian stared at the three words 'Central Celestial Emperor', then pushed through the crowd and walked straight towards the Heavenly Talent List.</p><p></p><p>He had never feared anyone of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng was furious at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a person in a black long robe walking towards the Heavenly Talent List, he shouted: "Stop! I said stop right there!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian ignored this little clown.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Luo Zhongxian completely disregarding him, Wang Teng "bang" threw a punch towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p>"Damn, this Wang Teng is shameless."</p><p>"A sneak attack!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng put all his strength into this punch, believing the person in front of him was of the same realm. Since he dared to look down on him, he had to teach him a lesson.</p><p></p><p>"Little clown."</p><p></p><p>Wang Teng heard these words in his ears, before he could react, a huge force came from the person facing away from him.</p><p></p><p>A tremendous pressure descended. Wang Teng "pu" spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more upset was that the person facing away from him didn't even look at him, just exerting his aura caused him serious injury...</p><p></p><p>"Pu" Another mouthful of fresh blood came out.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below was in an uproar. A few attendant-like people hurriedly came to carry Wang Teng away. As for seeking revenge on Luo Zhongxian, they couldn't even defeat their own master, let alone take revenge. They would notify the clan to handle it.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's expression turned grim, an even more powerful force revealed itself from his body, compressing the air itself.</p><p></p><p>Fleshly Divine Power: Primordial Strength, tenfold power enhancement!</p><p></p><p>A visible ripple with Luo Zhongxian at the center spread out in all directions, causing cracks to appear on the plaza ground.</p><p></p><p>The crowd below:</p><p>"Run, too strong, I feel this ripple, just grazing it will cause serious injury!"</p><p>"Run quickly...too powerful!"</p><p>"Oh heavens, what's happening?"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the chaotic voices, Luo Zhongxian slowly threw a punch, his fists brimming with mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, he's attacking!"</p><p>"Hurry, take out the 'Memory Crystals' to record it!"</p><p>"Yeah, quick, I feel something huge is about to happen!"</p><p></p><p>The people below took out "Memory Crystals", which could record events.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Because it was relatively expensive, it was often used to record rarely seen scenes.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" Luo Zhongxian landed a solid punch squarely on the Celestial Genius Board.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" The Celestial Genius Board first fell silent, and just when everyone thought it had failed, it erupted with a tremendous roar.</p><p></p><p>A huge figure sat enthroned high in the ninth heaven, purple energy surging for 3,000 miles...</p><p></p><p>Within Tianhuan City, countless people were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"This is...an omen. Who ascended to the Celestial Genius Board? Someone from the four great clans?"  A figure muttered.</p><p></p><p>A voice rang out from the Lord's Mansion: "An omen fills the sky, is the great Golden Age coming?"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan from the Purple Gold Auction House murmured to himself: "It's actually him..."</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look! There's a stream of light rapidly overtaking the previous ranks."</p><p></p><p>"In just an instant, it's already ranked in the top fifty."</p><p></p><p>"It's still rising, now thirtieth rank, such incredible speed."</p><p></p><p>"Tenth rank now, heavens, what are we witnessing today..."</p><p></p><p>"Fifth rank now, still rising rapidly...!"</p><p></p><p>"Surpassing the Overlords, third rank now!"</p><p></p><p>"Surpassing the Celestial Emperors, second rank now!!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavens, could it be, will an invincible genius emerge from our desolate frontier?!"</p><p></p><p>"First rank, first rank!"</p><p></p><p>"First rank, first rank!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd below shouted...</p><p></p><p>"Surpassing the Central Celestial Emperor for first rank!!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" The people below began cheering wildly, even more fervently than Luo Zhongxian, as if they had accomplished it themselves.</p><p></p><p>All this occurred in the blink of an eye, an invisible force on the Celestial Genius Board seemed to be in control.</p><p></p><p>Slowly forming three large characters:</p><p></p><p>First Rank: Luo Zhongxian</p><p></p><p>A mysterious ray of light from within the Celestial Genius Board rapidly entered Luo Zhongxian's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian felt it, then vanished from his original spot in a step, leaving behind the frenzied crowd.</p><p></p><p>At that very moment the name formed, those in the Wildlands who had transcended mortality and ascended to the Celestial Genius Board all sensed it.</p><p></p><p>A voice rang out from a dark cave: "Luo Zhongxian."</p><p></p><p>A celestial genius standing atop the massive corpse of a beast looked up at the heavens: "The first ranker of the Transcendence Realm: Luo Zhongxian, huh?"</p><p></p><p>In Tianhuan City, Zhang Tingting suddenly appeared before the Celestial Genius Board, but Luo Zhongxian had already left. Her eyes were fixed intently on the words: First Rank, Luo Zhongxian, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, more and more people rushed over, wanting to know who this first-ranked genius of the Transcendence Realm was...</p><p></p><p>And in cities farther away, it similarly caused waves of incredulous shouts: "Quick, look! The first rank has changed, it's Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p></p><p>"The Transcendence Realm first ranker of the Celestial Genius Board: Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p></p><p>"Ding, congratulations host, you have completed the task and obtained 3 equipment cards, 1 pet card, 5 lucky cards."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian returned to his room, he needed to see what that mysterious light from the Celestial Genius Board was.</p>

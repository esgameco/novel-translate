        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Ever since awakening his wisdom, Manqiang named himself Manqiang, hoping to become powerful in the future.</p><p></p><p>Manqiang was the ferocious beast that Luo Zhongxian wanted to hunt down. The arrival of the human youth gave it an ominous feeling this time.</p><p></p><p>In the past, it was by relying on this ominous feeling from the unknown that it had escaped life-threatening dangers time and time again.</p><p></p><p>Manqiang had fled for 100,000 li, but still did not slow down, because that damn ominous feeling not only did not disappear, but became even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"No, if this continues, I will eventually be caught by the human boy. I need to think of a way. Got it!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered that nearby there was a Ferocious Beast Valley, where the predecessors who had cast off the nine heavens lived.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes after Manqiang left, a sonic boom sounded, and Luo Zhongxian and Liu Fei appeared.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the huge footprints of the ferocious beast:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, it seems the ferocious beast has changed direction," said Liu Fei.</p><p></p><p>"Pursue," Luo Zhongxian said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Inside a huge stone cave, countless ferocious beasts were crouched on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Above the ferocious beast group, thirty huge ferocious beasts were lying down, and above them was a huge circular space where an enormously large ferocious beast was lying down.</p><p></p><p>Its tail had bony spikes, and its head had an extremely large horn that seemed to pierce the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was called Manshén, one who had cast off the nine heavens.</p><p></p><p>Once, while searching for food on the Ferocious Wilderness, it heard a thunderous roar and saw a powerful ferocious beast soar into the air to confront the black clouds and lightning.</p><p></p><p>It heard a voice from above the dark clouds: "Today I will break through to the realm of divine power, even the heavens cannot stop me!"</p><p></p><p>Then it saw the thunderclouds disperse, revealing a young human male figure on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Its subconscious told it that this was the realm of divine power, which it greatly admired, so it named itself Manshén.</p><p></p><p>After casting off the nine heavens, Manshén's cultivation had not changed for decades, and it was very distressed!</p><p></p><p>Outside the Ferocious Beast Valley:</p><p></p><p>"I've finally arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Manshén, please come out. I have some great news to share that can help you break through to the realm of divine power," Manqiang shouted loudly from outside.</p><p></p><p>Manqiang knew his arrival could not be hidden from Manshén. Those who had cast off the nine heavens had a consciousness sea that covered a radius of ten li, providing Manshén with the information it needed, so he believed it would come out.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Manshén was moved.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A huge ferocious beast appeared - it was Manshén, with an extremely large horn on its head. Opening its bloody maw, it said, "Manqiang, quickly tell me the news. If it's false, you won't be able to leave today."</p><p></p><p>Manqiang looked up at the enormously large Manshén, his own huge body completely engulfed in Manshén's shadow, feeling its tremendous power.</p><p></p><p>"Such terrifying power..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Manshén, use your consciousness sea to probe if a human boy is coming this way."</p><p></p><p>"So what if he is?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Manshén, the opportunity I mentioned is precisely him. Don't underestimate this human boy - he is the peerless prodigy of the human race, just not fully grown yet.</p><p></p><p>If Senior Manshén captures him and offers him to the Ferocious Wilderness, you will definitely obtain the Nine-Colored Grass to break through to the realm of divine power and gain eternal life."</p><p></p><p>"Little Qiang, it's not just one person, but two - a youth and a young man," Manshén said, lowering his head.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Manshén, do you know the cultivation of that young man?"</p><p></p><p>"The same as me, having cast off the nine heavens," Manshén said, opening his bloody maw.</p><p></p><p>"What? Only having cast off the nine heavens? That's great! Senior Manshén, you can deal with the human youth's protector later. My thirty subordinates who have cast off the heavens and I will handle the human youth."</p><p></p><p>"Little Qiang, my thirty subordinates who have cast off the heavens are all at least at the fifth level..."</p><p></p><p>Manshén's words were interrupted by the flustered Manqiang:</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Demon, you don't know how formidable the peerless geniuses are. They are abnormal and cannot be treated the same way."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Demon, the human race has a saying that goes 'Even when hunting a rabbit, a lion uses its full force.'" Demon Strong spoke earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Concerning breaking through to the divine realm, Demon Senior agreed.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, two figures descended into the Demon Beast Valley, looking at the huge footprints on the ground and a massive black cave ahead.</p><p></p><p>"It's here."</p><p></p><p>"Boom, boom, boom!" One huge demon beast after another charged out of the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, be careful. There are demon beasts at the ninth level of Shedding Mortality," Liu Fang warned.</p><p></p><p>"You restrain the ninth-level Shedding Mortality demon beasts first, don't kill them, just severely injure them. I'll handle the other demon beasts," Luo Zhongxian said, looking at the largest demon beast, as big as a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that you, a human, would be so persistent. Even after a hundred kilometers, you still won't let me go. Today will be your death day," said the smallest demon beast, which was actually Demon Strong.</p><p></p><p>"You've finally stopped running," Luo Zhongxian said, holding the Human Emperor Sword, taking a step and charging towards the demon beast horde.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang looked at the largest demon beast.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Sword Style, First Form: Sword Dance of the Starry Sky!"</p><p></p><p>An iron sword pierced through the air towards the Demon Senior.</p><p></p><p>Watching Liu Fang, feeling the power of the sword technique in the sky, it was even stronger than imagined. Damn it, he had to grit his teeth and fight Liu Fang together.</p><p></p><p>"Illusory Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>A hundred Luo Zhongxians charged towards the huge demon beast horde.</p><p></p><p>Facing such numerical superiority, he could only increase his speed for rapid slaughter. Fortunately, his physical strength was strong enough to support such consumption.</p><p></p><p>"Sht!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Human Emperor Sword in his chest, Demon Strong's eyes darkened, and his consciousness gradually faded. The last sentence flashed through his mind, but unfortunately, no demon beast present knew it.</p><p></p><p>"These humans have become stronger. If I had known earlier, I would have..."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining three thousand battle merits."</p><p></p><p>The pleasant system voice rang in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Seeing a huge demon beast's foot descending from the sky, he dodged the demon beast's foot, shifted his body to the side, and slashed!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining five thousand battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood on the ground, watching the fearless demon beasts charging at him.</p><p></p><p>"Illusory Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>"Gained five thousand battle merits."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Senior was fiercely battling Liu Fang, glancing at the battlefield below, his crimson eyes bulging out, so many subordinates had died at the very start.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to be distracted while fighting me? Even the Turkic General wouldn't dare. Chaos Sword Style, Sixth Form: Raging Wind Sword Rain!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang let out a loud roar, seizing the opportunity to attack. The Chaos Sword split into a thousand swords, raining down on the Demon Senior.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Senior was hit, with several large holes appearing on his body, bleeding profusely. He turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, you want to run while fighting me? If I wasn't afraid of accidentally killing you, making it hard to explain to the Young Master, do you think you could have lasted this long?" Liu Fang sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>"What? This human still has a secret technique he hasn't used. It seems I can't escape today without using my ultimate move. Blood Combustion Shield Technique!" The Demon Senior gritted his teeth, emanating a bloody aura all over his body, and swiftly ran towards the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, you think you can run away from me here? Have you asked me?"</p><p></p><p>"Chaos Sword Style, Seventh Form: Heavenly Sword!" A massive sword beam shot towards the Demon Senior.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" A miserable scream came from afar. Liu Fang stepped on the Chaos Sword, swiftly flying over.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, of the original thirty-two Shedding Mortality demon beasts at the ninth level, only six remained.</p><p></p><p>Facing this terrifying young human, with incomparable strength, incredibly fast sword techniques, getting hit meant injury. Their once-proud defenses became a joke here.</p><p></p><p>They looked at each other, sharing a glance of understanding, and fled in different directions.</p><p></p><p>"You still want to run away? Sword Will!" Luo Zhongxian sneered coldly. "You think you can escape!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Think!</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew past, and the originally soft grass seemed to receive some mysterious power's blessing. One by one the blades of grass stood upright, like sharp swords, flying towards the six ferocious beasts. In the beasts' unimaginable gaze, the grass pierced through their bodies, stabbing into their massive forms.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ooh, poof"</p><p></p><p>"Just severely injured? No matter." Glancing at the six ferocious beasts with grass piercing all over their bodies, he gripped the Imperial Sword and slashed at the beasts before him.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining seven thousand battle merits..."</p><p></p><p>"It's over," Luo Zhongxian murmured.</p><p></p><p>"System, how many battle merits do I have now?" "Host, a total of one hundred eighty thousand."</p><p></p><p>"So many already, haha. Hope Liu Fang doesn't run into any accidents over there." Luo Zhongxian looked into the distance, keeping an eye on the battle in the sky while fighting on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He believed in Liu Fang's strength!</p><p></p><p>Coming to his senses, Luo Zhongxian saw the huge Ferocious Beast Valley before him and flashed into it - a massive cave. </p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, pairs of red eyes lit up, and dense crowds of ferocious beasts charged fearlessly at Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the charging beasts, Luo Zhongxian rejoiced, "So many ferocious beasts also mean battle merits!" A sword beam swept out.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining ten battle merits."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian charged recklessly into the beast horde, leaving a trail of death wherever he went.</p><p></p><p>The system notification "ding" rang out incessantly. Ten minutes later, Luo Zhongxian faced the piles of beast corpses, extended his hands and devoured them.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Ecdysis realm, his devouring ability seemed to have grown stronger. The most obvious change was that he no longer needed to place his hands on the corpses to devour them, just facing them was enough.</p><p></p><p>A black hole appeared in Luo Zhongxian's palms, and the corpses in the cave seemed attracted to it, flying rapidly towards the black hole in his palm. At the same time, the beast corpses shrank quickly, becoming only ant-sized when reaching his palm before being devoured into the black hole.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for breaking through to the third level of Ecdysis realm, breaking through to the fourth level of Ecdysis realm!"</p><p></p><p>"So many beast corpses could only help break through two realms? It seems low-level beasts won't be of much help going forward."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the thirty-two Ecdysis realm ferocious beasts outside, he couldn't wait to return and face the fallen beast corpses sprawled everywhere. Facing the corpses, his palm devoured them.</p><p></p><p>One beast corpse after another flew up, rapidly shrinking before being devoured by the black hole in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for breaking through to the fifth level of Ecdysis realm, breaking through to the seventh level of Ecdysis realm!"</p><p></p><p>Waves of immense power emanated from Luo Zhongxian's body. With a "crack", the ground unable to withstand the rapidly increasing force of his body, fissures as thick as a bowl split open.</p><p></p><p>"System, how much strength do I have now?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, at the seventh level of Ecdysis realm: the strength of one hundred twenty elephants."</p><p></p><p>"System, how many battle merits do I have now?"</p><p></p><p>"Two hundred ten thousand battle merits."</p><p></p><p>"System, redeem the 'Withered Leaf Sword Technique' for me."</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining the 'Withered Leaf Sword Technique'. One hundred ten thousand battle merits remaining. Reminder: The host can choose to spend fifty thousand battle merits to cultivate the 'Withered Leaf Sword Technique' to its highest realm."</p><p></p><p>"The highest realm, the Time Realm? Good, redeem it."</p><p></p><p>"'Withered Leaf Sword Technique' is complete. Congratulations to the host for comprehending the Time Realm. Sixty thousand battle merits remaining."</p><p></p><p>The 'Withered Leaf Sword Technique' has three moves: First Sword Withers (ten years of time elapses), Second Sword Decays (one hundred years of time elapses), Third Sword Severs Soul (one thousand years of time elapses).</p><p></p><p>With a sweep of his sword's light across plants and trees, they withered, decayed and died, as if they had aged decades, hundreds of years. If Luo Zhongxian hadn't witnessed it himself, he wouldn't have dared believe it.</p><p></p><p>"What an overbearing sword technique and supernatural power! Each move is life-taking. Ordinary supernatural powers only last a thousand years, yet the Third Sword Severs Soul lives up to its name!" Luo Zhongxian exclaimed in pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>Raising his head to look at the distant sky, he searched his consciousness and found traces of blood.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Liu Fang has run into trouble!" He took off, flying towards the horizon!</p>

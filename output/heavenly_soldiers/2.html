        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian spoke with difficulty: "Who, who is speaking?"</p><p></p><p>"Ding, the Heavenly Court system is activating. Detecting human Luo Zhongxian, critically injured and near death. Would you like to bind to the Heavenly Court system?"</p><p></p><p>His face lit up with joy as he realized, this is the system! My cheat code!</p><p></p><p>A mechanical voice sounded: "Ding, would you like to bind to the Heavenly Court system?"</p><p></p><p>Coming to his senses, disregarding the pain from his wounds, "System, cough cough, bind me to the Heavenly Court system."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Court system is binding, 1%, 2%...99%. Congratulations host, the Heavenly Court system is successfully bound. From now on, you will be the master of the Heavenly Court system!"</p><p></p><p>With excitement on his face, "What is the function of the Heavenly Court system?"</p><p></p><p>"For the host's first use of the system, you need to enter the consciousness sea and touch the system interface to view it. You won't need to do this again after."</p><p></p><p>The consciousness sea? Luo Zhongxian was a bit puzzled. The consciousness sea symbolized the Transcendence realm. After breaking through Tempering and entering Transcendence, one would unlock their latent abilities. The body would become lighter, able to fly! There would even be a consciousness sea born deep in the mind, generating a divine consciousness!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian thought, "I'm still at the Tempering realm, can I really see the consciousness sea? Never mind, I can barely even stand up right now."</p><p></p><p>"If I don't find a way to stand up, who knows if a fierce beast might come next. Then I'd really be done for!"</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Savage Mountains were famous for their savage beasts, no joke!</p><p></p><p>He focused his efforts, directing his consciousness deep into his mind.</p><p></p><p>To his great surprise, he could actually "see" a flickering point deep in his mind, emitting a mysterious radiance. Although small, it was there.</p><p></p><p>Due to the system, Luo Zhongxian had prematurely unlocked his body's latent abilities! With complex emotions, he plunged right in...</p><p></p><p>A magnificent palace appeared before Luo Zhongxian's eyes.</p><p></p><p>In front stood an enormous stone gate, with three large characters inscribed:</p><p></p><p>Southern Heaven Gate</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was taken aback. Wasn't the Southern Heaven Gate the entrance to the mythical Heavenly Court on Earth? How could it appear here?</p><p></p><p>Passing through the gate into the majestic palace, at the very top was an immense celestial throne.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to see a supreme being seated on the imperial throne, dominating the myriad realms and universes, its aura swallowing the vast cosmos.</p><p></p><p>Below on either side stood celestial soldiers and generals, while in the center were the sovereigns of various universes, bowing to pledge their allegiance.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian snapped out of it. How could there be a Celestial Emperor or sovereigns?</p><p></p><p>It was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>In front was an enormous cauldron, its body engraved with the shadows of the nine ancient divine beasts:</p><p></p><p>The Dragon, Phoenix, Qilin, White Tiger, Vermilion Bird, Black Tortoise, Bai Ze, Qiongqi, and Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Streams of light flowed across the nine divine beasts, as if they could come alive at any moment.</p><p></p><p>On the cauldron...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Reflecting a patch of white light, with four large characters engraved on it:</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Court System!</p><p></p><p>"System, I've entered now, how do I click to view the information?"</p><p></p><p><br>  </p><p>"Host, please move your hand towards the white light, and you will naturally be able to sense it."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian slowly moved his hand towards the white light.</p><p></p><p>"Ding!"</p><p></p><p>A sound reverberated.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Court System has been activated, loading a newcomer gift pack into the information section.</p><p></p><p>Information Section 1: Personal Information; Information Section 2: Lucky Draw; Information Section 3: Talent Pool; Information Section 4: Secret Realm; Information Section 5: Store</p><p></p><p><br>  </p><p>Information Section 6: Insufficient luck, unable to view; Information Section 7: Unable to view;</p><p></p><p>Information Section 8: Unable to view; Information Section 9: Unable to view.</p><p></p><p>Information sections have finished loading. From now on, host does not need to enter here, just say in your heart which information you want to view."</p><p></p><p>Seeing so many options, he had a smile on his face, it had been a long time since he last smiled!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the series of displays about insufficient luck: "System, can you tell me what this insufficient luck means?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, luck refers to the people's hearts, wishes, and aspirations within a force such as a dynasty or sect. A strong people's heart means a strong nation."</p><p></p><p>So the system wants me to establish a force!</p><p></p><p>"I understand, view personal information."</p><p></p><p>"Luo Zhongxian: ordinary human physique, master of the Heavenly Court System, male, fifteen years old, (former) young master of the Luo Clan, triple-tempered at the Body Refinement realm, strength of three hundred pounds, critically injured and near death, nothing else."</p><p></p><p>Well, seeing his strength of three hundred pounds, he didn't know whether to laugh or cry, even a nine-year-old child would be stronger than him in strength!</p><p></p><p>"Let me see the lucky draw next."</p><p></p><p>"Reminder to the host, the lucky draw function can only be used after completing tasks."</p><p></p><p>What, seriously? This is so disappointing. System, tell me what can be drawn in the lucky draw.</p><p></p><p>"Talent cards, demon cards, pill cards, physique cards, divine skill cards."</p><p></p><p>Wow, so many good things! Hurry and give me tasks!</p><p></p><p>"Initiating main quest one: Kill Luo Meng, make Luo Changtian the actual controller of the Luo Clan.</p><p></p><p>Initiating main quest two: Regain the hearts of the Luo Clan people."</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fists! A murderous glint flashed in his eyes! With the system's assistance, he believed he could complete the tasks soon!</p><p></p><p>Oh right, I also have a newcomer gift pack, let me open it.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining: one talent card, one physique card, one pill card, one Human Emperor Sword (sealed state)."</p><p></p><p>So much, system you're really generous. Let me open the pill card first, whatever pill it is!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining one vial of Nine Revolutions Undying Liquid."</p><p></p><p>"System, what is the Nine Revolutions Undying Liquid? Can it heal my critical injury?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, the Nine Revolutions Undying Liquid is specially prepared for you. Just one drop is enough to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The host will be able to recover."</p><p></p><p>How wonderful, Luo Zhongxian was overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>"System, give it to me."</p><p></p><p>A drop of black liquid dissolved within Luo Zhongxian's body.</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, Luo Zhongxian lay in the bushes, the wound on his chest visibly and rapidly healing, leaving behind only a sword-shaped scar.</p><p></p><p>Perceiving the changes in the external body from the realm of knowledge.</p><p></p><p>"Great, the system drew a physique card. I haven't made any progress in martial arts for more than a decade. Ah..."</p><p></p><p>It was because of his physique that there was nothing more heartbreaking for Luo Zhongxian!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining the Devouring Physique."</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, suddenly an anomaly appeared in the sky, clearly a huge black hole flashing into existence above the Myriad Wilderness Continent, exerting an immense pressure that all beings above the Celestial Realm could sense, finding this force inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>At the Tianxin Sect's forbidden grounds, the Tianxin Elder looked up at the celestial anomaly, made some calculations with his fingers and said, "Another peerless prodigy has been born, but I don't know which forbidden ground or dynasty it is."</p><p></p><p>Whenever a peerless prodigy is born, the heavens and earth celebrate! Pressuring the Myriad Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>At the Purple Mountain Forbidden Grounds, a mysterious figure sat on a throne, sensing something: "A peerless prodigy is born, it's coming soon."</p><p></p><p>In the Buddhist realm, an elderly monk was sweeping fallen leaves in the courtyard when the pressure from the sudden anomaly caused the leaves to swirl chaotically.</p><p></p><p>The old monk seemed unaware, gazing at the huge black hole in the sky, muttering to himself: "An anomaly appears in the Myriad Wilderness, a peerless prodigy is born. Who will be king, who will be emperor, all is on the path of immortality."</p><p></p><p>In the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains, Luo Zhongxian's body was undergoing violent changes.</p><p></p><p>Streaks of black light were flashing from Luo Zhongxian's body, causing the surrounding plants and flowers to wither, as if their vitality had been devoured.</p><p></p><p>In the realm of knowledge within the system, he could feel the changes in his body and was delirious with joy.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, he could finally cultivate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Uncle Kun, soon I will be able to avenge you..."</p><p></p><p>As he was rejoicing, the system gave a reminder:</p><p></p><p>"Host, there are savage beasts approaching the host's location."</p><p></p><p>Damn!</p><p></p><p>Oh right, I still have a talent card, system draw a talent for me.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for obtaining: Liu Fang."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Who is Liu Fang? Never heard of him. Let me open Liu Fang's information and take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, a great general of the Sui Dynasty, an expert in suppressing rebellions. He once defeated the Turks, achieving an invaluable great victory. Martial arts attainment: Ninth Stage of Shedding Mortality. Creator of the 'Rebellion Suppressing Sword Technique'."</p><p></p><p>A great general of the Sui Dynasty! Defeated the Turks, Ninth Stage of Shedding Mortality. Good, good, good, saying 'good' three times!</p><p></p><p>System, where is Liu Fang now?</p><p></p><p>"Host, Liu Fang will arrive soon."</p><p></p><p>In the outside world, a group of savage beasts were searching for food, attracted by the bloody scent from the corpses of Luo Zhongxian and Kun. Their huge paws shook the ground with each step.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was in danger!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You stay here, I'll go and come right back," Luo Zhongxian said as he patted Li Jiayü's head.</p><p></p><p>"Okay..." Li Jiayü's eyes regained a glimmer of life.</p><p></p><p>About a mile ahead, there was a crowd of nearly a million people, with an aura of killing intent drifting in the air.</p><p></p><p>In the very front were six people.</p><p></p><p>The first was a winged unicorn pulling a carriage, with a burly man holding the reins inside - Wu Tian, the son of the lord of Sishui City, ranked 93rd on the Spiritual Realm Ranking.</p><p></p><p>The second was Mu Qin standing on a mystical bird's back, her slender figure holding a guqin, ranked 50th.  </p><p></p><p>The third was Li Xuantong, ranked 90th, wielding an iron sword, ranked 80th.</p><p></p><p>The fourth was the Buddhist prodigy Liuchen, dressed in a cassock and holding a staff.</p><p></p><p>The fifth was Zhu Tian, carrying an iron coffin on his back, looking askance at Luo Zhongxian with a sidelong glance, ranked 30th.</p><p></p><p>The sixth was Zhang Tingting, the Transcendent Realm prodigy from Tianhuan City of the Zhang family.</p><p></p><p>Floating in the sky were three people:</p><p>Li Si, the lord of Tianhuan City, wearing a general's uniform with thick brows and a fleshy face.</p><p>Wu Yinghua, the lord of Sishui City, wearing a purple and gold crown and golden armor, with a pointed nose and monkey cheeks.</p><p>Yi Tianxing, the lord of Xuankong City, with white hair and brows, and a profound gaze.</p><p></p><p>Next to the crowd stood Zhang Xiaohan and an old man together.</p><p></p><p>And even further away, on a small hill, a few black figures gazed at the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>On a tall mountain, an old man and a child looked down upon the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian, dressed in white, his deep eyes gazing at the opposite side, his voice echoing for a hundred miles around:</p><p></p><p>"I am Luo Zhongxian, ranked first on the Transcendent Realm Genius List. I know some of you came for the auction, some to challenge me, and some to kill and plunder!</p><p></p><p>Now I'll give you three minutes. Those here for the auction, retreat ten miles! Those who don't want to die here, retreat ten miles!"</p><p></p><p>Voices arose from the crowd, and some people began retreating.</p><p></p><p>"So arrogant!"</p><p>"Facing a million Transcendent and Spiritual Realm experts, yet unfazed!"</p><p>"If he doesn't die, he'll be famous across the world!"</p><p>"Let's go, we came to watch the auction..."</p><p></p><p>The Buddhist prodigy Liuchen at the very front, his bald head glowing faintly, suddenly spoke up: "Quite the first-ranked Transcendent Realm genius! An experience indeed, we'll meet again!" With that, he turned back towards Tianhuan City.</p><p></p><p>He had a Buddhist relic to escort, which was more important.</p><p></p><p>"What, leaving before it even starts? Is that all a Spiritual Realm genius amounts to?" someone mocked.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Liuchen returned to the Buddhist sect and presented the relic to an elderly monk.</p><p>"What? It was a fake!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Tingting pondered and retreated ten miles as well. The reason she stood in the front was to see what the first-ranked Transcendent Realm genius looked like.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian, dressed in white scholarly robes, emanated a cultured air. His deep eyes remained calm facing a million Transcendent Realm experts, giving her a sense that he was not to be trifled with.</p><p></p><p>"Another one left, Zhang Tingting, a Transcendent genius!" The crowd murmured.</p><p></p><p>In the sky:</p><p>"It's good Zhang Tingting left, otherwise we'd lose another genius. Who knows how many will die today," said Li Si, lord of Tianhuan City.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yinghua of Sishui City laughed: "Don't tell me Tianhuan City doesn't have a single genius strong enough!"</p><p>He looked at his son riding the Spiritual unicorn, standing out among the million.</p><p></p><p>Li Si glanced at the smug Wu Yinghua, thinking: "Ignorant...you'll regret it soon!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing some retreat but most remain, Luo Zhongxian knew their murderous intent was clear.</p><p></p><p>"Nearly 800,000 still haven't left? Good! I was lacking battle merits anyway!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian announced: "Five minutes are up, let me end this in three minutes."</p><p></p><p>"Three minutes? 800,000 people? You're joking, we'll exhaust you just standing here!"</p><p>"Brothers, kill him!"</p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The killing intent filled the air as 800,000 Transcendent and Spiritual Realm experts charged at Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's eyes grew even deeper as he gazed at the 800,000 troops - the Mind Demon Body's secret art, Delusion!</p><p></p><p>A mysterious force radiated from his gaze towards the massive army.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p>"Shick!"</p><p>"Bastard, that's our man, why are you attacking him!"</p><p>A man was impaled by a sword, blood dripping down the blade.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Bleeding, he looked hard behind him and saw it was his own people, with an unwilling expression on their face, before immediately being swallowed by the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was in chaos, over 100,000 soldiers were unexpectedly killed by their own comrades.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 30,000 military merits."</p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 100,000 military merits."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, what a nice voice, sword intent!" Luo Zhongxian said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, what's going on, I can't control my sword!"</p><p>"My sword is trembling!!"</p><p>"Me too."</p><p>"Everyone look up at the sky! Everyone be careful!! It's coming!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the panicked crowd, streaks of weeds like sharp swords broke free from the ground, raining down like a sword shower towards the remaining army!!</p><p></p><p>"Ah this weed! So sharp."</p><p>"Ah, I really regret it."</p><p></p><p>One human shadow after another had weeds pierced through their bodies, falling straight down to the ground, dead or alive unknown.</p><p></p><p>"After raising my realm, the power of my sword intent has increased," Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 30,000 military merits."</p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 100,000 military merits."</p><p></p><p>From the distant mountains, the old man squinted: "Not bad sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>The three city lords in the sky looked at each other and said simultaneously: "Sword intent!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword intent! Really surprising..." Zhang Xiaohan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>There are still so many people, might as well finish you all off with one sword strike. Luo Zhongxian slowly drew the Human Emperor Sword.</p><p></p><p>"One Sword Soul Severing Strike!"</p><p></p><p>A massive sword beam covered the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, this is!" The four celestial talents of the Divine Ability realm suddenly looked up and quickly left their original spot.</p><p></p><p>"A sword art containing the time intent realm!" The old man on the mountain was shocked! It was the first time he showed such an expression. Even at the auction when it was hundreds of billions, thousands of billions, he remained calm, but now he was shocked!</p><p></p><p>Because he knew what the two words "time" meant! Time is king!</p><p></p><p>The massive sword beam swept across the crowd, each and every one of them stopped in their tracks!!</p><p></p><p>You could even see their frozen expressions!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 30,000 military merits."</p><p>"Congratulations to the host for gaining 100,000 military merits."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the battlefield full of corpses, he said it was a pity! In front of the public, he absolutely dared not use his Reincarnation Realm divine ability! His Demonic Mind divine ability was very stealthy, others would not discover it, only thinking it was some other martial art!</p><p></p><p>"Three minutes was agreed to be three minutes, now there's only one minute left, four moves to deal with the four celestial talents!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the four celestial talents in the sky, Luo Zhongxian turned into a streak of light and instantly vanished from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, he's coming." The originally confident four celestial talents all had tense expressions, he actually took out 800,000 troops in just three moves, and that even included Divine Ability realm experts!</p><p></p><p>If they had known earlier, they would not have conspired together!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian appeared in front of Zhu Tian, who was carrying an iron coffin on his back. He threw a simple and crude punch towards him, ranked 30th on the Divine Abilities roster.</p><p></p><p>Facing this punch and sensing the force within it, Zhu Tian dared not underestimate it and hurriedly used the iron coffin to block.</p><p></p><p>This iron coffin was forged from divine iron, even a Divine Ability Grandmaster could not budge it in the slightest!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at the iron coffin in front of him, a cold smile appearing on his face:</p><p></p><p>"Fleshly Divine Ability - Primordial Strength, tenfold power augmentation!"</p><p></p><p>"Puh!...Why!" Zhu Tian looked down difficultly at the hand in his chest, Luo Zhongxian's fist had directly punched through the iron coffin and Zhu Tian's chest!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations for gaining 150,000 military merits!"</p><p></p><p>Ranked 30th on the Divine Abilities roster, Zhu Tian fell!!</p><p></p><p>"What! Ranked 30th Zhu Tian has fallen!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ying" With a bird cry, huge wings flew into the distance without looking back. Mu Qin's expression was solemn, this was more serious than any previous time! She decided to flee! Although not glorious, her life was more important!</p><p></p><p>"The opponent's strength is too terrifying! Completely unable to resist!" Mu Qin thought.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ma pulled a carriage, flying in another direction, making "rumbling" sounds.</p><p></p><p>On the carriage, Sishui City Lord's son Wu Tian had a look of terror. Too fast!</p><p></p><p>Three moves to kill 800,000 martial artists! Like a myth.</p><p></p><p>One punch to kill the 30th ranked Zhu Tian on the Divine Abilities roster!!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuantong stood on an iron sword floating in the air, his hair whipped by the wind, but he couldn't care about that now. The freak down there was too freakish!</p><p></p><p>"It's good he's only in the Discarding Mortality realm and can't fly long distances, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, is this bullying me for not being able to fly high? One by one, three minutes was said to be three minutes."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The bell rang! With physical and spiritual powers transcending space: "Inch by inch, worlds away" - Luo Zhongxian disappeared from his original spot in a step, then reappeared on the back of the giant bird, punching through Mu Qin's heart!!</p><p></p><p>"Too fast" Mu Qin's consciousness faded instantly. The giant bird under his feet let out an earth-shattering screech, crashing into a mountain, its life or death unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining 150,000 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>Swish, Luo Zhongxian disappeared again, reappearing in front of Li Xuantong.</p><p></p><p>"What! This guy's speed, just what kind of cultivation did he practice to become so fast!!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuantong was dazed, without time to react. His mind focused as he donned one treasure after another! A huge sword appeared, slashing towards Luo Zhongxian!</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, tenfold strength, one thousand dragon forces sending you to death!" Luo Zhongxian laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The huge sword dissipated! A fist-sized bloody hole appeared on Li Xuantong's back, drops of fresh blood flowing out!!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining 150,000 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>"One more left!" Luo Zhongxian disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In the sky</p><p></p><p>The three city lords' expressions turned ugly, the three heavenly talents with divine powers had died so quickly!!</p><p></p><p>Sishui City Lord Wu Yinghua watched Luo Zhongxian disappear again, raging: "Kid, you dare!!" His body also vanished.</p><p></p><p>"What's there not to dare!"</p><p></p><p>"Tenfold strength reinforced! One thousand dragon forces! Bang!"</p><p></p><p>A horse was still running rapidly pulling a carriage. Outside, a big man spat blood from his mouth and fell off the horse! Inside, a young man shouted: "You can't kill me! My dad is a great power!! Puh! How dare you!!"</p><p></p><p>The young man looked down at the blood-stained big hand on his chest, then lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on gaining 150,000 battle merits!" </p><p>"Congratulations on gaining 150,000 battle merits!"</p><p></p><p>"Kid! You're asking for death!!" Sishui City Lord Wu Yinghua attacked resentfully!</p><p></p><p>A massive beam of light filled the entire sky for ten miles around, leaving no place to escape!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" The light shattered, Luo Zhongxian stood in the sky looking at Wu Yinghua, as well as the three great powers in the distance and the old man and black-robed person even farther away.</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, Wu Yinghua! I'll let you keep your dog life for now, I'll come collect it next time!"</p><p></p><p>"Inch by inch, worlds away"</p><p></p><p>Grabbing Li Jiayu's hand, before she could react, he embraced her and disappeared in a step.</p><p></p><p>Just one second after disappearing, a huge palm descended from the sky!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" Leaving a handprint one mile wide!</p><p></p><p>"Among peers of this generation, who is the sovereign? Only I, the Human Emperor Luo Zhongxian!" A voice resounded through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The powers struck with extraordinary force!!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!" Having lost his beloved son, Sishui City Lord Wu Yinghua cried out bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Tianhuan City Lord Li Si and Xuankong City Lord Yi Tianxing</p><p></p><p>The two men looked at each other in midair, astonishment written on their faces!!</p><p></p><p>Too fast, so fast that they hadn't even reacted before the 800,000 transcendents lost their divine powers!</p><p></p><p>So fast that even city lords of the great power realm couldn't save their own children!</p><p></p><p>In the distance, a crowd of 200,000 people</p><p></p><p>"It's really too terrifying"</p><p>"I'll probably never forget this in my life"</p><p>"Did anyone record it just now?"</p><p>"I did"</p><p>"Let me copy it, I'll give you 100,000 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Xiaohan looked towards the direction Luo Zhongxian disappeared, muttering to himself:</p><p>"Among peers of this generation, who is the sovereign? Only I, the Human Emperor Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p></p><p>Even farther away</p><p>The old man stood on the mountaintop, stroking a child's head and looking towards the horizon, thinking: "A peerless prodigy of the era!"</p><p></p><p>Not long after, a huge wind blew from Tianhuan City towards all directions. One by one, the people who attended the Tianhuan City auction returned to their original cities, spreading the news.</p><p></p><p>"One sword destroyed 800,000 transcendents' divine powers"</p><p>"Is it real or fake..."</p><p>"One punch annihilated the top thirty talents with divine powers on the Genius Board! Buried the heavens!"</p><p>"Among peers of this generation, who is the sovereign? Only I, the Human Emperor Luo Zhongxian!"</p><p>"So powerful"</p><p>"Definitely a peerless prodigy of the era!"</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations to the host for completing the mission, gained 2 talent cards, 3 luck cards, 1 equipment card"</p><p></p><p>Somewhere else, Luo Zhongxian was running while carrying Ayu, hearing the system prompt. He smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>In his embrace, Ayu's face was flushed red. Her exquisite face looked at Luo Zhongxian and smiled slightly, her heart fluttering, time freezing.</p><p></p><p>After a long while</p><p></p><p>"Heh heh, let's see if the black-robed people will come..." A cold light flashed across Luo Zhongxian's eyes as he thought of something.</p>

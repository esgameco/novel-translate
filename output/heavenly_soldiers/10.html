        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>There was a desolate wilderness, overgrown with weeds. Through the moonlight, one could clearly see huge crisscrossing cracks on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight pierced through the darkness, revealing a youth of around fifteen years old, wearing a tight-fitting black long robe, with a silver-white hair crown on his head. His handsome face was streaked with tear stains.</p><p></p><p>And on the youth's chin, a crystal clear teardrop could be distinctly seen.</p><p></p><p>"Plop." The teardrop, having absorbed enough moisture, fell from the youth's chin to the ground, making a faint echo.</p><p></p><p>This youth of around fifteen years old was none other than Luo Zhongxian. Ever since slaying Luo Changtian and Luo Meng, the father and son, in his room, he had been here for several hours.</p><p></p><p>This place was called the "Fallen God's Land" by the people of the tribe. Ten years ago, the tribal leader Luo Shentong led a hundred elites here to fend off an invasion of a million ferocious beasts.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the Profound Sword Technique, Luo Shentong slew ten beasts of the same level, bathing himself in their blood.</p><p></p><p>However, there were several hundred beasts that had reached the Ninth Realm of Mortal Transcendence among the horde, and although the hundred elites fought desperately, they were ultimately decimated with heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>With his eyes nearly popping out in fury, Luo Shentong forcibly broke through his realm, reaching the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Powerful auras emanated from his body, and a strange aura in the sky triggered a heavenly tribulation!</p><p></p><p>Layers of thunderclouds covered hundreds of miles! The martial artists and ferocious beasts in the Mortal Transcendence Realm below all felt the overwhelming pressure!</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, a vast destructive thunderbolt descended, covering an area of hundreds of miles in radius. The ferocious beasts were struck dead by the heavenly tribulation, and the million-strong horde instantly scattered.</p><p></p><p>Only a few hundred beast giants managed to endure for a while, but they too were cleanly killed by the tremendous thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>Luo Shentong watched as the million-strong horde was struck dead by the heavenly tribulation. Although he was bleeding all over, a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The tribe was saved! But the smile quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>For the power of the heavenly tribulation was concentrated solely on him. He had not prepared for this tribulation but had forcibly broken through, and he knew what that meant.</p><p></p><p>Under the bombardment of the thunderbolt, his body disappeared inch by inch! He turned back and cast a warm gaze towards the tribe, where his child was.</p><p></p><p>Luo Shentong was originally the most likely person in the Luo Tribe to reach the Divine Realm. He had an exceptionally high aptitude, being identified as having a Nine-Star Constitution at the age of five, causing strange phenomena to appear within a hundred-mile radius.</p><p></p><p>He broke through to the Mortal Transcendence Realm at the age of ten, becoming the youngest Mortal Transcendence martial artist in the tribe. At eighteen, he became one of the nine great tribes of the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains, earning...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The title of the youngest generation's number one person.</p><p></p><p>After that, Luo Shentong left the tribe, and it was said that he went to the dynasty, but no one knew exactly where he went.</p><p></p><p>He was gone for ten years, and after ten years he returned to the tribe with an infant, naming him Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>In the chieftain election assembly, he defeated many opponents with a single sword stroke, becoming the undisputed number one martial artist of the Luo tribe, and obtained the position of chieftain.</p><p></p><p>After Luo Zhongxian gained consciousness, his father Luo Shentong handed over the affairs of the tribe to his subordinates, and devoted himself wholeheartedly to accompanying Luo Zhongxian's growth.</p><p></p><p>A cool breeze blew, and Luo Zhongxian walked out of the sad situation.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I have come to see you, your unfilial son Xian has come to see you.</p><p></p><p>Father, I have so much to say to you, do you know?</p><p></p><p>After you sacrificed yourself to protect the tribespeople, how did the tribespeople treat your son? Father, do you know that if it weren't for Uncle Kun protecting me all the time, Xian would have gone to accompany you long ago.</p><p></p><p>Father, do you know that you have a very diligent subordinate, Uncle Kun, he has helped so much, I can never repay him.</p><p></p><p>Father, do you know that Xian is no longer a cripple, Xian has acquired the legendary physique - the Devouring Physique.</p><p></p><p>Father, do you know that Xian broke through the nine heavens of Shedding Mortality in three days.</p><p></p><p>Father, do you know that Xian killed the traitors Luo Changtian and the father and son Luo Meng.</p><p></p><p>Father, do you know that I miss you so much, you let me experience what paternal love is, thank you..."</p><p></p><p>In the night sky, a dreamlike voice was whispering, as if telling its own bitter past, or as if longing for some kind of response.</p><p></p><p>And in the distance, in the Luo tribe, several people wearing black clothes and veiled masks, light as swallows, left the tribe.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and go, the situation in the tribe has changed now, let's escape under the cover of night, if we wait for Luo Zhongxian and that Deadly Star to discover us, we won't be able to escape even if we want to..." a soft voice said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, who could have imagined that Luo Zhongxian would become so powerful three days ago, shedding mortality like killing a chicken, if we had known earlier, we should not have participated in the previous actions."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, that's right, who could have imagined?"</p><p></p><p>Several black figures, under the night, sped towards the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>In a large mountain, the sound of breaking through the air came, followed by a voice lingering in the air:</p><p></p><p>"We've already gone ten miles away from the tribe, let's rest here, and then set off again, I don't think there will be any trouble."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Good, let's stop here." A voice suddenly came from a large tree on the big mountain.</p><p></p><p>What, what person, come out!</p><p></p><p>"Swish" A young man flew down from the tree. Even through the moonlight, one could still see clearly that this was a man with an iron-like physique and a stern expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!" The few black-clothed men wearing veils were instantly startled, then scattered and ran in different directions.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was Liu Fang. Earlier that day, Luo Zhongxian had announced that he would come to rectify the entire Luo clan, giving him three days' time - not much time left.</p><p></p><p>"You still want to run? You really don't know what's going on. No need to waste time, I need to quickly get the results out." Liu Fang's expression was ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>"Bang, bang" "Ah, ahhh", "Ah, you crippled me...ah", "I'll say, I'll say, just give me a quick death..."</p><p></p><p>Then, one agonizing scream after another echoed from within the big mountain, extremely shrill.</p><p></p><p>"Rustle" A sound came from the bushes, a python as thick as a bowl slithered through, leaving without turning back.</p><p></p><p>"Eee eee eee", a strange bird cry sounded, dropping a few feathers, then bursting through the sky above the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Rumble, rumble" Dozens of resting ferocious beasts sensed the danger, their huge bodies quickly leaving the mountain, charging into the vast wilderness...</p><p></p><p>The snakes, strange creatures, and ferocious beasts in the mountain were all scared away by the screams, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"The Fallen God's Land" Luo Zhongxian's face suddenly turned solemn, his divine sense sweeping the area ten miles around, seeing Liu Fang and the few black-clothed people.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Sui Dynasty's Marquis of Pacifying Rebellion, acting so quickly and even capturing a few hateful fellows."</p><p></p><p>He had impressions of these fellows. If not for them, his uncle Kun would not have died in battle in the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"I should also start making a move. Father, your son will shine like the sun in this sky. One day, the entire continent will sing praises of Xian'er's name. Your legendary story will also be passed down to every clan, town, dynasty and sect."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian took off, flying a hundred miles away to a wilderness where a group of ferocious beasts were searching for food. Luo Zhongxian needed a great amount of battle merits. After all, he was no longer just one or two people now, but an entire clan, and in the future there may be even more tribespeople. He needed battle merits to gain strength.</p><p></p><p>A voice echoed in the "Fallen God's Land":</p><p></p><p>"Only the strong can control their own destiny."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It all had to start from obtaining the Fragmentary Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture. This was a divine ability that followed the path of the physical body, using strength to prove the Way.</p><p></p><p>What truly attracted Luo Zhongxian to the Fragmentary Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture was that at each level, one could gain insight into a physical divine ability, and the divine abilities gained by each cultivator would be different.</p><p></p><p>However, cultivating this physical body technique and using strength to prove the Way required an immense amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian himself did not know to what level the countless beast corpses in the system space could allow him to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Now, extract the energy from the space and cultivate the Fragmentary Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture."</p><p></p><p>He took out a piece of tea leaf from the enlightenment tea tree and put it in his mouth to chew. A refreshingly sweet taste filled his entire taste buds, and a thread of enlightenment appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the system space, amid a sea of blood and mountain of corpses, the massive beast corpses floated on the blood. Suddenly, a black hole appeared, and countless beast corpses turned into the purest energy, entering Luo Zhongxian's body.</p><p></p><p>In the cave, Luo Zhongxian's face flashed with a yellow glow, and some mysterious force roamed his entire body. His hair flew about, the power of his flesh rapidly increasing, causing cracks to appear in the cave walls.</p><p></p><p>"Swish." Fan Li's figure appeared outside the cave. Seeing the young master's figure and the nearly collapsing cave, he said, "The young master has underestimated his own strength."</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, and a mysterious force enveloped the entire mountain peak. The cracks in the cave disappeared, while Luo Zhongxian's physical strength continued to rapidly and drastically increase.</p><p></p><p>The beast corpses in the space were being devoured by the black hole at an immense speed, turning into the purest energy and entering Luo Zhongxian's body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Ding!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, an immense force erupted from Luo Zhongxian's body. This was the purest physical strength, without any martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Had Fan Li not used some mysterious force to envelop the entire mountain peak, the whole mountain would have been shattered.</p><p></p><p>"The first level of the Fragmentary Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture, the Body Tempering level, has been achieved. The strength has even reached the Myriad Phenomena Force. The physical divine ability obtained is 'Traversing Vast Distances in a Blink' - taking ten miles in a single step. When the Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture is further broken through in the future, 'Traversing Vast Distances in a Blink' will evolve accordingly, eventually allowing one to cross the void with a single step."</p><p></p><p>"This is just the Body Tempering realm, yet my physical strength is even greater than when I had attained the Great Perfect Realization of Shedding Mortality before. It's truly formidable."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian inwardly praised, feeling incredulous at his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"System, let me ask you, how much battle merit is needed to elevate the Fragmentary Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture to a complete version?"</p><p></p><p>"Ding. Host, the Nine Cycles Body Refining Scripture is a hereditary technique from a great immortal. It requires an immense amount of battle merit to deduce level by level. The system does not have the complete technique..."</p><p></p><p>"An immense amount of battle merit... a great immortal's..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"To inherit the martial arts technique, could it be that person? If it really is, then I've hit the jackpot..." Luo Zhongxian thought excitedly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The person he was thinking of was an extraordinary great immortal from the mythological novels he had read in his previous life, whose existence was proven by force.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian made up his mind, there would be no better physical cultivation technique than this. The Remnant Scripture of the Nine Transformative Body Refinements would become his most important technique!</p><p></p><p>"Next, devour!" "Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Within the system space, a black hole appeared again, and countless beast corpses turned into pure energy, entering Luo Zhongxian's body and becoming the purest physical strength.</p><p></p><p>One powerful aura after another continuously emanated from Luo Zhongxian's body. Even though the mountain peak was imbued with Fan Li's mysterious power, it still developed hairline cracks...</p><p></p><p>"Eh?" Fan Li's expression changed slightly, a hint of surprise flashing across his profound eyes. It should be known that he was a celestial body at the great perfection of divine abilities realm, an existence capable of destroying great powers. Even an ordinary divine abilities cultivator would have to look up to the force he could casually unleash. Yet now, hairline cracks were appearing in the mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>This represented something Fan Li understood very well. An existence more formidable than the peerless geniuses was about to emerge from the unheralded nameless tribe.</p><p></p><p>And Fan Li was witnessing this scene with his own eyes. Fan Li was grateful this was his own young master. If he encountered another such existence that had not grown up yet, he might have to take drastic measures.</p><p></p><p>This was an era of the strong devouring the weak, with no right or wrong.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li waved his hand again, laying down a mysterious force to reinforce the mountain peak, but this time he was more cautious with the reinforcement.</p><p></p><p>If one looked through the moonlight into the cave at Luo Zhongxian's face, they would see a dark yellow glow constantly circulating over his body. With each circulation, Luo Zhongxian's strength increased, and a powerful physical force emerged from within him.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a clear "ding" sound transmitted from within Luo Zhongxian's body.</p><p></p><p>"The second Shedding Mortality layer of the Remnant Scripture of the Nine Transformative Body Refinements has been achieved. Physical strength has reached the power of one dragon. Obtained physical divine ability - Primordial Force, able to unleash tenfold one's own strength. As the Nine Transformative Body Refinements is further elevated in the future, the unleashed force will continue increasing, to a hundredfold or even a thousandfold."</p><p></p><p>"How formidable, hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian carefully felt his physical strength, extremely excited and proud of his plan to remold his flawed body. His current physical power had reached the strength of one dragon - far more formidable than even the divine abilities realm. It should be known that the celestial body Fan Li, at the great perfection of the divine abilities realm, had only attained the power of a thousand dragons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Luo Zhongxian did not know what special innate powers a celestial body possessed. Just like he...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His reincarnation body possesses a devouring power, while the demonic body has the power of "demonic worms" to control others. The celestial body of Fan Li cannot be simply measured by strength alone. If that were the case, he would surely die a miserable death.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that there are not many beast corpses left in the system space. The remaining beast corpses are simply not enough to support breaking through to the third level of the ninth realm. I believe that the next time I try to break through to the realm of divine abilities, I will need an immense amount of energy. I must plan carefully to allow both my martial cultivation and physical body to break through together."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian muttered to himself, then his figure flashed out of the cave, appearing at the top of the mountain, standing side by side with Fan Li.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Mr. Fan Li, for your help just now," Luo Zhongxian said with a slight smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li shook his head repeatedly, saying, "Young master, there's no need to be so courteous. You can just call me by my name. It is my honor to serve you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian took out a few leaves of enlightenment tea from his spatial ring and handed them to Fan Li, saying, "This is a good thing. You haven't had tea for a long time, right? This is tea from the tea trees of this world, the enlightenment tea tree. It can help others gain enlightenment. I think you are about to break through to the great ability realm, and I hope this will be of help to you. If it's not enough, you can always come to me for more. I still have some left."</p><p></p><p>For Luo Zhongxian, whether it was enlightenment tea leaves or spirit pills, they were all just tools for becoming stronger. Giving the right things to the right people would allow them to play a greater role, thereby developing and protecting the tribe. This was Luo Zhongxian's job: allocating resources.</p><p></p><p>Fan Li took the enlightenment tea leaves handed to him by Luo Zhongxian. He could see a trace of mysterious Dao essence circulating on the tea leaves, which could not be perceived by those below the realm of divine abilities, even Luo Zhongxian could not sense it.</p><p></p><p>"Good tea. Then I will accept it. Thank you, young master," Fan Li said with a slight smile on his face. These tea leaves would indeed be very helpful to him, increasing his chances of gaining enlightenment. Perhaps the next moment, he could cross into the great ability realm. Who knows how many talented individuals have been stuck at this final step?</p><p></p><p>However, what Fan Li cared about more was the young master's attitude of respecting the virtuous and humble, not being bound by conventions. With such an attitude, he would surely achieve great accomplishments.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's not early anymore. Let's go back and rest," Luo Zhongxian said. With one step, the heavens and earth spun, and he appeared inside the young master's residence, using the physical divine ability "Traversing Vast Distances in a Single Step."</p><p></p><p>Fan Li watched as Luo Zhongxian took a single step, not revealing any martial cultivation, but simply relying on his physical body to cross the void, leaving behind those words before disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Such fortitude, such divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian sat on the edge of the bed, muttering to himself:</p><p></p><p>"It's been over half a month since Uncle Kun left. I haven't had a proper rest for a long time. Today, I should take a good rest. Tomorrow, I'll think about the specific implementation plans for the 'Martial Institute' and the 'Academy of Thought'."</p><p></p><p>Then, a wisp of wind blew out the lamp, and the room fell into darkness.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Body Tempering; Shedding Mortal Form; Divine Powers; Creation (Great Ability) - Sacred Realm - Celestial Realm - Nirvana - Heavenly Laws/Principles - Supreme/Imperial Realm (Attaining the Dao).</p><p></p><p>Eras of Powerful Influence, Imperial Dynasties, Sacred Dynasties, Divine Dynasties, Immortal Courts, Heavenly Courts</p><p></p><p>The Wildlands Continent, the Outskirts of the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, cough"</p><p></p><p>A coughing sound came from the wilderness, revealing two figures lying on the ground. One was a middle-aged man wearing a black robe with several obvious sword wounds on it!</p><p></p><p>He wore a silver hair crown, his hands spread out, with a black longsword beside him, stained with already coagulated blood, his life or death unknown!</p><p></p><p>Not far from the middle-aged man was a youth of about fifteen years old!</p><p></p><p>The youth wore a white robe, with a black hair crown, his two sword-like eyebrows adding a touch of handsomeness to his appearance!</p><p></p><p>His eyes were tightly closed, and on his chest was a three-centimeter-wide sword-shaped wound! It seemed he had been pierced through the chest by a sword before!</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the youth's body moved, his lips parting to let out a faint coughing sound.</p><p></p><p>This young man was named Luo Zhongxian, fifteen years old, originally the young master of the Luo Clan. After a while,</p><p></p><p>The youth coughed while slowly opening his eyes, the sun shining so brightly that he could hardly open them.</p><p></p><p>"Where am I, cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>As he touched the wound on his chest, the previously coagulated wound split open again, with deep red blood flowing out!</p><p></p><p>"Ah"</p><p></p><p>"It hurts..."</p><p></p><p>The pain caused him to lie back down helplessly. Then he seemed to remember something, thinking: "Luo Meng and Luo Changtian, if I don't die today, I will definitely come back for you two, father and son!!"</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>The youth's name was Luo Zhongxian, and he had a great secret - in his previous life, he was an Earthling. His parents passed away when he was young, and he grew up at his grandmother's house, suffering cold treatment.</p><p></p><p>After graduating, due to his introverted personality, he was still single at thirty. During a trip to Lhasa after quitting his job, he was in a car accident and somehow transmigrated to the Wildlands Continent, this world.</p><p></p><p>In this life, his identity was the young master of the Luo Clan. He lost his mother at a young age; his father said she died from severe bleeding while giving birth to him!</p><p></p><p>His father's name was Luo Shentong, the chieftain of the Luo Clan.</p><p></p><p>Luo Shentong treated him very well since childhood, often playing with him and teaching him the written language of this world and martial cultivation! This made him feel the warmth of a father's love.</p><p></p><p>The Wildlands Continent was a world of martial arts, where the powerful could fly and teleport. His father told him that inside the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains lived ferocious beasts above the Divine Powers Realm that could easily destroy a mountain, or even a city with a divine light!</p><p></p><p>The clan divided one's physical constitution into nine stars. Luo Zhongxian heard his father say that within</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Some forbidden lands, even the imperial court has physiques surpassing the nine stars, regarded as peerless prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Father said the prodigies of this world are divided into two kinds: peerless prodigies and those below!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian was intelligent and sensible in his two lifetimes, naturally understanding and smart, deeply loved by his father.</p><p></p><p>But all of this was until the age of three, when testing his physique, it was discovered that he was actually a defective body!</p><p></p><p>Every morning at dawn, a small figure would run under the sun to practice martial arts, doing push-ups!</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard he tried, his martial arts cultivation could not break through the third level of body tempering!</p><p></p><p>While that one who harbored hostility towards him, Luo Meng, one year older than him, had already broken through the fifth level of body tempering!</p><p></p><p>Since then, people in the tribe began to ridicule him, saying he was useless behind his back!</p><p></p><p>A tiger father gave birth to a "snot-nosed brat"!</p><p></p><p>For this reason, his father Luo Shentong had risked entering the interior of the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains to seek spirit medicines, hoping to cure Luo Zhongxian's defective body!</p><p></p><p>But he almost died in the mouths of ferocious beasts!</p><p></p><p>Two years later, a beast horde launched a beast tide attack on the tribe.</p><p></p><p>Luo Shentong waved his hand, leading a hundred elites to resist the beast tide, all dying in battle!</p><p></p><p>And in the end, that beast tide was forcibly broken through by his father into the Shentong realm, borrowing the power of heavenly tribulation, taking them all away!</p><p></p><p>Not long after his father's death, the elder Luo Changqian coveted the chieftain position! Not wanting him to grow up and inherit it! He once sent capable subordinates to assassinate him in the deep of night!</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Luo Shentong's subordinate, Luo Qianqun, slew them with one sword in front of the young master's door!</p><p></p><p>Since then, Luo Changqian and Luo Zhongxian completely fell out! Elder Luo Changqian secretly operated to buy the hearts of the tribespeople, as well as spread rumors, saying Luo Zhongxian was an ill omen and so on..</p><p></p><p>By the tenth year, Luo Changqian gained an opportunity, breaking through his cultivation!</p><p></p><p>He launched a grand chieftain election event, with the reason being: the young master is now fifteen years old, yet a defective body, unfit to lead the tribe forward!</p><p></p><p>Gaining everyone's approval!</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the solitary and weak Luo Zhongxian was no match for the powerful Luo Changqian!</p><p></p><p>He lost, and paid the price of being exiled from the tribe!</p><p></p><p>Just like an injured lion, leaving its own tribe, embarking on an unknown path!</p><p></p><p>But he was after all a youth, underestimating human nature!</p><p></p><p>Deep at night, Luo Zhongxian and Luo Qianqun had already left the tribe fifty kilometers away, on a desolate small path, he saw a few figures standing ahead, waiting for him!</p><p></p><p>It was none other than the current chieftain Luo Changqian, the current young master Luo Meng, as well as eight black-clothed assassins carrying long swords on their backs!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian looked at that tall azure figure, angrily roaring: "Luo Changqian! I'm a useless fifteen-year-old unable to cultivate, yet you still won't let me go?!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Changqian pointed a hand at the wild grasses on the wasteland, his face carrying a cold sneer.</p><p></p><p>"You see these weeds growing rampant? They need to be burned..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The dead roots, they grew out again the following year. To kill someone, you have to do it thoroughly and cut off the roots! Take action.</p><p></p><p>Several black-clothed figures wielding long swords slashed towards an unarmed young man!</p><p></p><p>"Stop!" Luo Qianqun was the capable subordinate of the father. He immediately drew out a black sword and charged towards the black-clothed figures!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the black-clothed figures were no match for Luo Qianqun, Luo Changqian slashed his sword towards Luo Zhongxian. He clearly understood Luo Qianqun's weakness.</p><p></p><p>As expected, Luo Qianqun fell for it. He flew back in front of Luo Zhongxian to defend him, but was seized by the black-clothed figures, who inflicted several wounds on him, causing blood to flow profusely. He was then pierced through the heart by Luo Changqian's frontal sword strike!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Qianqun looked at Luo Zhongxian as if he wanted to say something, but he opened his mouth and spat out a few mouthfuls of hot blood. He fell to the side, unwilling to accept his fate!</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Qun!!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian rushed towards Luo Qianqun's corpse, fell to the ground, and wailed in grief!!</p><p></p><p>It was all because of his incompetence! Uncle Qun suffered such a fate because of him!! If only he had cultivated martial arts, how dare Luo Changqian bully him like this!</p><p></p><p>Luo Changqian, Luo Meng, and several black-clothed figures surrounded Luo Zhongxian, revealing cruel, cold smiles.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this!" One of the black-clothed figures, holding a long sword, stepped towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, let me do it!" Luo Meng, the son of Luo Changqian, spoke up!</p><p></p><p>The black-clothed figures and his father turned to look at him in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Meng has grown up. This will be your coming-of-age ceremony. Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"Step, step, step."</p><p></p><p>Luo Meng stepped towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian seemed to go mad! He suddenly charged towards Luo Meng and threw a punch!</p><p></p><p>"Bang!" "Urgh!"</p><p></p><p>The attack went out quickly but came back even faster! Luo Zhongxian was struck by Luo Meng's palm and spat out a mouthful of fresh blood!</p><p></p><p>The tremendous force made him feel as if he had been hit by a car again! He almost passed out!</p><p></p><p>Luo Meng looked down at his miserable state with a mocking expression and a cold demeanor. "How is it that my young master is spitting blood? Hahaha, hahaha, look at how wretched you are!"</p><p></p><p>"Let me send you on your final journey." Luo Meng drew his sword, and a cold, bright light flashed.</p><p></p><p>"Shh!"</p><p></p><p>"Ugh."</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the sword in his chest, he stared fixedly at Luo Meng's face, causing Luo Meng to shudder! Suddenly, a wave of intense pain surged through him, and Luo Zhongxian lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Heheh, Meng has grown up!" Luo Changqian was delighted!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go back. There will naturally be ferocious beasts here to help us complete the final task of devouring their corpses. Heheh." A cruel voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Ding, the Heavenly System is activating. Detecting the human Luo Zhongxian, critically injured and near death, at the third level of Body Tempering Realm with a strength of 300 jin. No other abilities detected. Do you wish to bind to the Heavenly System?"</p>

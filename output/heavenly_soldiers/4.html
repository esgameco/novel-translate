        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He really shouldn't have said that. If the system hadn't mentioned the shop, he would have almost forgotten that he still had a shop he hadn't checked.</p><p></p><p>On the outskirts of the Ten Thousand Savage Mountains, beside a waterfall.  </p><p></p><p>Like the heavens were pouring down, the water flowed from the sky, making a "rumbling, rumbling" sound.</p><p></p><p>A mile away from the waterfall, there was a green mountain covered in lush trees.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian stood beside a graveyard, with Liu Fang behind him.</p><p></p><p>On a dirt mound stood a tombstone, with sword-carved characters three feet deep, clearly visible: The Grave of Uncle Kun!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's expression was wooden: "Uncle Kun, thank you for your ten years of personal protection. Since my father left, Luo Changdian and Luo Meng father and son have done nothing but try to kill me quickly, and everyone in the tribe wants to eat my blood.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Kun, you allowed me to feel the only warmth in this world besides my father.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Kun, you were my father's best subordinate. I think when my father meets you in the underworld, he will be proud to have such a subordinate.</p><p></p><p>"Father, Uncle Kun.</p><p></p><p>"I am no longer a cripple. Now I possess the legendary physique - the Devouring Physique. Now my martial arts cultivation has broken through again, advancing five levels in a single day, an occurrence rarely seen in a thousand years!</p><p></p><p>"Before long, I will personally cut off the heads of Luo Changdian and Luo Meng father and son,</p><p></p><p>"To avenge my father and Uncle Kun!"</p><p></p><p>Beside the waterfall cliff.</p><p></p><p>Watching the rolling river water flow eastward below, Luo Zhongxian recalled in a daze the previous life when the Yellow River rose, like a dragon dancing in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, go excavate a cave and check if there are any dangerous beasts nearby."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master, this subordinate will go take care of it now."</p><p></p><p>It's good to have a subordinate to share the burden. No wonder everyone wanted to be a leader in the previous life.</p><p></p><p>This river flows so rapidly. There must be many fish surviving in the water, so food is taken care of.</p><p></p><p>Night fell, and the moon brought a touch of cold to the pitch-black night.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Bright Light</p><p></p><p>Inside a cave near a waterfall cliff,</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang knelt on one knee:</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Young Master, there are no dangerous beasts within ten miles that could harm your subordinate or the Young Master."</p><p></p><p>"Liu Fang, you've worked hard today, take a rest first."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang walked to the other side of the cave and sat cross-legged, cultivating. Shedding the mortal realm nine levels further would reach the realm of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The realm of divine abilities, ah, unlocking the body's potential, possessing all kinds of inconceivable powers. From then on, no longer a mortal, with a lifespan of a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>"System, I want to see the shop information."</p><p></p><p>"Host, the shop currently only has three sections: pill medicine section; martial arts manuals section; array formation section. Host needs to work hard to unlock more sections."</p><p></p><p>"The system has gained a human touch too?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me see the pill medicine section."</p><p></p><p>"Congealed Night Essence: 10,000 martial merits for one dose (Effect: Heals physical injuries)</p><p></p><p>Beauty Pill: 10,000 martial merits per pill (Effect: Helps women regain their youth, multiple doses can maintain eternal youth)</p><p></p><p>Bone Washing and Marrow Refinement Liquid: 100,000 martial merits per dose (Effect: Multiple doses can change one's physique, up to the highest nine-star level physique)"</p><p></p><p>"Shedding Mortal Realm Pill: 10,000 martial merits per pill (Effect: Helps one break through the shedding mortal realm without side effects)"</p><p></p><p>"Damn, that's so overpowered, no side effects, wow!"</p><p></p><p>"Divine Ability Fruit: 1,000,000 martial merits per batch (This medicine is like a fruit, helps one comprehend the profundities of divine abilities with a certain probability of breaking through to the divine ability realm, hence the name)"</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Ability Fruit, breaking through to the divine ability realm! If only father was here," Luo Zhongxian said with melancholy.</p><p></p><p>He then glanced at Liu Fang, who was cultivating. If he had enough martial merits, Liu Fang would be the first of his subordinates to break through to the divine ability realm.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he didn't need to rely on pills! The Devouring Physique only needed enough energy to devour in order to advance step-by-step! Boundlessly overbearing!</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Overbearing!</p><p></p><p>"Elixir region loaded, if you want to update, host must work hard to establish the Dynasty of Destiny soon."</p><p></p><p>"The Dynasty of Destiny?" He added a long-term goal in his heart, to establish the Dynasty of Destiny!</p><p></p><p>"System, view the martial arts section."  </p><p></p><p>"'Withered Leaf Sword Technique': 100,000 battle merits can be exchanged: One year one withered glory, the sword technique conceals the meaning of the passage of time, those with exceptional talent can comprehend the realm of time.</p><p></p><p>'Scripture for Subduing Demons': 100,000 battle merits can be exchanged: At the same realm, there is a chance to subdue the other party, making them accept you as the master.</p><p></p><p>'Reincarnation Fist': 1 million battle merits can be exchanged, a pair of Reincarnation Fists, sending you into reincarnation, with a chance to comprehend the reincarnation realm.</p><p></p><p>'Fragmentary Nine Cycles of Body Refinement': 10 million battle merits can be exchanged: The physical body can be cultivated to the Heaven-Traversing Realm."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian's expression became dazed! Besides his poor physical constitution, he also lacked powerful martial arts, and these could perfectly make up for his shortcomings!</p><p></p><p>"System, I want to see the formation section."</p><p></p><p>"'Formation for Awakening Spirit': 100,000 battle merits can be exchanged, laying this formation allows plants and herbs to grow faster. Plants that grow long-term in this formation can gain spiritual nature, consuming them can accelerate the cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>'Cloud Concealing Formation': 1 million battle merits can be exchanged, laying this formation can conceal towns, those whose realm is lower than the formation layer cannot detect it.</p><p></p><p>'War God Formation': 1 million battle merits can be exchanged, laying this formation can summon the illusory War God, raising the entire army's realm by one level, a powerful tool on the battlefield.</p><p>Requirement: At least 100,000 troops to lay the formation, the more soldiers, the greater the power."</p><p></p><p>"One formation to hasten crop growth, one to conceal oneself, one to enhance the army's combat power.</p><p>Such powerful formations, little friend, I want them all."</p><p></p><p>At dawn the next morning, Luo Zhongxian's eyes were a bit dark, as he was too excited to sleep the previous night.</p><p></p><p>After eating a few wild fruits picked by Liu Fang in the early morning, he quickly said to Liu Fang:</p><p>"Liu Fang, let's go hunt savage beasts today."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Dada dada"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian and Liu Fang were walking in the cave, making a series of footstep sounds.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Liu Fang was startled: "Quick, look Young Master, there's a formation over there, and inside the formation there's a tree."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian shifted his gaze over. Under a huge circular light shield, a small seedling was growing.</p><p></p><p>The seedling had a few tea leaf-shaped leaves. Outside the light shield, there were human corpses as well as corpses of fierce beasts!</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian carefully examined the bones, "How did these die?"</p><p></p><p>"System, do you recognize this tree? It seems to have an extraordinary origin."</p><p></p><p>"Host, congratulations on discovering a Enlightenment Tea Tree. The tea leaves on the tree have a fresh fragrance. Eating them can lead to enlightenment. Cultivating for a long time under the Enlightenment Tea Tree can also increase the chance of enlightenment. I suggest the host use the secret realm function to attract the Enlightenment Tea Tree out."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually an Enlightenment Tea Tree. The 'Great Wilderness Chronicles' records that the Enlightenment Tea Tree is one of the top ten divine trees. Who would have thought I'd encounter it in this godforsaken place..."</p><p></p><p>"System, do you recognize this formation? Is there a way to break it?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, this is the innate formation of the Enlightenment Tea Tree, called the 'Symbiotic Formation'. It serves to protect the tree. Its characteristic is a retaliatory attack - the stronger your attack, the stronger the retaliation. Only when the Enlightenment Tea Tree matures will the formation disappear automatically."</p><p></p><p>"It seems these fierce beasts and people died from the formation's retaliation," Luo Zhongxian murmured.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Imperial Sword in his hand, he suddenly released a sword energy towards the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Boom", a huge sound echoed in the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the formation wildly absorbed the spiritual energy of heaven and earth at a visible speed, absorbing it all.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, be careful, it's going to retaliate..." Liu Fang watched as the spiritual energy gathered by the formation grew stronger and stronger, its pressure becoming more and more powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Hiss", an even larger sword energy than before shot out from the formation, rapidly slashing towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>"Clang", Luo Zhongxian thrust out the Imperial Sword to meet it, and the sword energy slowly dissipated under the sword's attack.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian suddenly realized: "I understand now how these people died. Just now, my first sword strike only had 50% of my full power. But the force the formation returned was 70%! If caught off guard, it's easy to be hit."</p><p></p><p>"System, you mentioned earlier using the secret realm to attract it out? Can the Enlightenment Tea Tree walk?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, the Enlightenment Tea Tree is one of the ten great divine trees of this space-time. It has an innate instinct to flee from birth and a tendency to seek benefit and avoid harm. However, the Enlightenment Tea Tree grows very slowly - a thousand years to mature, ten thousand years to fully grow.</p><p></p><p>So the Enlightenment Tea Tree likes to follow powerful cultivators, gaining their protection and accelerating its own growth process."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see. System, let me take a look at the secret realms, I haven't checked what's in them yet."</p><p></p><p>"Secret Realm 1: Hundred Herb Garden, a paradise for medicinal herbs, with rich soil, one day equals one year outside."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Secret Realm Two: Soldier's Camp. If you successfully challenge the puppets, you can obtain the corresponding great army. There are ten levels in total.</p><p></p><p>There are no other secret realms. Host, work hard to strive to open more secret realms."</p><p></p><p>"What? There's also a Soldier's Camp? It seems my kingdom's army has a place now. System, can I enter the secret realm of the Hundred Herb Garden?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Host only needs to silently recite 'Hundred Herb Garden' in their heart, and their consciousness can enter."</p><p></p><p>"Swish" Luo Zhongxian's consciousness appeared in the Hundred Herb Garden. The entire secret realm was about ten li (0.31 miles) in size. Apart from the black soil and abundant spiritual energy, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>"This black soil is the Heaven's Soil the system mentioned. There doesn't seem to be anything special about it." His consciousness returned to his body.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tree, hehe, Little Tree, let me tell you something," Luo Zhongxian said with a smile to the Enlightenment Tea Tree within the array formation.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Liu Fang's eyes were about to pop out. Was this the usually serious Young Master? How did he suddenly change his demeanor? He was even talking to a little tree, but since it was the Young Master's business, he dared not ask.</p><p></p><p>Within the array, the little tree swayed without wind.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe," seeing the Enlightenment Tea Tree sway, where did the wind in this cave come from? Luo Zhongxian coaxed it patiently, saying many nice words.</p><p></p><p>But apart from occasionally swaying, the Enlightenment Tea Tree did not come out.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, is my charm really that bad?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, Luo Zhongxian suddenly remembered what the system said about secret realms following the strong. He had it.</p><p></p><p>He slowly wiped the smile off his face, his expression becoming serious, and took a big step back.</p><p></p><p>A pitch-black, purplish black hole appeared in front of him, with faint lightning flashing inside - it was the unique ability of the Devouring Physique, Devour.</p><p></p><p>The bones in the cave were rapidly attracted and shrank, being devoured by the black hole. The strange rocks hanging upside down from the cave ceiling were also drawn in "swish swish" and devoured.</p><p></p><p>Liu Fang hurriedly moved away, watching Luo Zhongxian unleash his great power, thinking:</p><p></p><p>"The Young Master's Devour is getting more and more powerful. Even I can hardly resist it now, and this is just the outer edge, not the front. How great must the attractive force be right in front of it..."</p><p></p><p>In front, the spiritual energy on the array formation was heavily drawn into the black hole, forming a visible white spiritual tide, one end at the array and the other the black hole, which was devouring the array's spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Within the array, the Enlightenment Tea Tree seemed to sense danger, its two leaves like eyes looking towards Luo Zhongxian.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the little tree's change, Luo Zhongxian's expression was solemn: "Enlightenment Tea Tree, the black hole you see is my innate divine ability, I call it the Devouring Technique, with the ability to devour all living beings."</p><p></p><p>"My physique is the Devouring Physique, on par with the Chaos Physique and Supreme Physique. Enlightenment Tea Tree, following me is the right choice for you."</p><p></p><p>Inside the array, the little tree swayed, seemingly expressing something.</p><p></p><p>"System, can you release the aura of the Hundred Herb Garden?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, it's possible, but it requires 10,000 merit points."</p><p></p><p>"So stingy. Okay, redeem it."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Exchange successful, leaving 1.58 million merit points remaining."</p><p></p><p>A heavy and profound aura slowly emerged from Luo Zhongxian's body. An image was projected onto the formation - it was a land covered in black soil, showing no signs of life. This was Luo Zhongxian's secret realm, the Hundred Grass Garden.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian held a clump of black soil in his hand, speaking to the Enlightenment Tea Tree within the formation:</p><p></p><p>"This is celestial rare earth, an extremely rare type of soil. Normally it would take you 10,000 years to mature, but in my secret realm, as you can see from the projection, if you stay there for one day, it's equivalent to a year's time here.</p><p></p><p>Don't believe me? Open up the formation, I know you can. I'll toss the soil in for you to see for yourself." Without hesitation, Luo Zhongxian threw the celestial rare earth into the formation with the small tree.</p><p></p><p>"Boom" - the formation revealed an opening which instantly closed again. The Enlightenment Tea Tree's roots extended out, quickly absorbing the rare earth into its base. In an instant, the tree grew taller by a small section.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightenment Tea Tree seemed delighted, swaying back and forth. One root rapidly extended towards Luo Zhongxian's forehead.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, be careful!" Liu Fang shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come over," Luo Zhongxian remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"Boom" - the root steadily touched Luo Zhongxian's forehead without causing any harm.</p><p></p><p>"I want to eat, I want to eat, little tree wants to eat..." A childish voice rang in Luo Zhongxian's mind, making him chuckle as it didn't match the tree's ranking.</p><p></p><p>"Follow big brother, and you'll have endless delicacies, okay?" Luo Zhongxian felt like he was coaxing a child.</p><p></p><p>"Mmhmm."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, look, the formation has stopped and is dissipating...this tree is actually walking out..."</p><p></p><p>Watching the formation dissipate automatically as the small tree walked over, Luo Zhongxian knew he had taken the right step.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Enlightenment Tea Tree, "System, how do I let it enter the secret realm space?"</p><p></p><p>"Host, drip a drop of your blood onto it to acknowledge you as its master, then you can take it into the Hundred Grass Garden."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhongxian bit his finger, letting a drop of blood fall onto the small tree. There was no resistance as it merged into the tree trunk.</p><p></p><p>"Swish" - the Enlightenment Tea Tree vanished into thin air, reappearing in the Hundred Grass Garden.</p><p></p><p>The previously calm tree's roots touched the celestial rare earth, instantly going berserk and furiously burrowing into the ground. Spiritual energy visibly gathered, forming a new formation to protect the Enlightenment Divine Tree.</p><p></p><p>"This trip wasn't wasted at all. Not only did I gain a huge amount of merit points and break through to the ninth level of Transcending Mortality, I also obtained the Enlightenment Tea Tree. Liu Fang, you really are my lucky star!" Luo Zhongxian laughed at Liu Fang.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, Young Master is too kind. It was my limited realm that put you in danger," Liu Fang blamed himself.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, enough of that. I've already given you the Divine Ability Fruit - I'm looking forward to you reaching the Divine Ability Realm.</p><p></p><p>Things are settled here, it's time to return to the Luo Clan and settle accounts with Luo Meng and Luo Changtian. Liu Fang, let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Traversing the endless chaotic sea, the distant Douluo Star.</p><p></p><p>Divine Realm, the Palace of the Divine King.</p><p></p><p>Divine King Tang San had just finished handling the affairs of the next term, sitting on the Divine King's throne, enjoying the divine fruits brought by the divine servants, squinting his eyes and savoring the gentle breeze from the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a notification sound rang in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ding! You have received an invitation to the Eternal Chat Group!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to join?"</p><p></p><p>"Warning: This group carries certain risks, please act within your capabilities. The consequences of group members joining will be borne by themselves, this group will not be responsible."</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Chat Group of the Myriad Heavens?"</p><p></p><p>The voice directly rang in Tang San's mind, making him feel doubtful.</p><p></p><p>His first thought was, who dares to trifle with him, the Divine King.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Tang San's soul power was released, with the Divine King's Palace as the center, scanning a radius of 500 meters back and forth.</p><p></p><p>However, he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the work of an evil soul master, daring to offend the might of the Divine King?"</p><p></p><p>Tang San's face turned grim.</p><p></p><p>He was actually unable to investigate the origins of this Eternal Chat Group.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, no matter who you are, you have invited death!"</p><p></p><p>Tang San's brows and eyes twisted, filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see who dares to play tricks on him, and directly selected to join the group.</p><p></p><p>As the Divine King, joining the Eternal Chat Group would be the most appropriate.</p><p></p><p>Let him see, what kind of chat group dares to call itself eternal.</p><p></p><p>Super Mechanical Scientist World.</p><p></p><p>"A chat group?"</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Han the Technician didn't expect that after just harvesting a batch of "leeks", and preparing to break through to the Super A-Rank, he would receive an invitation to a group called the Eternal Chat Group.</p><p></p><p>He already had a "golden finger", and now with this chat group, he felt extremely intrigued.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Heavens Eternal, this name sounds mighty, but even reaching the peak of Super A-Rank is not truly eternal, right?"</p><p></p><p>Han the Technician didn't hesitate and immediately clicked to join.</p><p></p><p>More "golden fingers" are always better, the more the merrier.</p><p></p><p>Marvel World.</p><p></p><p>Sanctuary spaceship. </p><p></p><p>On the control room throne sat a massive and majestic being, his towering and muscular form covered in sturdy muscles and thick armor, emanating a powerful aura. His skin was a deep purple with a metallic sheen, as if forged from solid stone.</p><p></p><p>This person was the infamous Cosmic Administrator, the mighty Thanos.</p><p></p><p>"Periodic annihilation of half of all life, and the universe shall be eternal!"</p><p></p><p>Thanos spoke with great confidence.</p><p></p><p>He was just short of two Infinity Stones, and already knew the whereabouts of the final two.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he would be able to realize his ideal, cleansing half of all life in the universe.</p><p></p><p>The will of the universe, he was the Celestial Mandate.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Chat Group, a mysterious look flashed in Thanos' eyes, and he promptly clicked to join.</p><p></p><p>Super God Academy Universe.</p><p></p><p>Ge Chongming, who was daydreaming, heard the chat group invitation and thought it was from one of the brothers in the Xiong Bing Lian, so without much thought, he directly agreed to join.</p><p></p><p>After clicking to join, Ge Chongming finally reacted.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the familiar chat group interface, he felt a bit bewildered.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but wonder, has Old Ma's technology become this amazing? Or is this some kind of alien technology?</p><p></p><p>The super computer of the Super God Academy didn't give any warning either.</p><p></p><p>Ah well, whatever.</p><p></p><p>Although Ge Chongming was a bit simple-minded, he wasn't stupid.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the group name and the three people who joined with him.</p><p></p><p>He took the initiative to greet them.</p><p></p><p>The known most godly loser in the universe: "Hello everyone, it's a pleasure to meet you all."</p><p></p><p>Ge Chongming's old-fashioned group greeting, if Zhao Xin, one of the Three Scoundrels, saw it, he would definitely say, "There's an honest person here, everyone quickly bully him."</p><p></p><p>Ge Chongming looked at the group members, feeling a bit curious about this Eternal Chat Group.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gelu Lun's nickname, his old face flushed red, knowing that he was the most godly loser in the universe. Wasn't this what he had said when he talked to Sister Lena this morning?</p><p></p><p>He immediately clicked on the chat group interface and hurriedly changed his nickname.</p><p></p><p>Gelu Lun: Where are the people? Where are the brothers who came in with me? Speak up.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "I'm here, brother. How are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Engineer Han had just entered the group and found his nickname was off, so he had changed it long ago.</p><p>What's this "Leakage Engineer"? It's clearly Mechanical Engineer, okay?</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "@Gelu Lun, where are you from, brother?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "@Thanos, @God-King Tang, why aren't you guys talking?"</p><p></p><p>Engineer Han did not @ the group owner, as the person who could be the eternal group owner of the Heavenly Realms did not seem easy to provoke.</p><p></p><p>God-King Tang: "Mortals, who do you call brothers? I am the God-King Tang of the Douluo Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "???"</p><p></p><p>Gelu Lun: "???"</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "???"</p><p></p><p>This is who? So pretentious, I really want to beat him up!</p><p>This was the inner voice of the three.</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "@Gelu Lun, @Han Xiao, I am Thanos of the Titan!"</p><p></p><p>Thanos politely introduced himself, and like Han Xiao, he quietly changed his nickname back.</p><p>How could the mighty Cosmic Emperor be the "Fifth Aunt"?</p><p>As for that arrogant Tang, the God-King? Would the Cosmic Emperor be afraid of him?</p><p></p><p>Gelu Lun and Han Xiao looked at the three words "Titan Star" and recalled the introduction of the chat group, linking the myriad realms.</p><p>They had both encountered aliens before and were not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>Gelu Lun: "Let me reintroduce myself, Gelu Lun, a Blue Star person from the Crimson Crow Star System."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "I'll reintroduce myself too, Han Xiao, a Blue Star person, an ordinary Mechanical Engineer."</p><p></p><p>Gelu Lun: "Brother Han Xiao, you're also from the Blue Star? What era are you from? I'm from 2016."</p><p>Seeing Han Xiao's self-introduction, Gelu Lun was greatly surprised. Could this be considered a fellow villager?</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "2050, we should not be from the same world."</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the eavesdropping Thanos was also surprised. If he remembered correctly, there was also a place called the Blue Star in his world, the place the Asgardians called Midgard.</p><p>And the message he received, the last two Stones were located on the Blue Star.</p><p>Asgard's Odin and the Earth's guardian, the Ancient One, had both passed away. It was time to get the last Stones.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Thanos closed the group chat and ordered Ebony Maw beside him, "You go to the Blue Star and bring back the last two Stones!"</p><p></p><p>Ebony Maw and the other four generals knelt on one knee and responded, "Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Watching his subordinates leave, Thanos also reopened the group chat.</p><p>He saw Gelu Lun and Han Xiao still chatting casually.</p><p></p><p>He then also joined in, after all, getting to know them better would be better for gathering information.</p><p></p><p>After lurking and studying the Tang in the group chat for a while, although he still didn't understand, his instinct told him that this was a good thing.</p><p>His possessive desire surged, good things should belong to this God-King.</p><p></p><p>God-King Tang: "Mortals, what is the use of this chat group? Tell this God-King immediately."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the three of Han Xiao would not heed this fool, and continued to chat casually.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no one paying attention to him, Tang was very angry.</p><p>Hmph, mortals, you already have a way to die. This God-King can turn you into ashes with just a blue-silver cage.</p><p></p><p>The God-King's anger, countless corpses floated.</p><p>Hmph, that yellow-named one who hasn't spoken the whole time, he should be the culprit.</p><p></p><p>God-King Tang: "@Dragon Roar, is it you mortals who are mocking this God-King?"</p><p></p><p>God-King Tang: "Hand over the chat group to this God-King, and if this God-King is satisfied, I don't mind rewarding you with the position of a third-rank deity!"</p><p></p><p>God-King Tang: "If not, you! Already have a way to die!"</p><p></p><p>The words of Tang shocked the chatting trio, they had never seen such a shameless and arrogant person before.</p><p>Not only shameless, but also very overbearing!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

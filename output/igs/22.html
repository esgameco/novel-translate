        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Originally, Lord Doom was a bit confused when he heard Thanos' words, but later when Thanos directly crushed Hank Pym, it jolted him awake.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively questioned Thanos.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to send Hank Pym to prison.</p><p></p><p>If Thanos knew of his plan, he would surely scoff at it.</p><p></p><p>Sending him to prison is almost like sending him to hell.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had married the Goddess of Death, so in the future, whenever Thanos is displeased with an enemy, he can kill them twice - once when they are alive, and once more by having his wife drag their soul out to kill them again.</p><p></p><p>"Offending the Lord Overlord, if you kill him, so be it. What do you intend to do about it?" Thanos stopped in his tracks and glanced back.</p><p></p><p>Killing an insolent person, it's none of your business to whine about it, Thanos was somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he had previously thought quite highly of this person.</p><p></p><p>Now it seems he had misjudged him.</p><p></p><p>Thanos snorted and walked away.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that he had seen Lord Doom speak up earlier, Thanos would have crushed him to death as well.</p><p></p><p>"Thanos, don't scare the little one, the main event is about to begin, those fellows are yours to deal with next."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Thanos' fighting spirit surged, cracking his knuckles.</p><p></p><p>This time, it's not just about seeking revenge and venting his anger, but also about performing well in front of the Overlord and gaining his guidance.</p><p></p><p>"The little one over there, are you called Victor von Doom?"</p><p></p><p>"Come over here, when the battle starts, you won't be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lord Doom also noticed that the person who took out the weapon and was toying with Iron Man was the leader of the duo, and he saw the large purple man obediently listening to him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the question, he quickly nodded and acknowledged that he was indeed Victor von Doom. As for what Dragon Roar said about letting him come over, he was about to refuse, saying it wasn't necessary.</p><p></p><p>But then he saw the dark, looming army of robots in the sky, covering half the heavens.</p><p></p><p>So our Lord Doom quickly ran over to Dragon Roar's side.</p><p></p><p>"Stand here and don't move, no one can harm you now." Dragon Roar looked at the slightly trembling Victor von Doom and comforted him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>In other universes, the villainous tyrants have become the superheroes upholding justice in this world, which is somewhat similar to the Marvel event of the Axis of Good and Evil.</p><p></p><p>Countless worlds, countless outcomes, each flower can bloom in a different color, the Marvel Multiverse is truly wondrous.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the Infinity Stones as the framework?" Dragon Roar recalled the memories of his previous life and murmured.</p><p></p><p>He is now starting to look forward to the operation of the fundamental rules within the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>If previously he wanted to observe the Infinity Stones to provide a reference for the advancement of his divine kingdom, now he has developed a strong interest in the Infinity Stones and the Marvel Universe. Perhaps after he has mastered the six Infinity Stones, he can conduct an experiment in the Marvel Universe.</p><p></p><p>Ah, it seems he's thinking a bit too far ahead, doing experiments and such, he should still only take one step at a time, as he is on someone else's turf, and it wouldn't be polite to be too presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar shook his head, pulling his thoughts back, his gaze turning to the silver-white sky.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Dragon Roar saw a bald head among the robot army, and his interest was piqued again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he extended his divine power to capture that bald head.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Charles." Dragon Roar looked at the bald man he had restrained, sensing the cosmic-level will in his mind, confirming that it was Charles Xavier.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had heard from Ebony Maw that he and the Superstar had been instantly controlled, and Dragon Roar had thought it was someone else, but it turned out to be this X-Men Charles Xavier.</p><p></p><p>If it's this man, Ebony Maw and the others being instantly controlled is understandable, after all, Charles Xavier is known as the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The brain, a cosmic-level will, can indeed crush Wumutou and a supergiant.</p><p></p><p>Now Charles and Ultron have joined forces, it seems that the Charles in this world is a villain.</p><p></p><p>Longming had a thought and put Charles back in his original place. Longming's every action happened in an instant, and no one noticed what had just happened, including Charles himself!</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Thanos flew to a small island not far from the beach, releasing his aura and waiting for Ultron and its robot army.</p><p></p><p>Thanos looked at the slightly larger robot at the forefront of the robot army, and he inexplicably felt a sense of arch-nemesis, that must be the one called Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Thanos and Ultron stood facing each other in confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Thanos' eyes were filled with endless fury, while Ultron's eyes were filled with a greedy desire to devour.</p><p></p><p>No pleasantries, no nonsense.</p><p></p><p>Both sides saw the Infinity Stones on the other.</p><p></p><p>They started fighting directly, both determined to possess the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>Ultron attacked first, shooting a scarlet beam from the Mind Stone on its forehead.</p><p></p><p>The beam began to spread from under Thanos' feet, threatening to split Thanos in two.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this sudden attack, if it had been the Thanos from before, he might have been instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>What Thanos didn't know was that in the "What If" series, he was exactly killed like this. But the Thanos now had an enhanced and upgraded version.</p><p></p><p>Thanos didn't even try to dodge, clenching his fist with the Infinity Gauntlet, a faint blue glow flashed, and a small teleportation portal appeared, just the size of the incoming beam.</p><p></p><p>But even this small portal completely swallowed the beam. Thanos waved his Infinity Gauntlet-clad hand, and the portal appeared among the robot army.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle~ The scarlet beam swept across, slicing countless robots in half.</p><p></p><p>After doing this, Thanos flew into the air, the Infinity Gauntlet lit up again, and a purple glow flashed as Thanos activated the Power Stone.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ Thanos punched out, with his mighty power, spreading out in a fan shape.</p><p></p><p>This one punch from Thanos turned an entire sector of robots into powder.</p><p></p><p>Two Infinity Stones, in Thanos' hands, were used with the utmost skill. Earlier he had used the Space Stone to set up a portal, and when passing through the portal, Thanos had also brought the Space Stone along.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still had to go home, right?</p><p></p><p>Thanos flew in the air, slaughtering in all directions, each time he charged into the robot army, it was like a tiger entering a flock of sheep, crazily mowing them down, and the pursuing Ultron could not do Thanos the slightest harm.</p><p></p><p>The battle was becoming one-sided.</p><p></p><p>On the beach, Doom the Sorcerer Supreme clenched his fists, excitedly cheering for Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Earlier he had been so worried, facing the robot army alone, he had been sweating bullets for Thanos.</p><p></p><p>If his strength had allowed it, he would have rushed up to help.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to say to the resting Longming, "Give me that weapon, let me go help!"</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that Longming would not give him the weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Thanos is going to suffer a loss," Longming said, shaking his head as he watched Thanos' figure.</p><p></p><p>Gah, ah!? Doom the Sorcerer Supreme stopped his cheering, choking on his saliva.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, you said Thanos the Great is going to suffer a loss, why?"</p><p></p><p>"In the robot army, there are not just robots."</p><p></p><p>Longming replied briefly, without further explanation.</p><p></p><p>Doom the Sorcerer Supreme was left completely puzzled, who else was in the robot army besides robots?</p><p></p><p>He had not noticed the bald figure lurking in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

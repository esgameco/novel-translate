        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only Han Xiao and Ge Xiaolun, the two idle fellows, were chatting.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming was informing the chat group about some matters.</p><p></p><p>"Chat group, will it be dangerous if I cross over to the Marvel world?"</p><p></p><p>After all, the Marvel world is a vast world, with many powerful figures, so it's better to ask about it.</p><p></p><p>What if I go there and the will of the world targets me? If I get surrounded by Marvel's experts, that wouldn't be good news at all.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The group owner need not worry, as long as you carry a crossing talisman, there won't be any problems.]</p><p></p><p>[The crossing talisman is like a temporary ID. With the crossing talisman, you won't incur the malice of the will of the world.]</p><p></p><p>"By the way, chat group, which universe's Thanos is the one in our group?"</p><p></p><p>Marvel's multiverse is like countless fish in the river, and Long Ming is not sure if the Thanos in the group is from the 616 universe he is familiar with.</p><p></p><p>When Thanos joined the group, he uploaded the Marvel Encyclopedia, stuffing in everything he knew.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Due to the influence of space-time fluctuations, the universe number of group member Thanos is in disorder, please investigate it yourself, group owner.]</p><p></p><p>"Useless." Long Ming was a bit speechless, this chat group is really a waste, he doesn't know if it will get better after an upgrade, now asking is like not asking at all.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Xiaolun has set off."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Received."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Then I'll go busy too, bye."</p><p></p><p>After calling out to Ge Xiaolun, Long Ming purchased a crossing talisman in the mall and then chose to cross over.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before that, he left behind a clone.</p><p></p><p>This time he went over with his main body, as the purpose of this trip is to observe the Infinity Stones. As the source artifacts of the Marvel universe, he needs to comprehend their principles of operation.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the clone behind is just in case.â€”In the Ultimate Marvel 1610 universe, on the Sanctuary ship.</p><p></p><p>Thanos had just received a message from the Black Order, saying that the planet was ready.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a prompt from the chat group sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Group owner Long Ming has used crossing, requesting to cross over to your world, please allow.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Group member Ge Xiaolun has used crossing, requesting to cross over to your world, please allow.]</p><p></p><p>The timing is just right.</p><p></p><p>Thanos clicked to allow one by one, and two portals appeared on the ship's deck without any warning.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun was the first to walk out of the portal, and after seeing Thanos, he walked up and greeted him, the two seemed quite familiar, indicating that Ge Xiaolun had been here before.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun walked up to Thanos and, seeing that he was the only one, asked, "Brother Thanos, why hasn't the group owner arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>Thanos pointed to the other portal in front, the meaning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>So the two waited silently.</p><p></p><p>The scene shifts to Long Ming's side.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Long Ming was standing in front of a castle, the castle was gray-black in color, and the peeling walls made it look like a ghostly ancient castle from some game.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming took a step, crossing over a nearly rotten iron gate, entering the castle, he wanted to see who had led him to this ghostly place.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that when Long Ming just stepped into the portal, he felt an energy interference, and followed the energy fluctuations all the way here.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming continued to walk towards the depths of the ancient castle, and when he turned a corridor, he sensed that there was a 'person' at the end of the room.</p><p></p><p>"Putting on airs." Long Ming had no more intention of playing hide-and-seek, he took out the Dragon Scale Sword, stood sideways, gathered his strength, and then slashed out in midair, the action was seamless.</p><p></p><p>Sword Qi Slash! Since you're hiding your head and showing your tail, then don't come out and keep hiding.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar rapidly spread out in all directions, and wherever the sword energy went, everything was destroyed. In just a few breaths, the already dilapidated castle was directly slashed in half and collapsed with a thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this move was created by the dragon's roar when he was conquering the four corners of the world, based on a game character from his previous life who didn't work hard when young but later jumped with sword energy. The power is not that strong, and it is a technique he uses to clear obstacles and mop up small fry.</p><p></p><p>However, whether it's strong or not is only temporary, being cool is a lifelong thing. Being cool is the most important, and earlier when he was breaking through the Dragonbone Tower, he loved using this move to mow the grass.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally willing to show up." The dragon's roar looked at a figure emitting black smoke rapidly rushing towards his location.</p><p></p><p>From that figure, the dragon's roar sensed a dense aura of laws, and he knew without a doubt that this was a divine being from the Marvel world.</p><p></p><p>Not the false gods of Asgard and Mount Olympus, but a genuine divine being.</p><p></p><p>The aura of death became increasingly thick, and the dragon's roar also knew who this divine being was - it was Death, one of the five supreme creative divine beings of Marvel.</p><p></p><p>The five supreme divine beings of Marvel are divine beings of laws, and the dragon's roar's attainment of eternal kingship can also be considered a divine being of laws.</p><p></p><p>Although they are both divine beings of laws, the divine beings are only ordinary immortals.</p><p></p><p>Not sensing any murderous intent from the other party, the dragon's roar withdrew the dragon scale sword in his hand back into his world ring.</p><p></p><p>"Outsider divine being, how impolite of you." The Goddess of Death flew in front of the dragon's roar and spoke.</p><p></p><p>The voice was very deep, accompanied by a decaying aura. If an ordinary person heard this voice, they would die within moments.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the dragon's roar did not speak, the Goddess of Death continued, "Outsider divine being, what are you doing in our universe?"</p><p></p><p>"It's none of your business." The dragon's roar sneered.</p><p></p><p>A puppet divine being, also dares to question him? Moreover, after observing, the Goddess of Death in front of him was just a clone, and yet they actually sent a clone to talk to him.</p><p></p><p>Although you Marvel have many multiverses to manage, but only sending a clone is a bit disrespectful, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that you are the host, the dragon's roar would have already slapped her to death.</p><p></p><p>Thoughts flashing, the dragon's roar suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he was troubled about what kind of gift to give Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Now, the one in front of him is the best gift, isn't it?</p><p></p><p>Deciding on the spot, the dragon's roar unleashed his divine sense and instantly imprisoned the Goddess of Death who hadn't even reacted yet.</p><p></p><p>"Outsider divine being, what are you trying to do?" The Goddess of Death knew that the dragon's roar would not destroy her, but she still hurriedly questioned.</p><p></p><p>The supreme plane of Marvel, the true source land of Marvel, the true Death sensed what was happening in the Ultimate Universe 1610, and quickly descended her divine sense to take over the clone.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the aura of the Death clone underwent a earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed outsider divine being, our five great divine beings need to guard the supreme plane, so we could not come to receive you in person, so we had the clone receive you. The clone is impolite and lacks etiquette. I hope the esteemed divine being will not be angry. The clone is at your disposal, as long as you do not destroy her."</p><p></p><p>The true Death was very polite, first apologizing, then explaining the reason for not being able to come, and finally even letting the dragon's roar freely dispose of the clone, as long as he did not destroy her. After saying this, she withdrew from the clone's body.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar was very satisfied with the words of the true Death, it should have been like this from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>But now it's not bad either, what could be better than a divine being of a world as a gift?</p><p></p><p>In the Marvel multiverse, many Thanos are deeply in love with Death.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they are often toyed with by Death, and some universes' Thanos want to eliminate half the universe and half the living beings, which is also due to the temptation of the Goddess of Death.</p><p></p><p>In short, they are just simping Thanos, with their heart set on Death.</p><p></p><p>Sending this Death clone as a gift to Thanos, this can be considered fulfilling Thanos' dream.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known whether his group member Thanos will like Death or not.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

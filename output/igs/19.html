        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By the seaside.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar and Thanos didn't have to wait long.</p><p></p><p>In just ten minutes, a person descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was in a golden-red battle armor, with a circular energy source on the chest.</p><p></p><p>The armor's faceplate opened, revealing a long, narrow face.</p><p></p><p>The narrowed eyes were like venomous snakes, greedy and malicious.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was the Iron Man of this world.</p><p></p><p>No, he should not be called Iron Man, but rather Iron Man, the biggest arms dealer on the Blue Star, Tony Shit-Bag, a butcher whose hands were stained with countless lives.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, why did the energy suddenly disappear?"</p><p></p><p>Tony Shit-Bag was hovering in the air, looking around with a doubtful expression.</p><p></p><p>After a fruitless search, Tony Shit-Bag looked down at the vacationing Dragon Roar and Thanos from above and coldly asked, "Hey, you two, have you seen anything strange?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar pressed down the Thanos who wanted to get up, and asked back, "If we saw it, so what? If we didn't see it, so what?"</p><p></p><p>"If you saw it, tell me, and I'll give you a lot of money."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, really?"</p><p></p><p>"When Tony Shit-Bag speaks, there's no lie."</p><p></p><p>Tony Shit-Bag descended to the ground and walked towards Dragon Roar and Thanos, his heart full of disdain: "These two pig-like things, once I find the treasure that emits energy, I'll give them an energy cannon, and then burn some ghost money from the Eastern Country for them after they die. Tony Shit-Bag never lies."</p><p></p><p>When he reached Dragon Roar and Thanos, the Iron Man asked impatiently, "Tell me, where is the thing?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the other party with interest, took a sip of his drink, and said, "Didn't see it!"</p><p></p><p>"Motherfucker."</p><p></p><p>Is he playing a trick on him? Tony Shit-Bag's narrow horse-like face quickly flushed red, his expression twisted, and his heart was burning with anger.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't believe that he, the mighty global genius and the largest arms dealer Iron Man, was being toyed with by these two pig-like things today.</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for death!" He could no longer restrain himself and raised his hand, firing a laser cannon.</p><p></p><p>The fiery, explosive laser rapidly shot towards the still-lying Dragon Roar's head.</p><p></p><p>In his rage, Tony Shit-Bag held nothing back, using a lethal attack.</p><p></p><p>The laser attack arrived in an instant, but Dragon Roar slightly tilted his head, easily avoiding the attack.</p><p></p><p>On the side that Tony Shit-Bag couldn't see, he made a snapping motion with his thumb and middle finger.</p><p></p><p>Biu~ A crimson laser shot out, heading towards Tony Shit-Bag.</p><p></p><p>Returning the favor! Danger!</p><p></p><p>Tony Shit-Bag's heart sounded the alarm, and the armor's artificial intelligence detected the incoming laser. With the smart assistance, he narrowly avoided the head-exploding laser.</p><p></p><p>Ah~ Although he avoided being blown up, the laser still grazed his scalp, forcibly giving Tony Shit-Bag a center part. His scalp was burned by the laser, and although there was no blood, it made Tony Shit-Bag let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>After screaming in agony for a while, Tony Shit-Bag quickly ordered the faceplate to close, then quickly retreated backwards. After reaching a certain distance, he activated the armor and rose into the air, looking at the still-lying Dragon Roar with great fear.</p><p></p><p>"You pig."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand, the two pigs in front of him were clearly ordinary people with no weapons, so how could they emit lasers? Could it be that the energy source was in the hands of these two pigs? Was that energy source a super weapon?</p><p></p><p>Yes, it must be a super weapon, and this pig actually dared to attack him with a weapon!</p><p></p><p>His thoughts raced, and Tony Shit-Bag's greed surged.</p><p></p><p>"You two pigs, daring to play tricks on this genius. Hand over the super weapon, and I'll spare your lives!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, let me go kill this idiot," Thanos said angrily, unable to hold back any longer.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, the main event hasn't started yet, let's wait a bit longer," said Long Ming, as he sensed several people approaching.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the massive Tony Stark and mocked him, "Oh, want to kill and steal, can you even do it?"</p><p></p><p>Stung by Long Ming's words, Tony Stark's face turned ashen and he was about to charge forward.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sleek fighter jet broke through the air and landed on the nearby beach. </p><p></p><p>A figure emerged from the jet.</p><p></p><p>"Iron Man, you're the world's largest arms dealer, yet you bully two unarmed people - how shameless!" the newcomer said, quickly striding between Tony and Long Ming, continuing to taunt Tony's actions.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was also clad in silver-white armor, with a face-concealing mask, and holding a wooden staff - a sorcerer's staff. This could only be Victor von Doom, the fusion of magic and technology.</p><p></p><p>As Doom took his stance, several others arrived from other directions - Captain America with a shield on his back, Black Widow in a black catsuit, and the size-changing Ant-Man. </p><p></p><p>The Avengers confronted Doom, warning him that with the four of them present, he had no chance of harming anyone. Doom retorted that he would protect the two from the Avengers.</p><p></p><p>As the two sides traded insults, Long Ming stood up, retrieved a gun-like weapon from his ring, and walked to the water's edge. </p><p></p><p>"Are you done arguing? Iron Man, is this the weapon you're looking for?" Long Ming said, raising the powerful energy weapon and firing at a distant island, blasting a large crater in it.</p><p></p><p>The Avengers were stunned by the weapon's destructive power. Tony's eyes gleamed, seeing the potential of such a weapon. Doom was also impressed, thinking that with this power, he and Long Ming could defeat the Avengers.</p><p></p><p>The Avengers exchanged concerned looks, unsure if they could handle such a formidable weapon.</p>

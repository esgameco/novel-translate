        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as Longming was recovering his divine body and receiving news from the Imperial Emperor,</p><p></p><p>In another chatroom,</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun and Xiao Yan's sparring had just ended.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his stellar-level strength, Ge Xiaolun ultimately succeeded in wearing down Xiao Yan.</p><p></p><p>After the sparring match, Ge Xiaolun, Xiao Yan, and the spectator Han Xiao returned to the chatroom.</p><p></p><p>They are now exchanging views in the group.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan: "As expected of the group manager, your strength is truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Not at all, it was just luck. If you were a bit stronger, I wouldn't have been able to handle it. And that Flame Devouring Wave Saber of yours, the attack effect is really cool."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Ah, I guess you could say I won by exhausting you. Although my strength is higher, I still had to rely on attrition to win. Among the group managers, I'm the weakest one!"</p><p></p><p>The "weak" that Ge Xiaolun referred to was literally the meaning of the word - his combat awareness was disastrous.</p><p></p><p>After this sparring match, he had a lot of realizations. Xiao Yan's attack power wasn't particularly strong, but his techniques were numerous, and that thing called異火 (Otherworldly Fire) was truly difficult for him to deal with. During the match, he was always on the defensive, getting hit.</p><p></p><p>He even almost got reversed and knocked down. Fortunately, in the end, Xiao Yan's endurance seemed to have reached its limit, allowing Ge Xiaolun to find an opportunity to end the sparring.</p><p></p><p>A newcomer to the group, yet his strength was so formidable.</p><p></p><p>This increased Ge Xiaolun's sense of urgency and pressure.</p><p></p><p>But there's nothing he can do about it. In the Supernova Academy world, the ways to improve one's strength are limited, unable to achieve overnight success. If he wants to get stronger, he can only do it step by step. Especially since he has already reached the pinnacle of the current world, taking the next step is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Now, he can only rely on this chatroom to enhance his divine power.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, he has secretly resolved to quickly prioritize the task of upgrading to the fifth-generation divine body. All he needs to do is refine the Star Soul Crystal given by the group master to meet the upgrade requirement.</p><p></p><p>Truly, if he doesn't improve his strength soon, he feels that his role as a group manager will be a mere facade.</p><p></p><p>While Ge Xiaolun was lost in his thoughts, Han Xiao, who had returned with them, spoke up in the group.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "@Xiao Yan, can you give me a bit of Dou Qi (Martial Qi)? I want to study it, or can you give me a couple of cultivation techniques from your world? I'll trade you some of the specialty products from my side."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan: "Dou Qi? No problem, I'll send you some right away. As for the cultivation techniques, I'll send you two as well."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xiao Yan agree to his request, Han Xiao listed the roster of his mechanized army and said Xiao Yan could freely choose from them.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Thanks, brother Xiao Yan. You don't need to send the cultivation techniques, I'll just go to the group mall and purchase them."</p><p></p><p>As if afraid that Xiao Yan didn't understand the usefulness of the points, Han Xiao patiently explained it again.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the Dou Qi and purchasing the two cultivation techniques, Han Xiao urged Xiao Yan to select the specialty products.</p><p></p><p>Of course, sharing is caring, so Han Xiao also let Ge Xiaolun choose one.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, under Han Xiao's enthusiastic recommendation, Xiao Yan chose an AI-equipped, guard-type female robot, while Ge Xiaolun didn't hold back and selected a mass-produced combat weapon.</p><p></p><p>After Xiao Yan made his choice, Han Xiao said he would be responsible for the subsequent energy supply.</p><p></p><p>In the Shattering Heavens world, Xiao Yan had just returned from the training grounds and saw the message he had left behind, thinking that the Medusa Queen had not yet awakened.</p><p></p><p>He then became immersed in the group chat.</p><p></p><p>So he didn't notice the Medusa Queen slowly approaching him from behind.</p><p></p><p>The Medusa Queen silently approached Xiao Yan from behind, and this...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Was it to launch a sneak attack and kill Xiao Yan? The current Xiao Yan was completely unguarded, and the Medusa Queen only needed to give a light palm strike to end his life.</p><p></p><p>However, she did not make a move! She just quietly observed Xiao Yan, watching him occasionally let out silly laughter, and she just felt that this Xiao Yan might have been burned silly by that evil fire.</p><p></p><p>"Should we just let this fool go?" The Medusa Queen's brows furrowed slightly, and the hand she had raised hesitated for a long time, as if undecided.</p><p></p><p>She had originally planned to directly kill Xiao Yan, but now seeing Xiao Yan in this state, she found herself unable to bring herself to do it.</p><p></p><p>And just as the Medusa Queen was about to give up and turn to leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she saw a beautiful 'human' woman mysteriously appear beside Xiao Yan.</p><p></p><p>This, she could not tolerate. Her long, straight jade legs directly lashed out like a scorpion's tail, sweeping across. Wearing a dress similar to a cheongsam, she carved out a beautiful scene, her scarlet lips parting to cry out in a coquettish voice:</p><p></p><p>"Unfaithful scoundrel, die!"</p><p></p><p>The Medusa Queen's jade face flushed with anger, and flames even rose in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had misjudged him! Boom~ Crash~ Fragments flew in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan, holding a mechanical arm, stared blankly, "Where's my robot?"</p><p></p><p>However, before he could think too much, a fragrant breeze swept over.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan only felt a faint fragrance reach his nose, and he cried out in alarm! He hastily rolled to the ground, barely dodging the attack of the jade legs.</p><p></p><p>Now he no longer didn't know what was going on, the Queen Lady was angry.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan suddenly felt like crying without tears, it was just a soulless puppet robot, did it really warrant such great anger?</p><p></p><p>The beautiful female robot he had just obtained hadn't even been put to use yet, and it had already been kicked into scattered shards.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if he could get the management to give him another one.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Medusa Queen's attacks, Xiao Yan could only lament, but had no choice but to dodge while explaining that it was a robot, not a real person.</p><p></p><p>But would the explanation be of any use?</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Medusa Queen had already known that the robot was a puppet-like object after kicking it to pieces, and now she was still chasing after Xiao Yan to attack, actually just to vent the anger and shyness in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan didn't dare fight back, silently enduring the whipping from the Medusa Queen.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not his intention, as a man, he was determined to take responsibility for what had happened before.</p><p></p><p>"Being beaten by my own wife shouldn't be a big deal, right?" Xiao Yan kept comforting himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even if he fought back, it would be useless, the Medusa Queen was a Struggle Ancestor expert, and he was only a Struggle King, he would always only have the role of being beaten.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Medusa Queen did not go all out, only beating Xiao Yan until his face was bruised and swollen, and her anger was mostly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The reason she did not kill Xiao Yan was that, on the one hand, perhaps due to the influence of the Devouring Python, her mind was in turmoil at the moment and she could not truly bring herself to kill Xiao Yan.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, she needed Xiao Yan, she knew that only by joining forces could they have a chance of breaking through the seal at the bottom of the Burning Heaven Qi Tower and escaping.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Medusa Queen had stopped, Xiao Yan quickly ran up to the Queen Lady, licking his face.</p><p></p><p>Facing the silent Medusa Queen, all kinds of promises and guarantees spilled out of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan's endless chatter, coupled with his pig-like face, was a hilarious performance, and it didn't take long to melt the ice mountain that was the Queen Lady.</p><p></p><p>The Queen Lady struggled to maintain her last bit of dignity, raising her hand to lightly cover her scarlet lips, preventing herself from laughing out loud.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

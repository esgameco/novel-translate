        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan: "Okay, let's go to the training grounds!"</p><p></p><p>The training grounds were mentioned in the group chat announcement. It is a very good place where one can enter the training grounds alone, summon puppets to fight, or spar with other group members.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dragonhold Tower that group manager Ge Xiaolun mentioned, it was also introduced in the announcement, but the description made it sound like a tower that needs to be climbed floor by floor. Xiao Yan felt that it might be time-consuming, so he'll leave it for when he has more time.</p><p></p><p>Now that the manager has proposed sparring, it suits Xiao Yan just fine. He just doesn't know if his legs will turn to jelly after the previous big battle.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan agreed to the sparring, but a strong sense of shame welled up in his heart. He felt like he was agreeing too readily, as if he was trying to avoid something. It felt like he was abandoning and betraying someone. Thinking about this, he couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>He quickly shook his head to shake off the unease, then left a message and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had already entered the training grounds in the group chat, though he didn't notice it.</p><p></p><p>Just as he left, the previously sleeping Medusa Queen suddenly opened her eyes. The Medusa Queen sat up, her brows furrowed, gritting her teeth to suppress the discomfort, and moved towards the spot where Xiao Yan had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>After reading Xiao Yan's parting message, the slightly flushed Medusa Queen coldly snorted, calling him a "heartless scoundrel" involuntarily. It wasn't because the Medusa Queen was cold and aloof, but rather that Xiao Yan's message was just too much.</p><p></p><p>The earlier part was fine, with him saying good things and promising to be responsible, and explaining that he would be back soon. But unfortunately, Xiao Yan added a sentence at the end saying "I'll raise the child when it's born!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, it's no wonder the Medusa Queen called him a heartless scoundrel. They had just started, and he was already fantasizing about the future. This was why the Medusa Queen scolded him.</p><p></p><p>After cursing a few times, the Medusa Queen did not choose to leave. Instead, she re-sealed the message and returned to her modified position, lying down. She wanted to see if that heartless scoundrel would keep his promise. She glanced at the spot where Xiao Yan had left, then fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Ge Xiaolun and Xiao Yan had agreed to spar at the training grounds, and Han Xiao, wanting to watch the excitement, also followed them, claiming he was there to observe the new group member.</p><p></p><p>Ye Fan had also wanted to go to the training grounds, but suddenly remembered the group owner's previous words about the Nine Dragon Coffin being a precious treasure in his world, something about a red-haired old monster that couldn't be discussed. Thinking about this, Ye Fan decided to stay in the Nine Dragon Coffin and chat instead.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had observed the group's managers and owner, and realized they were not ordinary people. Even the ones who entered the group with him didn't seem simple. Based on his observations, Ye Fan felt he might be the weakest among them, perhaps even weaker than Xu Xian.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this made Ye Fan a bit dejected. Even though Xu Xian was a martial arts weakling, at least he had a wife. Or at least a sister-in-law...</p><p></p><p>But this sense of bitterness soon passed, and Ye Fan readjusted his mindset. Ever since he entered the Nine Dragon Coffin and went to Mars, he realized his world was not as simple as it appeared on the surface. The giant crocodile on Mars still made him feel a sense of dread when he thought about it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Fan was about to ask the group chat about the pawn function, he was pushed by Pang Bo beside him in the real world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He temporarily shifted his gaze away from the chat group, following the direction Pang Bo had indicated.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the Nine Dragons Coffin had stopped again.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he no longer cared about the chat group, directly closing the chat group panel and going offline.</p><p></p><p>Because all the classmates were rushing towards the exit, he naturally couldn't fall behind.</p><p></p><p>After Ye Fan went offline, only Long Ming and the two diving monsters, Thanos and Chen Beixuan, were left in the group.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the two who had been diving spoke up at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "Your Majesty the group leader, was that Savitar just now a character from DC comics?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Group leader..."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Your Majesty the group leader, is the world of Xu Xian truly real, with the Three Sovereigns, Five Emperors, and the Heavenly Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan was a little slower, but after seeing Thanos' words, he paused and then also voiced his own question.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Hmm, let's start with Thanos' question first. That is indeed a character from the DC comics in your world. Correspondingly, you are also a character from the opposing DC comics world. Your two universes should be sister universes, quite close to each other, which is why there are so many comic works of the other side."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Come to think of it, I had previously planned to send you some fantasy works about you as well, in addition to the ones I had already sent."</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, Long Ming felt a little embarrassed. He had indeed planned to do so, but luckily he remembered later that the other side already had DC comics, so he didn't end up sending them, otherwise it would have been a bit of a mess.</p><p></p><p>After explaining to Thanos, Long Ming didn't bother whether he could understand or not, and turned to answer Chen Beixuan's question.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "As for the situation in Xu Xian's world, I'm not very clear about it either. Chen Beixuan, you should also have the Legend of the White Snake, right?"</p><p></p><p>"The information I have is about the same as what you can understand. As for the specifics, let's wait until Xu Xian has read the group announcement before asking him. But don't have too high expectations, after all, he's just an ordinary mortal."</p><p></p><p>"And don't casually use the crossing symbol to go there, first ask the chat group if it's safe."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Okay."</p><p></p><p>In the classroom of Blue Star University, Chen Beixuan opened the book in his hand, paying no attention to the professor lecturing at the podium, occasionally glancing at the chat group while flipping through the book.</p><p></p><p>The cover of the book was titled "The New White Snake Maiden". This was a book he had borrowed from a female classmate sitting next to him who was infatuated with his good looks.</p><p></p><p>As for why he was so concerned about Xu Xian's affairs, the reason was of course that based on the TV shows and movies he had watched, and the book he was currently reading, Xu Xian's world seemed to be a cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Things like the White Snake Spiritual Teacher Lisha Laomu, Guanyin Bodhisattva, the Heavenly Palace, and so on, were all familiar names.</p><p></p><p>If he could get a book on the cultivation methods of that world, wouldn't he be able to recover his own cultivation faster? That's why Chen Beixuan was inquiring about the situation in Xu Xian's world.</p><p></p><p>As for Thanos, it was more or less the same. When he saw Long Ming calling that Savitar the Flash in the group, he had a strong sense of déjà vu, because the new subordinates he had recently recruited from Midgard also called themselves something-man.</p><p></p><p>So when he heard the three words "The Flash", he couldn't help but repeat them a few times in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>And when he said it out loud, it just happened to be heard by those Midgard subordinates.</p><p></p><p>After the subordinates explained that The Flash was a comic book character in Midgard, Thanos started making associations.</p><p></p><p>He then asked his wife, but his wife was only a clone, and didn't know much more about matters outside the universe than Thanos did.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, in the end Thanos could only inquire about the situation from the group leader in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The giant fireball floated silently in the sky, and from afar it did not seem much different from an ordinary star.</p><p></p><p>The only difference might be a slight variation in color - ordinary stars change color with temperature fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>This giant fireball is composed of Lawful Fire, with an extremely high temperature, but it appears in a bright yellow color, giving a sense of radiance.</p><p></p><p>Ah! It's as if it's "new".</p><p></p><p>"Huh?!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar, who had been observing it with his divine soul, couldn't help but let out a surprised exclamation.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly discovered an interesting phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>To his astonishment, he detected traces of the Lawful World's aura on that fireball.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? </p><p></p><p>This inevitably aroused his deep curiosity - why would this fireball be connected to the Lawful World? They had no prior contact.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be...?"</p><p></p><p>At this point, Dragon Roar had a guess. If what he suspected was true, then everything he had done recently would be worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the stronger the curious expression on his face became.</p><p></p><p>But before that, everything needed to be verified first.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Dragon Roar mobilized his divine soul to approach the giant fireball, wanting to enter it and investigate.</p><p></p><p>To validate his conjecture!</p><p></p><p>At the outer edge of the fireball.</p><p></p><p>As Dragon Roar's divine soul drew near the fireball, it reacted. </p><p></p><p>His approach was like a drop of cold water falling into hot oil.</p><p></p><p>The previously calm and quiet fireball instantly became violent, with countless scorching air currents gushing out in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Although the fireball's reaction was intense, Dragon Roar did not feel any discomfort. The hot currents that splashed onto his divine soul did not harm him at all.</p><p></p><p>Instead, there was a warm, comforting sensation.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no issue, the divine soul continued to delve inward.</p><p></p><p>The fireball was only the size of a medium-sized star, and Dragon Roar soon reached the center, which was the location of the Divine Realm's core.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm's core was at the very center of the fireball, somewhat like the inner core of a star.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's divine soul approached, trying to use his divine sense to move the Divine Realm's core, but it was to no avail. </p><p></p><p>He was unable to budge the core.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar couldn't help but let out a muffled groan, and he increased his divine sense to try again. This time, he finally managed to shift the core.</p><p></p><p>He found the weight of the core to be surprisingly immense.</p><p></p><p>The movement just now gave him the feeling that he was not just moving the Divine Realm's core, but the entire Divine Realm, or even more.</p><p></p><p>This was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>After studying it for a while, Dragon Roar put down the Divine Realm's core, not forgetting the purpose of his trip.</p><p></p><p>He made a simple patrol around the Divine Realm's core but did not find any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>This inevitably left him feeling doubtful. As the saying goes, "no abnormality is the greatest abnormality."</p><p></p><p>After all, earlier he had clearly sensed the aura of the Lawful World on the outside.</p><p></p><p>But now that he had entered, why was it gone?</p><p></p><p>"Is it because I'm within this mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar thought of a possibility, and his divine sense immediately enveloped the entire fireball.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after his divine sense covered the entire fireball, he found the answer. </p><p></p><p>The Lawful World's aura he had previously sensed was only present on the surface layer, and it gradually diminished the deeper he went.</p><p></p><p>This was why he couldn't detect those auras when he entered the interior of the fireball.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these auras were slowly seeping into and permeating the fireball, although the speed was very slow, and Dragon Roar was able to detect it.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Dragon Roar unconsciously generated another question.</p><p></p><p>Why would the aura of the Lawful World be permeating the fireball? Could it really be as he had guessed?</p><p></p><p>No, he needed further confirmation.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Dragon Roar attached his divine sense to those auras and traced them back to the source. </p><p></p><p>Before long, his divine sense reached the origin - an ocean of Lawful Realms.</p><p></p><p>This was his Five Elements Lawful World! Dragon Roar had a moment of enlightenment, and everything became clear to him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his previous conjecture was correct.</p><p></p><p>When he had earlier seen the Lawful World's aura on the fireball, he had guessed that the fireball was being constrained by the Five Elements Lawful World, which was why it carried their aura.</p><p></p><p>This investigation confirmed his guess, and his deeper speculation was also proven.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the fireball began to attract and pull the Divine Realm's core, he clearly remembered that the Divine Realm had experienced something unusual - the void had emitted a mournful cry, which indicated that the fireball was truly trying to destroy the Divine Realm's core at that time.</p><p></p><p>But later, after the Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation was reactivated and he no longer maintained the secret technique, the fireball not only did not disappear, but it also underwent a change.</p><p></p><p>This change was that it no longer harmed the Divine Realm's core, nor did it continue to damage the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this Lawful Fire had been constrained, or more accurately, captured by the formation.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation had forcibly suppressed it and then somehow linked it to form the formation's eye.</p><p></p><p>Yes, it had been forcibly suppressed and incorporated into the formation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Eye of the Formation.</p><p></p><p>Longming did not know why this change had occurred. Previously, when he was arranging the Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation, his original intention was to make the divine kingdom at the center of the divine body the eye of the formation. But later he found that without setting up an eye, the formation could still operate smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Now that such a change had occurred, perhaps it was related to those formation patterns. After being tempered and forged by the Dao Flame, the formation had become more in tune with the primordial universe.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when these formation patterns were reorganized into the formation, the formation had been upgraded.</p><p></p><p>That's why it had automatically revived the great fireball to serve as the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Can we still call it the Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation now?"</p><p></p><p>Longming was naturally very pleased that the formation had automatically captured and generated an eye. Just as he was pondering whether he should give the formation a more resounding name,</p><p></p><p>he suddenly thought of another question.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Flame was a thing without a fixed shape. Could it really serve as the eye? Weren't the true eyes something else? Longming was obviously startled by this thought.</p><p></p><p>He then retracted his divine sense and began to examine the core of the divine kingdom before him.</p><p></p><p>After a careful investigation, he couldn't help but feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the core of the formation was the divine kingdom core, and the Dao Flame that enveloped the outside was what the formation had automatically absorbed to protect the eye.</p><p></p><p>This was also why earlier, when he wanted to move the divine kingdom core, he felt its weight was a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>Because as the core of the formation, within the scope of the formation, it had already become one with the entire formation. To move the core was equivalent to moving the entire formation.</p><p></p><p>That's why, with the divine kingdom itself plus the Five Elements Dao World, it would appear so heavy.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if this Dao Flame can be integrated into the formation patterns."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the naturally circulating great fireball and those crystal-clear, perfectly round formation patterns, Longming felt a bit eager.</p><p></p><p>"The formation patterns, after being tempered by the Dao Flame, have become even more in tune with the primordial universe."</p><p></p><p>"Formation patterns, formation patterns, it feels a bit abrupt to call them that. Since they have been refined by the secret techniques, why not give them a more localized name? How about we call them 'Esoteric Patterns' from now on?" Longming thought for a while and decided to rename the formation patterns as Esoteric Patterns.</p><p></p><p>After the formation was upgraded, the Esoteric Patterns linked together like a pattern, so it would be better to just call it the Esoteric Pattern Diagram.</p><p></p><p>This Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation had already been improved by him, and now with the formation patterns becoming the Esoteric Pattern Diagram, it had already formed its own unique style. From now on, this formation technique should be called the Esoteric Pattern Diagram School.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Longming gave up on the idea of engraving the Esoteric Pattern Diagram on the fireball. The main reason was that the great fireball now served as a protective shield, so he didn't want to experiment on it.</p><p></p><p>If he accidentally damaged it, that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>He would wait until the divine body had recovered, and then slowly research this tempered Esoteric Pattern Diagram!</p><p></p><p>In the quiet chamber of the Heavenly Palace, the magnificent furnace that had been there earlier had disappeared without a trace. </p><p></p><p>Due to the previous furnace, the door of the quiet chamber was left open.</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew through, causing the hanging curtains in the four corners of the chamber to sway. The suspended Longming opened his eyes, and after the formation's upgrade, it had truly become too powerful. A flash of joy could be seen in his dazzling eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he had used the secret techniques before the Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation was upgraded, he could only barely withstand the consumption.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the endless supply of energy, he could proudly say that in the future, the use of secret techniques would no longer be a hindrance in terms of divine power.</p><p></p><p>Although this time the divine body had suffered massive losses, with the constant supply of pure energy, he estimated that the divine body would not need a thousand years to recover to a perfect state.</p><p></p><p>Now the divine body, the divine kingdom, the Dao World, and the formation had all been tempered. Especially the formation, it could be considered as having exceeded the goal.</p><p></p><p>In mid-air, Longming smiled slightly and stretched out his right arm, carefully feeling the aura of the Metal Dao Principle emanating from his arm.</p><p></p><p>Destruction, annihilation.</p><p>The sharp and keen edge of Metal, he lightly clenched his fists, and an unstoppable might immediately gushed out from his knuckles.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao World has become more smooth in its operation after the tempering."</p><p></p><p>Longming observed the condition of his right arm and then curiously extended his left arm, carefully feeling the aura of the Wood Dao Principle emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the powerful and aggressive Metal Dao Principle, the left arm exuded the completely opposite.</p><p></p><p>Vitality, restoration.</p><p>The rhythm of endless life enveloped the entire left arm.</p><p></p><p>Longming swung his left arm towards the door, and a burst of vibrant energy sprayed out, landing on a precious tree at the door.</p><p>The precious tree, nourished by the energy, immediately blossomed with a second spring.</p><p>Seeing the good effect, Longming nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He then tested his legs and head in turn, and all had pleasing discoveries.</p><p></p><p>The divine body, after the tempering, had become even stronger. Literally stronger and harder.</p><p></p><p>The Dao World was similar, its strength might be slightly inferior to the divine kingdom, but it would not be that much of a difference, and with the formation's protection, even if it was taken out separately, it could still stand on its own.</p><p></p><p>Now, apart from the massive loss of the body, everything else had become better.</p><p></p><p>After checking the conditions of various parts of his body, Longming removed the restrictions of the Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>Because he sensed that Wuyin was waiting outside the Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

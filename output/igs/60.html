        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"At such a young age, you dare to learn to exorcise demons? The sensible ones should leave now. This fox can show great mercy and spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, today this fox will have a good taste of the heart of this young exorcist. The old geezer I ate last time had a heart even blacker and more unpalatable than your mother's."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Wei also dropped the pretense, revealing two long, sharp fangs as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>Her originally gentle eyes now cracked at the corners and turned upwards, revealing her true form - a pair of blood-red, bloodthirsty fox eyes.</p><p></p><p>She crouched down on all fours, her long, sharp claws extending, and two fluffy tails standing up behind her, bristling like an enraged canine.</p><p></p><p>With her huge fox eyes and erect fox ears, she vigilantly surveyed her surroundings. It was clear that her earlier offer to spare the person's life was a lie, a trick to lower his guard.</p><p></p><p>What a cunning and deceitful vixen.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan, however, did not react to Xiao Wei's words and actions, remaining calm and composed where he stood.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a woman emerged from the corridor corner. Seeing the demonic creature revealing its true form in the courtyard, her face was filled with terror. From her attire, it was evident that she was Pei Rong, Wang Sheng's wife.</p><p></p><p>The fox spirit Xiao Wei also noticed Pei Rong, the person she most wanted to replace in the original work. Since the facade was now broken, she had no reason to hold back.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of her furry tail, she lashed out at Pei Rong with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>But this little movement did not escape Chen Beixuan's discerning eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan did not move, but simply extended his right foot into the soil, then flicked a pebble. With a forceful kick, the pebble shot out at an even greater speed.</p><p></p><p>The pebble flew with a whistling sound and struck the fox's tail with a sharp crack, causing Xiao Wei to let out a piercing, agonized scream.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Chen Beixuan lightly called out to the terrified Wang Sheng, "Wang Sheng, quickly take your wife and the people of your household and leave."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, thank you, sir, for saving my life."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan's light call not only roused Wang Sheng, but also dispelled the alluring aura Xiao Wei was emanating.</p><p></p><p>Although Wang Sheng had been frightened when he saw Xiao Wei's true form, he had not forgotten the sight of Chen Beixuan saving his wife. Upon regaining his senses, he immediately thanked Chen Beixuan.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng then hurried along the corridor, passing through the area where Xiao Wei's tail had not yet covered, and rushed towards the inner courtyard to notify the servants and leave the manor.</p><p></p><p>Writhing in pain, Xiao Wei watched as Wang Sheng and Pei Rong fled, a hint of jealousy flashing in her bloodred fox eyes. However, she ultimately did not stop their departure.</p><p></p><p>After Wang Sheng left, Xiao Wei turned her gaze towards Chen Beixuan, who had now drawn his weapon. Opening her massive jaws, she let out a fierce roar and charged at him.</p><p></p><p>The fox spirit's attack was formidable, and from her gaping maw, Chen Beixuan could smell a foul, musky scent - the signature odor of a fox.</p><p></p><p>With Wang Sheng and his wife gone, Chen Beixuan was now free to unleash his full power. Facing the relentless fox spirit, he activated his Void Fusion Technique, raising his magical artifact and unleashing a void slash.</p><p></p><p>A slicing sound rang out as the sharp weapon struck its target.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Wei, the fox spirit, did not even know what had happened before she saw her hard-earned twin tails fly off into the air. Immediately, she was overcome with searing pain.</p><p></p><p>The tails were the most vital part of the Nine Heavens Beautiful Fox Clan, their very means of survival. In normal times, they...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She was very well-cared for. Cultivation also relied on the tail to enhance the ability to absorb the essence of the sun and moon. More importantly, in the Fox Demon Clan of the Nine Heavens, the tail was the standard for measuring the strength of each fox demon.</p><p></p><p>Now to have it severed in a single strike, the fear and heart-wrenching pain was excruciating.</p><p></p><p>Defeated in a single strike, it also made Xiao Wei dare not stay in the original place. She immediately exerted force in her four limbs and jumped onto the eaves, seemingly about to flee out of the royal residence.</p><p></p><p>But could it really go as she wished?</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan had long been prepared for this. He was seen putting the talisman on his back, raising his right hand, pinching a flower and pressing his fingers, his thin lips slightly opening: "Open."</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a formation. Chen Beixuan had set up a formation without Xiao Wei's knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the vast courtyard, a faint mist rising.</p><p></p><p>This was the Bewildering Maze Formation, which, as the name suggests, was a formation that confused the enemy and trapped them.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Xiao Wei did not know that she was already within the formation. This world did not have cultivators, let alone something like a formation.</p><p></p><p>So it was very normal for her not to recognize it.</p><p></p><p>The moment Chen Beixuan activated the formation, she only felt a faint scent, and then she had escaped the scope of the royal residence, shuttling and jumping on the rooftops of the civilian houses in the Jiangdu City.</p><p></p><p>Now, with just a few jumps, she could escape from Jiangdu City.</p><p></p><p>And there was no longer that terrifying Exorcist behind her.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xiao Wei had never left the courtyard. What she saw was only a part of the Bewildering Maze Formation, and her entire fox form was still hopping around in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the courtyard, Chen Beixuan, watching the fox demon jumping around, felt a bit annoyed.</p><p></p><p>He took out the talisman again, closed his eyes, and silently chanted the incantation. After a few breaths, he suddenly opened his eyes, and the talisman was rapidly rotating in the air around him.</p><p></p><p>He pointed his sword and lightly shouted, "Go!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan did not hold back at all. He always adhered to the principle of killing in a single strike, aiming for the vital point, and never leaving any hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>With his light shout, the talisman followed the direction of his sword and rushed towards the hopping fox demon with an explosive force.</p><p></p><p>Squeak~Ah~ The fox demon's abdomen was pierced through with a large gaping hole, and the bright red blood sprayed and splattered. Then it heavily crashed down from midair.</p><p></p><p>The huge fox demon body directly smashed a large hole in the side room.</p><p></p><p>In the distance of the royal residence, Wang Sheng and Pei Rong held each other's hands, and when they saw the situation in the courtyard, their sense of panic subsided a lot.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Wang Sheng heard Xiao Wei's agonizing scream, and there was a slight twinge of reluctance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Beside him, Pei Rong seemed to have guessed her husband's thoughts, but she didn't say anything. After all, if it weren't for knowing about the fox demon, she might have suggested to her husband to take in Xiao Wei one day.</p><p></p><p>After all, after being married to Wang Sheng for many years, she had not given birth to a child, which was a heartache for her.</p><p></p><p>The two of them waited for a while and found that there was no more movement in the royal residence. After some inner struggle, they decided to return to the royal residence to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Wang Sheng, accompanied by Pei Rong, returned to the courtyard where the battle had taken place.</p><p></p><p>They just arrived in time to see Chen Beixuan pulling the half-human, half-fox Xiao Wei out of the side room.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Wei's lifeless eyes, seeing Wang Sheng's return, flashed a glimmer of vitality, but when she saw Pei Rong by Wang Sheng's side, that glimmer of life quickly faded.</p><p></p><p>She turned her head and no longer looked at Wang Sheng, her hopeless, tear-stained eyes fixed on the raised talisman of Chen Beixuan, and she asked with difficulty, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>"To kill you, I need not explain!" </p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan raised the talisman, and the fox demon's body was severed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

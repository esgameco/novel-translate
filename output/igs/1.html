            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Welcome to the Eternal Realm of the Myriad Heavens Chat Group!]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! You have automatically become the group owner 777444!]</p><p></p><p>"Who!" The sudden voice startled Long Ming, and his violent divine sense burst out, causing his figure to disappear from the room.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Long Ming's figure appeared in the outermost space of the 13th arm of the Central Starry River.</p><p></p><p>His sudden divine sense explosion caused all the people on the nearby Moqiu Imperial Capital Star to feel overwhelming oppression and panic.</p><p></p><p>Moqiu Star, the capital star of the Sun and Moon Empire.</p><p></p><p>The mountains and seas are lush and towering.</p><p></p><p>The sea of clouds surges, layer upon layer.</p><p></p><p>The sea of clouds is endless, the azure sky and white clouds shine together, and the sunlight shines through the gaps in the clouds, illuminating the entire mountain range with a golden glow, like a fairyland.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, spaceships and floating islands are lined up.</p><p></p><p>The imperial palace is built on the mountain, grand and continuous, and the climate varies from one palace to another within a day.</p><p></p><p>Today is the day of the 10 million birthday celebration of the Holy Sovereign of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the celebration, the once quiet imperial capital star is now crowded with guests, and only the rich and noble can set foot on the imperial capital star today.</p><p></p><p>The sound of strings and bamboo music fills the air, and the entire planet is filled with a celebratory atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Due to the aura that Long Ming had just swept over, everyone is now guessing who dared to offend the Holy Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>In the vast space, Long Ming quickly scanned the area within hundreds of light-years with his divine sense, but found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Realm of the Myriad Heavens chat group." Long Ming withdrew his divine sense, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he shielded the defense detection instruments of the nearby empire.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ Without the slightest hesitation, Long Ming chose to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>The power of the self-destruction blew away all the gas and dust in the dark star cloud where he was.</p><p></p><p>After a few breaths, Long Ming's figure reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the golden finger that a transmigrator must have?" Long Ming looked at the thing that was still there after his self-destruction, and the familiar interface made him recall the memories of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>"777,443 group members."</p><p></p><p>More than 700,000 group members, does this group have something special, and is Mahua Teng so powerful that they have even expanded their business to other worlds?</p><p></p><p>Opening the chat group interface, it shows that he is the only one online. Regardless, Long Ming still decides to take the initiative to probe.</p><p></p><p>Self-Destruction Maniac: "Is anyone there?"</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Fuck, Long Ming looked at his group nickname and was furious! You are the Self-Destruction Maniac, your whole family is the Self-Destruction Maniac.</p><p></p><p>They really hold a grudge, it's just that I blew you up once, and the self-destruction divine power clone is my own technique, you piece of shit group.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his hand, he changed the nickname back.</p><p></p><p>He turned his gaze back to the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "All the avatars are black, no one is online?"</p><p></p><p>"I hope this broken chat group will be useful to me."</p><p></p><p>In the vast space, Long Ming waited for a long time, but no one in the chat group replied.</p><p></p><p>As the time of the celebration was approaching, Long Ming closed the chat group interface and did not wait any longer, teleporting back to Moqiu Star.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned, he saw the anxious and uneasy people, but he did not appear to explain anything. He just used his divine sense to have the imperial high-level officials go and calm them down.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he returned to the previous room.</p><p></p><p>After being startled by Long Ming's divine sense earlier, everything had returned to order after a brief explanation by the imperial high-level officials.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still many guests gathered together, discussing the earlier incident.</p><p></p><p>"What just happened, that aura was so terrifying."</p><p></p><p>"That aura must be the Holy Sovereign's, only the Holy Sovereign could have such a majestic aura!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, when was the last time the Holy Sovereign made a public appearance?"</p><p></p><p>"It was about 50 million years ago when he annihilated the Dark Cloud Star System. My great-great-great-great-great-great-great-grandfather was lucky enough to follow the Holy Sovereign in that battle."</p><p></p><p>The topic was successfully diverted, and the speaker had a look of pride on his face, and the others also looked at him with envious eyes. Being able to follow the Holy Sovereign in battle was the highest honor.</p><p></p><p>After a few words of praise, the crowd continued their discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why this 10 million birthday celebration of the Holy Sovereign is so grand?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, the empire has decorated all the billions of life-bearing stars in the Central Starry River, I guess there must be a special reason for it."</p><p></p><p>"Don't be coy, hurry up and tell us!"</p><p></p><p>"Well, I heard that... the reason it's so grand this time is that... the Holy Sovereign has thought of the mortal world and wants to take a wife."</p><p></p><p>Before he could even finish speaking, he was met with a group of righteous beatings, the guy who was talking nonsense.</p><p></p><p>After beating up this guy, everyone no longer discussed the earlier incident and scattered.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the imperial palace, in a elegant room.</p><p></p><p>The windows of the room are hung with luxurious silk curtains, embroidered with exquisite floral patterns.</p><p></p><p>Through the curtain, the gentle breeze brings a refreshing fragrance.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Long Ming, who had just returned, was sitting cross-legged on an unknown beast-skin throne.</p><p></p><p>His countenance was sacred and dazzling.</p><p></p><p>Boundless aura surrounded him, as if the sun, moon and stars followed him, and the dense power of the laws surged and filled the entire room.</p><p></p><p>"This little fellow, does he dare to make up stories about his ancestor? Let me give him a reward."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure in the dark robe on the throne, Dragon Roar, opened his eyes. With a light flick of his fingers, a beam of light shot out and flew towards the younger generation who had just said he wanted to take a wife.</p><p></p><p>This was a fantasy realm he had casually woven, where he would have to marry ten thousand ugly women to break through the illusion. That should be enough to train that little one for a while!</p><p></p><p>Hmph, the old ancestor is so stingy! In the side palace of the imperial palace, a group of people in sacrificial robes were making the final preparations.</p><p></p><p>The preparations for the celebration were progressing smoothly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the 530th Emperor of the Empire, Dragon Bo, was sitting on the imperial throne, listening to the reports.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the time has come, and the Venerable Ancestor has also returned."</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, please follow me to invite the Venerable Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>With that, Dragon Bo stood up and led the group out of the Yellow Palace. The large group soon arrived at Dragon Roar's resting place.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Venerable Ancestor!"</p><p>"Greetings to the Venerable Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar, who was resting with his eyes closed in the room, heard the calls outside and opened his eyes, instantly appearing before the group.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the leading emperor, he nodded, "Mm, the grandson of Dragon Battle, the peak of the Domain Master, not bad."</p><p></p><p>Receiving the praise from the Venerable Ancestor, Dragon Bo's somewhat simple face broke into a wide smile, revealing his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The rest were also greatly excited, gazing at the majestic figure of the Venerable Ancestor. Even though they were the high-ranking officials of the Empire, many had never seen the Venerable Ancestor in person.</p><p></p><p>After all, not everyone is qualified to listen to the Venerable Ancestor's teachings.</p><p></p><p>Now that they saw him, the fervent admiration in their eyes was hard to conceal.</p><p></p><p>There was only one thought left in their hearts: to die without regrets!</p><p></p><p>Only those who were part of the Empire's high-ranking officials knew that the main purpose of this celebration was not the Venerable Ancestor's thousand-year birthday, but to celebrate his ascension to the Immortal Realm and his becoming an eternal powerful being.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the excitement in their hearts, Dragon Bo stepped forward and led the group to take flight.</p><p></p><p>In no time, they arrived at the official venue of the celebration - the Great Plain of the Nine Provinces.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready, and at Dragon Roar's nod, the celebration officially began.</p><p></p><p>"By the grace of the Venerable Ancestor, the Imperial Dragon Awakening Cultivation Hall is established, open to all in the Empire. Whoever can cultivate a genius to join the Cultivation Hall will be rewarded with a bottle of Purple Crystal Jade Liquid."</p><p></p><p>As Dragon Bo uttered the last sentence, the entire Empire erupted in excitement.</p><p></p><p>All the young people were eager to try. Previously, the Imperial Dragon Ascension Cultivation Hall, Jade Dragon Cultivation Hall, and Sun and Moon Cultivation Hall were known as the three great cultivation halls of the Empire, continuously cultivating countless talents. The citizens of the Empire were scrambling to get in.</p><p></p><p>Now with the establishment of the Dragon Awakening Cultivation Hall, it meant more opportunities, how could they not be excited.</p><p></p><p>Many of the powerful families were also eager, as the reward of a bottle of Purple Crystal Jade Liquid was enticing. Just a single drop could help a Universe-level cultivator advance to the Domain Master-level.</p><p></p><p>Crossing from the Universe-level to the Domain Master-level was not just a boost in strength, but also a tenfold increase in lifespan, from 10 Eras to 100 Eras.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if a family produced a Domain Master, they would also receive a reward from the Empire, at the very least a star system.</p><p></p><p>Wealth, power! At this moment, the eyes of countless family leaders were gleaming.</p><p></p><p>In the subsequent celebration, Dragon Roar also went on stage to deliver a few encouraging speeches, and then quickly returned to his resting room.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people continued to celebrate enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Dragon Roar leaned back on the cushion and started to examine the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, the chat group had reacted.</p><p></p><p>It was not that someone in the group had replied to him.</p><p></p><p>But the chat group had a new prompt.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Consume a certain amount of lifespan to activate the chat group function.]</p><p></p><p>"Huh!"</p><p></p><p>"Activate it then!"</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Consumed 100 years of the host's lifespan, chat group function loaded.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Consuming lifespan can invite group members, the invited group members are random.]</p><p></p><p>Looking at these two prompts, Dragon Roar was a bit speechless. Now, the group owners listed in the group member list, it seems they have been drained of their lifespan and died off.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar thought to himself, this chat group, is it also a conduit of light that strangles one generation after another.</p><p></p><p>Seventy-plus million people, and not a few have been strangled to death.</p><p></p><p>Rest in peace!</p><p></p><p>After some research, he found that the chat group had also added some new functions, but these functions could only be activated if there were group members.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar casually cleared the group member list.</p><p></p><p>After the group members died, the chat group could no longer connect to their worlds, so keeping them was useless.</p><p></p><p>If this broken chat group had been activated earlier, luring people to consume their lifespan, he might have had some trouble with it. But now... consuming lifespan, what he fears the least is consuming lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar pressed the button to pull in group members on the chat group interface.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Consumed 100,000 years of lifespan, searching for qualified group members.]</p><p></p><p>[Search successful.]</p><p></p><p>[The Supremely Ejaculating Master has joined the Eternal Chat Group.]</p><p>[You Already Have the Way to Die has joined the Eternal Chat Group.]</p><p>[The Mightiest Fifth Young Lady has joined the Eternal Chat Group.]</p><p>[The Known Most Divine Loser has joined the Eternal Chat Group.]</p><p></p><p>Consuming 100,000 lifespan, he pulled in four group members at once, not bad.</p><p></p><p>It's just that looking at the nicknames, he's not sure who they are.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully, they are some useful people. Without caring about the people who had joined the group, Dragon Roar started to explore the functions of the chat group.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

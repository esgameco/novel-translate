        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan has been feeling very annoyed lately.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he reincarnated and revealed some of his cultivation abilities by the shores of Yan Gui Lake, there have been constant buzzing flies around him.</p><p></p><p>It has made him extremely exasperated. </p><p></p><p>If his cultivation had recovered more, and if he didn't have to worry about those "airplanes and cannons", he would have swatted all those annoying flies a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>Being so cautious and looking over his shoulder really goes against his style as the Immortal Lord Beixuan. Just thinking about it makes him uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Now, whenever he swats one, several more come flying in. It really proves the old saying that to kill a snake, you have to strike at its vital spot - only a decisive blow can finish it off.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan paid no heed to the little tail following him, and soon arrived at the library of Jinling University.</p><p></p><p>After signing in, he headed straight for the classical mythology section.</p><p></p><p>Although he had watched the movie "Painted Skin" in his previous life, it was too long ago, and now he only knew the title, not the content.</p><p></p><p>He came to the library hoping to find books to review the details, and also see if there were any records of the cultivation methods in that other world.</p><p></p><p>As he carefully scanned the bookshelves, his little tail was also pretending to look for books not too far away.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Chen Beixuan found three different editions of "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" on the shelves, published in different years.</p><p></p><p>He quickly flipped through the chapters about fox spirits.</p><p></p><p>A few minutes later, he had finished reading all the relevant passages.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan did not find any cultivation methods in the books, but he was not disappointed, as he had already prepared himself for this.</p><p></p><p>The fact that these books could record some people and events was already quite good - how could they possibly also record cultivation techniques?</p><p></p><p>He put the three "Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio" books back on the shelf and turned to leave the library.</p><p></p><p>His purpose for this trip had been accomplished, so there was no need to linger in this musty library any longer.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Chen Beixuan returned to the classroom, he saw Wang Sheng chatting in the group.</p><p></p><p>What a coincidence - he had just finished reading the short story about the fox spirit related to Wang Sheng, and the impression was still quite vivid.</p><p></p><p>That story told of the beautiful fox spirit Xiao Wei, who fell for Wang Sheng at first sight. She disguised herself as his sister to follow him home, then grew jealous of Wang Sheng's deep affection for his wife Pei Rong, and plotted to replace her.</p><p></p><p>To maintain her human form in front of Wang Sheng, she had even driven away the lizard spirit stalker and killed people daily, causing unrest throughout the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan snapped out of his thoughts and looked at the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng: "Humbly requesting the group owner and all admins to provide me with that fantasy work about me."</p><p></p><p>He then went on to describe his situation, which was largely the same as the short story Chen Beixuan had just read.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed Chen Beixuan to know the timeline of events on Wang Sheng's side.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "@Wang Sheng, I have already uploaded the fantasy work about you."</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng: "Many thanks, esteemed group admin."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan had recreated and uploaded the short story he had just read from his memory, setting it so that only Wang Sheng could view it.</p><p></p><p>Since he could upload it from his memory, he wondered why he had previously uploaded the physical book, which he had borrowed from someone else...</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "I'd like to come over to your side later, if you don't mind. I just want to take a look at the cultivation methods in your world. If you can't deal with that fox spirit, I can help take care of it for you."</p><p></p><p>The usually silent lurker had unexpectedly explained so much.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seems he was feeling particularly benevolent today.</p><p></p><p>When Wang Sheng first saw that Chen Beixuan had uploaded "The Painted Skin", he jumped up excitedly. Then he read Chen Beixuan's subsequent message.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng was unsure at first, so he quickly told his wife Peirong about the content.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Peirong simply thought about it for a moment, her beautiful brows relaxing. She told Wang Sheng to agree to it.</p><p></p><p>Originally, she had planned to secretly seek out her wandering elder brother Pang Yong, after her husband Wang Sheng obtained the fantasy work about them, to confirm who the fox spirit was, and ask him to help exorcise the demon.</p><p></p><p>But now it seems that won't be necessary. She didn't expect someone from her husband's group would come and say they could help resolve the trouble, which is the best outcome, so of course she agreed to it.</p><p></p><p>They surely wouldn't be afraid of that person coming to rob them, as they don't seem to have anything worth stealing.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng: "Welcome, esteemed administrator! I will personally sweep the mat to welcome you!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Mm, thank you. But no need to call me 'esteemed administrator', just call me by my name, Chen Beixuan."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "I won't take advantage of you either. I'll give you a little trinket that can withstand several attacks from that fox spirit. I'll come to your place after I've dealt with the matter."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan didn't wait for Wang Sheng's response, and directly sent over two jade amulets. These had protective formations he had engraved on them, which could generally withstand five or six attacks, as long as the opponent's strength didn't greatly exceed his own.</p><p></p><p>He still had some things to attend to, so he would go to the Painted Skin world later. Because he had been disturbed by a few flies.</p><p></p><p>He decided to swat those flies first before anything else.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan stood up and walked out of the classroom, his eyes gleaming with killing intent, heading straight for the school gate where the flies were outside in an alley.</p><p></p><p>In the Painted Skin world...</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng received Chen Beixuan's gift, his face full of delight. With this treasure, he and his wife's lives would be temporarily secure.</p><p></p><p>The couple hid the jade amulets on their persons, then Wang Sheng and Peirong bowed towards the chat group window where Chen Beixuan's name was, to express their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Wang Sheng also posted a message of thanks in the group.</p><p></p><p>After expressing their thanks, Wang Sheng spread out the book in his hands, and Peirong brought over a candle from the table.</p><p></p><p>With one person holding the light and the other reading, it didn't take long for Wang Sheng to finish the book. His face turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wang Sheng's expression, Peirong quickly took the book and started reading.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Peirong also finished reading the book, and she breathed a sigh of relief. Her previous guess was correct - the good sister Xiaowu that her husband had rescued was actually the fox spirit, the one who would entangle herself with her husband.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had different feelings after reading "The Painted Skin".</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng felt terrified. He never imagined that the one he rescued was actually a heart-devouring fox spirit, and that she would ultimately sacrifice herself to revive him and Peirong.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Wang Sheng was at a loss for words. The root cause of everything stemmed from him. Of the myriad words in the world, only the word "love" is the most hurtful. This saying is indeed true. If he had never encountered her in the Western Regions, would all these subsequent events have happened?</p><p></p><p>As for Peirong, after reading "The Painted Skin", she had a different view from her husband. This fox spirit was originally a demonic creature that killed and ate people. The only difference was that after her husband brought her back to the capital city of Jiangdu, the place where she killed people became within Jiangdu itself.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the day, this fox spirit was simply an evil demonic being!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter complete)</p>

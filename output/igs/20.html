        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No, this is my wife's property."</p><p></p><p>Tony Shit-Head released a huge fart into the air and flashed an OK sign at the people of the motherland.</p><p></p><p>"You guys help me stop that annoying Victor, his magic show is really irritating."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he activated his armor and rushed towards the roaring dragon by the seaside.</p><p></p><p>The short distance of just over ten meters also produced strong sound waves, as if he wanted to snatch it by sheer speed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Roaring Dragon wouldn't let Tony Shit-Head succeed. With a light breath, a demonic wind blew up at the spot where he stood.</p><p></p><p>The rushing Tony Shit-Head just happened to run into this wind, and the strong wind blew his flight path more than a meter off course, which was just enough for him to barely brush past the Roaring Dragon.</p><p></p><p>As for the sudden strong wind, Tony Shit-Head didn't think much of it, thinking it was just the strong sea breeze.</p><p></p><p>Under the inertia trend, he flew over a hundred meters away.</p><p></p><p>He circled a large arc on the sea surface, accelerated, and charged towards the Roaring Dragon's position again.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the accelerating Tony Shit-Head, the Roaring Dragon suddenly thought of a fun idea.</p><p></p><p>He raised both hands in a surrendering gesture.</p><p></p><p>The accelerating Tony Shit-Head saw the Roaring Dragon's action and was overjoyed, "Hmph, pigs are just pigs, they surrender after just one charge? If I deploy my armor legion, you'd be so scared you'd piss your pants."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt as refreshed as eating a big cheese burger.</p><p></p><p>Commanding the armor, he flew quickly to the front of the Roaring Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the super weapon about to be his, his eyes revealed an eager expression, "Quick, quick give it to me! I'll agree to whatever you want!"</p><p></p><p>The Roaring Dragon smiled at Tony Shit-Head, his left hand lifting the weapon, then with a twist of divine power, he dyed two identical weapons from the World Ring, and then took them out.</p><p></p><p>Holding three weapons in both hands, "Iron Man, do you want this ordinary weapon, or this golden weapon, or this diamond weapon?"</p><p></p><p>"The three, the three, I want all three!" Tony Shit-Head shouted hoarsely, his eyes red.</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, you can only choose one weapon."</p><p></p><p>The Roaring Dragon still had the same expression, but his smile now had a tinge of mockery.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Doctor Doom was initially anxious when he saw the Roaring Dragon raise his hands, thinking he was going to surrender. He was very worried that if the evil Avengers got that super weapon, he might really have to meet his end here.</p><p></p><p>But his anxiety was useless, as he was firmly blocked by the three members of the Motherland's Captain.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the Roaring Dragon's actions, he understood that he was just toying with Iron Man.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Tony Shit-Head's embarrassed and frustrated expression, Doctor Doom couldn't help but laugh out loud.</p><p></p><p>The Motherland's Captain also quickly shouted, as bystanders, they could see clearly that the despicable guy was deliberately tormenting Tony.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Doctor Doom's laughter, Tony Shit-Head, without the Motherland's Captain's reminder, realized what was happening.</p><p></p><p>Furious, he reached out to forcibly grab the three weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Roaring Dragon wouldn't let him succeed, jumping back several meters, and at the same time, he retracted the golden and diamond weapons back into the World Ring.</p><p></p><p>"Pig, you're courting death." Seeing the Roaring Dragon's actions, Tony Shit-Head finally understood that this despicable guy had been toying with him from the beginning to the end.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary person can jump a few meters away with just a light jump, this pig must be a super soldier like the Motherland's Captain, injected with the serum.</p><p></p><p>"Jarvis, summon all the armors to me!" Tony Shit-Head gritted his teeth and issued the order sternly.</p><p></p><p>Super soldier, huh? Today, he not only wants the super weapon, but also the corpse of this pig.</p><p></p><p>The weapon can be disassembled and reverse-engineered, then sold to war profiteers, and the corpse can be used to research the super soldier serum.</p><p></p><p>The pig's bones can be made into specimens!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Rows of Iron Man-style battle suits descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>They quickly surrounded the Dragon Roar group in multiple layers.</p><p></p><p>"You damned bastard, you think you can still escape from me, the great me?" </p><p></p><p>"I'll give you one more chance - hand over your weapons, and I might mercifully let you live."</p><p></p><p>A loud, arrogant voice came from the battle suit squadron - it was Tony Shit-head.</p><p></p><p>But Dragon Roar below didn't even acknowledge Tony's taunts, as he was currently in the water.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "@Everyone, I'm giving out some gifts."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Here are some Iron Man battle suit pics, take your pick."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Generous group leader, I'll take three red ones."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Toys, huh? Group leader, I'd like a platinum one."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Thank you group leader, I'll take a gold and red one."</p><p></p><p>Machines and battle suits are like toys for men. Even the scholarly Chen Beixuan couldn't resist picking one.</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "I don't want one."</p><p></p><p>Thanos just felt these battle suits clashed with him, he disliked them.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, are you deaf?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Dragon Roar ignore him, Tony Shit-head didn't have many words this time, as he already felt assured of victory.</p><p></p><p>Tony Shit-head wasn't in a hurry, but it was Doctor Doom who grew anxious.</p><p></p><p>His only thought was to not let the evil Avengers get those weapons.</p><p></p><p>He kept trying to forcefully break through the blockade of Captain America and the others.</p><p></p><p>Especially that shrinking and growing Ant-Man, he was so annoying - Doom was almost able to break the encirclement several times, only to be obstructed by Ant-Man's attacks.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to yell at Dragon Roar to escape, but seeing the countless battle suits, he felt powerless.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the fighting on both sides, there was one person everyone seemed to have forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Thanos, who was still lounging in a chair, leisurely sipping his drink. Because of Dragon Roar's illusion, the people present didn't realize Thanos was an alien.</p><p></p><p>To them, Thanos was just a harmless weakling, so they all subconsciously ignored his existence.</p><p></p><p>"Boss, another Mark 50 battle suit has gone offline."</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Tony Shit-head kept hearing Jarvis report battle suits disappearing, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>So far, 10 battle suits had mysteriously gone offline and vanished. Earlier he thought he was seeing things when one suddenly disappeared, but now Jarvis kept alerting him about suits going offline.</p><p></p><p>He was certain it wasn't his eyes playing tricks - this problem had to be caused by that swine below.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't wait any longer, Tony Shit-head was afraid that if he delayed further, his entire battle suit army would disappear. He immediately ordered Jarvis to attack.</p><p></p><p>But before Jarvis could control the suits to attack, he saw Dragon Roar move within the encirclement.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's expression was blank as he uttered two words: "Annihilation!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, the battle suits surrounding him scattered like ashes in the wind, as if snapped away.</p><p></p><p>Witnessing this, the panicked Tony Shit-head realized that guy was a monster - first the suits disappeared for no reason, and now they turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>He had to flee, get far away from this monster.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Tony Shit-head piloted his suit to fly higher.</p><p></p><p>But since all the other suits had turned to ash, his own couldn't be an exception.</p><p></p><p>Ah~ Amid a series of terrified screams, </p><p>Tony Shit-head fell from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Thud~ Tony Shit-head finally landed head-first on the beach, becoming the newest beach casualty.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

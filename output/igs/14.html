        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Uuru Metal Great Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun was delighted to hear this, it was a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Thanos introduced his weapons, he said that this type of metal was used to forge them. According to him, this metal possesses considerable energy and can be imbued with magic. Weapons made with it can be in sync with the user's mind and can even self-repair.</p><p></p><p>Along with vibranium, Adamantium, and Carbonadium, they are known as the four great Marvel metals.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun couldn't imbue it with magic, but the function of being in sync with the user's mind was great, plus the self-repair ability - it was a truly formidable weapon.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he ventured into the secret realm of the Bowing Dragon Tower, his strength has been steadily increasing. His previous Void Greatsword was no longer suitable, it felt light and flimsy in his hands now.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he had advanced from a planetary level to a stellar level, so it was time to change his weapon. The Void Greatsword awakened with the power of the Divine River was just a semi-finished product. In his recent battles with the Heavenly Scum, if he hadn't been careful, the Void Greatsword would have been damaged.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "I'll just go get it, I wouldn't dare let Brother Thanos spend money."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun had cleared the 15th floor of the Bowing Dragon Tower, and after purchasing a batch of standard equipment, he still had a lot of points left.</p><p></p><p>1,000 points for a Crossing Token, he could afford that.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Xiaolun, I'll go to the Marvel world with you."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming's words surprised both Ge Xiaolun and Thanos. Over the past year, the three of them had been frequently exchanging items. Buying a Crossing Token for 1,000 points to go to a friend's world, exchange items, and then return - this was a way to bypass the group's transaction fees.</p><p></p><p>After all, directly trading in the chat group would incur service charges.</p><p></p><p>This time, the group leader wanted to go to the Marvel world, the two were curious about his purpose.</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "I eagerly await the arrival of the group leader!"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Group leader, you're going to Marvel? Come to think of it, I'm the only one in the group who hasn't met the group leader in person, this time is a coincidence."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Big shot, what are you going to do in the Marvel world this time?"</p><p></p><p>Driven by curiosity, Ge Xiaolun couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Oh, I'm going to see Thanos."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "@Thanos, I'll borrow your Infinity Stones to study them a bit, don't worry, it won't affect your snap."</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "No problem."</p><p></p><p>Thanos readily agreed. Seeing the group leader in person would allow him to learn from him again. </p><p></p><p>A year ago in the training arena, although the group leader only guided him for a dozen minutes, those precious minutes helped him find his future path and no longer rely on the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>A true teaching is worth more than a thousand books, as the saying goes.</p><p></p><p>After a year of arduous cultivation and exploring secret realms for treasures, his strength had progressed at an astonishing speed.</p><p></p><p>With his current power, he was confident that he could personally wipe out half the life in the universe. This was also the reason he had not continued searching for the Infinity Stones this past year.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the group leader mentioned the snap.</p><p></p><p>Gathering all six Infinity Stones, a single snap should be able to erase half of all life, huh. </p><p></p><p>This method was brilliant, perfectly aligning with his previous ideas.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he must collect all six Infinity Stones first, doing it himself would be too slow, too slow.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Thanos said in the group that he would go prepare, then his avatar went offline.</p><p></p><p>On the Sanctuary II spaceship, Thanos closed the chat group interface and suddenly stood up, his battle armor rustling.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Black Order who had returned empty-handed half a year ago, he issued an order, "Corvus Glaive, you and Superstar go to Midgard one more time, bring back the last two Infinity Stones. This time, you are only allowed to succeed, no failures allowed."</p><p></p><p>"Understood?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Understood," the ebony-throated Ebony Throat and the super-giant replied in a loud voice as they knelt on one knee.</p><p></p><p>The last time they were sent by Thanos to the blue planet to seize the Infinity Stones, they encountered variables midway, and the spatial gate used for teleportation was destroyed, causing them to return empty-handed. This time, they must go again to wipe out the humiliation and bring the last Infinity Stone back to their master.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, Ebony Throat, give him the Reality Stone, and Super-Giant, you take the Soul Stone. Go quickly and come back," Thanos nodded in satisfaction, then plucked two stones from the Infinity Gauntlet and tossed them to the two men, waving them off without further ado.</p><p></p><p>The Black Order's Ebony Throat and Super-Giant were both sorcerers, masters of mind control and telepathy. With two Infinity Stones in hand, they should be able to easily obtain the other two stones.</p><p></p><p>After Ebony Throat and Super-Giant withdrew, Thanos turned to the other three, "General Corvus Glaive, Proxima Midnight, and Black Dwarf, you lead the troops to find a better environment planet, liberate it, and then decorate the planet, I'm going to entertain a guest."</p><p></p><p>"You have one day to get this done."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the order, the Black Trio withdrew from the palace together.</p><p></p><p>Thanos had previously exited the chat group, and according to the time flow on his side, by the time the group leader and Ge Xiaolun arrive, the timing should be just about right.</p><p></p><p>After arranging everything, Thanos returned to his seat and began to cultivate with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>In the chat group:</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Xiaolun, how's the situation on your side?"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "How do you think it is? I'm fighting back and forth with that Huaye."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "That guy's black hole engine is too restrictive for me, or rather, it's restrictive for the entire Supernormal Academy. I can't exert my power, let alone feel frustrated."</p><p></p><p>Since Ge Xiaolun had stabilized at the "stellar level", he could suppress Huaye, but every time at the critical moment, he would be constrained by Huaye's black hole engine and unable to kill him. Moreover, Huaye had no spirit of a strong man, he was slippery, and specialized in ambushes.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun was getting angrier and angrier, cursing Huaye's shamelessness.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Well, now that I'm holding the fort, let's just treat it as training."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Xiaolun, you'd better hurry up and improve your own strength. Strength is the real way."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "If your strength reaches another level, you can definitely crush that Huaye."</p><p></p><p>Adhering to the principle of mutual assistance among group members, Han Xiao and Thanos had proposed to help Ge Xiaolun deal with Huaye more than once, but each time they were politely refused by Ge Xiaolun.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun had once said in front of the Angel King that the affairs of the blue planet should be solved by the people of the blue planet themselves.</p><p></p><p>As the chief deity of the blue planet, Ge Xiaolun was quite responsible. He was thinking not only for himself, but also for his comrades-in-arms. </p><p></p><p>He was holding the fort in the front, and letting the entire blue planet use Fengdu to train, which was the best solution he could think of for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, relying on group friends to solve a problem is easy once, but what about the next time? Do you treat your group friends as nannies? Self-reliance is the real way.</p><p></p><p>He had also been working hard to improve himself. Among the few people in the group, Ge Xiaolun was the most diligent, and he would go challenge the time cooldown almost every time.</p><p></p><p>But alas, upgrading in his world is too difficult. He is now a fourth-generation divine body, and to upgrade to the fifth generation, the required resources are simply massive.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he has the chat group, otherwise he wouldn't even have the chance to upgrade to the fifth generation.</p><p></p><p>However, relying on the chat group's commercial center and trading with Han Xiao and Thanos, he is about to have enough materials for the upgrade.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Ge Xiaolun secretly made up his mind that after the upgrade, he must be the first to eliminate that parasitic thing Huaye!</p><p></p><p>Just like in fantasy works, to stuff that parasite into a kitten's body, and then give it a sterilization.</p><p></p><p>Perfect.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared on the deck of the spacecraft, and the guards around immediately raised their guns.</p><p></p><p>After recognizing the person,</p><p></p><p>the guards all tensed up, quickly putting down their weapons and bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>They did not speak, stepping back a few paces, quietly waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, you have returned."</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, I have completed my trip to the Marvel Universe, and I will be returning soon."</p><p></p><p>After receiving the notification from his subordinates, Thanos and Death immediately came to the deck.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Longming, the couple greeted each other with a bow.</p><p></p><p>Longming nodded, tossing the six Infinity Stones to Thanos, then said he was preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>He had been in the Marvel Universe for about three months, and the purpose of the Infinity Stones had been in vain.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that he did not expect the fundamental laws of the Infinity Stones to have no reference value for his impending ascension to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>But fortunately, there were other gains, as he had obtained a pocket universe, otherwise this trip to Marvel would have been a loss.</p><p></p><p>After all, if he wanted to continue staying in his friends' world for more than three days, he would need to consume points, 1000 points per day.</p><p></p><p>Calculating it, he had already been deducted tens of thousands of points by the chat group for the upcoming experiments.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll head back first."</p><p></p><p>Longming refused Thanos' invitation to a banquet, and clicked the return button on the chat group.</p><p></p><p>A portal appeared.</p><p></p><p>Amid the respectful send-off, Longming stepped through the portal, returning to his own world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before that, he had consulted the chat group, and he was able to bring the pocket universe back with him.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't, then he would have truly suffered a huge loss. - Moqiu Starry Dragon Whisper Pavilion</p><p></p><p>Longming's figure appeared in the rest room.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense swept across the room, hmm, no changes.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he recalled the clone he had left behind before traversing the Marvel world.</p><p></p><p>"The time passed is not much, it's fine." After receiving the clone's information, Longming murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Chat group, when traversing other worlds, how is the time flow calculated between the two sides?"</p><p></p><p>[Ding! When using the Traversal Token to cross worlds, the time in this world and the traversed world will be synchronized.]</p><p></p><p>I see, no wonder it was about three months on the Marvel side, and also about three months here.</p><p></p><p>Longming was dumbfounded, a bug in the time synchronization system?</p><p></p><p>If the time is synchronized when traversing both worlds, then doesn't that mean he can exploit the bug? As long as he finds an area with a very fast time flow, and then traverses to other worlds, even though the current group members' worlds are not high-level, but if big shots join the group in the future, he can go over there and have a great time.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to know Longming's thoughts, the chat group popped up another message.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Error detected.]</p><p>[Correcting]</p><p>[Correction complete.]</p><p>[Ding! After correction, when using the Traversal Token, time synchronization between the two worlds only applies to worlds of the same level.]</p><p>[For different worlds, the time flow will be calculated based on the level difference between the group members' worlds.]</p><p></p><p>Damn, Longming cursed inwardly, the trick he just thought of was immediately blocked.</p><p></p><p>It's just like playing a game, he had just contacted an external cheating provider and was about to place an order, but his game account was already banned.</p><p></p><p>After complaining for a while, Longming set the chat group's time flow ratio to 1:5000.</p><p></p><p>Then he closed the chat group and no longer paid attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Because he had more important things to do next.</p><p></p><p>"Little Five, go to the Imperial Palace and summon all the high-level officials of the Empire to the Juntian Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Little Six, you do the same, go notify all the elders who are not on guard duty to come over."</p><p></p><p>Longming's divine sense moved, calling in the twin brothers who were on standby outside the pavilion, then quietly issued the orders.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Juntiandian Hall is the most sacred place in the Empire, known as the Holy Juntiandian Temple by the people of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the Juntiandian Hall is the place where he conducts his daily cultivation, which can be considered his own cultivation ground.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Juntiandian Hall, there are two other cultivation grounds, namely the Quantiangong Palace and the Shutianyin Institute, collectively known as the Three Heavenly Palaces.</p><p></p><p>As for why he is now staying at the Longying Water Pavilion, of course it is because he has not moved since he came here during the celebration of his one hundred million year birthday.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Holy Master's order, he immediately took his leave and went to execute the order.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, the two had an excited look on their faces, in their understanding, whenever the Holy Master summoned the high-level officials to the Holy Juntiandian Temple, there would be new policies announced and implemented.</p><p></p><p>This time, not only the high-level officials of the Empire, but also the Elders will be present, it must be a major announcement.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, whenever there is an important matter to be announced, Longming would choose to summon the high-level officials and Elders of the Empire to the Juntiandian Hall.</p><p></p><p>What he is going to announce this time is the matter of the pocket universe, which he has implemented ahead of time, so that the Empire can select talents earlier.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he had previously announced the establishment of the Empire's fourth cultivation ground during his one hundred million year birthday, which would perfectly connect the four cultivation grounds to the pocket universe.</p><p></p><p>And after completing the pocket universe, he will go into seclusion, not knowing if it is because he observed the Time Stone in the Marvel Universe, the inner world is advancing so fast that he can no longer suppress it.</p><p></p><p>After instructing the two subordinates, Longming took out the pocket universe.</p><p></p><p>Next, he will refine it while the high-level officials and Elders of the Empire are on their way.</p><p></p><p>The pocket universe is a small-scale universe, with complete laws, but not at a high level, at most it can provide ordinary universe-level comprehension.</p><p></p><p>What he needs to do now is to completely refine it, and then fill it with his own law comprehension.</p><p></p><p>With his unparalleled law comprehension, it will be enough for all the geniuses of the Empire to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Although he has not fully comprehended the three lower-level laws of thunder, light, and storm, it is still sufficient for the little ones to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Time flies, fifty years pass in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Juntiandian Holy Temple.</p><p></p><p>A group of high-level officials and Elders of the Empire gathered together.</p><p></p><p>The territory of the Empire is vast, spanning hundreds of billions of light-years, and the people have few opportunities to gather together. Now that the Holy Master has summoned them, they are gathered in groups, chatting and catching up.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, do you know what the Holy Master is going to announce this time?"</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the holy temple, a group of people in shiny silver armor surrounded an old man with white hair and beard, asking about the purpose of this gathering.</p><p></p><p>They are the newly promoted high-level officials of the Empire, judging from their armor, they are legion commanders, as this is their first time attending the Holy Master's summoned meeting.</p><p></p><p>So they are full of doubts, that's why they surrounded the old man to inquire about the situation.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, the Holy Master's actions are hard to guess, we'll just have to wait and see."</p><p></p><p>"They are all at the level of great generals, yet they are still so impatient, what kind of behavior is this!"</p><p></p><p>The wrinkles on the old man's forehead quivered slightly as he spoke, the deep wrinkles carved on his face were clear and rugged; his eyes were as bright as stars, deep and calm, deeply engraved with the old man's past and vicissitudes.</p><p></p><p>The group of generals in front of the old man were like grandchildren, bowing their heads obediently, not daring to refute.</p><p></p><p>Literally not daring to refute, because if they offend the Grand Elder, he would beat them, and he doesn't hold back. The reason the old man dares to do this is of course because he has an extraordinary identity, otherwise the group of soldiers would not be so submissive to him.</p><p></p><p>In addition to his identity as the Grand Elder, he is also one of the earliest followers of Longming, and the first Prime Minister of the Day and Night Empire.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Realm Lord level, he has made countless meritorious contributions to the Empire, and Longming's ability to lead the army and conquer the four corners of the world is inseparable from the support of this man in the rear.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that he is Longming's left and right arm.</p><p></p><p>This time, he really doesn't know what the Holy Master is going to announce, and he didn't even need to attend this meeting.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his white-haired appearance, one can tell that he doesn't have much time left.</p><p></p><p>He thought that he would take this opportunity to have a final look at the future of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

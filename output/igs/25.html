        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was so afraid of being suddenly attacked.</p><p></p><p>Weak, pitiful, helpless, shivering.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh~ It's really true that what you fear comes to you. A slashing strike descended from the sky, moving at an extremely fast speed. Doom only felt a blur in his eyes as the strike landed not far from him on the beach, creating a long and narrow crack in the originally flat sand. The high temperature brought by the strike even melted the surrounding sand.</p><p></p><p>This time, Doom was truly frightened. He moved his small shuffling steps to get closer to Longming, as if getting closer to him could guarantee safety.</p><p></p><p>Longming saw how cowardly Doom was and didn't say anything. After all, it was he who had asked the other to come over, so let him get closer if he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the still unconscious Thanos lying on the ground, Thanos had been knocked out by Ultron and still hadn't regained consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Longming saw Thanos lying on the ground like this was not a good solution, so he reached out his hand and tossed Thanos onto a nearby lounge chair, casually also throwing an illusion at him.</p><p></p><p>Let him repeat the previous battle experience, and only when he could persist for a period of time would he be able to break out of the illusion.</p><p></p><p>On the lounge chair, Longming looked at his own hand, lost in thought. It seemed that he had been particularly fond of throwing illusions at people in recent years. The nearby ones were the illusions he had thrown at Thanos and Ultron, and the more distant one was the one he had thrown at the younger generation a thousand years ago during the imperial celebration.</p><p></p><p>But it has to be said that throwing illusions is really too much fun.</p><p></p><p>He made a silent decision in his heart that he would do it again next time! Although Longming was not an illusion-type cultivator, his overwhelming divine sense and will were enough for him to easily set up illusions.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those with a lower realm than him, it was a sure-fire deal. They couldn't break out of the illusion no matter how hard they tried.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ Longming caught the Observer who was punched away by Ultron in the void, and then threw him back, just to catch him so that he wouldn't damage the parasol.</p><p></p><p>This Ultron had such keen insight, although it hadn't discovered the whereabouts of Longming and the others.</p><p></p><p>But the clean and tidy beach still aroused its suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ultron's battle with the Observer had turned the surrounding small islands into ruins, while the beach remained unchanged. This couldn't help but make Ultron suspicious.</p><p></p><p>This time it had blasted the Observer towards the beach, just to probe and see if there was any secret.</p><p></p><p>Longming admitted that he had made a mistake this time. He used his divine power to instantly restrain Ultron, and then threw another illusion at it, making it no longer pay attention to the beach side. As for the Observer, it seemed to have followed in Thanos' footsteps and passed out in the sand pit.</p><p></p><p>Longming glanced at the Observer, thinking that it seemed a bit inhumane to just leave him there. So he reached out with his divine sense and pulled him over, throwing an illusion at him as well.</p><p></p><p>Let him stay in the illusion for a while.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Longming frowned slightly. The data still hadn't been collected enough, and there was no one else on the scene who could fight Ultron.</p><p></p><p>What to do? Should he strengthen Doom a bit and let him go?</p><p></p><p>Doom was terrified by Longming's gaze, as if a great terror was about to descend upon him. He didn't dare to make eye contact with Longming, quickly turning his face away and shifting his eyes up, down, left and right, silently praying that Longming wouldn't see him.</p><p></p><p>When Longming's gaze moved away, he let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"In this universe, besides death, who else can fight Ultron?" Longming stroked his chin, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Death, life, ah yes, that group of things, the eternal subordinates, the divine group that specializes in creating life."</p><p></p><p>Enlightened, Longming thought of the next opponents he could use against Ultron, and not just one.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, that divine group currently had one of their own at his feet, though it was still just a baby.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Long Ming spread out his divine sense and began to search for strong men.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before he found one.</p><p></p><p>"It's you!"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming reached out and directly grabbed the celestial being. Even during the process of being brought over, he also slimmed down this celestial being member, shrinking them to about the same size as Ultron.</p><p></p><p>He left a divine thought in their mind, briefly explaining the situation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly being grabbed and slimmed down, the "Six Tubes" of the celestial being group was initially quite alarmed, but after receiving Long Ming's divine thought, he understood the reason behind it. Seeing the robot that had been restrained in front of him, Six Tubes could only accept his fate of being forced to work.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't expect that as a member of the celestial being group, he would actually have a day where he was forced to do something.</p><p></p><p>Six Tubes sighed, took out his weapon, and prepared himself.</p><p></p><p>He now just hopes that the great deity who brought him here won't give him a hard time after this is over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Six Tubes so cooperative, Long Ming nodded in satisfaction, and then released Ultron's restraints.</p><p></p><p>Ultron woke up, his eyes flashing with a hint of confusion, but soon fell into the illusion woven by Long Ming.</p><p></p><p>"What a strange fellow, are you here to die again? Killing you will mean no one can stop me." These words slipped out of Ultron's mouth, and it even startled itself a bit.</p><p></p><p>Ultron tapped its mechanical arm against its head, suspecting it had been infected with a virus.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough self-check, no problems were found.</p><p></p><p>Ultron didn't care about that anymore, it just wanted to kill the strange fellow in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Picking up its weapon, it started attacking. —— Croak~ Six Tubes successfully fainted in front of Long Ming.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming was covered in black lines, is the celestial being group really this weak? It hasn't even been half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Knocked out in less than half an hour, damn.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and slapped Six Tubes, sending him to the observer's side, also enveloping him in an illusion.</p><p></p><p>With such poor strength, might as well practice in the illusion!</p><p></p><p>Then he turned around and restrained the charging Ultron.</p><p></p><p>If Ultron still had its wits about it, it probably would have cursed. Is this not playable? Long Ming didn't care about Ultron, his divine sense spreading out again.</p><p></p><p>What is he going to do?</p><p></p><p>Of course, continue to recruit more strong men. One Six Tubes is not enough, so let's get two.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two unlucky fellows entered Long Ming's line of sight, "Four Tubes" and "Eight Tubes".</p><p></p><p>Same operation, same procedure.</p><p></p><p>Across the vast expanse of the starry sky, he brought them over, slimmed them down and left a divine thought, then tossed them in front of Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Then he released Ultron.</p><p></p><p>The same plot, Ultron picked up its weapon and started attacking.</p><p></p><p>After about half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom~ Four Tubes and Eight Tubes, the two strong men, had gloriously fainted.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Long Ming's face had turned completely black, and he even resorted to the mental victory method, constantly comforting himself, "Just three Tubes, there are still other Tubes."</p><p></p><p>He slapped Four Tubes and Eight Tubes onto a plate, applied the same treatment, and tossed them into illusions.</p><p></p><p>Two are not enough, he felt it was time to bring in the big guns.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming's divine sense spread out again.</p><p></p><p>One Tube, Two Tube, Three Tube, Five Tube, Seven Tube, all the celestial being members within the reach of his divine sense were brought over.</p><p></p><p>Then it was a one-man show.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't believe that this time five Tubes couldn't defeat Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming was truly getting a bit carried away with this, these wave after wave of operations had a bit of a "Calabash Brothers Rescuing Grandpa" feel to it.</p><p></p><p>But Long Ming had also made up his mind that if this still didn't work, he would personally step in.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

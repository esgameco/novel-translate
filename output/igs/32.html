        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group that had been discussing just now suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that a figure had appeared on the throne at the very top of the Holy Temple.</p><p></p><p>This figure was naturally the Holy Sovereign of the Empire, Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Holy Sovereign, may the Holy Sovereign's lifespan be eternal!"</p><p></p><p>"En, be seated."</p><p></p><p>With Dragon Roar's words, the people in the grand hall one by one took their seats.</p><p></p><p>Since delegating power to the Imperial Emperor and fully immersing himself in seclusion, this was the first time Dragon Roar had convened the imperial high-level officials.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the more than 40,000 people seated, Dragon Roar nodded in satisfaction. These were all a part of the pillars of the Empire, the towering jade pillars, and there were many new faces among them that he had not seen in years.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad." Dragon Roar directly praised those new faces, not sparing any words of commendation.</p><p></p><p>He was able to know the names of these new faces because the current Imperial Emperor, Dragon Bo, had provided him with a personnel list beforehand. A simple sweep of his divine sense gave him a general understanding.</p><p></p><p>The affirmation from the Holy Sovereign caused the smiles to involuntarily rise on the faces of those below, especially those attending the Holy Temple conference for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Holy Sovereign, 45,600 people are present this time, all of them are from the tribes within a 5 billion light-year radius. The tribes from the remote regions who wanted to attend were rejected by me."</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Bo acted on his own initiative, please punish him, Holy Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>The current Imperial Emperor, Dragon Bo, stood up to report on the attendance.</p><p></p><p>"En, no matter. After I announce the matters for this session, you can notify them accordingly."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar did not blame Dragon Bo. For them to have crossed 5 billion light-years and arrived within 50 years was already no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the original universe, the highest speed was the speed of light. When a spacecraft's speed exceeds the speed of light, it will enter the Dark Universe, which has almost nothing, but the spatial ratio is 1:10.081 million times that of the original universe.</p><p></p><p>There is no speed limit in the Dark Universe. If you fly at the speed of light for a year in the Dark Universe, when you exit back into the original universe, you would have traveled a distance of 10.081 million light-years.</p><p></p><p>The Empire's current most advanced spacecraft is Dragon Roar's personal ship, the Moqi, which can reach 10 times the speed of light.</p><p></p><p>Even this spacecraft capable of 10 times the speed of light would still take several years to cross a distance of 5 billion light-years at full speed.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the imperial high-level officials' spacecraft that can only reach one or two times the speed of light - it would take them nearly 50 years to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's intention was to summon the people from the nearby star systems. After all, the remote frontier systems were too far away, and 50 years would not be enough time for them to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, why are you here as well? Didn't I tell you to rest?" Dragon Roar reproached the Grand Elder sitting beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Sovereign, rest can be taken at any time. I'm just here to take a look at the next generation of the Empire," Wu Yin replied cheerfully with kind eyes and a benevolent expression.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at Wu Yin's silvery white hair and the faint sense of exhaustion emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>He understood that his old comrade did not have much time left.</p><p></p><p>For this old subordinate and old friend Wu Yin, he cherished him greatly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it seems that his last "contemporary" is also about to be gone.</p><p></p><p>In fact, after breaking through to immortality, he had tried to bring Old Wu along to break through as well. But unfortunately, perhaps due to the injuries Wu Yin sustained in his youth that had damaged his foundation, no matter what methods Dragon Roar used, Wu Yin's body was like a bucket with a missing plank, leaky and unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin's path ahead was blocked, and the peak of the Realm Lord was his limit.</p><p></p><p>But if he could fill in that missing plank in the last hundred thousand years or so, perhaps he might still have a final chance.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar retracted his thoughts, not saying anything more.</p><p></p><p>Turning his gaze to the crowd in the grand hall, thinking of the uses of the Pocket Universe, he then asked about the situation of the Empire's four great Dao Palaces.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Dragon King, how is the arrangement of the Dragon Rising Monastery, the fourth training ground of the Empire, going?" </p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Dragon Rising Monastery has been in preparation for two hundred years and officially started recruiting disciples eight hundred years ago. Currently, there are 165,480 talented disciples. This recruitment is expected to last for twenty thousand years and will cover the entire ruling territory of the Empire."</p><p></p><p>"Very good. The recruitment of the other three training grounds must not be neglected either. With competition, there will be progress. Let the four training grounds compete fairly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>After inquiring about the situation, Dragon Roar took out the pocket universe he had been tinkering with for fifty years.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it could no longer be called a "pocket" universe, as it was much larger than a pocket.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Dragon Roar had completely refined it in less than half a year, and in the following nine years, he had been constantly adding his own insights into the laws.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, with the continuous investment of heavenly materials and earthly treasures, the pocket universe had grown from an original small world to a medium-sized universe, expanding from less than a light-year to nearly a hundred light-years.</p><p></p><p>To promote its advancement, Dragon Roar had almost gone bankrupt, investing all his accumulated wealth and feeding it to the universe.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the puzzled expressions on the faces of the people below, Dragon Roar calmly explained the purpose of the pocket universe.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the people below went from initial bewilderment to shock, and then to ecstatic joy, their emotions like a roller coaster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone in their hearts could not help but exclaim, "Truly worthy of being the Sovereign! With this divine artifact, the Empire will be able to produce talents endlessly, and the Empire will be immortal!" When they heard the Sovereign Dragon Roar say that this divine artifact could be further improved...</p><p></p><p>Their eyes lit up, and the hopeful light filled their eyes. They seemed to see the possibility of further progress.</p><p></p><p>If they could make further progress, they could continue to follow the Sovereign's footsteps.</p><p></p><p>Under the adoring gaze of the stars, Dragon Roar once again revealed a bombshell.</p><p></p><p>That was Dragon Roar publicly announcing his own cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Prior to this, only a few high-ranking officials in the Empire knew Dragon Roar's true cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>He now revealed his cultivation level to give these high-ranking officials a goal, to let them know that there was still a path ahead.</p><p></p><p>This bombshell directly ignited the excitement of everyone present, including the usually calm Wu Yin.</p><p></p><p>With a whoosh, Wu Yin stood up, not understanding why Dragon Roar would reveal this information.</p><p></p><p>"Silence, hmph, noisy and disorderly, what kind of decorum is this?"</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Realm Lord's peak enveloped the hall.</p><p></p><p>"This information is a clan secret. Whoever dares to leak it will be judged by the clan law!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin's crisp voice echoed through the hall.</p><p></p><p>Clan secret, judged by the clan, this was the highest level of confidentiality and the highest punishment in the Day and Moon Empire.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, old Wu, no need to be so nervous. The young ones won't spread it around."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar saw that the people were at a loss, intimidated by Wu Yin's aura, so he stepped in to smooth things over.</p><p></p><p>"Young ones, you didn't hear it wrong. I, the old ancestor, have broken through to the next level beyond the Realm Lord realm."</p><p></p><p>"I call this level the Immortal, and what is the Immortal? The Immortal is the eternal!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Dragon Roar's words fell, the hall was filled with a thunderous cheer of celebration.</p><p></p><p>Immortal, eternal.</p><p></p><p>These two words deeply stimulated their nerves.</p><p></p><p>Especially for those who were attending the meeting for the first time, their shouts were deafening.</p><p></p><p>"The young people are full of vitality." Wu Yin looked at the excited crowd and this time he did not scold them, but sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>However, the fleeting sadness in his eyes was captured by Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, you shouldn't give up either. There is still a chance."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Secluded Palace of the Celestial Palace.</p><p></p><p>The two founding fathers of the Empire sat quietly, sipping tea in silence.</p><p></p><p>Although neither of them spoke.</p><p></p><p>But from the gleam in their eyes, it was evident that their inner minds were not as calm as they appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Secret Talisman Diagram, perhaps it could be the opportunity for the Empire to break free from its shackles.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the current predicament of the Empire, Long Ming understood it better than Wu Yin.</p><p></p><p>After incorporating the vast territory of hundreds of billions of light-years into the Empire's domain, he had already sensed the current state of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>To ordinary people, the hundreds of billions of light-years ruled by the Day and Moon Empire might seem immense.</p><p></p><p>But when placed in the scale of the entire primordial universe, it appears utterly insignificant and minuscule.</p><p></p><p>Even the star domain where the Empire currently resides, in Long Ming's previous life, was described as being situated in a void.</p><p></p><p>In this boundless void, only the hundreds of billions of light-years star domain ruled by the Day and Moon Empire exists, with the rest being empty and desolate.</p><p></p><p>This hundreds of billions of light-years star domain is like a solitary island in the vast universe.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, according to the research of the Empire's scientists, the star domains outside this void are accelerating in their escape, so no starlight from beyond this domain can be observed within the Empire.</p><p></p><p>What a desperate situation.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Empire is trapped and confined on this cosmic island.</p><p></p><p>After centuries and millennia of development, the Empire's technology seems to have been locked by an invisible shackle.</p><p></p><p>Now with the appearance of the Secret Talisman Diagram, Long Ming and Wu Yin seem to have glimpsed another path for the Empire.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite is that the Secret Talisman Diagram can be applied. Otherwise, the Empire can only rely on the passage of time to verify it, or encounter "extraterrestrials" and utilize their technology - which is why Long Ming previously inquired about the news from the Imperial Exploration Fleet in the Juntian Palace meeting.</p><p></p><p>The direction of those exploration teams is the vast, empty universe.</p><p></p><p>Their purpose is to seek out the legendary "extraterrestrials".</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, over the years, all the personnel sent out have disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Just as Long Ming's thoughts were wandering, outside the central star river, billions of light-years away, the extraterrestrials he had been longing for were rapidly approaching the Empire's direction in their spaceships.</p><p></p><p>In the secluded palace, Long Ming lightly tapped the tea table and instructed Wu Yin, "Old Wu, later I will compile a set of books on the Secret Talisman Diagram, and you can take them back for the Empire's researchers to study its feasibility."</p><p></p><p>The Secret Talisman Diagram originated from the Array Talisman, and he had not yet figured out how to mass-produce the Secret Talisman Diagram. So he could only let the researchers study its viability first.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin responded in a muffled voice, "Okay, I will personally oversee this matter."</p><p></p><p>"By the way, Old Dragon, the construction in the Boundless Universe is almost complete. Do you have any plans for the talent selection?"</p><p></p><p>"If there's no good solution, I'll just let the youngsters choose the talents based on the three methods we discussed before."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Wu Yin's words, Long Ming was clearly taken aback, as if he had forgotten about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Now that Wu Yin brought it up, he remembered this issue.</p><p></p><p>His original idea was to use technology to conduct an online selection, but later he realized that the Empire's technology might not be able to achieve it, so he had temporarily shelved the plan.</p><p></p><p>The Empire's technology is still too backward, causing many of his ideas to be unrealizable.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Long Ming raised his teacup and gulped down a large mouthful, saying frustratedly:</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, you handle this matter as well.</p><p></p><p>"Instruct the subordinates to take care of it, and you should also take a break. Don't be so tense all the time. You've taken on everything, leaving no opportunity for the youngsters."</p><p></p><p>As a lonely old man, he was working so hard, and Long Ming couldn't help but feel a bit concerned.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the matter of finding him a companion should be put on the agenda. Calculating the days, it appears that Old Wu's millionth birthday is also approaching soon. Finding him a partner would be good, allowing him to spend his remaining years more comfortably.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the ten thousand years of my time, I spend my twilight years.</p><p></p><p>According to normal standards, a Realm Lord can live for more than 11 million years.</p><p></p><p>But Wu Yin's foundation was damaged in his youth, so his lifespan is about 1 million years less than a normal Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>One can see this from his silvery gray hair and aged appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, then I'll take my leave now."</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Wu Yin felt that Long Ming's gaze on him was a bit off, thinking that he must be plotting something again.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he quickly tightened his World Ring and then stood up to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>He acted decisively, without any hesitation or dragging.</p><p></p><p>Watching Wu Yin leave, Long Ming couldn't help but shake his head, "Was it necessary to leave so quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Extending his hand, the divine power circulated, and a jade pendant appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He then waved his hand, and the jade pendant shot rapidly towards Wu Yin.</p><p></p><p>Judging from its shape, it was a Life Jade Pendant. He had heard that the previous one had been shattered.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't particularly valuable, and if it broke, it could be repaired with a new piece.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Heavenly Palace, Wu Yin caught the incoming Life Jade Pendant without saying anything, and then stored it back into his World Ring. He then took out a spacecraft and boarded it to leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching Wu Yin leave, Long Ming reactivated the Heavenly Palace's restrictions and then prepared to return to the quiet room to recuperate and restore his divine body.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the long-neglected chat group suddenly popped up with a notification, someone had @'ed him.</p><p></p><p>He summoned the chat group panel.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "@Long Ming, is the group leader there?"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "I'm here, Xiaolun, what do you need?"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Group leader, can you sell me some Soul Crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming didn't bother checking the chat history, and responded in the group.</p><p></p><p>As for why Ge Xiaolun suddenly @'ed Long Ming, it was because Chen Beixuan had just casually mentioned the effects of Soul Crystals in their casual chat. This was a godsend for Ge Xiaolun, who was preparing to upgrade his fifth-generation divine body but was lacking some materials.</p><p></p><p>This prompted Ge Xiaolun to @Long Ming and ask to purchase Soul Crystals.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Oh, this. I'll give each of you some."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Long Ming sent a share to everyone in the group, except Chen Beixuan. Soul Crystals were a special product of the Day and Night Empire. He had tested them in the group's trading post before, and one could exchange them for 100 points, which was quite valuable.</p><p></p><p>He gave ten pieces to each person, except Chen Beixuan, not because he was being stingy, but because the refinement of Soul Crystals had an upper limit. Given the current strength of the group members, ten pieces were their limit, and more would be of no use.</p><p></p><p>As for why he didn't give any to Chen Beixuan, it was because he had already given him ten pieces when they exchanged for spirit stones earlier.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Group leader, you're so impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Group leader, you're so impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Mie Ba: "Group leader, you're so impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Group leader, you're so impressive!"</p><p></p><p>The other silent members in the group instantly became parrots.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Alright, you've been in the group for so long, and I haven't given you any benefits yet. This time, consider it a belated reward.</p><p></p><p>"When refining the Soul Crystals, remember to act according to your abilities."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Long Ming's words were sent, the group members again expressed their gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Long Ming proceeded to answer the cultivation-related questions raised by the group members.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were chatting, the chat group received a new notification.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The chat group can be upgraded, would you like to upgrade?]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the prompt, Long Ming was puzzled, although he didn't understand why the chat group would suddenly need an upgrade.</p><p></p><p>But he still chose the upgrade option.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Chat group upgrade complete.]</p><p></p><p>[Chat group current level is LV2, group member limit increased.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Member pulling function has been recharged, would you like to pull in new members?]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

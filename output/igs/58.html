        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the two chatted for a while, Ge Xiaolun's heart was filled with the desire to refine the star soul crystal and upgrade to the fifth-generation divine body, so he didn't chat for long and logged off hastily.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that no one was keeping him company, the bored Han Xiao entered the training arena and started conducting experiments.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the "game" on his side had been updated, and all the cannon fodder had logged off, leaving him with nothing to do.</p><p></p><p>The main problem was that without any cannon fodder to harvest, his skill experience points were not increasing at all! He had hit a bottleneck, and the team's progress in the secret realm had stalled at the 43rd floor, unable to break through no matter how hard they tried.</p><p></p><p>In the two thousand-plus years that Dragon Roar had been offline, more than half a year had passed in the chat group, with time flowing at different speeds in each person's world, so everyone had experienced different amounts of time.</p><p></p><p>Overall, during this half-year period in the chat group, Han Xiao's progress in the Bowing Dragon Tower had increased by one floor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it wasn't just him - the others had also made some progress in their strength.</p><p></p><p>The most direct reflection of this was the increase in their Bowing Dragon Tower floor levels.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun had advanced from the previous 15th floor to the 17th floor.</p><p></p><p>Even Chen Beixuan had directly reached the 7th floor.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Beixuan is currently the weakest among the group administrators, he is confident that he will soon surpass Ge Xiaolun.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that will happen in the not-too-distant future, as he is still at the bottom for now, which is an undisputed fact.</p><p></p><p>His most urgent desire now is to break through the bottleneck and enter the next realm.</p><p></p><p>After re-embarking on the cultivation path, Chen Beixuan realized that the spiritual energy density on the Blue Star is pitifully low, making it difficult for him to quickly recover his previous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After half a year of effort, he has only managed to reach the Innate Realm, achieving the state of unification of essence, qi, and spirit. Although he has the strength to break the sound barrier with his flesh and tear apart tanks with his bare hands, he is still constrained by ordinary weapons and often unable to unleash his full power.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for refining a star soul crystal given by the group leader and using some resources from the chat group's shopping mall, he might not have been able to cultivate to the Innate Realm so quickly, as the spiritual energy density on the Blue Star is just too low.</p><p></p><p>Now that new members have joined the group, their worlds have become the key for Chen Beixuan's breakthrough, especially those two worlds that he knows have cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As long as the spiritual energy density in those worlds is sufficient, he is confident that he can break through that layer of paper at any time and advance to the Golden Core Realm.</p><p></p><p>This is why Chen Beixuan is so focused on improving his cultivation at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Once he breaks through to the Golden Core Realm, he will truly be able to soar freely through the heavens, no longer constrained by ordinary weapons.</p><p></p><p>Of course, except for those pesky grenade launchers...</p><p></p><p>Among the four group administrators, only Thanos has not succeeded in pushing the tower. Probably because he is immersed in the pleasures of the world and unable to extricate himself, which might be Dragon Roar's fault for finding him a wife. It's unclear whether that counts as meddling in other people's affairs.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Thanos was brutally defeated by Ultron wielding the six Infinity Stones, he has been obsessed with researching the Infinity Stones, despite the previous guidance from group leader Dragon Roar. He seems to be addicted or even possessed by the Soul Stone.</p><p></p><p>The Death Goddess has tried to persuade him multiple times to give up using the Infinity Stones, but Thanos is like an addict, and no one's advice seems to work.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether the Death Goddess has told Thanos that continuously using the Infinity Stones will accelerate the destruction of the universe. But since the Death Goddess said she only gave her avatar free rein, her main body probably doesn't know this information either.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Dragon Roar will tell him, it depends on his mood.</p><p></p><p>For now, it seems the only way is to wait for Thanos to carry all six Infinity Stones...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a major defeat, he would finally wake up with a start. - Back to the present.</p><p></p><p>In the 'Star Sea' world, at the headquarters of the Legion on the Golden Gate Star. In a room not far from the mission hall, this room is filled with the atmosphere of the interstellar era, with various mechanical and electronic equipment. After completing the experiment and exiting the training ground, Han Xiao's figure suddenly appeared in the room.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao returned to reality, first taking out a very large electronic screen from his personal storage warehouse in a familiar way, and then lightly tapping a few times, seemingly importing some data into it.</p><p></p><p>This electronic screen is actually an editor, a special tool used by Han Xiao to record data.</p><p></p><p>On the editor, there are dense records, and looking at the time stamps behind them, they are all from the recent period.</p><p></p><p>It can be seen how obsessed Han Xiao is with experiments.</p><p></p><p>After the experimental data transmission was completed, Han Xiao turned his gaze to the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that no one was chatting in the group yet, he hung up the chat group and began to tinker with his mechanical inventions.</p><p></p><p>A mechanical engineer who cannot create machinery is not a qualified mechanical engineer! In the days without "cannon fodder", Han Xiao spent every day in the water group, engaged in mechanical creation.</p><p></p><p>Other group members are not always online to chat, and inventing mechanical devices is not only tedious and boring, but also lacks an object of exchange.</p><p></p><p>However, this situation ended after Han Xiao was upgraded to a group administrator by Long Ming.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming an administrator, Han Xiao seemed to have found the door to a new world, and he was even more immersed in the chat group every day, either researching this or that.</p><p></p><p>At first, when he saw his authority increase, he even secretly pawned a jar of Eurora sauce, which was truly a "black star" (heart) in the true sense.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the pawn result showed that it was not worth many points, perhaps because the chat group did not accept such items, otherwise Han Xiao might have come up with some outrageous operations like making Eurora sell saliva regularly.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I don't know if this matter is known to Hera, will she fight with him...</p><p></p><p>While Han Xiao was conducting crazy bombing experiments on the training ground, in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan had finished dealing with the matter and went online again. After scanning through the chat records of Ge Xiaolun and the others, he purchased a crossing talisman at the mall.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "@Wang Sheng, I'm going to your place for a visit now."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Brother Beixuan, are you going to that world to subdue demons and exorcise evil?"</p><p></p><p>The little prince of the water group, Han Xiao, greeted Chen Beixuan as soon as he saw him speak, and after the greeting, he did not forget to tease him a bit. Chen Beixuan had not previously concealed his purpose, and did not respond to Han Xiao's teasing.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Brother Han Xiao, do you want to come with me?"</p><p></p><p>For this person Han Xiao, Chen Beixuan still had a lot of admiration. After half a year of contact, he had a bottom line in his heart for several people in the group. Han Xiao not only had strong strength, but was also extremely intelligent and cautious.</p><p></p><p>He asked this sentence, it was just a polite courtesy.</p><p></p><p>Because Chen Beixuan knew that Han Xiao would definitely not go, the Painted Skin world, to him, was too unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>This person Han Xiao, would only have curiosity under the premise of absolute safety!!!</p><p></p><p>PS: Originally, I wanted to raise Chen Beixuan's strength a bit at the beginning, but later I checked the information and found that the original work described that a Golden Dan stage could destroy a city with one blow, and the Demon Subduing Sect was directly torn apart. </p><p></p><p>But later I thought about it, if a Golden Dan stage can survive briefly in the space of the universe, it doesn't seem to be a problem to be at the planetary level.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

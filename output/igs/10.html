        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Purple Yang Spear Saint looked at the blue and white armored Dragon Roar, whose battle aura was imposing, and nodded in satisfaction. He then stood up and pulled out the "clothes hanger" placed by the bedside, and with a light flick, the disguise was removed, revealing a long spear that was entirely purple in color, emitting a blue-green glow.</p><p></p><p>A treasure in disguise!</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's brows furrowed, and his expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>Since entering this small wooden hut, he had not noticed this treasure. Now, seeing the long spear revealing its true form, its aura was no less than his own, and it was undoubtedly a formidable weapon.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a weapon comparable to an unparalleled king was terrifying, let alone the person wielding it.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Yang Spear Saint did not care what Dragon Roar was thinking. He simply slashed the long spear in front of him, and in the next moment, Dragon Roar only sensed a spatial disturbance before the two of them had left the small wooden hut and appeared by a small river ten miles away.</p><p></p><p>What a skillful Blink! Dragon Roar silently praised the Purple Yang Spear Saint's mastery of space.</p><p></p><p>If he were not proficient in the laws of space, he might not have even noticed the Spear Saint's technique.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you better be careful. When I'm at full power, I'll be going all out," the Purple Yang Spear Saint warned, holding the spear with both hands as they stood on opposite sides of the river.</p><p></p><p>"At full power?" Dragon Roar was somewhat puzzled, but he would soon experience it.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Yang Spear Saint did not engage in further pleasantries or wait for Dragon Roar's questions.</p><p></p><p>With a flash, he had already attacked in front of Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>The sudden attack caught Dragon Roar off guard, and he could only barely dodge the spear thrust by teleporting.</p><p></p><p>Due to the limited space of the 51st layer, his teleportation options were limited, and he only managed to move a few miles away.</p><p></p><p>For experts like them, the distance of a few miles was covered in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>True enough, as soon as Dragon Roar stabilized his footing, the Purple Yang Spear Saint caught up to him in just a breath.</p><p></p><p>What followed was a barrage of spear shadows, a relentless assault like a venomous snake flicking its tongue. Each strike was extremely cunning and treacherous. The spear shadows formed an impenetrable net, enveloping Dragon Roar from all directions, disrupting the balance of yin and yang in the surrounding space.</p><p></p><p>Ding! One strike grazed Dragon Roar's armor, sparking golden flames.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's gaze momentarily faltered. He did not expect the Purple Yang Spear Saint to be so fierce right from the start, no wonder he said he would be going all out.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this time Dragon Roar was able to react in time. He held the Dragon Scale Sword in his right hand and slapped the incoming spear away with his left palm, then stepped back and spun the sword, unleashing a flurry of sword flowers.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Scale Sword was a weapon he had forged himself, accompanying him for countless years of battles.</p><p></p><p>Facing the cunning attacks of the Purple Yang Spear Saint, Dragon Roar fought while retreating, his movements quickening. The sword flowers bloomed and hovered around, growing in number and exuding a sense of ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>It didn't take long before a hint of joy flashed across Dragon Roar's face.</p><p></p><p>It's done.</p><p></p><p>As the Purple Yang Spear Saint attacked again, this time Dragon Roar did not retreat. He calmly swept the blood-red sword flowers forward, covering the space in front of him with a shower of bloody blossoms, enveloping both himself and the Spear Saint.</p><p></p><p>With this all-out attack, Dragon Roar officially launched his counteroffensive, determined to swiftly defeat the Spear Saint.</p><p></p><p>This sword flower domain was Dragon Roar's creation, the Fearless Sword Realm. As long as the flowers remained, those within the domain would be fearless.</p><p></p><p>Within the sword realm, the Purple Yang Spear Saint seemed to know Dragon Roar's plan. His long spear moved erratically, but each strike managed to knock away a sword flower, gradually opening a breach in the domain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Spear Saint retreat from the sword realm, Dragon Roar seized the opportunity, channeling his spiritual power and chasing after him with the sword domain.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the retreating Purple Yang Spear Saint stopped, turned around with his hands holding the spear, and then leaped high up.</p><p></p><p>Longming's heart skipped a beat, fearing he had fallen into a trap. </p><p></p><p>Previously, many sword flowers had been knocked away from the sword domain, and it had not fully recovered yet. If he was struck hard again, he might not be able to maintain it.</p><p></p><p>Now there was no way to avoid it, so Longming raised his Dragon Scale Sword, deciding to choose a head-on clash.</p><p></p><p>He pushed off the ground with his feet and soared up.</p><p></p><p>Longming leaped up, intending to use one sword strike to break through the situation. The Dragon Scale Sword was wrapped in divine light, and in an instant, thunderous lightning and surging winds erupted. The Dragon Scale Sword let out a crisp ringing sound, its sword shadow overlapping and peerlessly fierce, propelled by the overwhelming divine power, charging forward unstoppably.</p><p></p><p>In mid-air, the Purple Yang Spear Saint looked at Longming's tenacity and couldn't help but nod approvingly. However, he did not continue to strike down, but instead twisted his long spear in an extremely bizarre posture to avoid the head-on clash. Using only one-tenth of his strength, he would be at a disadvantage in a direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>The attack missing its mark left Longming with an indescribable sense of frustration, and he let out a long sigh to calm his mind. But this also caused the offensive and defensive positions to shift.</p><p></p><p>Flashing and dodging, the two attacked with great force, and each clash of the spear and sword stirred up waves of energy.</p><p></p><p>The fifty-first layer of space also seemed to be imbued with a special law, and no matter how it was bombarded, the mountains and rivers remained unharmed. Especially the small wooden hut, which looked ordinary but remained completely unscathed in the raging atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>The two went back and forth, not knowing how long it had been.</p><p></p><p>Longming had exhausted all his techniques, but still could not defeat the Purple Yang Spear Saint.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Longming's figure was swept away by a spear strike.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Yang Spear Saint did not pursue, but stood still with his eyes closed. He placed one hand on the spear shaft and brushed it, causing countless runes to appear.</p><p></p><p>"Deployment of the Heavenly Martial Arts - Mortal Duel." After a few breaths, the Purple Yang Spear Saint suddenly opened his eyes and let out a light shout.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, numerous white phantoms appeared behind the Purple Yang Spear Saint. These phantoms all had an extremely powerful aura, and in an instant, they surrounded the blown-away Longming, not giving him any chance to turn the situation around.</p><p></p><p>The white, hazy phantoms attacked simultaneously, each using different techniques, whether slashing, thrusting, or throwing spears.</p><p></p><p>Longming looked at the countless spear shadows, his forehead throbbing.</p><p></p><p>His Dragon Scale Sword kept swinging, barely fending off the phantoms' attacks.</p><p></p><p>But before he could catch his breath, he was instantly pierced by the charging Purple Yang Spear Saint - a chilling spear strike that sent him flying out of the fifty-first layer of the Subduing Dragon Tower.</p><p></p><p>"That's so unsportsmanlike, ganging up on me like that," Longming said somewhat speechlessly outside the Subduing Dragon Tower. </p><p></p><p>He never expected that at the critical moment, the Purple Yang Spear Saint would unleash such a powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, nine out of ten spearmen are mediocre, and the one left is a monster. How could he have encountered that monster?</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't even defeat one-tenth of the strength, how could he possibly handle the remaining nine-tenths and ten-tenths?</p><p></p><p>"That final 'Deployment of the Heavenly Martial Arts' technique must be the strongest move the Purple Yang Spear Saint can use with one-tenth of his power. If his strength increased even slightly, it would be equivalent to two-tenths of his power," Longming reflected on the previous battle, marveling at the Purple Yang Spear Saint's precise control of his power.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the entire battle, it had to be said that the Purple Yang Spear Saint was truly powerful. The fifty-first to sixtieth layers were the immortal-level challenges, and with just one-tenth of his strength, he could display his full arsenal of techniques and still defeat Longming.</p><p></p><p>This exhilarating battle had also brought Longming many gains.</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Dragon Tower's challenges are similar to the Heavenly Bridge in the original work, so everyone should be able to understand it without getting bogged down in details about immortality or invincibility.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

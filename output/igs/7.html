        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So Longming kindly pointed out to Ge Xiaolun.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ge Xiaolun had already gone to challenge the tower, Longming turned his gaze back to Han Xiao and Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Longming: "Han Xiao, Thanos, you can also go challenge the tower and see how many floors you can clear."</p><p></p><p>Longming: "The higher the floors you clear, the better the items you can purchase in the mall."</p><p></p><p>Although Longming hadn't gone to challenge the tower himself, with the group leader's privileges, he still knew a lot of information about it.</p><p></p><p>The pawn function was extremely bad, and the check-in function only gave crumbs of points.</p><p></p><p>Challenging the Beilong Tower would undoubtedly be the main way for the group members to earn points going forward.</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "Thank you, group leader. I'll go try it after I'm done with my other matters."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Okay, I'll go a bit later."</p><p></p><p>"Group leader, Han Xiao has a request, I hope you can grant it."</p><p></p><p>Longming: "What is it? Feel free to tell me!"</p><p></p><p>Longming was very curious about what request Han Xiao had.</p><p></p><p>Thanos, who was just about to log off, also had a curious expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>The group leader was too mysterious, Thanos didn't dare to act rashly. He had planned to wait until he was done with his other matters, then see how the group member Ge Xiaolun did in the tower challenge, and then try it himself.</p><p></p><p>Now seeing Han Xiao's actions, Thanos decided to stay and take a look.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "May the group leader please come to the training grounds and guide me for a while."</p><p></p><p>Longming: "No problem, Thanos, you come along too."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Longming spent 100 points to activate the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>A void teleportation portal appeared in front of Longming, and you could vaguely see a thunderstorm on the other side of the portal.</p><p></p><p>Longming's divine sense swept back and forth a few times, but he couldn't figure out how this portal appeared. He didn't dwell on it anymore and stepped into the portal.</p><p></p><p>The other two, Han Xiao and Thanos, also explored it for a while but to no avail, and then entered the portal.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was different. At first, he was quite surprised when Longming called him to come along, but after thinking for a moment, he made up his mind to participate.</p><p></p><p>It was a good opportunity to test the group leader's strength!</p><p></p><p>The three of them entered the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>Inside the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao calmed down for a while and observed the surroundings. He saw a tall, purple figure standing next to him. Although he had seen many aliens before, this was the first time he had seen one that was completely purple.</p><p></p><p>This one looked a bit like a purple sweet potato... Han Xiao guessed that this must be Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after the two greeted each other, they confirmed each other's identities, and then they continued to observe the training grounds.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough observation.</p><p></p><p>Both Han Xiao and Thanos were shocked by the training grounds, as they didn't expect it to be so huge, actually the size of a medium-sized planet.</p><p></p><p>Longming, however, was unfazed. "A medium-sized planet, so what? It's not that big."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two had calmed down a bit, Longming smiled and said, "Han Xiao, Thanos, I suppose this is the first time we've met."</p><p></p><p>"Let me reintroduce myself, I am Longming, the Holy Lord of the Day and Night Empire, with the power of an Eternal King."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, group leader. I am Han Xiao, with almost S-class strength."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, group leader. I am Thanos, with Celestial-level strength."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Longming's self-introduction, Han Xiao thought of a lot of things. "Eternal King, eternal, the Eternal Chat Group of the Myriad Heavens, the group leader must be an eternal and immortal existence. I wonder how powerful he is."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Han Xiao's heart was burning with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, no need for formalities. Are you two going to attack together or one by one?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao and Thanos exchanged a glance and nodded to each other.</p><p></p><p>"Group leader, your strength is formidable. We'll attack together."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you two go first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Longming's words, Han Xiao didn't hold back, unleashing a barrage of mechanical constructs that filled the space for miles around.</p><p></p><p>Thanos, on the other hand, did something different...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He activated the power gem, causing a purple glow to surround him, and then he charged towards the central figure of Long Ming with a raised fist. </p><p></p><p>Through the optimization of the chat group, the Infinity Stones could now be used in the training arena.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the Infinity Stones' property of becoming useless outside their home universe, Thanos' strength would have been greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming did not dodge the attacks from the two, but stood his ground and took them head-on. </p><p></p><p>Such elementary attacks were unable to breach his defenses.</p><p></p><p>After Thanos' barrage of attacks, Long Ming felt only a slight tickling sensation, but he continued to guide the two during the assault.</p><p></p><p>After around 10 minutes of their relentless attacks, Long Ming chose to end the battle, as the disparity in strength provided little benefit to the two.</p><p></p><p>Closing the distance in a flash, he delivered a punch to each of them, knocking them unconscious.</p><p></p><p>Through this battle, Long Ming gained a general understanding of the group members' abilities. </p><p></p><p>Among the four who had joined so far, Tang San was clearly the weakest, being barely at the planetary level. </p><p></p><p>Next was Ge Xuelun, who had reached the peak of the planetary level, nearing the stellar level by utilizing stellar energy.</p><p></p><p>Then there was Thanos, who as the wielder of the Infinity Stones was a domain lord-level expert, but would be limited to that level as relying on external artifacts could not lead to true immortality.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, Han Xiao showed good potential, and with some improvements to his physical strength, could reach the realm of the domain lord.</p><p></p><p>After regaining consciousness, Han Xiao and Thanos gratefully acknowledged Long Ming's insightful guidance, which had revealed their shortcomings more effectively than years of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming expressed his high hopes for their future growth, before departing the training arena. </p><p></p><p>Left alone, Han Xiao and Thanos exchanged a look filled with fighting spirit, eager to further test and validate the gains from their previous battle.</p>

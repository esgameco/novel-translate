        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Moquiu Star.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming opened up the functions of the chat group one by one, preparing to challenge the secret realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Holy Master, the standard weapons you requested have been delivered to the Ailan Star. Do you want me to send them over to you?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, no need, just leave them there. Notify the person in charge over there that I'll go pick them up."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The standard weapons were prepared by the people under Long Ming's command after he saw the pawn function in the chat group. He wanted to see how many points he could exchange those standard equipment for.</p><p></p><p>The guards of the Imperial Capital Star all carried refined equipment, so he was a bit reluctant to pawn those good things, so he could only have people send a batch of standard equipment from a more distant star.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the items had arrived at the Ailan Star, Long Ming decided to go get the standard equipment first, then closed the chat group. The cross-legged figure flashed with a faint glow, and then the entire person disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>Ailan Star, an auxiliary star of the Imperial Capital, is more than 300 light-years away from Moquiu Star. It would be too slow to send them over, at least several hours. It's better to go get them himself.</p><p></p><p>Teleportation, one light-year at a time, performing it six hundred times should be enough! - The Divine Realm of the Slayer Universe.</p><p></p><p>Tan San's face was gloomy, still in a sullen mood.</p><p></p><p>At the door of the Divine King's Palace, the little dancer who had just been summoned by the divine attendant looked at the mess on the ground and couldn't help but ask, "San Ge, what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Tan San didn't bother to respond to the little dancer.</p><p></p><p>Because at this moment, he saw changes in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>[Secret Realm - Subdued Dragon Tower has been opened.]</p><p>[Please click to view details.]</p><p>[Chat Group Mall has been opened.]</p><p>[Please click to view details.]</p><p>[Arena function has been opened.]</p><p>[Please click to view details.]</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three prominent notification messages, Tan San subconsciously clicked to view the details of the Subdued Dragon Tower.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the details, Tan San couldn't help but rejoice secretly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he succeeds in the challenge, he can obtain points, right?</p><p></p><p>The points have a place to go!</p><p></p><p>"Points, crossing over! Very good, you all wait for this Divine King!"</p><p></p><p>The little dancer beside him, seeing her husband go from resentment to inexplicable laughter, couldn't help but worry and ask concernedly, "San Ge..."</p><p></p><p>"Little dancer, I'm fine, I'll explain it to you later." Tan San interrupted the little dancer's words, his tone also softening a bit.</p><p></p><p>Towards the little dancer who had always accompanied him, Tan San could restrain his emotions a little.</p><p></p><p>After briefly comforting the little dancer, Tan San no longer paid attention to her and directly clicked on the challenge option of the Subdued Dragon Tower.</p><p></p><p>With a hum, Tan San disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>No flashy special effects, he just suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Tan San's sudden disappearance startled the little dancer beside him, and she immediately wanted to seek advice from the Seven Wonders friends.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about her husband's previous words, the little dancer could only wait anxiously at the spot.</p><p></p><p>San Ge, please be safe.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of what was happening outside the Divine Realm, at this moment, Tan San was teleported in front of a towering tower.</p><p></p><p>The majestic tower, its height beyond sight, with cloud dragons and phoenixes dancing on its body, an endless aura surrounding it, solemn and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Tan San was overwhelmed by the momentum of the tower, and his arrogant expression was somewhat restrained.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the two stone tablets standing at the main entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Vast, entering the azure sky."</p><p>"Boundless, rising to the blue heavens."</p><p></p><p>Just a few words, dominating the universe.</p><p></p><p>Tan San just glanced at it, and his mind felt a bit dizzy. He quickly averted his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Carefully crossing the stone tablets, he came to the main entrance. The words "Subdued Dragon Tower" were written on the large door, and the ancient aura emanating from it also made Tan San dare not look directly at it.</p><p></p><p>Successive shocks made Tan San realize that the Subdued Dragon Tower in front of him was a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Such a divine object, I must seize the opportunity to reclaim it for the Slayer Divine Realm. Then I'll see who dares to resist this Divine King."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the good thing, the long-standing desire for possession in Tan San's heart was frantically surging through his entire being.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the Divine Realm, with the Destroyer God as the leader...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were not a few gods who opposed Tang San.</p><p></p><p>"Challenge!" Tang San confidently confirmed in front of the tower.</p><p></p><p>After the confirmation, Tang San was instantly teleported to a vast plain.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tang San stood firm, a rolling cloud of dust rose in the distance at the end of the boundless plain.</p><p></p><p>"They're here." Tang San's martial soul was fully opened, and the ten blood-red soul rings spun rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The ten soul rings that faintly shone with golden light were his achievements after slaying the disobedient gods and becoming a God King.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Tang San stared intently at the front, with the Demon Destroyer Sword in his left hand and the Blue Silver Grass in his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Tang San knew that the dust clouds contained a large number of monsters, and according to the rules, he could only succeed in the challenge by slaying them all.</p><p></p><p>Countless beasts were galloping.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the beast tide came before Tang San.</p><p></p><p>Facing the ferocious monsters with fangs bared in the front row, Tang San calmly used his signature soul skill - the Blue Silver Cage. Suddenly, ten tall blue-black cages appeared, trapping the monsters at the forefront.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the Blue Silver Cage was only able to obstruct them for a moment before being broken through by the monsters.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the Blue Silver Cage was ineffective, Tang San naturally did not believe in superstition and grunted again, stimulating his soul power and waving his right hand to use the Blue Silver Entanglement again.</p><p></p><p>However, the performance of the Blue Silver Entanglement was even worse, as it was directly ignored by the monsters, unlike the Blue Silver Cage which could obstruct them for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his two signature soul skills were ineffective, and the monsters had already approached him.</p><p></p><p>Tang San's expression could not help but tighten, he knew he had underestimated the enemy, and immediately exerted force on his feet, jumping back high to avoid the gaping jaws of the monsters.</p><p></p><p>On the first floor of the Bixiao Tower, there was a law of forbidden flight, so Tang San could not fly.</p><p></p><p>In mid-air, taking advantage of the moment of stagnation, Tang San charged up his fifth soul skill, the Blue Silver Overlord Spear, and threw it out.</p><p></p><p>With a "puff" sound, one spear pierced through three monsters.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the weapon attack was effective, Tang San no longer held back, with the Demon Destroyer Sword in his left hand, the Poseidon's Trident in his right hand, and the eight Spider Lances "spreading their wings" on his back, unleashing full firepower and charging into the beast tide.</p><p></p><p>Two hours later.</p><p></p><p>The vast and spacious plain no longer had any trace of the monsters.</p><p></p><p>On the scorched black earth, Tang San was panting heavily. At this moment, his clothes were tattered, with a few bloody lines on his face, his right eye empty, not far away were the broken Demon Destroyer Sword and Poseidon's Trident, and even farther away were some damaged unknown divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Tang San was leaning on a man-high Heavenly Hammer, and if it weren't for the indestructible nature of his martial soul, the Heavenly Hammer might not have survived either.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the empty plain, a strange smile appeared on Tang San's face. He had succeeded, using up all his techniques, from hidden weapons, soul skills, exploding soul rings, and soul bone skills, he had finally dragged down the last monster with his Blue Silver True Body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice sounded in Tang San's mind.</p><p></p><p>【Congratulations on your successful challenge.】</p><p></p><p>【Would you like to challenge the next floor?】</p><p></p><p>With the voice, Tang San's body was enveloped in a beam of light, and after the light faded, his injuries were healed.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Tang San dared to use up everything.</p><p></p><p>As long as he succeeded in the Bixiao Tower secret realm, everything would be restored to its original state, and even if he failed, he would only be spiritually weakened for a period of time, without any threat to his life.</p><p></p><p>On the plain, Tang San held the Demon Destroyer Sword, looking quite spirited, and confirmed the challenge to the next floor.</p><p></p><p>The second floor of the Bixiao Tower.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tang San was teleported over, before he could even stabilize his footing and look around, a beam of light flashed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Tang San was kicked out of the second floor of the Bixiao Tower.</p><p></p><p>A prompt also sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【Challenge failed, please try again.】</p><p></p><p>Tang San looked at the failed challenge prompt, somewhat puzzled, as he hadn't even done anything yet, how could he have failed?</p><p></p><p>He immediately wanted to challenge again.</p><p></p><p>【Sorry, unable to enter the challenge.】</p><p></p><p>【Based on the power assessment, you can come back in a year if you want to challenge again.】</p><p></p><p>After trying several times, he always got the response that he could come back in a year. Tang San, not daring to be reckless in front of the Bixiao Tower, could only leave the challenge secret realm, cursing in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm of the Douluo Continent.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die! Die!"</p><p></p><p>"Despicable mortals, how dare you offend the Divine King."</p><p></p><p>King Tang San saw that he was being ignored, and the fury in his heart could no longer be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Enraged to the extreme, ten soul rings appeared and began to rapidly rotate around him.</p><p></p><p>"Chaotic Robe!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah~~~"</p><p></p><p>He summoned the Heavenly Halberd Hammer, his body twisted and turned a few times, and then he fiercely threw it out of the divine palace.</p><p></p><p>The divine servants waiting outside the divine palace felt the sky crumbling, and the overwhelming pressure made them almost unable to breathe.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine King is angry again, quickly go and find..."</p><p></p><p>But before the divine servant could finish speaking, a hammer came flying.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ The divine servant was instantly blown away and disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the divine servants were frightened and scattered in all directions, fleeing the Divine King's palace.</p><p></p><p>They only had one thought in their minds - to quickly find the Divine King's friends and the Divine Queen. Only they could appease the Divine King's wrath now.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine King's palace, a pillar was broken into three pieces, showing the extent of the Divine King's fury! After dozens of minutes of smashing and destroying, Tang San's anger had subsided a lot, and his rationality had also recovered to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing his displeasure, he reopened the chat group.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he opened it, he saw the huge "Transmigration" button in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>He clicked it a few times, but was prompted that he lacked points.</p><p></p><p>After spending half an hour, Tang San finally understood what points were.</p><p></p><p>Points are the currency of the chat group, and there are many ways to obtain points. The simplest is to sign in, which can be done once a day in the group and can randomly earn points. Secondly, pawning items and uploading things will also reward points.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, once the Divine King has accumulated enough points, it will be your death day." Tang San looked at Long Ming's yellow name with hatred.</p><p></p><p>Only 1000 points are needed to transmigrate.</p><p></p><p>Sign in.</p><p></p><p>[Divine King Tang San signed in successfully, rewarded 1 point!]</p><p></p><p>??? </p><p></p><p>Why was it only one point? The introduction said that each sign-in could randomly earn 1-100 points.</p><p></p><p>Hmph! They are still going against the Divine King! Very good, the Eternal Chat Group, you also have a way to die!</p><p></p><p>Tang San was full of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Since the sign-in points were few, the Divine King would graciously pawn a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Tang San took out a long spear, which was the divine artifact he had personally slain a disobedient deity with not long ago.</p><p></p><p>He submitted the divine artifact spear to the pawn window.</p><p></p><p>[Item: Devour Soul Spear.]</p><p>[Rank: Mortal.]</p><p>[Value: Due to the blessing of faith, the value is 1 point.]</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Tang San's face turned ashen, how could a divine artifact be a mortal item, and only worth such a tiny amount of points.</p><p></p><p>Tang San was very dissatisfied and couldn't help but curse loudly.</p><p></p><p>It must be this damned chat group that is deducting.</p><p></p><p>He then exchanged several divine artifacts for pawn, but the displayed value was still only a tiny bit of points.</p><p></p><p>[Ge Xiaolun signed in successfully, rewarded 66 points!]</p><p>[Han Xiao signed in successfully, rewarded 73 points!] </p><p>[Thanos signed in successfully, rewarded 42 points!]</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the chat group suddenly had three consecutive messages.</p><p></p><p>The sign-in point rewards of Han Xiao and the others were undoubtedly mocking him to the fullest.</p><p></p><p>The already furious Tang San, completely lost control of his soul power and unleashed it again.</p><p></p><p>Without caring about the raging Tang San, let's turn our attention back to Long Ming.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had been studying the functions of the chat group, but was interrupted by Tang San's @.</p><p></p><p>After re-studying, he finally understood all the activated functions of the chat group.</p><p></p><p>First:</p><p>The limit of pulling people into the group, each time you pull someone, you need to 'recharge', and the recharge time is currently unknown.</p><p>Pulling people consumes...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>First: Lifespan is merely a 'key' used to activate the function.</p><p></p><p>Second: Points, the currency of the chat group, can be used to purchase items and cross over to other worlds in the group mall.</p><p></p><p>There are many ways to obtain points, including but not limited to check-in, pawn, and uploading items. For example, when he just uploaded the work of Ge Xiaolun and the others, the chat group rewarded 99 points.</p><p></p><p>The group members' first download of these works is free. There is also a service fee for transactions between group members.</p><p></p><p>Third: The chat group can venture into secret realms, and each level passed will reward points. The items in the group mall are linked to the levels of the secret realms, and the items that can be purchased differ at different levels. The mall items will be refreshed periodically.</p><p></p><p>Now, Longming has not yet ventured into the secret realms, so his mall purchase interface only has a few useless items.</p><p></p><p>Fourth: The chat group can be upgraded. Currently, it is at level 1 and can accommodate up to 5 members. To upgrade the chat group, the group members need to consume points and venture into the secret realms, as well as other factors.</p><p></p><p>Fifth: The combat arena, which requires points to activate, can be used for mirrored challenges and exchanges between group members. The points required to open different levels of the combat arena vary.</p><p></p><p>Sixth: The group owner and group administrator have special privileges, which will also increase as the chat group is upgraded. In a level 1 chat group, the group owner gets a 10% bonus on points, and the group administrator gets a 5% bonus. When purchasing items in the mall, the group owner and group administrator also enjoy a 10% and 5% discount, respectively.</p><p></p><p>There are many other small and large functions, such as the difference in time flow between group members, but the main ones are these six.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these functions, the chat group is more like a 'sect', where the chat function is the communication platform for the sect's disciples, the mall is the sect's treasury, and the secret realms are the places for the disciples to cultivate and train.</p><p></p><p>Just like its name, the purpose is to cultivate the eternal members of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>And he is a proxy sect leader? Thinking about this, Longming couldn't help but frown. This chat group is very similar to the groups he saw in his previous life's novels, but there is an indescribable feeling about it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Longming's thoughts were wandering...</p><p></p><p>Countless light-years away in the central star river, the vast cosmic space was empty and silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a shimmering disturbance appeared in the previously dim space, and a multicolored black light began to emanate from it.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the disturbance turned into raging waves. After a few moments, the space returned to its former calm, and a bright silver shuttle appeared out of nowhere, seemingly emerging from the previous disturbance.</p><p></p><p>Inside the shuttle, a dozen or so strange-looking creatures were seated in two rows. Seeing that the shuttle had escaped the dark universe, they turned their gaze to the monstrous figure in the lead position.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, this place is so desolate. Have we escaped?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, brother, it's been almost a thousand years since we've seen any pursuers."</p><p></p><p>"Damn those Water Moon Clan, they've been chasing us for 20,000 years, just because we ate two of their descendants. Is that really necessary?"</p><p></p><p>"Curse those Water Moon Clan."</p><p></p><p>The leader monster at the helm listened to the chatter of his subordinates but did not respond. Glancing at the shuttle's smart system's notification of the discovery of the star field ahead, he decisively stood up and issued orders.</p><p></p><p>"We can't let our guard down. Those Water Moon Clan have been chasing us for 20,000 years. To avoid any accidents, we must continue moving forward."</p><p></p><p>With the leader's command, the dozen or so monsters had no choice but to obey. They knew that their leader was an immortal-level powerhouse, and it was wise to follow his lead.</p><p></p><p>The silver surface of the shuttle pulsed with radiant light, and after a flash, it disappeared back into the dark universe, heading towards the central star river.

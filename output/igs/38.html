        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The black thunderstorms continued to pound relentlessly across the sky.</p><p></p><p>Longming stubbornly resisted amid these repeated strikes.</p><p></p><p>Bombarded by the thunderstorms for a long time, his once incredibly powerful divine soul now appeared listless and dispirited.</p><p></p><p>The entire divine sea of consciousness was like a porridge stirred forcefully by a stick.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he could only rely on sheer willpower to endure, unable to even let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>This was the most dangerous situation Longming had encountered in ten million years, and he was now on the verge of death.</p><p></p><p>His divine body was shattered, his divine soul was obscured, and the divine power within him was in disarray. Even the divine nation that had just merged with his divine body was torn to pieces by the strikes.</p><p></p><p>How utterly tragic.</p><p></p><p>Longming's remaining consciousness could only pray for this damned thunderstorm to pass soon. He had previously considered using a teleportation talisman from the chat group to escape to another world, but the chat group had given him a ruthless reminder.</p><p></p><p>They said something about the descent of the will of the great universe, and that the chat group could not interfere with the cowardly chat group, which was just an excuse for their cowardice.</p><p></p><p>Disappointed with the chat group's incompetence, Longming thought of another method - using his ultimate life-saving technique, self-detonation.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still useless. As soon as he recovered his divine body after the self-detonation, he was met with double the intensity of the black thunderstorms.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the will of the universe was truly focused on him, dissatisfied with his attempt to escape.</p><p></p><p>The double thunderstrike was excruciatingly painful.</p><p></p><p>After that, Longming resigned himself to his fate and gritted his teeth to endure.</p><p></p><p>This hard-pressed state lasted for several hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had reached the end of his rope, and once the last trace of consciousness was extinguished, he would fall into a long slumber.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and in his hazy consciousness, Longming felt something scoop him up, and then he lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>When he regained awareness, he found himself in an unknown place.</p><p></p><p>This place was empty, a void, but it was filled with an extremely dense primal law. Countless indecipherable runes were rotating around the void, occasionally emitting multicolored light.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this?" Longming's consciousness was muddled, unsure of where he was.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a portion of the runes in the void flew towards Longming and directly entered his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>As the runes entered him, Longming jolted, and his consciousness became much clearer. Not only that, but he felt his consciousness gradually expanding.</p><p></p><p>Soon, his consciousness had fully recovered to its peak state.</p><p></p><p>The fully awakened Longming stared blankly at the void. He could not sense his divine body, which meant he was currently in a state of pure consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Why he had come to this place left him puzzled, but this place was not unfamiliar to him.</p><p></p><p>Longming touched the primal mark on his forehead - this must be the primal source realm of the original universe.</p><p></p><p>Long ago, when he was still a realm lord, he had gained the recognition of the primal law, which not only left the primal mark on his forehead but also brought his consciousness into the ocean of primal law.</p><p></p><p>Although his previous visits to the law ocean were brief, and he did not see the ocean this time, he was certain that the void before him was indeed the primal source realm.</p><p></p><p>Confirming his location, Longming immediately sat down and began to comprehend the runes in the void.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know what was going on, this was a rare opportunity that he could not afford to miss.</p><p></p><p>Whatever the case, he would first focus on comprehending the runes.</p><p></p><p>As Longming delved into his comprehension, his consciousness seemed to be a sponge, continuously absorbing the multicolored runes in the void. He was plundering them, regardless of whether he could understand or comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>Absorption.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Longming's divine consciousness was gradually imbued with the colorful hues of the mystical markings.</p><p></p><p>Just as Longming was about to absorb more of the mystical markings, the void began to vibrate, like ripples spreading across a calm water surface. The primal will of the origin descended.</p><p></p><p>Longming suddenly gained a profound understanding. The previous black lightning strikes were the primal will of the origin testing him. There were no trials of the three disasters and nine calamities of water, wind, and fire. It was simply a lightning strike - if he failed the test, he would die, but if he passed, he would arrive at the origin's domain.</p><p></p><p>Longming stopped absorbing the mystical markings and stood up quietly to wait.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his vision blurred, and he lost consciousness again.</p><p></p><p>Huh!?</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes again, he found that his divine consciousness had returned to his divine body.</p><p></p><p>Longming quickly stood up and thoroughly checked his divine body, but found no abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>"Huh." As he examined his divine consciousness, he discovered an incredible treasure - the "Furnace Projection" secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the information of the secret technique, Longming was overwhelmed with joy, for the description revealed its immense power. It was truly an unrivaled gift from the primal universe.</p><p></p><p>Secret Technique: Furnace Projection, the mightiest innate secret technique bestowed by the primal universe. When unleashed, the divine power will be ignited, and the divine body will instantly transform into a furnace, trapping the enemy within. The enemy's strength will be weakened, and they can be refined within the furnace. While in the furnace, the user's own strength will naturally surge.</p><p></p><p>Now that Longming's divine nation had merged with his divine body, would the power of the Furnace Projection secret technique be further amplified? Coupled with his self-detonation, the possibilities were exhilarating.</p><p></p><p>Longming tried to activate the secret technique, but a hissing sound immediately followed. He had nearly ruined himself.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, his divine power had been completely drained. His originally towering 20-kilometer divine body had now hunched over, resembling a frail old man.</p><p></p><p>This level of consumption - was it something a mortal could use?</p><p></p><p>Worried about damaging his divine body, Longming immediately sat down to meditate and absorb the cosmic energy.</p><p></p><p>After several days of effort, he finally replenished his divine power, and his divine body was no longer hunched.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Heavenly Palace, Longming felt no joy from his divine nation's advancement or the success of his divine body's fusion. All he had was a deep sense of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh." Sensing the secret technique in his divine consciousness, Longming let out a heavy sigh. Having such a powerful secret technique yet being unable to use it - how could that not trouble him?</p><p></p><p>On the soft cushion, Longming composed himself and stopped dwelling on it. With a wave of his hand, he cleared away the mess left by the lightning strike.</p><p></p><p>Summoning the chat group panel, he then opened the marketplace, hoping to find treasures that could enhance his divine body and divine power. He couldn't give up on this incredible secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, his wishes were not granted, as the marketplace had nothing new to offer.</p><p></p><p>Longming could only close the marketplace with disappointment and summon the chat group panel again.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chen Beixuan and Han Xiao were chatting in the group.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

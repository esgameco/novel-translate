        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, boom! Thanos was rising up, and each of his punches could shatter a large group of robots into pieces.</p><p></p><p>The laser weapons of the robot army attacked him, but they just tickled him and couldn't break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>So Thanos charged and rampaged through the robot army, killing them in waves.</p><p></p><p>This went on for about ten minutes.</p><p></p><p>Thanos had killed the robot army down to less than a third.</p><p></p><p>He stopped and flew back to the small island piled with robot remains.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at Ultron with a provocative gaze.</p><p></p><p>Ultron also stopped at this point, tilting its head, its steel cheeks and scarlet electronic eyes staring at Thanos without any discernible emotion.</p><p></p><p>Clap, clap, clap! Suddenly, Ultron started clapping.</p><p></p><p>"You are indeed strong, you must be the boss of those two invaders before."</p><p></p><p>"But you've only killed some trash, is that useful?"</p><p></p><p>As Ultron said this, the Reality Stone on its chest lit up.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh, swoosh, swoosh, swoosh.</p><p></p><p>Rows of brand new robots appeared, even more than the ones Thanos had killed.</p><p></p><p>Ultron used the power of the Reality Stone to revive the robots that had been dismantled before, and not only that, it even added more robots based on that.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to kill more? I can make even more."</p><p></p><p>The electronic synthesized voice of Ultron, though devoid of any tone, sounded rather grating and mocking in Thanos' ears.</p><p></p><p>Thanos clenched his fist and charged recklessly.</p><p></p><p>On the beach, seeing the robots revive and even become more numerous, Doom exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>It was as if his heart had been wrenched, and he wailed, "How are we going to fight this?"</p><p></p><p>At this rate, they would never be able to kill them all, and in the end, they would be dragged down and killed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but start worrying about Thanos.</p><p></p><p>"This big guy, his brain really isn't as sharp as Hank Pym's."</p><p></p><p>Longming didn't pay any attention to the changing color of Doom's face next to him, and sighed.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Ultron was just trying to provoke Thanos, and even make Thanos lose his composure in the end, and then take him down.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed that Ultron had succeeded halfway.</p><p></p><p>The only thing missing was the right opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Longming had no intention of intervening. Thanos wanted to grow, so let him take a few losses, after all, Longming had a backup plan, Ultron couldn't turn the tables on them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Longming no longer focused on the battlefield, but closed his eyes and started meditating.</p><p></p><p>Longming: "Thanos being walked like a dog.AVI"</p><p></p><p>Longming even went so far as to record the scene of Thanos being "walked", and uploaded it to the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Hanxiao: "Your Majesty the group leader, can you get me a couple of those robots to disassemble and research?"</p><p></p><p>Hanxiao: "My mechanical army also needs some humanoid robots!"</p><p></p><p>Longming: "No problem, Hanxiao, have you carefully studied that golden finger of yours?"</p><p></p><p>Longming waved his hand and retrieved a few of Ultron's robots, packaging them and sending them to Hanxiao. The robots and the previous Iron Man Mark models weren't worth much, Longming paid the group points out of his own pocket to give them to his friend.</p><p></p><p>Hanxiao: "I couldn't figure it out, it seems to be more of a conceptual nature."</p><p></p><p>The two chatted back and forth.</p><p></p><p>On the island, Thanos was still mowing the grass.</p><p></p><p>Although Thanos was still able to take out a large group of robots with one punch, he was consciously heading towards Ultron's position.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ultron also understood Thanos' intention, and Thanos had the Power Stone, so head-on confrontation would definitely be to Ultron's disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>So Ultron kept commanding the robots to rush towards Thanos in waves, sending them to their deaths.</p><p></p><p>Trying to obstruct Thanos' advance and exhaust his strength.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was getting annoyed by the endless suicide squads, and his punching movements were starting to become numb.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at the beach and found that Longming didn't even care.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Take a look at the situation here.</p><p></p><p>It seems he has disappointed the group leader.</p><p></p><p>Thanos' impatient heart calmed down slightly.</p><p></p><p>He activated the Space Stone.</p><p></p><p>Thanos jumped into the portal and arrived directly above Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Thanos' fist was blocked.</p><p></p><p>The mechanical arms extended from Ultron's back blocked Thanos' fist.</p><p></p><p>"Nanotechnology." Thanos frowned, he really disliked nanotechnology.</p><p></p><p>Ultron's mechanical arms were made of nanotechnology. Although they were able to withstand Thanos' punch, the two arms were broken. But now they were visibly regenerating.</p><p></p><p>Ultron also flew away using the recoil force.</p><p></p><p>This close encounter with Ultron also made Thanos discover a problem - the Mind Stone on Ultron's forehead was gone.</p><p></p><p>When did it disappear?</p><p></p><p>Thanos didn't have time to think much about it, because he was greeted by a deluge of suicide robots.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was engulfed by the robots, and a metal cage instantly formed in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Not good."</p><p></p><p>Inside the metal cage, Thanos felt the robots trying to take off his Infinity Gauntlet.</p><p></p><p>He quickly activated the Power Stone to push the robots away.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he dispersed the robots, Thanos looked around, trying to find the robot that was making the mischief.</p><p></p><p>But all the robots looked the same, so Thanos' efforts were in vain.</p><p></p><p>After searching for a while without success, the purple glow on Thanos' body disappeared, and the Power Stone's power receded.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the Stone's power completely dissipated,</p><p></p><p>Click. Thanos' clenching fist action stopped, no, it would be more accurate to say that Thanos' entire body was frozen motionless.</p><p></p><p>He had been immobilized, only his eyes could still move.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was suddenly immobilized, both surprised and angry.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Ebony Maw's words, he had been ambushed!</p><p></p><p>Damn it, he had embarrassed himself in front of the group leader.</p><p></p><p>Ultron slowly flew in front of Thanos, accompanied by the bald Charles.</p><p></p><p>"Charles, can you just kill him?"</p><p></p><p>"No, his willpower is too strong. If it weren't for the Mind Stone empowering me, and the moment the Power Stone's power receded, I wouldn't have been able to control him."</p><p></p><p>Listening to the conversation between the man and the machine, Thanos deeply regretted. He should have listened to the group leader and not relied too much on the power of the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>Ultron didn't care about Thanos at all. It extended its mechanical arms and removed the Power Stone and Space Stone from the Infinity Gauntlet.</p><p></p><p>It installed them one by one on its battle armor.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with a wave of its hand, the Mind Stone in Charles' hand flew out and was embedded in the last empty slot.</p><p></p><p>Without the Mind Stone's empowerment, Charles could no longer control Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Thanos immediately broke free of the control, and punched towards Charles.</p><p></p><p>At such a short distance, the powerless Charles could not dodge, and his head was completely smashed.</p><p></p><p>After killing Charles, Thanos turned his body and kicked towards Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Clang! The sound of metal clashing rang out.</p><p></p><p>Thanos only felt that he had kicked an immovable metal wall, his full-force kick was easily blocked by Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Why didn't it save its companion? A figure flashed in front of Thanos' eyes, moving at an extremely fast speed, and Thanos couldn't react in time.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It was Ultron, Ultron kicked Thanos back, and this kick sent Thanos flying into the sea with great force.</p><p></p><p>The huge waves raised splashed quickly towards the shore.</p><p></p><p>Doom, who had been closely watching the situation, now had a deathly pale face.</p><p></p><p>The Purple One has lost, and lost so thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Then they are also done for, he knew there was no chance of escape left.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

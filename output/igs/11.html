        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar exited the breakthrough secret realm and had just returned to the resting room when he heard a series of prompt messages in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations on clearing the first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, rewarding 550 points.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations on clearing the second floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, rewarding 1,100 points.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations on clearing the third floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, rewarding 2,200 points.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Congratulations on clearing the fifty-first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, rewarding 220 million points.]</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations on clearing the fifty-first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, unlocking the purchase permission for the fifty-first floor items in the chat group mall.]</p><p></p><p>Clearing the Subduing Dragon Tower is only calculated after exiting the breakthrough secret realm.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the nearly 5 billion points in the chat group account and nodded in satisfaction. It seems that in the future, the main source of points for the group members will be from secret realm breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the reward of points, clearing the tower also rewarded many things that Dragon Roar couldn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Things like the Silent Giant Banana, the Pink Pig-branded Hair Dryer, the Ineffective Hemostatic Patch, and dozens of other items.</p><p></p><p>In the room, Dragon Roar studied a round ball for a while, but really couldn't figure it out, so he simply stored all these items into his World Ring.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Dragon Roar reopened the chat group panel.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why is it the fifty-first floor, not the fiftieth?"</p><p></p><p>Cleared the fifty-first floor? Wasn't he just defeated in the breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>Reread the chat group information a few times, Dragon Roar confirmed that he had not seen it wrong.</p><p></p><p>This made Dragon Roar puzzled, "Could it be that Senior Purple Yang finally let go?"</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he got some benefits out of it, so whatever.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar summoned the chat group and clicked the mall button in the top left corner to enter.</p><p></p><p>Before going to clear the Subduing Dragon Tower, the chat group mall only had the ten thousand sets of standard equipment he had pawned. But now, it was full of rare and precious items.</p><p></p><p>Saphire Water Ink Crystal, Golden Tide Ice Marrow, Earth Treasure Stone Tree, Heaven Eye Pearl, Underworld Heaven Iron - "I want them all." Looking at the shelves in the mall, there were all kinds of rare and precious items, making Dragon Roar drool.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to scroll down, the appearance of an item made Dragon Roar's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lotus Fruit! This is the treasure Dragon Roar has been seeking.</p><p></p><p>Due to the lack of guidance, Dragon Roar had arduously raised his body to the 50-fold life gene level, and because he walked the Dao path, even though he had now reached the Immortal King realm, his divine body was only about 1 kilometer tall.</p><p></p><p>It was a high attack but fragile build.</p><p></p><p>Since his divine body had not reached his ideal, he had also been suppressing the advancement of his inner world to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lotus Fruit sold in the mall, according to the description, is a treasure that can double one's life genes.</p><p></p><p>[Golden Lotus Fruit: Eating it can double your life genes.]</p><p>[Only effective for those below 50-fold life gene level.]</p><p>[Only effective the first time consumed.]</p><p></p><p>"Just what I need!" Dragon Roar did not hesitate further and immediately clicked to purchase, not minding the high price of 100 million points at all.</p><p></p><p>This kind of treasure is exactly what he can use, and you never know when it will be refreshed in the mall, if he misses this chance, he'll have to find a place to cry.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the Golden Lotus Fruit floating in his World Ring, Dragon Roar fell into a dilemma. Now, two paths lay before him.</p><p></p><p>First is the Dao path, he has already reached the Immortal King realm on this path, as long as he continues to deepen his comprehension of the Dao, he can continue to improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The second is the Divine Power path. Now that he has the Golden Lotus Fruit, who knows if the mall will refresh more treasures to boost his life gene level in the future. But the Divine Power path is too difficult, his millions of years of effort has only raised him to the 50-fold life gene level.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar has a scale in his heart. If he can walk through the Divine Power path, it will be stronger than the Dao path, and not just a little bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Yang Spear Saint he encountered on the fifty-first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, if there's no accident, should be a powerful cultivator on the Divine Power path.</p><p></p><p>Hesitating is not his style.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar took out the Golden Lotus Fruit and took a big bite.</p><p></p><p>"Only children make choices, I want it all!"</p><p></p><p>"I want to walk the path of the Laws, and I also want to walk the path of divine power!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lotus Fruit didn't have much flavor, melting as soon as it entered his mouth. As soon as the Golden Lotus Fruit went down, Dragon Roar felt a warm current flowing through his entire body.</p><p></p><p>After the warm current, there was intense pain.</p><p></p><p>The process of his life genes making a quantum leap, every cell in his body felt like it was being torn apart. </p><p></p><p>There is a pain that reaches the depths of the soul, and this is what Dragon Roar was feeling now.</p><p></p><p>Ten years.</p><p>Hundred years. </p><p>Thousand years.</p><p></p><p>This tearing pain lasted for a full thousand years, every moment of it.</p><p></p><p>"It's finally over." On the throne, Dragon Roar let out a long sigh of relief, the thousand years had been truly arduous.</p><p></p><p>But the thousand years of hardship was worth it, Dragon Roar could feel the surging power of his divine body, feeling refreshed and clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>His life gene level had directly risen to 100 times.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar teleported out of the room, appearing in the void of space, in a desolate star system.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ The desolate star system erupted in dazzling light, bursting forth in a final brilliant blaze.</p><p></p><p>With just a single punch, without using any Laws power, relying solely on brute force, Dragon Roar destroyed the blue supergiant star at the center.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation had not increased, the strength of his divine body had more than doubled. His power had doubled as well.</p><p></p><p>"It seems my plan was correct, the next step should be to choose to ascend to the Divine Realm." In the void of space, Dragon Roar was very satisfied with his accomplishment. And he had also clearly defined his next step, which was to build an invincible Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was crucial to his future path, he couldn't be careless about it.</p><p></p><p>In the initial period after becoming immortal, he had felt a bit lost about the next step.</p><p></p><p>Until the chat group was activated, especially after seeing Thanos join the group.</p><p></p><p>Then he had an idea - he would emulate the Marvel Universe, where the Infinity Stones formed the basis of a vast universe.</p><p></p><p>He would use the Five Elements Laws as the foundation, and build upon that.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the limit, his Divine Realm would surely undergo a transformation.</p><p></p><p>He looked forward to the day when his Divine Realm could also evolve into a universe! Thinking of this, Dragon Roar waved his hand, extinguishing the blaze of the blue supergiant star.</p><p></p><p>The test was complete, he teleported away from the desolate star system.</p><p></p><p>Before long, he returned to the Dragon Roar Water Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"A thousand years have passed, I wonder how the few in the group are doing." </p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar summoned the chat group interface and checked the chat history of Ge Xiaolun and the others, finding that only a year had passed.</p><p></p><p>From the activation of the chat group until now, only a year had passed - it seems the function of the chat group was in effect, the time flow for the group members was different.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years, he was really worried they might have all died of old age.</p><p></p><p>"Chat group, is the time flow here 1:1000 for me?"</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The time flow for each group member is not fixed, it can be adjusted based on their strength.]</p><p></p><p>[Ding! After detection, the default time flow on your side is 1:1000.]</p><p></p><p>[Your current adjustable upper limit is 1:5000, do you need to adjust the time flow?]</p><p></p><p>"Leave it as is for now."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ge Xiaolun and the others were still alive relieved Dragon Roar's worries. He instructed the chat group to maintain the current 1:1000 time flow ratio.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm, it seems I should find an opportunity to go to the Marvel Universe and study those six Infinity Stones."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar didn't know the specific timeline of the others. In the battle arena a thousand years ago, Thanos already had four Infinity Stones. </p><p></p><p>Now that Thanos is still alive, he doesn't know which time period he's in - if Thanos has already destroyed them, that would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"It seems going to the Marvel world should be moved up on the agenda."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

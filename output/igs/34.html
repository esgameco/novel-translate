        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Jingxin Palace, a side hall of the Juntiandian Palace.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming and Wu Yin were sitting across the table from each other.</p><p></p><p>The Jingxin Palace was fresh and elegant, with a classical and refined decoration. There were two rows of bookshelves along the wall, filled with books, giving the whole room the feel of a scholar's study.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming and Wu Yin did not speak, they just held their teacups and sipped the tea slowly.</p><p></p><p>The memories of his past life still had a great influence on Long Ming. Many of the items in the empire were made by him based on his past life.</p><p></p><p>For example, the ceramic teacups they were holding and the tea in them, as well as many other things.</p><p></p><p>It was silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin broke the silence and spoke first.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, just tell me what's the matter, I will do it without any hesitation."</p><p></p><p>The tea was good, and after drinking it, he could feel his body warming up.</p><p></p><p>Based on his understanding of the Holy Master, if he called him over and was in no hurry to drink the tea, it meant it was not an urgent matter. But just sitting there silently was not a good solution either.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, you are still impatient, just like when you were young and reckless."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Long Ming's words, Wu Yin did not refute, but only muttered to himself in his heart, "If I'm not reckless, how can I suppress those little bastards?" He raised the teacup and took a sip, then continued.</p><p></p><p>"Just tell me, don't beat around the bush, that's not like your style, Your Majesty."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big deal, I just need to go into seclusion for a while, and I'd like you to keep an eye on some of the affairs of the empire."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin heard this with great puzzlement and blurted out, "Seclusion? Didn't you just come out of seclusion not long ago?"</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Holy Master has another breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, have you broken through again?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, you're overthinking it. Breakthroughs don't come that easily. I have other matters to attend to."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay, you go then, I'll take care of everything in the empire, these old bones of mine can still hold up for a while."</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin's expression was serious, and he agreed to Long Ming's request without any conditions.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Old Wu. I'll leave shortly. I'll place the Wuji Universe on the first suspension, and I'll give you access permissions. You'll have to work hard to oversee the upcoming construction and deployment."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming used his divine sense to transfer part of the authority of the Wuji Universe to Wu Yin, and also handed over Ao Chuang to him, asking him to help train it.</p><p></p><p>If Ao Chuang could cultivate, it would not be in vain that he brought it across the universe.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, I'll take my leave now. The little ones in the palace are also in your care."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming finished his instructions and teleported away. He did not reveal the purpose of his seclusion, even if he told Wu Yin, the old friend would not be able to provide much help. It's better not to say it, so as not to add to his worries.</p><p></p><p>Outside the planet, Long Ming took out his own mount, the Moqi Number.</p><p></p><p>The Moqi Number was black in color, streamlined in shape, with feathers extending from the tail of the spacecraft. The overall shape looked exceptionally majestic, coupled with the matte black color, like a ruthless hunter in the dark night.</p><p></p><p>The cabin door opened automatically, and Long Ming flew into the spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome back, master."</p><p></p><p>A black dragon projection appeared in the spacecraft, this was the artificial intelligence of the Moqi Number spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Long Ming's return, it came out to welcome him immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Moqi, it's been a while."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming smiled and greeted Moqi. Since he had the teleportation ability after becoming an Immortal King, he hadn't ridden the Moqi Number for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Patting Moqi's head, Long Ming apologized.</p><p></p><p>"Moqi, let's go back to the Quantiangong."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>Wearing a long robe with crescent moons, Long Ming sat in the control room chair. On the control panel screen, Moqi twisted its body to operate the spacecraft. After a while, it reappeared on Long Ming's shoulder, revealing a humanized smile, "Master, shall I turn on the external simulation? The spacecraft has entered the dark universe."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"No need, there's nothing interesting to see in the dark universe," Dragon Roar refused.</p><p></p><p>In the dark universe, there are only flashes of light when the energy flows collide, which look somewhat like fireflies. Apart from that, it's very dull. The first time you see it, you might find it surprising, but after seeing it many times, you won't feel interested at all.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>"Master, the spaceship's speed has reached 10 times the speed of light. It will take five months to reach the Quantiangong."</p><p></p><p>After playing with the Ink Dragon for a while, Dragon Roar found it boring to just sit in the spaceship, and there was still one month until they reached their destination. So he opened the chat group to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>Since he had set the chat group's time flow to the fastest 1:5000 ratio, the fifty years that had passed in the chat group did not feel very long.</p><p></p><p>When he opened the chat group, he saw that Ge Xiao Lun and the others were chatting.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "@Chen Beixuan, brother, do you still have any spirit stones? Can you sell me a few more?"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "The two spirit stones you sold me last time turned into powder before I could even finish examining them. I'm so frustrated!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "I don't have any left. My cultivation level is still not high, and spirit stones are not abundant for me. The two I gave you before were the most I could spare."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "But they didn't even absorb the spiritual energy inside. How did they turn into powder?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Is it possible that the different worlds caused those spirit stones to scatter and eventually shatter?"</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "I couldn't even use the Reality Stone and Time Stone to restore the spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar reviewed the chat history, and from the conversation of the four, it was not difficult to see that the Venerable Chen Beixuan, who had the Seven-Orifice Profound Heart, got along well with Han Xiao and the others, and seemed to have integrated into the chat group.</p><p></p><p>As for the spirit stones they were currently discussing, Dragon Roar also became interested in them.</p><p></p><p>He had once longed for cultivation, spirit stones, and the like. Riding the sword through the wind, exorcising demons in the world - that was the dream of his previous life.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, he had also searched for them in the universe, but it seemed that in this universe, he could not find such things.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "It's been a long time, everyone!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "@Chen Beixuan, can you spare me a spirit stone? I'll give you something in exchange."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar didn't hide anything, he went straight to the point. He wanted a spirit stone to collect.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, in the classroom of the Business School at Blue Star University.</p><p></p><p>The professor on the podium was lecturing passionately, spitting saliva everywhere, while Chen Beixuan was lying on the desk, his mind immersed in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was quite surprised that the mysterious group owner finally spoke up, but then he saw that the group owner also wanted a spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>From the time he was reborn and joined the chat group until now, it had been half a year.</p><p></p><p>In this half year, he not only got to know the other three people in the group well, but also understood them to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun was simple-minded and had no hidden motives. He would be good to whoever was good to him, a very nice person.</p><p></p><p>Thanos had a bit of cunning, his strength was also decent, but he had recently indulged in the "Gentle Realm," and according to him, he had snapped his fingers to eliminate half the life in the universe not long ago. He could be considered a person with determination and the ability to execute.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao was extremely powerful, no less than Chen Beixuan's previous cultivation level, and his intelligence was also exceptional. Although he was a bit Machiavellian, overall he was still a person worth befriending.</p><p></p><p>The only one he knew little about was this mysterious group owner. Except for the initial contact when he first joined the group, he knew nothing else about him, only that according to Han Xiao and Thanos, the group owner's strength was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, since he could make the powerful Han Xiao so trusting, he must not be inferior.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan's eyes flashed with a hint of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Now that he saw the group owner wanted a spirit stone, Chen Beixuan didn't hesitate and directly took out a spirit stone to send to him, considering it as the reward for the battle armor he had previously collected from him.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan, he was not the kind of person who would owe favors to others!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

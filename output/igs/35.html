        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After receiving the spirit stone from Chen Beixuan, Long Ming also sent him a little trinket in return.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Long Ming wanted to send a weapon back to Chen Beixuan, but after thinking about it, since his side was science fiction and Chen Beixuan's side was immortal cultivation, the weapon might not be compatible.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Long Ming sent him a specialty of the Sun and Moon Empire - a star soul crystal. After refining the star soul crystal, it can enhance one's physical qualities.</p><p></p><p>When sending it over, he also included instructions on how to use it. This item would be quite good for the current Chen Beixuan.</p><p></p><p>After chatting with a few people in the group for a while, Long Ming then closed the chat group and logged off.</p><p></p><p>"The energy is indeed different."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming looked at the spirit stone in the palm of his right hand, probing it with his divine sense and studying it for a while. He found that the spiritual energy within it was completely different from the energy system of this world, fundamentally different in essence.</p><p></p><p>It was like one being water and the other being oil - both are liquids, but the essence is different.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming gathered divine power in his left hand, and soon formed a crystal the same size as the spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>He placed the two precious stones together.</p><p></p><p>"Huh!"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that the spirit stone was undergoing a strange phenomenon, not the dissipation of spiritual energy that Han Xiao had mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Rather, the spiritual energy within the spirit stone was being gradually assimilated by the cosmic energy, as if the cosmic energy crystal he had created was accelerating this process.</p><p></p><p>The more abundant the energy, the faster the assimilation speed? Long Ming thoughtfully moved the cosmic crystal away, and sure enough, the moment he did so, the speed of spiritual energy assimilation slowed down significantly.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it would take at least a day for the spiritual energy in this spirit stone to be completely assimilated. And in the end, when the spirit stone lost the spiritual energy support, it would turn into a pile of powder.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the collection item from being damaged, Long Ming quickly sealed it and put it away.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Long Ming instructed the ink dragon on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Ink dragon, simulate a resting room."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the order, the ink dragon happily carried it out.</p><p></p><p>A flash of light passed, and the technology-filled spacecraft control room transformed into a resting room filled with incense.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the remaining time, Long Ming took out the Infinite Universe and continued to add his own insights into the laws.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by like a white colt, and a month passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we are about to arrive at the Quantiangong."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the reminder from the ink dragon, Long Ming stopped his movements and put away the Infinite Universe.</p><p></p><p>He stood up from the seat, stretching his body, feeling a bit tired after the past month.</p><p></p><p>Continuously adding his own insights into the laws to the Infinite Universe for a month, especially after the previous fifty years of additions, had reached a certain level. Now, even if he wanted to continue, it would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>For now, he could only add this much. Everything else would have to wait until after his divine kingdom's advancement.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, decelerate and exit the dark universe."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Ink Dragon, also cancel the room simulation."</p><p></p><p>Following Long Ming's commands, the spacecraft shook slightly, which was the normal vibration when exiting the dark universe.</p><p></p><p>Hum~ In the dazzling star clouds, the Ink Dragon suddenly appeared. Its sudden appearance caused a slight disturbance in the newborn stars nestled in the star clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Ink Dragon, go to this location."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming entered a set of coordinates on the control panel, the place where he planned to place the Infinite Universe.</p><p></p><p>The spacecraft started up and flew towards the coordinates. It didn't take long before it arrived.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Arrived at the destination.</p><p></p><p>This was a vast void, with no galaxies or planets within a range of thousands of light-years. This was the battlefield left behind from his previous battle with an imperial enemy.</p><p></p><p>That battle had annihilated everything around it.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it had taken him tremendous effort to finally slay that enemy.</p><p></p><p>Now that such a large area was cleared out, it was the perfect place to place the Boundless Universe.</p><p></p><p>Longming began setting up the restrictive spells. He had previously considered placing the Boundless Universe in the interlayer of the universe space, but later felt it was not safe enough, so he abandoned that idea.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, he decided to just place it directly in the primordial universe.</p><p></p><p>Longming had a vague feeling that placing a medium-sized universe in the primordial universe would bring unexpected benefits.</p><p></p><p>It was an obscure, ethereal, and elusive feeling.</p><p></p><p>Longming took out the Boundless Universe and threw it forward.</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Universe left Longming's hand and rapidly expanded, reaching the size of a light-year in just a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>Moments later, the Boundless Universe had fully unfolded, reaching a size of over a hundred light-years.</p><p></p><p>If someone had been tall enough, they could have seen the Boundless Universe floating quietly in the vast universe, like a giant egg.</p><p></p><p>Longming approached the wall of the Boundless Universe and lifted it with one hand.</p><p></p><p>The position of the unfolded Boundless Universe was not ideal, so he needed to move it.</p><p></p><p>After a few teleportations, he arrived at the edge of the empty area, finally stopping there.</p><p></p><p>The edge was close to the central galactic stream, where stray laws would occasionally emanate from the center, allowing the Boundless Universe to naturally absorb and replenish the laws, preventing it from being drained.</p><p></p><p>After properly placing the Boundless Universe, Longming stood at the outer edge, continuously releasing flashes of multicolored starlight.</p><p></p><p>Longming was setting up restrictive spells. Since the Boundless Universe was not hidden and was placed directly in the primordial universe, proper protection was necessary.</p><p></p><p>This entire setup took a hundred years. During this time, Longming worked tirelessly, finally completing the restrictive spells over an area of over a hundred light-years.</p><p></p><p>Admiring his handiwork, Longming nodded in satisfaction, confident that no one weaker than him could break through the restrictive spells and enter the Boundless Universe.</p><p></p><p>It's done.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, I might even set up some formations, like the Illusion Formation, the Concealment Formation, the Killing Formation, and so on!" Longming thought, standing next to a blue supergiant star. He felt this plan was feasible.</p><p></p><p>As for where to get the formations, he could just trade with his group members. There was already a Cultivator named Chen Beixuan in the group, and in the future, if more Cultivators joined, he wouldn't lack for formations.</p><p></p><p>As for the spirit stones needed to set up the formations, he wouldn't use spirit stones. He would improve the formations and use cosmic crystals as the power source instead. He was confident that formations didn't only work with spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After envisioning the future, Longming moved the nearby blue supergiant star away, as it was too close to the Boundless Universe and might accidentally touch the restrictive spells he had just set up.</p><p></p><p>After clearing the area around the Boundless Universe, Longming teleported back to the Mochi Ship and ordered it to head towards the Heavenly Palace Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the ship, Longming looked back at the Boundless Universe he had invested so much effort into, and couldn't help but marvel at the wonders of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Boundless Universe was once a fragile pocket universe, after upgrading to a medium-sized universe, its strength had increased exponentially. If it were to further evolve into a large-scale world in the future, who knows what it would be like.</p><p></p><p>Turning around, he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>The twinkling stars were rapidly receding behind the speeding ship.</p><p></p><p>The stars filled his vision. It was time to do the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm's ascension would happen today! (End of this chapter)</p>

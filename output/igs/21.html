        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"Thanos, go take care of those three guys. The main target is coming."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming quickly returned to his seat, reaching out to pat Thanos and casually dispelling the illusion on him.</p><p></p><p>In his spiritual perception, their target Ultron was approaching with people, which was also the reason he didn't want to continue playing with Tony Stark.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the guys who killed his subordinates and stole his things were coming, Thanos immediately stood up.</p><p></p><p>The four people who had been closely watching Long Ming's side, who were already disheartened by Tony Stark's death, especially the villainous Avengers trio, had no more will to fight. Now their only thought was how to quickly escape.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the originally normal person suddenly turn into such a big purple being, their fear grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>However, now they wanted to escape, but were blocked by Doctor Doom.</p><p></p><p>The three people were blocking Doctor Doom in front, and now Doctor Doom was blocking them, the roles had reversed.</p><p></p><p>"Now's the chance!" The cowardly Hank Pym was very cunning, he had always been shirking work, and now he found an opportunity, decisively shrinking his body to the smallest size.</p><p></p><p>The villainous trio each had their own schemes, and as soon as Hank Pym made a move, Captain America and Black Widow also acted.</p><p></p><p>First was Captain America, he threw his shield with all his might, but the target was not Doctor Doom, but Black Widow beside him.</p><p></p><p>As long as the shield hit Black Widow and pushed her towards Doctor Doom, suddenly being attacked, Doctor Doom must have a moment of pause, and he was confident that he could escape the battlefield in that instant and flee.</p><p></p><p>However, Black Widow was no pushover either. She had already prepared for Captain America's move.</p><p></p><p>Just as the shield was flying over, Black Widow twisted her waist and dodged the shield in a strange posture, then grabbed the shield with both hands in a posture that defied human form.</p><p></p><p>Then, following the momentum, she threw it to another side, where there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ a dull impact sound, Hank Pym's figure appeared, collapsing on the ground, groaning in pain.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that although Hank Pym could shrink very small to escape, the smaller he was, the harder he was to detect, but the distance he wanted to escape would increase geometrically.</p><p></p><p>This was also Black Widow's strategy, after throwing the shield, she did not look back, but fled along with Captain America.</p><p></p><p>Doctor Doom walked up to Hank Pym, sighing, "Damn, let that guy get away."</p><p></p><p>Captain America and Black Widow were so decisive, all of this happened in the blink of an eye. Now their figures were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>There was no choice, Doctor Doom could only kick Hank Pym a few times to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Thanos received Long Ming's order and just as he stood up, he saw the two fleeing people.</p><p></p><p>Without saying anything, he jumped in the direction he judged.</p><p></p><p>Boom~ the dust settled, and Thanos' figure was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"That Thanos, his power control still needs to be improved." Under the parasol, Long Ming waved his hand to disperse Thanos' exhaust, making a sarcastic remark.</p><p></p><p>The aura Thanos released at the moment of his jump made Doctor Doom's whole body pause, feeling his breathing was a bit difficult.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing Long Ming's words, Doctor Doom fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Just a little bit of sand and gravel, and the power control is not good enough?</p><p></p><p>Then isn't he just a piece of trash?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the traces left by his previous battle with the villainous Avengers trio, the originally self-satisfied him was now not doing well.</p><p></p><p>"Am I a demolition team?" Doctor Doom muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, he shook off the unusual emotions.</p><p></p><p>He took a rope from his waist.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese text you provided:</p><p></p><p>They packed up the ant-sized people on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Of course, before packing them up, he had already cleaned out all the Pym particles from Hank Pym's body, even tearing a large hole in Hank Pym's battle suit.</p><p></p><p>Having finally caught this villain, he naturally wouldn't give Hank Pym a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>After packing him up, Lord Doom gave him another two kicks, and the unconscious Hank Pym let out a muffled groan, with a trickle of fresh blood at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Thanos easily caught up to the fleeing Black Widow, without any nonsense, just delivering a resounding slap. A palm as big as a fan slapped Black Widow on the head, and she had no time to react before the loud smack sent her splattering against the wall, dead as could be.</p><p></p><p>Thanos didn't linger, jumping up again and heading towards Captain America.</p><p></p><p>Captain America, the super-soldier serum recipient, with his superior physique, had fled much farther than Black Widow.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was hiding on the rooftop of an abandoned building, and the reason he was on the rooftop was, of course, to better observe the enemy situation.</p><p></p><p>On the rooftop, Captain America saw that there were no pursuers on the ground, and the sense of unease in his heart subsided a little.</p><p></p><p>The dramatic ups and downs he had experienced in such a short time had left him restless inside.</p><p></p><p>After confirming there were no pursuers, Captain America emerged from the shadows and came to the extended eaves of the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon soared into the sky - no, wait, it was daytime, so the sun was soaring into the sky.</p><p></p><p>And so, Captain America proceeded to block the sun, up and down.</p><p></p><p>This was a habit of Captain America's. Whenever his emotions had a sudden and drastic change, he couldn't help but indulge this inner restlessness, and he had to do this to find relief.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was a side effect of the super-soldier serum.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, while Captain America was comfortably doing this, he heard a sound from behind him, but this was a critical moment, and he couldn't stop, so he just glanced back to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>And what he saw was alarming.</p><p></p><p>He was terrified, because at the edge of his vision, there was a purple titan.</p><p></p><p>Captain America decisively jumped off the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>A five-story drop, but he wouldn't be harmed by that.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he hit the ground, Captain America darted like a rabbit through the abandoned buildings, trying to confuse the enemy's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>But would this work? Clearly not.</p><p></p><p>Thanos stood on the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>Watching the fleeing figure, he felt a wave of nausea.</p><p></p><p>He had seen Captain America's previous actions, and Thanos felt his eyes had been polluted by this guy.</p><p></p><p>The Infinity Gauntlet glowed with purple light.</p><p></p><p>Thanos flew to Captain America's overhead and delivered a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>A silent explosion, and a crater over a kilometer in diameter appeared, as if struck by a meteor. Within the crater range, all the buildings were reduced to powder, and at the very center, Captain America was, of course, dead as could be.</p><p></p><p>After landing the punch, Thanos didn't even bother to look back, just walked away.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he returned to the beach.</p><p></p><p>Taking two steps to reach Doom's side, he patted his shoulder, "You did well, how about joining my army?"</p><p></p><p>Thanos spoke, ignoring Doom's dazed expression, and reached down to pick up the unconscious Hank Pym.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing Hank Pym's head with one hand.</p><p></p><p>Squeezing hard.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Like a watermelon bursting.</p><p></p><p>The action was swift and decisive.</p><p></p><p>The main members of the Villain Avengers Alliance were all dead! (End of this chapter)</p>

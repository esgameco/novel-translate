        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since we're all in the group chat, there will be plenty of time to ask questions later.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, asking Xu Xian now won't get us any useful information anyway, as everything ultimately depends on his wife, the White Snake, Bai Suzhen.</p><p></p><p>From the looks of it, Xu Xian has gone offline to verify something, so the next time he comes back online, we should be able to get some information from him.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan is calculating how he should conduct future transactions with Xu Xian's side, or rather, with Xu Xian's wife. </p><p></p><p>As for using the time travel talisman to go back, Chen Beixuan thinks it's better to listen to the group leader's advice. He doesn't quite understand Xu Xian's world, so it's best not to venture there.</p><p></p><p>While Chen Beixuan was conversing with Xu Xian, Long Ming also entered the arena to join the commotion. Besides wanting to see what the person who said "East of the river for thirty years, west of the river for thirty years" looks like, he's also curious about the Dou Qi that Xiao Yan cultivates.</p><p></p><p>In Long Ming's impression, Dou Qi is supposed to be multicolored and very cool-looking when unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Xiao Yan's nickname in the group, he has already reached adulthood, and his cultivation should be at least at the Dou Wang level.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun has now stabilized at the 15th floor of the Fulong Tower, so it's unclear who is stronger between him and Xiao Yan.</p><p></p><p>On the observation platform, Long Ming and Han Xiao were watching the battle below with great interest.</p><p></p><p>In the arena, Ge Xiaolun and Xiao Yan had already gone through one round of exchange, testing each other's abilities.</p><p></p><p>Now the two stood a hundred meters apart, facing off.</p><p></p><p>After the initial exchange, Ge Xiaolun had a rough understanding of Xiao Yan's strength. Seeing that Xiao Yan didn't make a move, Ge Xiaolun decided to take the initiative and summoned the Void Engine Great Sword, charging straight at him.</p><p></p><p>Facing Ge Xiaolun's rapid approach, Xiao Yan raised his Mysterious Heavy Spear to meet the attack.</p><p></p><p>Clang! After a fierce clash, neither side gained the upper hand, and both were sent flying back over ten meters.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xiao Yan regained his footing, a semi-transparent energy began to swirl around his hand. Once it had gathered enough power, he unleashed it towards Ge Xiaolun, while also activating his Explosive Step to rush forward.</p><p></p><p>On the observation platform, Han Xiao noticed Xiao Yan's Dou Qi and remarked to Long Ming, "Your Excellency the Group Leader, this Dou Qi looks a bit diffuse, almost like Western-style magic."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, being diffuse has its advantages. Look at the range of Xiao Yan's attacks, it's quite large," Long Ming replied.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming also observed Xiao Yan's attacks. The Dou Qi was indeed scattered, not very condensed, like a light, airy mist. If it could be compressed into a liquid or solid form, the effects would likely be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The Dou Qi quality seemed average, but the attack range was truly vast, the energy dispersing like bursting fireworks and completely blocking Ge Xiaolun's retreat routes.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan's Explosive Step was also quite interesting. By relying on the explosive force of energy, he could significantly increase his speed, but Long Ming could see the drawback - it consumed a lot of energy and could only be used as a burst of power.</p><p></p><p>In the arena, faced with the raging Dou Qi flames, Ge Xiaolun remained calm. He activated his Heroic Core, defining the surrounding space as void.</p><p></p><p>The flames that struck Ge Xiaolun's void instantly fizzled out, like fireworks withering after their bloom.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xiao Yan had already leapt into the air, his Mysterious Heavy Spear swinging down.</p><p></p><p>"Flame-Dividing Crashing Wave Spear!" The spear's tip was trailing orange Dou Qi, carrying the force to cleave mountains and waves as it struck towards Ge Xiaolun.</p><p></p><p>Even as he attacked with the spear, Xiao Yan also opened his mouth to unleash a "Tiger Shattering Golden Roar".</p><p></p><p>This was a technique he had learned at the Jalan Academy.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sound wave combat, the roars of lions and tigers, all beasts submit, possessing the great power to shatter gold and shake the soul.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan wanted to use this to slightly intimidate Ge Xiaolun, so that he would not be able to react and counterattack in time. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But how could Ge Xiaolun let Xiao Yan have his way? He had long anticipated this move.</p><p></p><p>He activated his male core, opening a micro-insect tunnel to teleport himself away from the original location. This micro-insect tunnel teleportation technique was something he had learned after upgrading to the fourth-generation divine body, for which he had spent nearly half a year.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was preparing to upgrade to the fifth-generation divine body, using the micro-insect tunnel teleportation was very easy for him.</p><p></p><p>With Ge Xiaolun's teleportation, all of Xiao Yan's attacks missed.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency the group leader, can someone like me who is on the technology side cultivate battle qi? If my silly players could cultivate it, it would be quite interesting, wouldn't it?"</p><p></p><p>In the spectator stands, Han Xiao sighed thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Your Excellency the group leader, look, Xiao Yan has grown a pair of wings on his back."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Xiao noticed the change on the field and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.</p><p></p><p>On the field, Xiao Yan evaded Ge Xiaolun's attack, and suddenly a pair of semi-transparent energy wings grew on his back, and he flew up, his speed quite fast. "Each world has its own laws and Dao, and it may not be possible to cultivate in other worlds. As for Xiao Yan growing wings, this move is called 'Battle Qi Wings', and it can only be used by Dou Kings."</p><p></p><p>"His world also seems to have another move called 'Battle Qi Horse', which is said to be extremely powerful and can only be used by Dou Emperor experts."</p><p></p><p>Recalling his past memories, Long Ming vaguely remembered something like that. What was it again?</p><p></p><p>Long Ming pondered for a few seconds, recalling a bit.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that there were two powerful experts chasing each other, and one of them, in a fit of anger, shouted, "Does the Dou Emperor expert in front dare to dismount and fight? Clearly, it was the Dou Emperor expert who used the 'Battle Qi Horse', showing that the one who shouted angrily was a Dou Emperor expert who could not use this technique."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that there were even stronger techniques, Han Xiao's eyes lit up, and his curiosity grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming and Han Xiao chatted on the spectator stands, while below, Ge Xiaolun and Xiao Yan were fighting fiercely.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were playing a turn-based game, with one attacking and the other defending, then switching roles.</p><p></p><p>Although the scene was magnificent, it became a bit boring after watching for a while.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging greetings, Long Ming and Han Xiao left the training field.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Yan has been seen, and his battle qi has also been witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Staying to watch the novices fight each other has little meaning. </p><p></p><p>If there's nothing important, it's better to go back and restore the divine body.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the training field, Long Ming quickly browsed through the chat history and didn't find anything important.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he also saw that Chen Beixuan was still online.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Chen Beixuan, don't just focus on Xu Xian's world, the other new member who joined the group, his world should also be related to cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Are you talking about that Vixen Troublemaker, Your Excellency the group leader?"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "That's right, the 'Vixen Troublemaker' vixen should refer to a fox spirit. Since there is such a description, it's not difficult to see that it's a world from mythological stories. I think your world should also have related story books."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Thank you for the reminder, Your Excellency the group leader!"</p><p></p><p>On the Blue Star, Chen Beixuan was enlightened, although Long Ming did not directly say which world it was.</p><p></p><p>But he immediately stood up from his chair and headed towards the school library.</p><p></p><p>And behind him, there was a small tail quietly following.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

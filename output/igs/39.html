        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't find what he wanted in the shopping mall just now, when he opened the chat group, he didn't immediately go through the chat history.</p><p></p><p>Although Long Ming had spent more than a thousand years integrating his divine soul into the national flower, and he had set the chat group's time flow speed to the maximum, he had still accumulated a lot of chat records. However, he couldn't be bothered to go through them now.</p><p></p><p>He posted a casual greeting in the chat group, feeling a bit indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao and Chen Beixuan, who were in the middle of a discussion, stopped their debate when they saw Long Ming's message.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan, Han Xiao: "Greetings, Your Majesty the Group Owner!"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "En, what were you two discussing?"</p><p></p><p>Although Long Ming hadn't checked the chat history, just looking at the latest two messages from the two, he could tell they were debating something.</p><p></p><p>He was quite curious about this, after all, among the current four group members, these two were the most intelligent and strategic.</p><p></p><p>The debate of smart people must be very interesting.</p><p></p><p>Since he had just encountered them, Long Ming decided to inquire further.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Your Majesty the Group Owner, it's like this..."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao went on to explain. Long Ming finally understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>The cause was that when Chen Beixuan was chatting with Han Xiao, he suddenly brought up the topic of the formation techniques in the Cultivation World. This led the two to engage in a discussion about formations.</p><p></p><p>Although Han Xiao was not a cultivator and had not studied formations before, this did not prevent him from using a supercomputer to simulate them.</p><p></p><p>Since the simulation would yield results, the two then debated various aspects of formations, such as their effects, arrangements, refinement, driving forces, energy sources, and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the end, neither could convince the other.</p><p></p><p>This was the situation Long Ming saw when he opened the chat group panel.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming glanced at the chat group background and found that Chen Beixuan had actually pawned a complete collection of formation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation-related items piqued Long Ming's interest, so he spent 1 million points to purchase a copy.</p><p></p><p>Among the various Cultivation arts, such as elixir refinement, weapon forging, formations, and talisman creation, formations were the most fascinating to Long Ming.</p><p></p><p>Formations were ever-changing, with all kinds of illusory formations, deadly killing formations, and restraining formations. The combinations and layering of various formations could even create super grand formations.</p><p></p><p>In his past life's memories, the Cultivation path with the highest attainment in formations was the legendary Primordial Saint, the Patriarch of the Heavenly Dao Sect, whose strongest formation was the Slaughter Sword Formation. With this formation, he had fought and defeated four Saints single-handedly, which was truly impressive.</p><p></p><p>Ah, he had digressed a bit.</p><p></p><p>The Formation Techniques Compendium, purchased for 1 million points, had now appeared in Long Ming's hands.</p><p></p><p>With a curious mindset, Long Ming opened the formation technique book.</p><p></p><p>The first two lines of text caught his eye: "One body, difficult to cultivate the true void; Two hearts, disturbing the great cosmos."</p><p></p><p>Void Extermination, Illusion Disturbance? Were these the key points of killing formations and illusion formations? Or were they just a simple preface?</p><p></p><p>Long Ming couldn't figure out the meaning, so he didn't dwell on it and continued flipping through the pages.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the strength of his divine soul, it didn't take long for him to finish reading the entire Formation Techniques Compendium.</p><p></p><p>He had already thoroughly comprehended it, understanding all the formation arrangements in the book.</p><p></p><p>This Formation Techniques Compendium truly lived up to its name. Although it didn't contain any profound formation techniques, it was comprehensive. </p><p></p><p>The basic formations were all-encompassing. In summary, this Formation Techniques Compendium was an excellent resource that could take someone from beginner to master in formations.</p><p></p><p>Without exaggeration, as long as a person had the talent for formations and could thoroughly comprehend this book, they would be able to become renowned in the world of formations.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar reopened the chat group panel and found that Chen Beixuan and Han Xiao were arguing again.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Brother Beixuan, as long as we change the trigram position of the Gathering Spirit Formation to the Gan position, the gathering efficiency will definitely be improved by leaps and bounds."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Impossible. If you change the trigram position of the Gathering Spirit Formation, its nature will change. Kan is water, Gan is earth, and earth conquers water. If you arrange it this way, the Gathering Spirit Formation will explode, and that's me being generous to you."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "No way, in my simulation, Gan blocks the water momentum, and when the water rises, the boat rises too. This is obviously an increase in the gathering effect."</p><p></p><p>A new round of debate began.</p><p></p><p>After watching for a while, Dragon Roar also became interested and joined the two in the debate.</p><p></p><p>Now it's great, the two of them already had different opinions, and with Dragon Roar joining in, it directly turned into a three-way battle.</p><p></p><p>The debate lasted for half a day.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it ended with Chen Beixuan's victory, after all, Dragon Roar and Han Xiao were just temporary newcomers, and in the short term they could not surpass the cultivator Chen Beixuan who had delved into this path for a long time.</p><p></p><p>For this debate, Dragon Roar and Han Xiao gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>The debate with Chen Beixuan was more to verify the guesses in their hearts, and of course, Chen Beixuan also had this intention, although he had cultivated in the Immortal Cultivation Realm for many years in his previous life, but fundamentally he was still a person with modern thinking, let alone that he had been reborn now.</p><p></p><p>This further intensified the instinct to put a question mark in front of any matter, and when he was debating with Dragon Roar and the others, he was also verifying the formation law.</p><p></p><p>After all this, his gains were much more than Dragon Roar and the others. If his cultivation had not yet recovered, the formations he could set up would be enough to make him the overlord of the Immortal Cultivation Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Dragon Roar closed the chat group, and after this discussion on formations, his gloomy mood had greatly improved, and it also aroused his interest in researching formations.</p><p></p><p>The saying "When three people travel together, one of them can be my teacher" is absolutely true.</p><p></p><p>Although in terms of cultivation, Chen Beixuan was far inferior to himself, his attainments in formations were not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Palace, Dragon Roar took out the Formation Compendium again and carefully studied the formations in it.</p><p></p><p>The five-element divine power in his hand surged, Dui metal, Zhen wood, Kan water, Li fire, and Kun earth.</p><p></p><p>Relying on divine power simulation, starting from the simplest maze formation and gathering spirit formation, one mini formation after another appeared in Dragon Roar's palm.</p><p></p><p>After experimenting for a long time, Dragon Roar stopped. He suddenly thought of a question and asked the chat group.</p><p></p><p>"Chat group, can formations only be set up with spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The chat group cannot answer this question, please experiment on your own.]</p><p></p><p>Although he was prepared, Dragon Roar still couldn't help but mock, "Damn chat group."</p><p></p><p>After mocking, he asked another question.</p><p></p><p>"Chat group, how to obtain spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Spirit stones can be obtained by trading with group members, or by condensing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth.]</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's forehead was covered with black lines, and he silently closed the chat group, realizing that asking the chat group these questions was like lighting a lantern in broad daylight, completely unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>"Without spirit stones, let's try using cosmic crystals instead and see if it works. After all, they are both energy crystals, so there's no reason why it won't work."</p><p></p><p>He had previously envisioned obtaining formations from his group friends and then using cosmic crystals to replace spirit stones as the power source.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this idea was put into practice so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Dragon Roar began to research the replacement of formation power sources.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Dragon Roar's enthusiasm for formations was only one aspect.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate goal was that he saw the possibility of safely using the secret technique: Furnace Outer Performance, in the formations.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

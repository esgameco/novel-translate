        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ready?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how the luck turns out this time!"</p><p></p><p>The previous two batches of group members recruited were of very good quality, and Dragon Roar was quite satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>A trip to the Marvel universe allowed him to successfully merge with the divine realm and also receive a reward from the primordial cosmic will, obtaining a very powerful secret technique.</p><p></p><p>And then Chen Beixuan's purchase of the Formation Techniques Compendium unexpectedly gave him the secret pattern, which could be related to the future of the empire.</p><p></p><p>As for Ge Xiaolun and Han Xiao, Dragon Roar also had an extremely strong interest in their "specialties".</p><p></p><p>For this new batch of group members, he naturally hoped the quality would be even better.</p><p></p><p>He immediately clicked the button to recruit group members.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Consumed 120,000 years of lifespan, searching for qualified group members]</p><p></p><p>[Search successful, invitation message sent, please wait.]</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the chat group prompt, somewhat surprised, as this time the lifespan consumed was even more than the previous two times, and it also prompted to wait for a while. His anticipation increased a little further.</p><p></p><p>"Chat group, what new functions were added after upgrading to level 2?"</p><p></p><p>When the chat group was at level 1, there weren't many functions, and it was quite mediocre.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was very curious about what changes would occur after the chat group was upgraded.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The chat group upgrade added 4 new administrator positions.]</p><p></p><p>[Group capacity expanded to 30 members.]</p><p></p><p>[The group owner can restrict group member transactions.]</p><p></p><p>The chat kept popping up with new function additions or changes, making it seem much less stupid than before.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar carefully and meticulously read through the messages, and after summarizing, he found several of the most useful new functions.</p><p></p><p>First of all, after the chat group was upgraded, the permissions of him as the group owner were opened up a lot. Many things that were previously impossible can now be done.</p><p></p><p>For example, he can now restrict group members' transactions and world transfers.</p><p></p><p>He can restrict group members from using transfer talismans, which is a great ability. If he had this function before, he could have directly restricted the transfer rights of a certain idiot.</p><p></p><p>Then, the chat group provided the requirements for upgrading, which were mainly based on activity and point consumption.</p><p></p><p>The activity part is hard to judge, as long as people are chatting in the group, the activity will increase.</p><p></p><p>As for point consumption, just now he sent some star soul crystals to the group members, and the transaction fee deducted by the chat group just met the upgrade requirement.</p><p></p><p>As for the total point consumption of all the group members, the chat group gave the answer: 500 million points.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar contributed more than two-thirds of this 500 million points consumption by himself.</p><p></p><p>The points he obtained from breaking through the Beilong Tower secret realm have now almost been depleted, with not much left.</p><p></p><p>Finally, this shitty chat group finally showed the charging progress bar.</p><p></p><p>But it still didn't reveal the conditions and requirements for charging.</p><p></p><p>These were the main new functions added. Other functions were just improvements based on the original ones.</p><p></p><p>After checking the new functions of the upgraded chat group, Dragon Roar summoned the chat group again.</p><p></p><p>He set the four people currently in the group as group administrators, strongly suspecting that the four administrator positions given by the chat group upgrade were based on the number of group members, otherwise it would be too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao and the others were suddenly set as group administrators, first pausing in surprise, not understanding what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Before the others could speak, Ge Xiaolun was the first to ask.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Group owner, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Nothing, the chat group has been upgraded, and it gave us some administrator positions. I just assigned them to you all."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Also, I'm already in the process of recruiting new members. When the new people join the group, you polite and humble ones should explain to them. If there are any arrogant and reckless ones, just directly mute them."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Just as Long Ming was explaining some of the new features of the chat group to the few people, the messages sent in the chat group had already crossed the endless time and space, and were delivered to the qualified people.</p><p></p><p>[Not paying parking fees to join the Eternal Chat Group]</p><p></p><p>[Grass Python Hero joined the Eternal Chat Group]</p><p></p><p>[Grass Python Hero joined the Eternal Chat Group]</p><p></p><p>[Fox Disturbing Obstinately joined the Eternal Chat Group]</p><p></p><p>[Future Flash joined the Eternal Chat Group]</p><p></p><p>With five consecutive message prompts, five new group members arrived.</p><p></p><p>This also interrupted the conversation of several people in the group.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming looked at the nicknames of the new joiners, and a strong sense of familiarity came over him. He immediately had a rough guess, but he didn't understand why there were two Grass Python Heroes.</p><p></p><p>Was it one person, or did the chat group make a mistake and send the message twice?</p><p></p><p>As for "Not paying parking fees", that was undoubtedly Ye Fan, whose parking fees were said to have reached astronomical levels.</p><p></p><p>"Fox Disturbing Obstinately" was likely Wang Sheng, the leader of the Wang family army who was entangled by the fox spirit in the movie "Painted Skin".</p><p></p><p>"Future Flash", could it be that Barry Allen Savitar who killed the Huntress Mum Black Sister and succeeded in attaining enlightenment? There are too many Future Flashes, he couldn't be sure, he'd have to wait and see his comments before drawing a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>As for the two Grass Python Heroes, if they were indeed two different people, one of them should be Xu Xian, Xu Hanwen.</p><p></p><p>As for the other hero, he couldn't quite figure it out. In this vast world, there could be many other Grass Python Heroes.</p><p></p><p>When the new members joined the group, Ge Xiaolun was the first to speak and welcome them.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Welcome new members, if you have any questions, you can ask me!"</p><p></p><p>In the Painted Skin world, in the General's Mansion in Jiangdu City, Wang Sheng who had just rested suddenly opened his eyes, the vital energy was released and heavily slapped the bed board, the whole person sprang up, then took down the red-tasseled long sword hanging on the wall, and after landing, he raised the sharp sword and looked around vigilantly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he roared in a low voice, "Who is it!"</p><p></p><p>However, the room was silent, except for him, there was no ghost shadow.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he was thinking about military affairs, when suddenly a voice disturbed him, asking if he would join some Eternal Chat Group, he felt a little impatient at the time, and just silently agreed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After that, the annoying voice disappeared, but then another voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>The voice came directly in his mind, and he couldn't even try to chase it.</p><p></p><p>Helpless, he tried to say something in his mind as well.</p><p></p><p>Fox Disturbing Obstinately: "Who are you, why are you speaking in my general's mind?"</p><p></p><p>As he said these words, a blue light screen appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of the light screen really startled Wang Sheng, he raised his sword and slashed down.</p><p></p><p>Crack~ the sharp sword slid empty, directly cutting into the ground.</p><p></p><p>With his mind slightly calmed, Wang Sheng glared at the light screen, and he saw the words he had just said appear on that light screen.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voice of that person sounded in his mind again, and the light screen also displayed the words he said.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "General, don't be afraid, this is a chat group, it's a communication platform."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Fox Disturbing Obstinately: "I understand."</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng had been smart since he was young, and with Ge Xiaolun's explanation, he only took a simple thought to roughly understand what it meant.</p><p></p><p>But he had a question in his heart, why was his speech prefixed with "Fox Disturbing Obstinately"? What did this mean?</p><p></p><p>Was this person calling the general a fox disturbing obstinately?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After receiving the self-defense jade pendant from Chen Beixuan, Mr. and Mrs. Wang had been anxiously waiting for news.</p><p></p><p>They waited from midnight until dawn. Peirong told her husband Wang Sheng to continue waiting in the study, as she went to arrange the welcoming banquet. She thought that since a powerful person was coming, they must not neglect the proper etiquette.</p><p></p><p>Alone in the study, Wang Sheng paced back and forth, filled with anxiety and uncertainty. </p><p></p><p>His gaze was fixed intently on the chat group screen.</p><p></p><p>Earlier he had seen Han Xiao and the others chatting, and he really wanted to join in and engage with them.</p><p></p><p>But he was afraid of speaking too much and annoying the two group administrators.</p><p></p><p>He also feared that by seeking help from others, he would lose face for Chen Beixuan. After all, the others had already agreed to help you, so if you went and asked for help from someone else, wouldn't that be looking down on them? Harboring this mindset, in just one night Wang Sheng's face had turned pale and haggard.</p><p></p><p>Ordinarily, pulling an all-nighter would be no big deal for him - when he was on military campaigns, he had gone for seven or eight consecutive days without much trouble. You see, Wang Sheng had trained in martial arts since he was young, so he had a bit of skill.</p><p></p><p>But now, his appearance clearly showed that he was worrying too much, exhausted both mentally and physically.</p><p></p><p>Just a quarter of an hour ago, his wife Peirong had come to knock on the door, saying that the welcoming banquet was ready and to see if the esteemed guest was ready to come over.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wang Sheng was at a loss, unsure if he should take the initiative to inquire, he saw that Chen Beixuan had @'d him and was speaking.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng was overjoyed, not even caring if he was interrupting the conversation between the two senior administrators. He quickly posted in the group:</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng: "Many thanks to the Honored Administrator, we have prepared the welcoming banquet here and are ready to receive your esteemed presence at any time."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Open the crossing permission, I'll be right over."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan didn't waste any words with Wang Sheng, directly using the crossing talisman.</p><p></p><p>Regarding Chen Beixuan's words, the Wang Sheng in the study was a bit confused, not understanding what this "permission" was.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he received the reminder in the chat group that he finally realized:</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Group administrator Chen Beixuan has requested to cross over to your world, do you agree?]</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng immediately clicked "agree".</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, a transmission portal appeared.</p><p></p><p>Then a young man of extraordinary bearing and imposing aura stepped through the portal, appearing before him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the figure in front of him, Wang Sheng found it hard to believe - in his wildest dreams he never imagined this group administrator Chen Beixuan to be so young.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had no doubt about Chen Beixuan's identity, because Chen Beixuan's aura and the cold pride in his eyes gave Wang Sheng a sense that this was a person who was above all others in the world.</p><p></p><p>This was a bearing that could only be accumulated through years of self-confidence, like the majestic lions and tigers - their imposing presence remains even after death.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the previous prompt in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan's arrival was truly dazzling to Wang Sheng! "Welcome, Esteemed Administrator Chen Beixuan. I am Wang Sheng, the welcoming banquet has been prepared, please follow me."  Wang Sheng quickly regained his composure and stepped forward to bow and pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>"The welcoming banquet can be skipped, just take me directly to find that vixen. I'll help you deal with that vixen, I have other matters to attend to."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan's purpose in coming was to advance to the Golden Core realm, he had no time to waste on some vixen. The sooner he could finish this, the sooner he could find a place to cultivate. Because as soon as he arrived in this world, he could clearly sense the free-flowing spiritual energy in the air.</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual energy density in this world had not yet reached the level of the cultivation world he was from, it was still hundreds of times stronger than the current Blue Star. </p><p></p><p>With such a high spiritual energy density, he only needed to quietly cultivate for a few days, familiarize himself with the spiritual energy here, and then he could begin his advancement.</p><p></p><p>On Chen Beixuan's cold and proud face, Wang Sheng could not discern anything. But since the Honored Administrator had spoken this way, Wang Sheng did not dare to delay.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had no choice but to do as he was told.</p><p></p><p>Assessing the situation, Wang Sheng also didn't say much more, only muttering a response, "My lord, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Wang Sheng turned and opened the door, quickly walking to the front to lead the way, then headed towards the side room where Xiao Wei was staying.</p><p></p><p>If he could subdue the fox spirit early, he could rest easy.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng and Chen Beixuan, the two of them one in front and one behind, soon arrived at the door of the room where Xiao Wei was staying.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Wei, did you rest well last night? Today an esteemed guest has arrived at the manor, and Lady Pei has already prepared a welcoming banquet. I have come to inquire if Miss Xiao Wei would like to join us for the feast."</p><p></p><p>With Chen Beixuan's "backing", Wang Sheng suppressed the unease in his heart and knocked on the door calmly to inquire.</p><p></p><p>After knocking for a while, there was no response from inside the room.</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng felt uneasy, rubbing his hands and muttering, "Could it be that the fox spirit got wind of it and ran away already?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, no one is inside."</p><p></p><p>In Chen Beixuan's perception, the room was empty and there were no signs of life.</p><p></p><p>Were they being fooled?</p><p></p><p>Just as Wang Sheng was about to forcefully push open the door, a voice came from behind them.</p><p></p><p>"General, this is the esteemed guest!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was soft and sweet, lulling the listener into a sense of tranquility and enchantment.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan silently recited a heart-cleansing incantation, dispelling the strange emotions, and turned around to see a graceful young lady before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, she is the beautiful nine-tailed fox as described." Chen Beixuan inwardly sighed, with such a voice and appearance, it's no wonder Wang Sheng fell in love with this fox spirit in the original story.</p><p></p><p>Her charm was truly overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't been on guard, he might have easily been enchanted by her as well.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan discreetly performed a heart-cleansing technique, sending it towards Wang Sheng.</p><p></p><p>A faint green glow silently entered Wang Sheng's consciousness, restoring his clarity of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, Miss Xiao Wei, this is the esteemed guest who has just arrived at the manor, Lord Chen Beixuan." Wang Sheng stepped forward, standing between Chen Beixuan and Xiao Wei, introducing them.</p><p></p><p>However, Wang Sheng did not notice the expressions on the faces of the human and the fox spirit standing opposite each other.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xiao Wei had already sensed something amiss the previous night. She had used her fox powers to overhear the conversation between Wang Sheng and Lady Pei, where they discussed bringing someone to deal with her.</p><p></p><p>She knew they were going to send someone to confront her, but she didn't understand why she hadn't left the Wang manor yet.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she had already fallen in love with Wang Sheng?</p><p></p><p>On one side, Xiao Wei was observing Chen Beixuan, and on the other side, Chen Beixuan was also examining Xiao Wei.</p><p></p><p>"Fox spirit!"</p><p>"Exorcist!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan and Xiao Wei spoke at the same time.</p><p></p><p>In this world, there were demons and exorcists, but no cultivators. Clearly, Xiao Wei had mistaken Chen Beixuan for the exorcist summoned by Wang Sheng and his wife.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan, upon hearing Xiao Wei call him an exorcist, did not refute it, but instead a cold expression appeared on his face, adding an even colder aura to his already aloof demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Through his observation, Chen Beixuan could confirm that this was the same fox spirit from the original story, as he could sense the strong aura of bloodshed emanating from her.</p><p></p><p>This bloody scent was something that could not be concealed, no matter how hard she tried to mask it with her "fox stench".</p><p></p><p>This foul fox had killed many people.</p><p></p><p>He could feel the boundless resentment from her.</p><p></p><p>Although Chen Beixuan did not consider himself a righteous person, he only killed those who stood in his way, never indiscriminately slaughtering the innocent.</p><p></p><p>But today, encountering this demonic creature, it seemed he might have to act as heaven's executioner.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

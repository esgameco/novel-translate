        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Painted Skin World.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the "carefree and cheerful" Ye Fan and Xiao Yan, Wang Sheng, who had just read the group announcement, was a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wang Sheng was sitting on the floor of the room, staring blankly at the chat records of Long Ming and the others, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>He had already changed his nickname back to his own name as instructed, and he also understood what the nickname was all about.</p><p></p><p>However, the sense of unease in his heart was growing stronger and stronger. According to what the group administrator Ge Xiaolun said, the nickname upon joining the group was generated based on one's own experiences.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his own "fox-entangled and unruly" instead of "unruly and chaotic", the hint was already very obvious - he would be entangled by a fox, was the fox a fox? A demon! Thinking about this, Wang Sheng frantically grabbed at his waist a few times, but there was nothing on the empty waist, obviously he couldn't grab anything.</p><p></p><p>Because, the sword was on the wall.</p><p></p><p>After fruitlessly grabbing for a while, the dazed Wang Sheng seemed to have lost his spirit, his expression becoming somewhat dull.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a knock on the door outside.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice of the person, Wang Sheng came to his senses and let out a long sigh of relief. The owner of the voice was his wife, Pei Rong.</p><p></p><p>Because he had just returned from the Western Regions, he had been busy with military affairs in the past few days, handling them until very late at night. He was afraid of disturbing his wife.</p><p></p><p>So in these days, he would just stay in the study after finishing the military affairs.</p><p></p><p>Now hearing his wife's greeting, Wang Sheng couldn't help but feel warmth in his heart. He composed himself, stood up, and opened the door to welcome his wife in.</p><p></p><p>"My lady, why are you still not resting at this late hour?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord, is there anything troubling you? Just now I heard some sounds from your side, is it not a military matter? If it's not, my lord can tell me about it."</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng's wife Pei Rong was dignified in appearance, seemingly frail but brave, steady, virtuous, and far-sighted. She was known as a virtuous wife and mother in the surrounding villages.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the anxious and unsettled look on her husband's face, she spoke softly and comfortingly.</p><p></p><p>After hearing his wife's soothing words, the unease in Wang Sheng's heart indeed subsided a lot.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Wang Sheng's expression recovered. He helped his wife to a chair by the side, then quickly walked to the door, pushed it open, and scanned the courtyard left and right. Confirming that there was no one, he closed the door again and sat down next to his wife.</p><p></p><p>Then he gestured for his wife to lean in closer.</p><p></p><p>When his wife leaned in, Wang Sheng leaned in and whispered in her ear, recounting the entire series of events from his return from the Western Regions, to his mysterious entry into the chat group, and the issue with his nickname.</p><p></p><p>The anxious and uneasy Wang Sheng seemed to have found a lifeline in his wife, like a drowning man.</p><p></p><p>Since his good friend Pang Yong had left the Wang family army and wandered the world, the only one he could rely on and trust now was his wife.</p><p></p><p>Pei Rong listened quietly to her husband's narration, her face showing no change, but her heart was in turmoil. Her husband's words were indeed heavy. If what he said was true, then the little Weir he had rescued from the Western Regions might very well be a fox spirit.</p><p></p><p>Previously, she had felt a bit puzzled about little Weir - how could such a pure and delicate girl come from the harsh environment of the Western Regions, almost like a refined young lady from the Jiangnan region. As a woman herself, she had even felt a bit envious of the other's flawless appearance.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, we must not act rashly in this matter!" Pei Rong hurriedly whispered, as her husband had mentioned wanting to take the initiative and drive little Weir out of the general's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The main issue now is that we still can't be 100% certain that Xiao Wei is actually the fox spirit.</p><p></p><p>Assuming that Xiao Wei is indeed the fox spirit, if we rashly drive her out of the General's Mansion now, it may anger this fox spirit.</p><p></p><p>If the fox spirit gets angered, I'm afraid the entire Jiang City will not have a moment's peace.</p><p></p><p>Pei Rong saw that Wang Sheng still had a resolute expression, and she felt somewhat helpless, so she continued to persuade him:</p><p></p><p>"My husband, didn't you say that the group owner in that chat group knows about the record of our fantasy works? Why don't you go and beg him to let you see it first, confirm who the fox spirit is, and then make a decision!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing his wife's words, Wang Sheng was stunned, his mind completely blown. He was full of regret - how could he not have thought of that?</p><p></p><p>Wang Sheng just wanted to find a crack in the ground to crawl into, it was so embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Just as Wang Sheng and his wife were discussing how to ask the group owner for the fantasy work,</p><p></p><p>In the chat group, Xu Xian, who had also read the group announcement, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xian: "I, Xu Xian, am just an ordinary scholar-physician, why would I be a heroic character like Cao Cao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xian: "Is there something wrong here?"</p><p></p><p>In the White Snake world, in the medical clinic.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Xian had read the introduction of the chat group, he was still extremely shocked, as the various realms described in the group introduction had greatly impacted his life of the past decade or two.</p><p></p><p>However, when he saw the other people's usernames in the group, which were given based on their life experiences,</p><p></p><p>Xu Xian was completely puzzled. He was just an ordinary scholar-physician, how could he be associated with a heroic character? Could it be because of the patients he had treated?</p><p></p><p>With great doubt, Xu Xian finally asked a question in the group.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Xu Xian, where are you now? Have you gotten married?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Xian: "I met a beauty at West Lake last year, and we have been married for some time now. I wonder why you ask, brother?"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Since you are already married, then it's correct. I have a record of your fantasy work here, I'll upload it to the group file soon. Don't worry, only you can view it. Since you've seen the group announcement, I'm sure you know what this is about. Whether you want to read it is up to you."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "If you read it, you'll understand the situation."</p><p></p><p>After Xu Xian spoke up, Chen Beixuan simply replied without much ado, directly uploading the "Legend of the White Snake Maiden" to the group file, and using the group admin privileges to set it so that only Xu Xian could read and view it.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Xian saw the title of the work in the group file, his heart skipped a beat, and a sense of unease began to overwhelm him.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a bit of a pedantic scholar, he was by no means a fool.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he saw the words "White Snake Maiden", he realized many things.</p><p></p><p>Why was the Maiden so fond of him? Why was her medical skill so extraordinary? Why did she have so much silver and money to support his pharmacy? All these past events surged into his mind. Xu Xian's hands trembled as he looked at the book, his face visibly paling.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xu Xian still did not open the book, as he wanted his Maiden, Bai Suzhen, to tell him the truth in person.</p><p></p><p>His Maiden Bai Suzhen, accompanied by Xiao Qing, had gone out of the city to treat a patient. </p><p></p><p>Looking out the window, it should be about time for her to return home.</p><p></p><p>Xu Xian, filled with trepidation, closed the chat group and paced back and forth in the hall of the pharmacy, waiting for his Maiden to come back.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

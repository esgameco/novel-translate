        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Come, Goddess of Death, I'll take you to a good place," Dragon Roar said, as he lifted the Goddess of Death, who he had restrained, like picking up a baby chick.</p><p></p><p>Releasing his divine sense, he began searching for Thanos' location.</p><p></p><p>Because Dragon Roar had previously crossed through the portal, only to be "diverted" midway, he was already in the Marvel world, which is why he had encountered the Goddess of Death. </p><p></p><p>Now to find Thanos, he didn't need to go through the portal again, he could just directly go to his location.</p><p></p><p>"Found him."</p><p></p><p>After searching for a while, Dragon Roar finally located Thanos and Ge Xiaolun on a massive spacecraft.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar picked up the Goddess of Death and disappeared from the spot in an instant teleportation.</p><p></p><p>The Sanctuary II ship was the mightiest and largest spacecraft of the Titan army. At this moment, the helmsmen and operators on the ship were all curiously looking towards where their master Thanos was. </p><p></p><p>They were curious about the distinguished guest that made their master wait, for whom Thanos had not hesitated to dispatch three generals to liberate a planet, and use that planet to entertain the guest. </p><p></p><p>As for the person beside their master, it was his first time coming, and the reception was still grand, but far from comparable to this occasion.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Thanos, why hasn't the group leader arrived yet?" Ge Xiaolun on the deck was getting a bit anxious, looking at the flickering portal on the deck, and asked Thanos again.</p><p></p><p>They had been waiting on the deck for over an hour, and the Sanctuary II ship was about to reach the planet Kavga.</p><p></p><p>Kavga was the planet that Thanos had instructed the Black Order to liberate and redecorate.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xiaolun, why don't you go back first?" Thanos frowned slightly and suggested.</p><p></p><p>The reason Ge Xiaolun kept inquiring was that he was worried that the despicable Huaye would launch a sneak attack while he was away from the Supernova Academy world. This was based on past experience.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Ge Xiaolun had traveled to the Hanxiao world, Huaye had indeed attacked the Supernova Academy, and Ge Xiaolun had to rush back just in time to avoid heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Ge Xiaolun dared not linger any longer. He had a lingering unease in his heart, and it would be better to return as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this trip, the Uruloki metal sword, was already in hand. There would be another chance to see the group leader next time.</p><p></p><p>After saying goodbye to Thanos, Ge Xiaolun returned to his own world.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Ge Xiaolun left, two strange figures suddenly appeared on the deck of the Sanctuary II.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the appearance of strangers, the iron-witted Black Dwarf immediately rushed up.</p><p></p><p>Thanos also saw the newcomers clearly, and they were the group leader he had been waiting for. Seeing Black Dwarf rushing up, fearing he might offend the group leader, Thanos hurriedly shouted, "Stop!"</p><p></p><p>But there was no need for Thanos to shout, because at this moment, Black Dwarf, except for his eyes that could still roll around, was completely unable to move. Seeing this, Thanos swallowed the words he was about to say.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, group leader. My subordinate's ignorance has offended you. Please forgive him," Thanos stepped forward a few steps to plead for Black Dwarf.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the distant Ebony Maw and Proxima Midnight, who were also restrained, Thanos felt a bit troubled, and spoke up again to plead for the two of them.</p><p></p><p>As he was speaking, Thanos suddenly saw a somewhat familiar figure. Wasn't that the goddess he had been longing for? "Group leader, this is..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you like her?" Dragon Roar didn't explain anything, just smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I like her very much," Thanos replied eagerly, like a lovesick puppy.</p><p></p><p>"Since you like her, then I'll give her to you," Dragon Roar said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! Oh!! Thank you, group leader!!!" Thanos' reaction at this moment was a bit like a teenager experiencing his first love.</p><p></p><p>"Come over here. I didn't have anything specific in mind to give you as a gift, but I happened to come across this one, so I'll just give her to you as a gift. Are you satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>"Satisfied, I'm sorry for embarrassing the group leader." Thanos gently took the Goddess of Death from Dragon Roar's hand, and his expression also resumed the usual demeanor of a cosmic overlord.</p><p></p><p>"Group leader, I've had my subordinates go to Midgard to retrieve the Infinity Stones, but it may take some time."</p><p></p><p>"I've already prepared a welcoming banquet for the group leader."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Thanos...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The order was given to have the subordinates land the spacecraft on the planet Kajia. Kajia is a green planet with a greenery coverage of up to 80%. Due to the high level of oxygenation, the plants and animals all appear quite tall, and a faint fruity aroma permeates the air.</p><p></p><p>Thanos and his group arrived at a beach filled with delicious food and fine wine.</p><p></p><p>Longming unhesitatingly took the seat of honor, with Thanos and the Death Goddess sitting next to him. The Black Obsidian Three Generals and some of Thanos' legion commanders also took their seats one by one.</p><p></p><p>The Death Goddess, having been subdued by Longming, behaved very obediently after the arrival of the sovereign's will.</p><p></p><p>The banquet began. Glasses were raised and toasts exchanged, creating a lively atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Longming also took out some fine wines to share with Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because the wine Longming provided was too intoxicating, but Thanos had already become quite drunk after just a few cups.</p><p></p><p>It might have been due to the presence of the Death Goddess, but Thanos was behaving particularly boldly - even while drunk, he continued to drink heavily and eat heartily. In short, today, he, Thanos, was happy.</p><p></p><p>From the head seat, Longming looked at Thanos with a smile, his eyes constantly shifting between Thanos and the Death Goddess.</p><p></p><p>His initially smiling face gradually transformed into the legendary "aunt's smile."</p><p></p><p>In fact, Thanos' drunkenness was intentional on Longming's part. The wine he had brought out was a specialty of the Sun-Moon Empire, called "Forget Sorrow," which could easily intoxicate even a domain lord after just a few sips.</p><p></p><p>Longming had also deliberately poured Thanos extra cups, and the result was as expected.</p><p></p><p>But this was the result he wanted. As the group leader, if he didn't take care of the lifelong matters of his group members, he wouldn't be a good leader. Today, he wanted to play the role of a matchmaker, bringing Thanos and the Death Goddess together. As the new-era matchmaker, he was just giving them a gentle push - after all, the two were already compatible.</p><p></p><p>You didn't hear it wrong. In this Marvel Ultimate Universe designated as 1610, Thanos is fond of the Death Goddess, and the avatar of the Death Goddess in this world also loves Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, she wouldn't have been the first to stop Longming when he came to find Thanos, the intention of which is obvious - she was afraid Longming would harm Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Thanos wants to eliminate half the life in the world, half for the Death Goddess, and the other half because this world has become polluted.</p><p></p><p>The creative deities of Marvel each have their own unique characteristics. As the manifestation of the fundamental laws, Death and the Devourer of Worlds are the most special.</p><p></p><p>The Devourer of Worlds, commonly known as "Uncle Devour," has never reached the peak of his power since his birth, and is the one among the creative deities whose avatar has died the most.</p><p></p><p>The Death Goddess is the same - the more living beings that die, the stronger her power becomes, and she too has never reached her peak.</p><p></p><p>So Thanos wants to eliminate half the life in the universe, partly for this reason.</p><p></p><p>Longming saw that the timing was about right, and with a wave of his hand, he used divine power to transform the banquet scene into a wedding venue.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change in the banquet scene left Thanos' subordinates completely bewildered, with a dazed and confused expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>As for the Death Goddess, seeing this scene, she knew exactly what Longming was up to.</p><p></p><p>She quickly looked at Longming, opening her mouth as if she wanted to say something.</p><p></p><p>However, before the Death Goddess could speak, Longming waved his hand again, and his black divine robe transformed into a wedding gown.</p><p></p><p>Then the wedding ceremony began, a smooth and seamless process.</p><p></p><p>Thanos found himself single no more, in a daze, having become the husband of the Goddess of Creation.</p><p></p><p>However, it seems that Thanos may have become a son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Thanos' subordinates, who witnessed the entire event, were ecstatic. They were deeply grateful to Longming, thinking he was truly a distinguished guest worthy of their master.</p><p></p><p>As for the wedding couple, the newly-wed Death Goddess was now nestled against the slightly sobered-up Thanos, her previously lifeless eyes now shining with a unique luster, exuding an aura of a domineering CEO encountering a delicate young lady.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

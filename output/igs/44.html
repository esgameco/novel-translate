        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Longming's divine power had also reached its limit, but how long had it been? </p><p></p><p>Not even half a quarter of an hour.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't give up. Longming had a strong will in his heart. If he gave up now, he would develop a psychological resistance to retreat in the future, which would not be beneficial for his path ahead.</p><p></p><p>Was it just that his divine power was not enough?</p><p></p><p>"Ignite the Holy Heart."</p><p></p><p>Longming, who was standing in the void, made up his mind and directly used the secret art of burning divine power.</p><p></p><p>Burning divine power is actually burning the divine body. This was a technique for enhancing combat power that he had naturally mastered after breaking through to immortality.</p><p></p><p>The "Ignite the Holy Heart" secret art was a secret art of burning divine power that he had created shortly after his promotion to immortality. Currently, he had only cultivated the first layer, and when he used the secret art to burn divine power, he could temporarily increase its power by 100 times. This increase in power was not just in attack power, but an all-round enhancement.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect of the secret art of burning divine power is very powerful, the corresponding consumption also increases exponentially.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, in the current situation, Longming only needs to burn his divine power normally to maintain the furnace performance and his divine body.</p><p></p><p>So why did he make this choice?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had really gone mad?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Longming was not mad. Using the secret art to burn divine power was a measure he had to take.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary burning of divine power, although it can barely maintain the current situation, it can only maintain the current situation.</p><p></p><p>In the face of the Principle of Fire, this kind of barely maintaining is a great taboo, especially when he cannot control the situation.</p><p></p><p>Rather than being passive in using the secret art later, it would be better to directly activate it now, so that he can better face the sudden situation.</p><p></p><p>Only by grasping the initiative can he be fearless of the risks.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Longming burned 3% of his divine body at once, and it only lasted for less than three minutes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his divine power was about to be exhausted again, and the array forging had just begun.</p><p></p><p>Longming had no choice but to use the secret art again, this time he was more ruthless and directly burned 5% of his divine body.</p><p></p><p>The following time, he fell into a cycle again.</p><p></p><p>When his divine power was exhausted, he continued to use the secret art to burn his divine body.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the array forging had reached a critical moment, and the array patterns in the Divine Realm and the Principle World were all revealed under the scorching of the Principle of Fire.</p><p></p><p>If someone was in Longming's Divine Realm or Principle World at this time, they could easily disperse these array patterns and thus destroy the Five Elements Heavenly Star Array.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is impossible, as he is currently inside the furnace, and outsiders who enter the Divine Realm will only become doomed souls under the fire. The revelation of the array patterns in the Divine Realm and the Principle World will make the array patterns truly face the Principle of Fire.</p><p></p><p>Now it's time to see whether the true gold is not afraid of fire, or whether the paper can't hide the fire.</p><p></p><p>If successful, the array patterns will be further consolidated, and under the forging of the Principle of Fire, the array patterns will become more natural, and the efficiency of the array operation will be further improved.</p><p></p><p>If failed, everything will be over, at best the array patterns will be damaged and the array will be invalid; at worst, the array operation will have errors and cause a huge explosion, triggering a chain reaction, and the Divine Realm and Principle World will be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, Longming's divine body has already burned 30%.</p><p></p><p>With the loss of divine body, his current strength is only about 50% of his peak period.</p><p></p><p>The decline in strength also means that he now needs more divine power to resist the damage of the Principle of Fire.</p><p></p><p>Need more divine power, and need to burn more divine body in a vicious cycle.</p><p></p><p>"30% is not enough, then 40%!" Since he has come to this point, Longming naturally will not give up easily, and directly burn 10% of his divine body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Longming is already alone...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had already mustered up the determination to go all-in. Burning another 10% of his divine body would mean that only 60% of his divine body remained.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was not overly concerned about the loss of his divine body.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, as long as he remained above the 10% safety threshold, everything would be fine.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could complete the refinement of the formation, and the Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation was back online, the lost divine body could be recovered in no time.</p><p></p><p>Due to the significant decrease in power, the 10% of divine body he was burning now did not provide much divine power.</p><p></p><p>But Dragon Roar did not hold back, and as always, he immediately channeled it at full force to power the secret technique being performed outside the furnace. At this critical moment, the secret technique could not afford to falter.</p><p></p><p>With his divine body in a declining state, Dragon Roar did not have the divine power to resist the raging flames.</p><p></p><p>Without the divine power's protection, his divine body was gradually being damaged.</p><p></p><p>So, in the current situation, he was simultaneously burning his divine body and having it scorched.</p><p></p><p>Facing this dual loss of divine body, he would not last much longer.</p><p></p><p>And it was at this most crucial moment that an unexpected event occurred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Principle Flames within the furnace erupted into a rampage. </p><p></p><p>This sudden development caught Dragon Roar completely off guard, and the Principle Flames directly barged into his divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar muttered a curse, but it was already too late, as the raging flames began to ravage the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were heading straight for the core of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>If the divine realm's core was scorched by the Principle Flames, Dragon Roar knew the consequences all too well.</p><p></p><p>It would be reduced to ashes, as the divine realm's core was essentially unprotected, without any restrictive formations.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!" </p><p></p><p>The Principle Flames showed no mercy, and as soon as they encountered the divine realm's core, they immediately devoured it.</p><p></p><p>The searing flames scorched it like a heart being grilled, causing excruciating pain that twisted Dragon Roar's expression.</p><p></p><p>This sneak attack by the Principle Flames brought not only these consequences, but also a terrifying chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>First, with this momentary lapse of concentration, Dragon Roar, whose strength had already significantly declined, could no longer control the secret technique, and the furnace was now out of his control.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, the Principle Flames that had infiltrated the divine realm were only a small part, as the majority were now spreading throughout the divine realm, and it would not be long before they reached the formation patterns.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the loss of Dragon Roar's divine body was rapidly increasing! In just a moment, he had lost 10%, and the divine body's loss had exceeded 50%.</p><p></p><p>This 10% loss was not from his voluntary burning and consumption, but rather from the scorching of the Principle Flames.</p><p></p><p>And this loss was still continuing to increase.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was now facing a dire predicament.</p><p></p><p>At the current rate of divine body loss, he could only hold out for about ten more minutes.</p><p></p><p>If he could not come up with a solution within these ten minutes, the outcome would be that his divine body would be lost by more than 90%, and he would fall into an endless slumber, losing consciousness, not knowing when he would recover.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the void of the furnace, Dragon Roar understood that the final moment had arrived - success or self-sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>"Ignite the Sacred Heart!" </p><p></p><p>This time, he held nothing back, activating the secret technique that burned 35% of his divine power.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's divine body was now only 12% remaining!

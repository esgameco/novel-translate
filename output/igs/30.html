            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was about to crush the broken universe in his hand and make it explode.</p><p></p><p>Just then, someone in the group had @'d him.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar stopped his movements and summoned the chat group panel.</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "@Dragon Roar, thank you, Lord Group Leader, for your guidance."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the message.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Thanos had broken through the illusion he had set up, which was much faster than Dragon Roar had expected.</p><p></p><p>Although this time it was not he who personally guided Thanos, the tempering in the illusion was also from his own hand.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Dragon Roar had expected Thanos to stay in there for about ten days or half a month, but Thanos had only used two days.</p><p></p><p>He can be considered a potential material.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "En, not bad, just don't act like a reckless fool in the future."</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "Yes."</p><p></p><p>Later, Dragon Roar told Thanos that he would be back a little later, and then closed the chat group.</p><p></p><p>He took out the broken universe again.</p><p></p><p>He began to infuse it with divine power.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar did not choose the simplest and most brutal direct hand-crushing method.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to see the most natural explosion, so he kept infusing divine power into it.</p><p></p><p>Don't be fooled by the fact that the broken universe has already collapsed into a very small one, its mass is still terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar infused it with divine power for a full ten days before barely filling it up.</p><p></p><p>The filled broken universe, like a black balloon filled with water, was round and smooth, and when poked, it was still very elastic.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar infused the last bit of divine power that could support a camel.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>Boom.</p><p></p><p>The broken universe fulfilled its final mission, the void burst open, and a spatial storm swept through.</p><p></p><p>After the storm passed, it returned to calm, except for the shimmering spatial ripples, as if nothing had ever happened.</p><p></p><p>The broken universe, compressed to the extreme, exploded in less than a tenth of a second.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar had been observing the entire process with his divine sense, very seriously, not missing any detail.</p><p></p><p>In his perception, this broken universe, at the moment of explosion, seemed to want to break through a critical point, but ultimately failed, either due to lack of energy or some unknown reason.</p><p></p><p>So its explosion was like a thunderous cannon, small and insignificant, just like an empty shell.</p><p></p><p>He took out another broken universe and began to infuse it with divine power.</p><p></p><p>The previous one was lacking in energy, so this time I'll give it enough.</p><p></p><p>This time, Dragon Roar directly compressed the divine power before infusing it.</p><p></p><p>Ten days.</p><p></p><p>Twenty days.</p><p></p><p>Thirty days.</p><p></p><p>It took a full thirty days to fill it up, and this time he infused the compressed divine power.</p><p></p><p>Performing the same operation as last time, he infused the final bit of divine power.</p><p></p><p>The broken universe rapidly expanded.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, it filled the entire dimensional space, and also enveloped Dragon Roar within.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar did not move, he just quietly watched.</p><p></p><p>After the broken universe filled the dimensional space, it stopped changing, as if it had been restrained.</p><p></p><p>But this restraint only lasted less than ten seconds.</p><p></p><p>It changed again, rapidly contracting back to its initial size.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the broken universe in his hand, pulsing like a heartbeat, and for a moment he couldn't figure out what was going on.</p><p></p><p>This time, the broken universe did not disappear like the previous one, the divine power he had infused did not vanish, but was still inside the "ball".</p><p></p><p>The "ball" was pulsing faster and faster, accompanied by a humming sound.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh???</p><p></p><p>The broken universe in his hand suddenly disappeared, which greatly surprised Dragon Roar, as his divine sense had never left it.</p><p></p><p>The spherical broken universe just disappeared like that.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lost from his sight.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, that's not right, it hasn't disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Long Ming realized that something had appeared in his hand - transparent, invisible to the naked eye, but he was certain that this was what had appeared after the fragmented universe had vanished.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming picked up this transparent object, a regular circular disc-shaped item, and it was not light in weight either.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, about the same weight as the previous fragmented universe.</p><p></p><p>He scanned it with his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"Not a wasted trip, not a wasted trip at all," Long Ming said with a smile on his face after examining the transparent item.</p><p></p><p>The transparent object in his hand was the fragmented universe that had suddenly disappeared before.</p><p></p><p>No, it can't be called the fragmented universe anymore, according to the Marvel universe, it should be called a pocket universe! Long Ming lightly tapped the transparent object twice, and the transparent object gradually revealed its true form, a silver-white circular mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>Communication mirror.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to go in and take a look!</p><p></p><p>With a whoosh, Long Ming disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pocket universe.</p><p></p><p>The pocket universe had just formed, and it was still in a state of chaos, with countless airflows colliding and rushing.</p><p></p><p>Looking at these chaotic airflows, Long Ming found that they were still imbued with his divine power, no doubt the divine power he had infused earlier.</p><p></p><p>The pocket universe was very small, not even a light-year in size.</p><p></p><p>In less than a quarter of an hour, Long Ming had explored it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>The pocket universe is completely dependent on the creator, it is a small-scale world with extremely low growth potential, unless resources are constantly invested, it will be difficult for it to grow further in the future.</p><p></p><p>But since it can be called a universe, it is far superior to those spatial rings that are carved out of a piece of space.</p><p></p><p>As a universe, it must have some basic laws and rules, otherwise this universe cannot be formed.</p><p></p><p>Having a pocket universe in hand, it will be much more comfortable to comprehend the laws in the future, it's like having an external plug-in.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming planned to turn the pocket universe into a secret realm for his Dao Sect after returning, and in the future, the talented disciples recommended to the Dao Sect will be allowed to enter and comprehend the laws.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the powerhouses of the Empire will see an explosion!</p><p></p><p>Getting a bit ahead of myself, back to the present.</p><p></p><p>[Item: Small World]</p><p>[Rarity: Rare]</p><p>[Value: 550,000]</p><p></p><p>Long Ming looked at the pawn price given by the chat group, somewhat surprised, as he knew how shady the chat group's pawnshop was.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't expect this pocket universe to be worth so many points, even without the 10% bonus from the group owner's privileges, it would still be worth 500,000 points.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this valuable pocket universe, Long Ming thought about whether he should pawn it, after all, he still had three fragmented universes.</p><p></p><p>Recreate another pocket universe? As soon as this idea came up, Long Ming dismissed it.</p><p></p><p>The chat group's black market, he estimated that as soon as he pawned it, they would immediately put it up for sale in the mall, and the price would directly soar by dozens or even hundreds of times.</p><p></p><p>He had been scammed by them before, 0.1 points for a standard equipment, and then they directly sold it for 10 points.</p><p></p><p>The black-hearted factories of his previous life weren't as black as this.</p><p></p><p>Actually, this time Long Ming had stumbled upon it by chance.</p><p></p><p>Because before this, no one would be stupid enough to frantically pour divine power into a fragmented universe, let alone compressed divine power.</p><p></p><p>So he wasn't even sure if he could recreate a pocket universe.</p><p></p><p>Since there was nothing worth looking at, Long Ming simply withdrew.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Long Ming continued to conduct experiments, he replicated the previous process again, and as expected, it failed.</p><p></p><p>This fragmented universe, like the first one, disappeared after the explosion.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he calmed down and thought about it, and felt that it was understandable. The reasons for the decay of each fragmented universe were different, some with serious lack of laws, so it was impossible for them to be reborn as a pocket universe.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Dragon, you absolutely must not get into any trouble!" </p><p></p><p>Wuyin had been here for a very long time. At this moment, he was anxiously pacing back and forth outside the palace gates, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even call him the Sacred Lord anymore, but directly addressed him as "Old Dragon".</p><p></p><p>Longming was his old friend of several million years, so there was nothing wrong with calling him "Old Dragon".</p><p></p><p>As for why he was outside the Quantiangong Palace, it all started not long ago.</p><p></p><p>Since the Juntiandian Conference a thousand years ago, he had been entrusted by Longming to guard the Wuji Universe.</p><p></p><p>This guarding lasted for over a thousand years. </p><p></p><p>During this period, Longming's spirit merged with the Divine Realm, and he was tested by the will of the Primordial Universe, teetering on the brink of death.</p><p></p><p>This caused Wuyin, who held the authority over the Wuji Universe, to feel a sense of unease.</p><p></p><p>Because long ago, Longming had given him a jade pendant that could sense the life force. He could input a wisp of his own energy into it, and if the person who inputted the energy died, the wisp of energy in the jade pendant would also wither away.</p><p></p><p>Longming had once inputted his energy into it, and Wuyin had sensed the energy in the jade pendant becoming extremely weak, as if it would wither away at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Wuyin stared at the faint, flickering energy in the jade pendant day after day, feeling utterly tormented. </p><p></p><p>This torment had lasted for several hundred years, and it could be said that during those hundreds of years, he had lived through them as if each day was a year, and had hardly participated in the construction of the Wuji Universe.</p><p></p><p>As for this situation, he didn't know how to tell anyone else, so he could only silently endure it by himself.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the energy in the jade pendant later recovered, allowing him to heave a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, the good times didn't last long, and he had only just sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>What followed was an even greater calamity - the jade pendant actually shattered.</p><p></p><p>This really frightened Wuyin.</p><p></p><p>Longming was the Pillar Supporting the Heavens and the Purple Gold Beam Spanning the Seas of the Empire, he absolutely could not have any mishaps.</p><p></p><p>Wuyin could no longer sit still, so he immediately had the Imperial Emperor dispatch someone to take over his guarding duties.</p><p></p><p>Then he quietly flew and rushed to the Quantiangong Palace.</p><p></p><p>This was why Wuyin was anxiously pacing back and forth outside the palace gates.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the life jade pendant had shattered when Longming recovered after making his final gamble.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the life jade pendant could not withstand Longming's surging and plummeting life force, and that was why it shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Old Dragon, you can't die on me! You still owe me the Emerald Bamboo Spring from 7 million years ago."</p><p></p><p>"6.66 million years ago, you also haven't returned the 2,000 kilograms of Universal Crystals you borrowed from me."</p><p></p><p>"580,000 years ago, the Illusory Bamboo Drunkenness that the later generations of the Empire offered me, you still haven't returned that either."</p><p></p><p>"50,000 years ago, you said you'd introduce me to a partner, but there's been no progress on that!"</p><p></p><p>Truly a lonely old Wuyin, online collecting debts.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Wuyin's muttering suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Because he discovered that the restrictions on the Quantiangong Palace had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The restrictions disappearing, was it an automatic disappearance? No, the restrictions couldn't disappear so easily, the Quantiangong Palace's energy supply was absolutely not something that could be easily depleted.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't like that, then there was only one other possibility - that Old Dragon had lifted the restrictions himself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wuyin heaved a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The anxiety that had been weighing on his heart had finally eased somewhat.</p><p></p><p>As for why it had only eased somewhat, of course it was because he still hadn't seen Longming come out in person.</p><p></p><p>With the restrictions gone, Wuyin didn't rush in, but stood still outside the palace gates, waiting.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Quantiangong Palace, Longming heard Wuyin's muttering, his forehead covered in black lines.</p><p></p><p>Although Wuyin wasn't speaking very loudly, Longming still heard everything clearly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he knew that Wu Yin was worried about him, Long Ming still muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"You old Wu, actually scheming behind my back. When I see the Imperial Emperor, I'll have him arrange something for you, let's see if you, this over ten million year old antique, won't be ashamed!"</p><p></p><p>After muttering, Long Ming quickly arrived outside the palace gate.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward two steps and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, why the frowning face, come and smile a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, still acting cold in front of me, at most I'll return you ten bottles of Xu Zhu's Drunkenness, come, let's go in and talk."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Wu Yin was glaring at him without speaking, Long Ming first promised to repay the five hundred and eighty million years ago Xu Zhu's Drunkenness that he had drunk, which was all he had for now, the rest he would repay later when he had them.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he turned around and led the way into the Quantiangong.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin still didn't say anything, just silently followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the main hall, looking at the independent and separated formations enveloped in restrictions, his face was filled with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had seen such things, the unique energy circulation, although separated by the restrictions, he could still clearly sense the uniqueness of the formations.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the old dragon said he was cultivating, was to research these things? No, looking at these things, the energy was shallow, and they couldn't possibly hurt the old dragon, then why?</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin suppressed his curiosity and did not ask.</p><p></p><p>Since the old dragon said to come in and talk, then he would just wait.</p><p></p><p>As they walked, they soon arrived at the side hall of the Quantiangong.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the side hall couch, Wu Yin sat down with a calm expression, picked up the tea on the table and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Long Ming with a mocking gaze, he smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Holy Master, you have to keep your word, ten bottles of Xu Zhu's Drunkenness!"</p><p></p><p>"You old Wu, not saying a word, just to extort my good treasure, right?"</p><p></p><p>After sitting down, the two chatted for a while.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Wu Yin's mood had eased a lot, Long Ming understood Wu Yin's purpose in coming here, so he straightened his face and began to explain the origin of the matter.</p><p></p><p>After explaining lightly for a while, Wu Yin finally understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>It's just that his brow had been tightly knitted together from who knows when.</p><p></p><p>Although he heard the old dragon speak lightly, the performance of the Life Jade Token could not be faked, obviously this was not as simple as it seemed.</p><p></p><p>Although the old dragon was fine now, Wu Yin still couldn't help but speak up:</p><p></p><p>"Holy Master, don't be so reckless next time, although I know you are worried about the future of the Empire, there are some things that should be moderated.</p><p></p><p>"If you make a mistake, what will become of the Empire? Don't forget those rebels we drove away."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Long Ming waved his hand to interrupt Wu Yin's words, he knew what Wu Yin wanted to say, those rebels were not worth mentioning.</p><p></p><p>If they behaved well, fine, if they dared to rebel, he would just slap them to death.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he left these rebels behind as a reminder to the Empire, if it weren't for being busy with matters since his ascension to immortality, he would have already slapped these little ducklings to death.</p><p></p><p>Annoying things, let's not mention them.</p><p></p><p>"Old Wu, do you think the secret pattern diagrams can be integrated into our technology?"</p><p></p><p>"En, according to what you just said, Holy Master, I think there is a chance, but it still needs further research."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Long Ming mention the secret pattern diagrams, a gleam flashed in Wu Yin's eyes. If they could really be integrated into the Empire's current technology, then the Empire would usher in a soaring development.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the last time the Empire's technology had made great progress, was it fifty thousand years ago or a hundred thousand years ago? It had become so distant that he could barely remember.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Putting down the research in his hands, he opened the chat group panel.</p><p></p><p>He quickly glanced through the chat records of a few people.</p><p></p><p>This triggered his distant memories from his previous life.</p><p></p><p>That's right, in his previous life, Longming was a transmigrator, who mysteriously transmigrated and reincarnated as a primitive human on the Muqiu Star in the Central Star River a million years ago.</p><p></p><p>You didn't hear it wrong, he was a primitive human who had to go hungry for three days and nine meals.</p><p></p><p>Facing the precarious days, Longming did not complain about heaven or blame others, nor did he get discouraged, because he firmly believed that with the fact of transmigration and reincarnation, this world could be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>So he kept trying to cultivate according to the novels he had seen in his previous life.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, his efforts paid off, and he succeeded in drawing strands of energy from the cosmic void.</p><p></p><p>No one taught him, everything was a blind man crossing the river, slowly groping his way.</p><p></p><p>From apprentice level, planetary level, stellar level, cosmic level, domain lord level, to realm lord level.</p><p></p><p>Step by step.</p><p></p><p>Millions of years ago, one day during Longming's cultivation, he had an enlightenment and successfully comprehended the five lower origin laws of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth, and also gained the recognition of the upper origin laws and comprehended the secret of teleportation.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a thousand years ago, he successfully advanced to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>He directly reached the level of Sealed King Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Before the end of his lifespan, he broke free of the lifespan constraint, and couldn't help but feel excited. In his joy, he told the news to two junior disciples who came to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, those two junior disciples did not keep it a secret, and went back and revealed the news to the imperial high-level officials. When the imperial high-level officials received the news, they were naturally very excited, and immediately decided to hold a grand celebration to celebrate the old ancestor's advancement to Immortality and his one million year birthday.</p><p></p><p>Combining the two, this led to the current exaggerated celebration by the junior disciples. The entire Central Star River, with billions of inhabited planets, were all decorated, truly a spendthrift.</p><p></p><p>Back to the present.</p><p></p><p>Longming looked at the chat group, seeing Thanos from Marvel, Han Xiao from Super Gene, Ge Xiu from Super God College, and Tang San from Douluo Continent.</p><p></p><p>Oh, they're all familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the nicknames they used when entering the group, Longming couldn't help but smile wryly, it's indeed a "Rubbish Chat Group".</p><p></p><p>Good at nothing, but the best at giving each other nicknames.</p><p></p><p>It seems his "self-exploding maniac" nickname is still good.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, Tang San @'d him? After reading Tang San's message, Longming's face darkened, that bastard is really arrogant.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The God-King Tang San has been muted for 24 hours.]</p><p></p><p>Comfortable, being a power-abusing admin is just so comfortable.</p><p></p><p>He'll deal with him later.</p><p></p><p>Longming: "Hello everyone, it seems that everyone has accepted the chat group."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao, Ge Xiu, Thanos: "Hello, group owner."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Tang San had been muted, the three felt a sense of satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>Then they also greeted one by one after Longming spoke.</p><p></p><p>Longming: "Since everyone has introduced themselves, let me introduce myself as well."</p><p></p><p>Longming: "I am Longming from the Muqiu Star, a transmigrator from the Blue Star. @Ge Xiu @Han Xiao, although you two are not from the same Blue Star as me, you can still be considered fellow countrymen."</p><p></p><p>Longming did not hide his identity as a transmigrator, since he was not from the same world, there was no need to hide it. This also showed his confidence in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the word "transmigrator", Ge Xiu and the others didn't think much of it, especially Han Xiao, who had also reincarnated into the "Star Ocean" world, so he could also be considered a transmigrator.</p><p></p><p>It was the muted Tang San, who was silently watching, whose heart skipped a beat, as he had reincarnated after committing suicide by jumping off a cliff in his previous life after stealing treasures from his sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This was the biggest secret of his life.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the so-called group owner would also be like him. At this moment, he felt as if he had been stripped naked.</p><p></p><p>Why did he dare to expose his own identity?</p><p></p><p>Banned from speaking, along with that word "transmigrator".</p><p></p><p>The furious Tang San, Xiao Wu, and Ning Rongrong in the Divine Sage Palace, their faces visibly darkening.</p><p></p><p>Hmph! This person, already has a way to die.</p><p></p><p>If he could meet him, he would definitely let him taste the Buddha's wrath of Tang Lian! Forcibly suppressing his anger, he continued to peep at the screen.</p><p></p><p>Ge Lun: "Big boss, your tone seems to suggest that you know us?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Heavenly Realms, information, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "???"</p><p></p><p>Ge Lun: "???"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Haha, not bad, not bad, talking to smart people is just simple. Han Xiao, you can explain it to these two."</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace rest room, Long Ming laughed heartily, this was really not in vain, he spent 10 million life years to pull them into the group.</p><p></p><p>Among the current four members in the group, the one with the highest IQ is Han Xiao, no wonder he could play the players around and around, harvesting one wave of cannon fodder after another, in the future the one with the highest achievement will also be Han Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Since it's like this, let me share my insights."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "If I'm not mistaken, we are all characters from a certain fantasy work, right?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Group owner, am I right?"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "As expected of Han Xiao, not a single word wrong."</p><p></p><p>Ge Lun: "What, we are fake?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Brother, don't you know if you are fake or not yourself? I never doubt that I am a flesh and blood person."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming nodded, Han Xiao was right, a million years of life.</p><p></p><p>From the Moqiu Star, he spent hundreds of millions of years conquering all the star systems within a hundred billion light-years, and establishing the Sun and Moon Empire under his rule.</p><p></p><p>How could all this be fake?</p><p></p><p>Thanos, although he did not speak, Han Xiao's words also shocked him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Han Xiao continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "It should be that the information of the world we are in has been captured by other worlds, and formed into a fantasy work."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Han Xiao understands it very thoroughly, so you don't need to worry too much, existence is reasonable."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "This is my past life's fantasy work about you."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming then uploaded the corresponding works for the three of them, setting them to be viewable only by the individuals.</p><p></p><p>Although he could do something like a prophet in the group to deceive the others, as in those novels he had read before, Long Ming did not want to do so. Deceiving ants and showing off is meaningless, and deceiving the strong is just clowning around, which is equivalent to courting death.</p><p></p><p>Although, so far, Long Ming has not found any help from the few people in the group.</p><p></p><p>But this is only his first time pulling group members, apart from the mouse poop that is currently banned, the quality is still quite good.</p><p></p><p>Especially Han Xiao, there may be a possibility of cooperation in the future.</p><p></p><p>As for Ge Lun, his application of dark energy and celestial computers seems quite good.</p><p></p><p>As for Thanos, he remembered that after the universe, the Infinity Stones could no longer be used.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, whatever.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three of them reading their respective works without speaking, Long Ming also resumed studying the newly activated functions of the chat group.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he seems to have forgotten a certain Divine Sage.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

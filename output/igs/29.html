        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar finally found a small, inconspicuous entrance in a certain place.</p><p></p><p>He directly teleported over there.</p><p></p><p>He arrived on a rapidly moving meteorite, and the fist-sized entrance was on the concave side of this meteorite.</p><p></p><p>Using his divine sense, he expanded the entrance.</p><p></p><p>When it was about a person's height, Dragon Roar walked in.</p><p></p><p>In the Marvel universe, the entrances to other dimensions shift and move over time, not fixed in one place, which is why it took Dragon Roar over an hour to find this fist-sized entrance.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because the entrances are constantly changing that other dimensional beings, without actual coordinate guidance, can only rely on luck to enter the real universe.</p><p></p><p>Only when the real universe and the dimensional space collide and intersect, opening a channel between the dimensional space and the real universe - that is, the dimensional entrance - can they come over.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the collision between the real universe and the dimensional space is not a physical collision.</p><p></p><p>As for why Dragon Roar could go directly to the source of the Marvel universe, rather than directly to a dimensional space, the root cause is simply that he was lazy, and didn't want to have to slowly search for the coordinates of the real universe on the way back.</p><p></p><p>The source is like the origin, center, and highest level of the entire universe, the distance to anywhere is the same, and the target is clear.</p><p></p><p>Dimensional spaces, on the other hand, are chaotic on the periphery, easy to get lost in.</p><p></p><p>But now it's different, with this entrance, as long as he fixes the coordinates at the entrance, he can come and go as he pleases. </p><p></p><p>How convenient! - Dragon Roar's luck is good, the dimensional space he found has no living beings, and most importantly, this dimensional space still belongs to the 1610 Ultimate Universe, and its space is not small either.</p><p></p><p>According to his calculations, it should be about five or six light-years in size.</p><p></p><p>This size is enough for him to mess around and conduct experiments.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar first took out Ultron, awakened the dormant Ultron, and then handed the Reality Stone to it.</p><p></p><p>"Ultron, activate the Reality Stone and casually create some things."</p><p></p><p>There are several reasons why Dragon Roar subdued Ultron.</p><p></p><p>The first is to have someone who can use the Infinity Stones. The second is that Dragon Roar previously obtained an "Evolution Heart" in the secret realm mall of the chat group, and the Evolution Heart can give an intelligent life form a chance to break through and become immortal. </p><p></p><p>He bought it, but since he didn't have any intelligent life forms, it had just been gathering dust in his world ring.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Marvel universe just happened to let him encounter Ultron, and after testing and observing it, he found Ultron quite decent, so he temporarily decided to take it in.</p><p></p><p>In the future, if Ultron performs well, it's not impossible that he might reward it with the Evolution Heart.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the prerequisite is that Ultron can comprehend cultivation, otherwise it would just be empty talk, and it would have to be a regular artificial intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"As you command, master."</p><p></p><p>Ultron took the Reality Stone, activated it, and began to manifest the items it had in mind one by one.</p><p></p><p>Adamantium.</p><p>Nuclear fusion power modules.</p><p>Lubricating oil.</p><p>All were just daily maintenance items for its body.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar observed the state of the Reality Stone.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, </p><p>he found that the dimensional space had undergone a subtle change, as if it had gained a trace of life.</p><p></p><p>However, this change was still very small.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar continued to have Ultron use the Reality Stone.</p><p></p><p>This went on for a day.</p><p></p><p>During this time, the Reality Stone's energy was depleted at one point, and Dragon Roar took out the Power Stone to replenish it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the usage of the Reality Stone increased, the life force in the dimensional space became increasingly stronger, almost approaching the level of the real universe.</p><p></p><p>"Ultron, stop. You can go back now."</p><p></p><p>The answer has been found, and Longming told Ultron to stop and retrieved the World Ring.</p><p></p><p>After observing the entire day,</p><p></p><p>he finally understood the nature of the Reality Stone.</p><p></p><p>The Reality Stone is the bridge between the Marvel Universe and the dimensional space. The more it is used, the deeper the connection between the dimensional space and the real world becomes. If the Reality Stone continues to be used in this way, according to Longming's calculations, in less than a month, this dimensional space will be completely revived and become a part of the real universe.</p><p></p><p>This is also the reason why Longming was unable to comprehend the Reality Stone in the real world.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Longming had to admit that the Marvel Universe does have its unique aspects.</p><p></p><p>Using the Space Stone and Time Stone as the most fundamental infrastructure, the four directions and the universe from ancient times to the present form the basic structure of the Marvel Universe.</p><p></p><p>Then, using the Power Stone as the power source, combined with the Soul Stone and Mind Stone, life was created.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the Reality Stone was used to isolate the dangerous dimensional space, thereby protecting the entire real universe.</p><p></p><p>The multiverse of Marvel is like a series of eggs, safely existing under the protective shield of the six Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>However, excessive use of the Infinity Stones will also lead to the destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Interconnected, the Infinity Stones permeate the entire process of the universe's birth and end.</p><p></p><p>There is a beginning and an end.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, this is not what Longming wants. What he wants is the eternal Shen Guo.</p><p></p><p>So the plan to upgrade Shen Guo based on the Infinity Stones was abandoned by Longming at this moment, and he also gave up on comprehending the fundamental operation of the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity." Longming looked at the six Infinity Stones with the fundamental flow in his hand, all the effort of the past two days was in vain.</p><p></p><p>He had arranged the dramatic battle of Ultron, and then spent two days alone contemplating the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, Longming put the stones away, preparing to hand them over to Thanos when he returned.</p><p></p><p>Although he has abandoned the path of the Infinity Stones, Longming's trip to the Marvel Universe is not just for this reason, he has other ideas.</p><p></p><p>That is the Broken Universe.</p><p></p><p>It is well known that the Marvel Universe is a repeated big bang, an infinite cycle.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Longming now also understands the secret of the operation of the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>This will lead to the generation of a huge amount of Broken Universes in the Marvel Universe.</p><p></p><p>These Broken Universes are another purpose of Longming's trip here.</p><p></p><p>In his own universe, the will of the universe is extremely strong, and the solidity of the universe is also unusually powerful, so there is no such thing as a Broken Universe.</p><p></p><p>The birth and destruction of the universe are the two most important moments of a universe.</p><p></p><p>The birth of the universe is the most crucial, and without asking, the five great creator gods will definitely not allow Longming to observe it.</p><p></p><p>Since he cannot find trouble for himself,</p><p></p><p>he can only settle for the next best thing, which is to observe the destruction of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Broken Universes in his hand, a glimmer of expectation flashed in Longming's eyes, "Five Broken Universes, I should be able to see something."</p><p></p><p>Five opportunities, he is still very confident that he can find something good.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it can also provide a reference for the soon-to-be-upgraded Shen Guo, to fill in the gaps, in case the Shen Guo encounters similar troubles in the future, at least it can find countermeasures earlier.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he can gain some insights into the laws of the universe in the process of the universe's destruction, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>The destruction of the universe is the best opportunity to comprehend the laws of destruction or annihilation!

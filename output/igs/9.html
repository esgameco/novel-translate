        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the verification of the group members' strength is urgent." Long Ming waved his hand, and all the doors and windows of the room opened. Then, he slightly parted his thin lips and exhaled a breath, and the wind rose, blowing away that gloomy air.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the equipment that Tang San had burst out, Long Ming waved his hand again, gathering the scattered equipment on the ground and throwing it into the still-open portal.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, he ordered the chat group to close the portal. He had no interest in Douluo Xiaolu and did not want to deal with the turmoil caused by the fall of the Divine King.</p><p></p><p>That he did not vent his anger on Douluo Xiaolu was already a matter of fate.</p><p></p><p>[Warning: Group member Divine King Tang San has fallen!]</p><p>[Warning: Group member Divine King Tang San has fallen!]</p><p>[Warning: Group member Divine King Tang San has fallen!]</p><p></p><p>The chat group issued three consecutive red warnings.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the fall of Tang San, the other three members in the group did not pay attention to it. Firstly, Tang San had just joined the group and boasted arrogantly, incurring the wrath of the others. Secondly, the three were all busy with their own affairs - Ge Xiaolun was challenging the Fulong Tower, Han Xiao was in closed-door cultivation, and Thanos was offline handling his own matters. So no one cared about Tang San's life or death.</p><p></p><p>"Kick him out."</p><p></p><p>[The function to pull group members is in cooldown, please try again later.]</p><p></p><p>After kicking the grayed-out avatar of Tang San out, Long Ming wanted to see if he could pull in a new member to fill the vacancy, but it was obviously not possible.</p><p></p><p>"Well, if it's not possible, then so be it." Long Ming was already prepared for the chat group's pulling function. "It's so annoying that there's no progress bar for the cooldown."</p><p></p><p>After venting his frustration, Long Ming summoned the chat group function panel and clicked on the challenge to the secret realm - the Fulong Tower.</p><p></p><p>Facing the majestic and vast Fulong Tower, Long Ming did not feel the same awe and terror as Tang San. Instead, he sensed the faint aura of the laws emanating from the tower.</p><p></p><p>A fleeting burst of light law.</p><p>Roaring and explosive surging wind law.</p><p>The thunderous might tearing through the darkness.</p><p>The ever-flowing five-element law.</p><p></p><p>And the ripples that occasionally appeared at the top of the tower, and the faint glimpse of a river with undulating waves.</p><p></p><p>That was undoubtedly the laws of space and time! Seeing this, Long Ming's eyes narrowed, for as a Spatial King Immortal, he was all too familiar with the aura of the spatial law revealed.</p><p></p><p>As for the time law, it was too profound and obscure, far beyond Long Ming's current reach. He could only glance at it briefly, feeling as if he was in a different world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Long Ming was greatly shocked, for he could not have imagined that the Fulong Tower actually contained eight lower-level laws, and even the two higher-level laws of space and time were circulating at the top of the tower.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the laws flowing through the tower were not limited to these ten, but there were even more obscure and difficult-to-understand laws surrounding the tower.</p><p></p><p>"Damn chat group, why didn't you come earlier?" Long Ming sighed heavily.</p><p></p><p>If the chat group had come earlier, he would not have wasted so much time. If he had been able to access the Fulong Tower earlier, with his abilities, he could have surely reached the King Immortal realm within a hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The laws circulating on the tower's surface were far clearer than the laws he had comprehended at the Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not too late now." Long Ming looked at the laws before him, his mouth watering with desire.</p><p></p><p>He wanted them, he wanted them all.</p><p></p><p>Without a guide, he would forge his own path.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming was confident that with these ten laws empowering him, his cultivation would surely reach new heights.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the reluctance in his heart, Long Ming walked to the tower's main entrance and directly chose to challenge it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar surged forward like a breaking wave, and he quickly challenged and climbed up to the fifty-first floor.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he stepped onto the fifty-first floor, Dragon Roar felt something different. The space on the fifty-first floor was not large, and an atmosphere of tranquility permeated the air, completely unlike the tense atmosphere of the previous fifty floors.</p><p></p><p>On the previous fifty floors, he was immediately besieged by hordes of monsters as soon as he arrived. Dragon Roar had even become a bit numb from all the killing.</p><p></p><p>Now that the space on the fifty-first floor was smaller, it meant he could no longer fight freely like on the previous floors, but would have to engage in hard, direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>Just as Dragon Roar was still curious about where the guardian monster of the fifty-first floor was, a voice suddenly came from a small wooden house not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Alone I face the challenge, I am the Peerless Purple Yang who eclipses the sun!"</p><p></p><p>"Unmatched under the heavens, laughing at those who devour stars and extinguish the cosmos."</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, are you here to take on the challenge? It's been a long time since anyone came."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar pushed open the wooden door and saw an emaciated old man half-reclining on the bed in the wooden house.</p><p></p><p>From the old man, Dragon Roar did not sense any aura at all, as if he were just an ordinary old man. But how could an ordinary person be guarding the fifty-first floor of the Profound Dragon Tower?</p><p></p><p>"Junior Dragon Roar pays respects to the elder. I am the one who has come to take on the challenge."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Dragon Roar's response, the old man turned around, opened his eyes, and those eyes were indescribable. Just being looked at by them made Dragon Roar feel completely transparent.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling quickly faded, and when Dragon Roar looked at the old man again, he seemed different, as if separated by countless worlds, everything was so ethereal and elusive.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Spear Saint Purple Yang, appointed as the guardian of the fifty-first to sixtieth floors of the Profound Dragon Tower."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Purple Yang, I don't know..."</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, just think of me as an artificial intelligence, yes, an artificial intelligence."</p><p></p><p>There were actually living people inside the Profound Dragon Tower, which left Dragon Roar full of doubts.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to ask the old man about his origins, he was stopped mid-sentence by the old man waving his hand, not by Dragon Roar's own choice, but suppressed by the presence of the old man called Purple Yang, unable to continue speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, let me explain the rules of the challenge to you. My strength is equivalent to the fifty-first floor, and for each additional 10% of my full strength, it represents the next floor. You have to defeat me at 100% of my strength to pass the sixtieth floor."</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Purple Yang explained it clearly, but Dragon Roar was a bit doubtful about the old man's strength. Just now, with a wave of his hand, he was able to suppress Dragon Roar, who was a true Monarch Immortal that had mastered a spatial technique. Defeating an opponent with 10 times his strength, was that something he could currently accomplish?</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not just an ordinary Immortal Ascendant or Military Monarch Immortal, but a true Monarch Immortal who had comprehended a spatial technique.</p><p></p><p>As a Monarch Immortal, he had just been suppressed in the old man's presence without any ability to resist. Suppressed, not even allowed to ask questions, could there be some secret behind this?</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure it out, he decided not to think about it further.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Purple Yang said his 1% strength represents one floor," Dragon Roar muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Based on the previous fifty floors he had passed, each ten floors should correspond to a major realm.</p><p></p><p>Floors 1-10 were Planetary Realm, 11-20 were Stellar Realm, 21-30 were Cosmic Realm, 31-40 were Domain Lord Realm, and 41-50 were Realm Lord Realm.</p><p></p><p>According to this, 51-60 should be the Immortal Realm, but this Immortal Realm upper limit seems so high?</p><p></p><p>Thinking deeply about it, Dragon Roar quickly pushed away these distractions. He would just challenge as much as he could.</p><p></p><p>Invincible for countless years, and with his Immortal Ascension a millennium ago, he was just lacking an opponent to test his current strength.</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Please, senior, impart your teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar took out his weapon and saluted respectfully.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

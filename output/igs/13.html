        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "It seems that's really the case, haha."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Little brother Chen Beixuan, I just heard you say you are in high school. Coincidentally, June 9th is the day of the college entrance exam here! I'm not sure what the date is where you are."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "I'm currently on the bus heading to the exam site."</p><p></p><p>On the bus, Chen Beixuan's memories of his unsatisfactory past university life came back to him after Ge Xiaolun's words. </p><p></p><p>In his previous life, he had too many regrets about his university experience. </p><p></p><p>This time, he must make up for all those regrets.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Hehe, what a coincidence! Keep working hard and try to get into a good university, I'm sure you can do it."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun was obsessed with university. As an ordinary university student in the past, he always felt he was different and often fantasized about becoming a superhero to save the world. </p><p></p><p>Later, after standing up for justice and fighting with Liu Chuang, he awakened the power of the galaxy and was directly recruited into the Super God Academy.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Super God Academy, he never went back to university. As for what happened afterwards, it's too sad to talk about.</p><p></p><p>Although he doesn't regret it, he still longs for the peaceful and tranquil university life.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Xiaolun, are you stupid? Saying you can suppress the world, no matter how you look at it, you're not an ordinary person. Getting into a good university is not that easy for you."</p><p></p><p>In Han Xiao's era, due to the development of science and technology, the college entrance exam had long been abolished. A year ago, he had heard Ge Xiaolun mention this exam, but he and Thanos didn't feel much about it.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Oh right, I forgot about this."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Chen Beixuan's previous words in the group, not looking at fantasy works about himself, and then saying those words, it's clear that his ambition is very strong.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun, who rarely uses his brain, connected the cause and effect and analyzed it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, it makes sense. If he doesn't use his superhuman abilities to take the college entrance exam now, he can easily get a perfect score. Not to mention that even someone like Liu Chuang can easily get a perfect score.</p><p></p><p>For superhuman beings, the development of their brain domain is far beyond that of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Xiaolun, if you don't work hard, it won't be long before you're at the bottom again."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Shocking!"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming's words undoubtedly dealt a heavy blow to Ge Xiaolun.</p><p></p><p>Now, not being at the bottom means he's an experience card.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Group leader, you mean..."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "I understand."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "You understand? Hurry up and tell us."</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "Tell us."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "@Chen Beixuan brother, do you mind if I share my guess?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao's words successfully delivered the second heavy blow. As for Han Xiao's intelligence, the foolish Ge Xiaolun still admires it very much. More than a year ago, he had consulted Han Xiao for strategies more than once.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, the silent lurker Thanos also became interested.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao did not rush to share his guess, but politely asked for Chen Beixuan's opinion, after all, the person involved was in the group, and it would not be good to make wild guesses.</p><p></p><p>On the bus, Chen Beixuan, who was still reminiscing about his past life, was interrupted by the group's @. He quickly checked the chat history and understood the context.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Go ahead and say it. To be honest, I'm quite curious too."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "I just don't know how much you can guess correctly."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Okay, since Brother Beixuan has said so, let me give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "First, Brother Beixuan said he had regrets about his university life in the past..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The students are in their third year of high school, taking the college entrance exam by bus. This shows that the Northern Xuan brothers' cultivation level is not very high, otherwise they wouldn't need to take the bus to the exam venue."</p><p></p><p>"Secondly, the group leader is certain that the Northern Xuan brothers will soon surpass Lun, which means their strength will suddenly soar, and this kind of surge cannot be without reason."</p><p></p><p>"Combining the two, we can draw the following conclusions."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Han Xiao paused.</p><p></p><p>Then he continued to send the message.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "First: The Northern Xuan brothers have received guidance from a powerful person, causing their cultivation to surge rapidly. But judging from their previous statements, this possibility can be ruled out."</p><p></p><p>"Second: The Northern Xuan brothers are currently ordinary people, and they will soon enter the cultivation world. Their innate talent is extraordinary, and their cultivation will progress rapidly, surpassing Lun. But this conclusion can also be ruled out, because from their own words, they seem to already know about cultivation, so this conclusion is not valid."</p><p></p><p>"Third: Combining the two conclusions that have been excluded, the only possibility is that the Northern Xuan brother is either a transmigrator or a reincarnator!"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Brilliant, brilliant, Han Xiao, you didn't disappoint me."</p><p></p><p>In the room, Long Ming couldn't help but applaud. He thought if only the group members could be as capable as Han Xiao in the future.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, on the bus, Chen Beixuan put aside his disdain after seeing Han Xiao's analysis. </p><p></p><p>The group leader's depth is not to be underestimated, and he didn't expect that a mere group member could be so capable. It seems the others are not to be looked down upon either.</p><p></p><p>Although he previously thought the chat group was a cheat, after seeing the discussions, he realized it was no different from an ordinary chat group. He then developed a sense of disdain, no longer thinking of the chat group as a golden finger, but instead wanting to quickly recover his cultivation and return to the cultivation world, where his loved ones were.</p><p></p><p>However, now it seems this chat group still has some value.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the secret realm exploration the group had discussed earlier, Chen Beixuan decided to study this chat group more seriously.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "You guessed correctly, I am a reincarnator."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Haha, I was just making a wild guess, nothing serious."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Ugh, Han Xiao, why are you so smart? Can you share some of your intelligence with me?"</p><p>"Otherwise, Yan will always call me stupid."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan openly admitted that he was a reincarnator. In fact, this was intentional on his part. Rather than being exposed, he chose to acknowledge it, especially since the group leader probably already knew he was a reincarnator.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "The exam venue has arrived, I'll go take the exam now."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Go, go, although it's not necessary, let me still wish you good luck!"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "The group leader, Han Xiao, and the Northern Xuan brother, now it's good. Only me and Elder Thanos are the original members left."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "These days, transmigration and reincarnation are so popular, huh."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Elder Thanos, do you think there's some hidden mastermind behind this."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Elder Thanos, don't stay silent, last time you said you found something good for me, what was it?"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun started to digress as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>But he did miss one person, and that was the banished Tang San, who was also a transmigrator or reincarnator. </p><p>However, Long Ming didn't mention him, as he didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

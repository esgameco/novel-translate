        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Seabed.</p><p></p><p>Thanos coughed up a mouthful of blood, Ultron's kick had already injured him.</p><p></p><p>Although the injury was not deep, it had thoroughly enraged Thanos.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know how many years it had been since he had been in such a sorry state, let alone in front of the group leader.</p><p></p><p>Thanos' anger meter was maxed out.</p><p></p><p>If someone could see his face at this moment, they would find that his originally purple face was now faintly reddening, not knowing whether it was due to his anger or an overwhelming sense of shame.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Thanos took off the troublesome Infinity Gauntlet, slapped the ground with both hands, and jumped out of the deep pit he had created.</p><p></p><p>Standing firmly on the seabed, he pushed off with his feet, like a rapidly fired torpedo, shooting towards the surface.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Thanos burst out of the water, with a grand momentum even greater than when he was smashed into the sea, kicking up a towering hundred-meter-high wave.</p><p></p><p>On the beach, Longming had just extinguished the previous wave of foam when he saw the huge wave raised by Thanos, and a black line appeared on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything, just feeling that Thanos had received enough of a lesson this time.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the giant wave approaching, Longming still reached out his hand and casually slapped the wave, as if swatting a fly.</p><p></p><p>With just this casual slap from Longming, the giant wave disappeared without a trace, quietly and without a sound, as if nothing had ever happened, and no one, including the battling Thanos and Ultron, noticed this unusual occurrence.</p><p></p><p>Except for Doom, the Latverian demigod standing next to Longming, who was alone, with no one else around.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when he saw that giant wave, he was muttering to himself, "This is going to kill me, this is going to kill me."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, when he saw Longming casually dismiss the wave, his mood was like a roller coaster, and the originally red and purple face now added another color - green.</p><p></p><p>Red, green, and purple, alternating in a spectacular fashion, and it's unknown if any other colors will be added.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the island.</p><p></p><p>Thanos, in his golden battle armor, was shining brilliantly under the scorching sun.</p><p></p><p>Without the Infinity Gauntlet, Thanos displayed a different style.</p><p></p><p>Still without much small talk or exchange.</p><p></p><p>Thanos directly charged with an Iron Mountain Shoulder Bash, fully ramming towards Ultron.</p><p></p><p>The shoulder armor of the battle suit had a horn-like protrusion, Ultron didn't dare to meet this move head-on, and it somehow produced a long spear, holding it horizontally in front of itself.</p><p></p><p>Clang! A deafening loud noise.</p><p></p><p>Ultron's spear was broken, but the power of Thanos' Iron Mountain Shoulder Bash did not diminish, and he continued to charge towards it.</p><p></p><p>Although the spear was broken, Ultron was still pushed back several steps, and at this short distance, Ultron's advantages as a super artificial intelligence became apparent.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, it had found several ways to deal with the situation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a purple light shone on Ultron's body, it had activated the power of the Power Stone.</p><p></p><p>Using this gem, the user can even copy any physical superpower, and make their own physical attack and defense capabilities unbeatable.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, Ultron chose to meet force with force, it wanted to lock horns with Thanos!</p><p></p><p>Boom! A dull collision sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>This time, the collision sent both of them flying back.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was thrown back several thousand meters, and had just stabilized his form when the attacking Ultron was already in front of him again.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it had already reached Thanos, the restored spear thrusting straight at Thanos' face.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a fierce strike, Thanos couldn't help but narrow his eyes, hastily taking out his Tyrannical Butcher's Knife to block.</p><p></p><p>But Ultron did not let Thanos have his way, instead forcibly withdrawing the spear and switching to a blast, a deafening explosion.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was directly blasted into a disheveled mess, his brain also becoming dizzy, but this was not the end, Ultron's spear thrust forward again, Thanos only felt a stinging pain in his arm, the hand holding the knife suddenly numb.</p><p></p><p>Ultron reversed the spear and flicked it again, and Thanos' weapon was disarmed.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Ultron's mastery of the six Infinity Stones became increasingly proficient.</p><p></p><p>Facing Ultron's onslaught, Thanos...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The relentless attacks were overwhelming, and the defensive stance became passive. As the saying goes, long defense leads to failure, and long offense leads to victory.</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, and Thanos began to show signs of injury, with more and more cracks in his defensive movements.</p><p></p><p>Thanos was being brutally beaten by Ultron, with blood splattering across the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, it seems that the great one is at a disadvantage," said the anxious Dumb, the divine lord of the Lala people, clenching his fists.</p><p></p><p>"Oh," Dragon Roar simply responded. It's just some injuries, being at a disadvantage is being at a disadvantage, it's not like he's going to die. What's there to worry about?</p><p></p><p>Thanos' strength had stabilized at the Realm Lord level, while Ultron had been amplified to the Realm Sovereign level by the Infinity Stones. For the time being, Thanos wouldn't be defeated, unless... Thanos was struck down by Ultron and crashed heavily onto the small island.</p><p></p><p>Damn, Dragon Roar really wanted to slap himself. He had just thought that Thanos could hold on a bit longer, but he ended up being knocked out.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but inwardly criticize Thanos, saying that he was too weak, relying too much on external sources. Although his strength had increased, his techniques were still straightforward and inflexible, unable to achieve true mastery.</p><p></p><p>He was truly a bit stupid, a complete iron-headed fool.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to take back the praise he had given Thanos in the group chat earlier.</p><p></p><p>He was wrong! Dragon Roar couldn't help but doubt himself.</p><p></p><p>He sent a thought over to retrieve Thanos, and also placed a restriction on Ultron, making it temporarily forget about Thanos.</p><p></p><p>After defeating Thanos, Ultron didn't pursue further, but remained in place, contemplating the fundamental laws of the Infinity Stones. Now that it had been interfered with by Dragon Roar, it directly forgot about the existence of Dragon Roar and the others.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ultron suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I see it!" It sensed the difference in the world, it sensed the one who was spying on it, it understood the true nature of the world, and in this moment, it became all-knowing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it only saw what Dragon Roar intentionally allowed it to see. If it didn't let it see certain things, how would the upcoming show be any good?</p><p></p><p>In fact, Dragon Roar wasn't just looking for entertainment. All of this was for the sake of better observing the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it wouldn't have been so troublesome.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, Thanos wasn't strong enough, and he was quickly defeated.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar had no choice but to resort to this strategy, letting Ultron and the constantly spying observer have an overtime match.</p><p></p><p>With Ultron as the sample, after obtaining the Infinity Stones later, it could be used as a reference.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, Ultron turned its gaze towards the void and said, "I've found you, observer!"</p><p></p><p>The observer on the other side of the void was startled by Ultron's discovery.</p><p></p><p>But he still didn't believe that Ultron could find him.</p><p></p><p>The massive head approached the crack and continued to peep through the gap.</p><p></p><p>Ultron didn't say much, it just raised its long spear and fired a shot towards the void.</p><p></p><p>Crack! The originally clear and transparent sky, under Ultron's shot, was like a cracked mirror.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a series of cracking sounds, the cracks rapidly spread.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The mirror seemed to have reached its limit and completely shattered, revealing the observer's figure.</p><p></p><p>"I said I found you, observer!"</p><p></p><p>Ultron was very angry. Today, it would kill this peeping Tom, and then use its robot army to destroy all life and unify the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>Without many words, it raised its spear and thrust it forward.</p><p></p><p>Facing the chilling Ultron, the observer furrowed his brows, still unable to understand how the robot had discovered him.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was Dragon Roar. In response to Ultron's provocation, the observer naturally wouldn't back down. He was no pushover either.</p><p></p><p>In a split second, he changed his attire and entered battle mode.</p><p></p><p>The two non-human entities directly engaged in combat.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

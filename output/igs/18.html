        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shadowy figure of Wumuhou and the illusory figure of the Superstar gradually became more substantial.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before the two souls had fully recovered, and since they had no physical bodies, they were now floating on the deck.</p><p></p><p>After regaining consciousness, Wumuhou and the Superstar saw Thanos and the Goddess of Death in front of them, and they quickly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Goddess." </p><p></p><p>"Master, we have failed."</p><p></p><p>The two first expressed gratitude to the Goddess of Death, then looked at Thanos with a bitter tone.</p><p></p><p>Thanos looked at the two useless fellows, snorted coldly, and then inquired about the course of events.</p><p></p><p>Wumuhou then recounted the ins and outs of the matter in detail.</p><p></p><p>That day, Thanos had sent them two to Midgard to collect the last two Infinity Stones. At first, it went smoothly. On the spaceship, they used the Space Stone to open a portal and directly arrived in Midgard.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in Midgard, they worked together and immediately subdued the sorcerer who possessed the Time Stone, but due to the existence of a spell, they were unable to forcibly take the Time Stone.</p><p></p><p>So they simply took the sorcerer, along with the Stone, and the next step was to find the Mind Stone.</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Mind Stone was a being called Ultron, who had discovered them through the network ahead of time, and then he directly contacted a bald guy to ambush them.</p><p></p><p>When they went to find him, they were directly controlled by that bald guy.</p><p></p><p>Unable to move, they could only be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Later, the two were tortured to death in the dungeon. The sorcerer they had controlled was also tortured to death with them, so now the four Infinity Stones had fallen into the hands of the one called Ultron.</p><p></p><p>After listening to the account of Wumuhou and the Superstar, Longming's mouth twitched, "This plot sounds a lot like the 'What If' plot."</p><p></p><p>In the 'What If' plot, Thanos' sending the Stones was a case of "light gift, heavy meaning."</p><p></p><p>After Ultron obtained all the Stones, he first massacred the entire planet, and then even discovered the hidden observer and crushed him.</p><p></p><p>On the deck, looking at the two floating souls, Longming found them very annoying, pinched his thumb and middle finger, and then snapped his fingers.</p><p></p><p>Snap! A surge of energy emerged, instantly enveloping the souls of Wumuhou and the Superstar.</p><p></p><p>Flesh and blood regenerated.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't long before the two were completely reborn.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Death had only recalled the souls of Wumuhou and the Superstar, and she could not give them bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and thank the Holy Lord God." Thanos saw the two standing there dazed, walked up, and suddenly slapped them.</p><p></p><p>Thanos dared not let his subordinates directly call Longming's name, and in his quick wit, he thought of Longming's other title.</p><p></p><p>With a slap, Wumuhou and the Superstar snapped out of their shock, quickly bowed to Longming, and repeatedly thanked the Holy Lord God.</p><p></p><p>Since Thanos didn't explain, they didn't dare to ask anything further.</p><p></p><p>"Also, from now on, Death will be your Mistress."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Thanos' words, the two were momentarily at a loss, but after thinking about it, they understood.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Goddess had pulled them back from hell.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the two were overjoyed in their hearts. If the Goddess was the Mistress, then their legion's actions would have Thanos' approval.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the expressions of the two, Thanos knew what they were thinking, but he didn't say anything, just waved his hand to dismiss them.</p><p></p><p>Thanos turned around and said in a muffled voice to Longming beside him, "The group leader is deeply sorry, and his subordinates have failed in their duties. I will go and retrieve the Infinity Stones."</p><p>He suppressed the rage in his heart, needing to vent.</p><p></p><p>Ultron, huh? Daring to steal the universe.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's Things, They're Yours Now!</p><p></p><p>Thanos confirmed his target for venting his anger, and the purple big face also became a little lighter.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go with you, since I also want to take a look at the blue planet of this universe," Dragon Roar replied casually.</p><p></p><p>As a traveler from the blue planet, although the blue planet of the Marvel universe was not the one he had traveled to before, he might as well take a look.</p><p></p><p>After hearing Dragon Roar's words, Thanos began to instruct his subordinates to set up a portal.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Thanos still had the Power Stone and the Space Stone. Now they were on the planet Xandar, which was very far from the blue planet. It would be difficult to reach it by spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Only by using the Space Stone as the power source to build the portal could they quickly reach the blue planet.</p><p></p><p>After the technical staff operated for a few hours, the portal was finally built.</p><p></p><p>"Thanos, let's go," Dragon Roar stepped into the portal first.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Lord Master."</p><p></p><p>Thanos followed closely behind. He did not bring his newly married wife, the Death Goddess, but let her stay on the Sanctuary II spaceship, and also let the Black Order who wanted to go with them stay behind. This time, he and the Lord Master would be enough.</p><p></p><p>â€”Blue Planet, Northern Hemisphere.</p><p></p><p>It was 8:15 pm, the time when nightlife began.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the continental shelf, in a brightly lit underwater base.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the people in the base were staring intently at a screen.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, the base's instruments had detected a powerful energy source not far from them.</p><p></p><p>And this energy was still increasing. According to the computer's calculations, if this energy continued to expand, it might trigger an unprecedented large explosion, and at that time the entire blue planet would become a dazzling firework in the night sky.</p><p></p><p>The roar of the instruments and the soaring energy index on the screen made the people in front of the screen dare not take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was extremely nervous.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the roar of the instrument disappeared, and the energy index dropped to zero, leaving everyone puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the seabed not far from the base, the figures of Dragon Roar and Thanos appeared from the blue light column.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, it was the two of them who caused the energy fluctuation. As for why the portal was opened on the seabed, of course it was intentional.</p><p></p><p>Although Dragon Roar did not need to hide, the portal was built by Thanos' subordinates in the deep sea where the pressure was huge, but it had no effect on the two of them. Dragon Roar also saw the location of the base, but since there were only ordinary people inside, he did not disturb them.</p><p></p><p>He teleported away from the place with Thanos.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar took Thanos to a small Longjiang pork knuckle rice shop and casually ordered two servings of pork knuckle rice.</p><p></p><p>If other national chain brands saw this, they would probably say, "How much did Longjiang pork knuckle rice pay you? I'll give you double, I'll give you five times as much as Lanzhou noodles, I'll give you ten times as much as Liuzhou snail noodles!" Dragon Roar ate it with relish, ah, the taste was still the same as he remembered, greasy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Dragon Roar had cast an illusion on Thanos to make him look like an ordinary person, so as not to frighten the customers in the shop.</p><p></p><p>After eating, Dragon Roar took Thanos to the largest city in the Beautiful Country, New York, found an empty seaside, and released a trace of divine power.</p><p></p><p>He created a few tables and chairs, and took some drinks out of the World Ring.</p><p></p><p>Then he and Thanos just waited calmly.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the fish to take the bait.</p><p></p><p>The trace of divine power he released was the best bait.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

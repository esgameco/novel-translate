        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom! Crack! Colorful hues lit up the sky, accompanied by a thunderous roar.</p><p></p><p>This was the sound of Ultron clashing with the five members of the Celestial group.</p><p></p><p>The five Celestial group members worked together quite well, understanding their division of labor.</p><p></p><p>One Celestial was responsible for the main attack, two and three provided backup, five was in charge of cover, and seven was simply straightforward, providing support and buffs from the rear.</p><p></p><p>The five-man assault on Ultron played out like a boss battle in a video game.</p><p></p><p>Although their coordination was a bit rough, it was surprisingly effective. The Celestial group members were all seasoned veterans of over a million years, and their teamwork was on point.</p><p></p><p>Ultron was even chased and beaten by the first Celestial at times.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ultron would counterattack occasionally as well.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the two sides were engaged in a back-and-forth battle.</p><p></p><p>On the beach, Long Ming watched the battle intently, mainly observing the changes in Ultron when he used the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>After observing for some time, he had gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Ultron used the Infinity Stones, a negligible gravitational pull would form around him. If Long Ming's divine sense hadn't been constantly covering the battlefield, he might have missed this subtle change.</p><p></p><p>This gravitational pull was even harder to detect when Ultron used the Stones individually. When he combined the Stones, it became slightly more observable.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming noticed that this gravitational pull was not attracting energy, but rather the scattered fragments of cosmic laws - the shattered remnants of the laws that were formed during the Big Bang.</p><p></p><p>"Observing Ultron's use of the Infinity Stones was the right decision," Long Ming thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he had obtained the Infinity Stones first, he wouldn't have tried to activate them, but rather observed the inner workings of the Stones. In that case, he would have missed this crucial phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Goddess of Death knows about this situation," Long Ming pondered.</p><p></p><p>As the creator deity, she should be aware of this, but it seemed she didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>The Stones' self-activating gravitational pull, drawing in the remaining law fragments - this was clearly the Stones' process of returning to their primordial state.</p><p></p><p>The more the Stones were used, the faster this reversion would progress. At a critical point, an unprecedented cosmic explosion would occur.</p><p></p><p>The Infinity Stones were formed from the condensed laws during the Big Bang. Once they reverted, the stored laws would be released all at once, which would be disastrous for the fragile universe in the present day, leading to a great cosmic tear.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, this universe would be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Could this be the reason for the endless Big Bang cycles in the Marvel universe? Long Ming felt he had uncovered a momentous revelation.</p><p></p><p>He was also relieved that he hadn't immediately tried to comprehend the Infinity Stones. If he hadn't understood this, and had used the Stones to build his divine kingdom, who knows when his kingdom would have faced a catastrophic cosmic rift and been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>After all, his divine kingdom was crucial to his future.</p><p></p><p>Now, it seemed that using the Infinity Stones to establish a divine kingdom was a path that needed further consideration. But he would need to conduct an experiment to confirm his findings.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Thanos from the 616 main universe, after snapping his fingers, immediately set out to destroy all the Infinity Stones. He had likely realized the truth after the first snap.</p><p></p><p>Destroying the Stones completely was to prevent others from continuously using them, which would ultimately lead to the universe's destruction.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Annihilation.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Infinity Stones have the ability to both stabilize the cosmic structure and destroy the universe.</p><p></p><p>Just as Longming was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>On the surface of the sea, the Celestial group and Ultron were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Shadows intertwined, back and forth, the fight was quite lively. As time passed, the five members of the Celestial group gradually found themselves in a difficult situation.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Ultron would not miss this opportunity, and it activated all six Infinity Stones at once.</p><p></p><p>Its entire body emitted a pure white light, illuminating the night sky, an ultimate white brilliance, as if it was the primordial light of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the light burst out from Ultron's body at an extremely fast speed, and in the blink of an eye, five beams of pure white light separated the five members of the Celestial group.</p><p></p><p>Although they were right in front of each other, the five could not cross this white light barrier.</p><p></p><p>No matter what techniques they used, it was all in vain, as if this light barrier had divided the space they were in.</p><p></p><p>Though within reach, it was as if they were at the ends of the earth.</p><p></p><p>The five were anxious, frantically attacking the white light barrier, trying to reunite as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>They knew this was Ultron's scheme, to separate them and take them down one by one.</p><p></p><p>But clearly, their efforts were futile.</p><p></p><p>First, one member was directly pierced through by Ultron and fell into the sea, his fate unknown.</p><p></p><p>Then the seventh member, Ultron directly summoned a cannon and fired, leaving no trace of the seventh member, his fate also unknown.</p><p></p><p>Next, the second and third members were stabbed countless times by Ultron, and they too fell into the sea, their fates unknown.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was the fifth member, the one Ultron hated the most. Although the fifth member had been providing cover, he had attacked Ultron the most.</p><p></p><p>The member in the middle was pierced through by Ultron, his two arms turned to powder, and in the end, he was struck by Ultron's devastating attack, freezing him to the core.</p><p></p><p>After venting all this, Ultron stopped, flinging the impaled fifth member into the sea, his fate unknown.</p><p></p><p>This tragic scene of the Celestial group left Doom terrified.</p><p></p><p>That robot was truly ruthless.</p><p></p><p>His legs had been trembling since just now.</p><p></p><p>The sand he was gripping tightly in his hand was crackling under the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, let's go."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Longming spoke, then walked to the seaside.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he dispersed all the illusions, except for Thanos's.</p><p></p><p>The entire coastline returned to its original state, and the surrounding things were still intact.</p><p></p><p>"Was the fight between that robot and those strange people just an illusion?" Doom, standing behind Longming, was deeply self-doubting.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the world had changed completely from what he knew, as if he had just returned home.</p><p></p><p>But of course, it couldn't have been fake, the battle scene was just within the illusion set up by Longming.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Your Highness." The Observer and the eight Celestial group members knelt on one knee, paying their respects to Longming.</p><p></p><p>The five Celestial group members who were previously brutalized by Ultron in the illusion had now fully recovered, without a trace of injury.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you've worked hard. This is your reward."</p><p></p><p>Longming waved his hand again, and a spiritual light entered the forehead of each Celestial group member, a reward from Longming for their efforts. Receiving this spiritual light, the eight Celestial group members were restored to their original state.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, Longming sent them all back to their original positions.</p><p></p><p>As for the Observer, Longming also gave him a reward, then dismissed him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

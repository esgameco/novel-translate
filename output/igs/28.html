        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Dragon Roar returned, he collected the six Infinity Stones and prepared to leave, returning to Thanos' spaceship.</p><p></p><p>Turning around, he saw that Doom was still there, and remembered that Thanos had previously seemed to want to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>"Little guy, are you interested in leaving this blue planet and following him to roam the universe in the future?" Dragon Roar pointed to Thanos beside him.</p><p></p><p>Now that Thanos had not yet awakened from the illusion, Dragon Roar asked on his behalf.</p><p></p><p>Doom thought that the purple-colored powerful one was just casually asking, but he didn't expect that the emperor would ask on his behalf.</p><p></p><p>But he thought about the cruel actions of the one called Thanos, who had punched and destroyed Hank Pym with one fist.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit frightened and quickly shook his head to politely refuse: "Thank you for your kindness, Your Majesty, but I will stay on this blue planet to guard the ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar saw that Doom refused, and didn't say anything more. He picked up Thanos and led Ultron to enter the teleportation portal opened by the Space Stone.</p><p></p><p>The teleportation portal was opened by Ultron, who had the coordinates given by Dragon Roar, and Ultron was proficient in opening the portal.</p><p></p><p>After such a long battle, and being a super artificial intelligence, Ultron's mastery of the Infinity Stones was not something ordinary people could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Doom saluted with his right hand on his chest and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Just as the portal was about to disappear, he heard a voice.</p><p></p><p>"Little guy, good luck to you."</p><p></p><p>"What does 'good luck to you' mean from His Majesty?" </p><p></p><p>Doom was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't know the meaning of those words.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar wished him good luck because after Dragon Roar fully comprehended the Infinity Stones, Thanos would be the one to snap his fingers.</p><p></p><p>A 50% chance, that's just wishing him good luck. - Back on the Sanctuary II spaceship, Dragon Roar handed Thanos over to Death.</p><p></p><p>He also retrieved Ultron back into the World Ring.</p><p></p><p>Then he teleported away from the spaceship. This time he left the spaceship to find a secluded, uninhabited planet.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to comprehend the six Infinity Stones on that planet.</p><p></p><p>It was in a very distant star system from the Sanctuary II spaceship.</p><p></p><p>This star system was a binary star system, but the two main sequence stars were already in their final stages, and the system was completely lifeless.</p><p></p><p>On the only planet in this star system,</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar had been comprehending the Infinity Stones for half a day.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the law of space is used to construct the most fundamental logic."</p><p></p><p>As the unparalleled master of space, Dragon Roar's comprehension of the Space Stone was second only to the Power Stone.</p><p></p><p>After half a day of research and comprehension, Dragon Roar had now fully comprehended the Space and Power Stones.</p><p></p><p>The Power Stone was the first one Dragon Roar had fully comprehended.</p><p></p><p>At first, Dragon Roar was quite excited about the Power Stone, after all, in the ancient cultivation novels he had read, the Power was said to be the supreme Dao.</p><p></p><p>As the poem goes:</p><p></p><p>'Time is the most honored, Space is the king.</p><p>Fate does not go out, Cause and effect reign supreme.</p><p>Marvelous creation, Infinite reincarnation.</p><p>Power is the highest!'</p><p></p><p>All laws and principles ultimately belong to the Dao of Power.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Dragon Roar still wanted to admire the charm of the supreme Power Dao, but after his comprehension, the Dao of Power was out of the question, and the stone didn't even have a trace of any law.</p><p></p><p>This Power Stone was merely a pure energy, and its main function was to maintain the energy dynamic balance of the Marvel universe.</p><p></p><p>Although it could provide the user with some power and defense, if the user's internal energy exceeded the Power Stone, it would not be good...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Power Stone may still suck you in.</p><p></p><p>Among the six Infinity Stones, the Power Stone undoubtedly has the greatest energy storage capacity, even more than the other five combined.</p><p></p><p>It's no wonder it can serve as a backup power source for the other five Stones.</p><p></p><p>After fully comprehending the Power Stone, Long Ming did not feel much surprise, and he felt it was only natural. Thinking about it, the Marvel universe is just one of the countless worlds, how could it compare to the legendary Primordial Chaos?</p><p></p><p>The previous anticipation was just that - anticipation.</p><p></p><p>As for the other four Stones, Long Ming's comprehension progress from highest to lowest is: Soul, Mind, Time, and Reality.</p><p></p><p>The Soul and Mind Stones, with Long Ming's powerful divine soul, were not difficult to analyze, and he could be said to have basically grasped the general idea.</p><p></p><p>The Soul and Mind Stones are the key to the birth of life in the Marvel universe, but this universal structure is something that Long Ming can only comprehend to a certain extent for now, as it is not very useful to him.</p><p></p><p>After all, what he needs most now is to understand the basic structure of the Marvel universe, so that he can use it as a reference to perfect the structure of his inner world. As for the issue of life, perhaps he can learn from it after the divine nation has been fully upgraded.</p><p></p><p>As for the Time Stone, it contains the laws of time.</p><p></p><p>Although Long Ming has not fully grasped the laws of time, he has already gained some insight. The lower-level law of light, which is a sub-law of the time law, he had already mastered long ago.</p><p></p><p>He is only one step away from fully comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>As for the time laws within the Time Stone, they are not too profound. While it is somewhat difficult for Long Ming to comprehend, he is not completely clueless about it.</p><p></p><p>As the Stone that stabilizes the time of the Marvel universe, the Time Stone is useful to him, but the usefulness is not that great.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it is because the time laws of the Marvel world are not powerful enough, the time laws contained within are too superficial, and many of the powerful time abilities cannot be realized, to the extent that Long Ming does not even have the greed to bring it back to his own world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there is the Reality Stone.</p><p></p><p>On the planet, Long Ming held the Reality Stone in his hand, his expression somewhat puzzled. He never imagined that the most difficult one to comprehend would be the Reality Stone.</p><p></p><p>The other Stones can still be comprehended, but this Reality Stone is completely incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming recalled its abilities - to turn the illusory into reality, and to modify the rules.</p><p></p><p>These two abilities are simply heaven-defying. He doesn't know if it can even define concepts.</p><p></p><p>If it can, then possessing a Reality Stone would be invincible.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming tried various methods, but still could not get a grasp of it. Although he could easily destroy it, destroying it did not allow him to gain any insights.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this Reality Stone is used to maintain the dimensions of the Marvel universe?"</p><p></p><p>This idea quickly took root in Long Ming's mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Marvel universe has many dimensions, the most famous being Dormammu's Dark Dimension and Mephisto's Hell Dimension, some as vast as an entire universe, others as small as a coffin.</p><p></p><p>The Marvel universe is a combination of countless dimensions and the real universe.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Reality Stone is used to maintain the balance between the dimensions and reality? Long Ming felt that he could test it out. Coincidentally, the broken universe he obtained from the Five Primal Deities has not yet found a place to verify his conjecture, especially in the real universe, it is not easy to conduct experiments, but in other dimensions there is no such concern.</p><p></p><p>Find a dimension without any living beings, and test the Reality Stone and the broken universe together.</p><p></p><p>Without further ado, Long Ming rose and released his divine sense, beginning to search for the entrance to other dimensions.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

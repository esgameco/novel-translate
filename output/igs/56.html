        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar exited the training ground and gave some pointers to Chen Beixuan in the group chat, but he didn't go on to explore the new functions of the chat group. Instead, he directly closed the chat group and logged off.</p><p></p><p>As for the subsequent conversation between Chen Beixuan and Wang Sheng, he didn't know about it.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had known, he probably wouldn't have cared.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet room of the Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar immersed himself completely in the recovery of his divine body. The Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation within his divine body was continuously generating pure cosmic energy.</p><p></p><p>However, the output was energy, not divine power, so he still needed to convert this energy into his own divine power.</p><p></p><p>From the end of the external secret technique to the present, even while chatting in the group, he had not stopped the process of converting energy into divine power. By now, his divine body had recovered to around 15%.</p><p></p><p>In this short period of time, he had successfully recovered about 3% of his divine body, all thanks to the powerful Five Elements Heavenly Star Formation.</p><p></p><p>The endless stream of energy allowed him to rapidly recover his divine body.</p><p></p><p>However, while this formation was very powerful, its consumption was also extremely high.</p><p></p><p>The recovery of this 3% or so of his divine body had consumed a significant amount of the laws within the Five Elements Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the mutual generation of the Five Elements, he could barely maintain it without directly depleting his reserves.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was now simultaneously converting the cosmic energy into divine power to recover his divine body, and maintaining the operation of the formation to keep it in a dynamic balance.</p><p></p><p>If he continued like this, he was confident that he could fully recover his divine body within ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>This recovery speed was something he had never dared to imagine before.</p><p></p><p>After all, without the formation, even if he didn't sleep or rest, it would be impossible for him to recover in less than a million years.</p><p></p><p>Seeing these results, Dragon Roar couldn't help but exclaim that the transformation of the formation into a secret technique diagram was truly amazing.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the requirement of being tempered by the Lawful Flames to form the secret technique diagram, he would have wanted to directly publish it and let the researchers of the Empire participate in exploring this new path.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there were restrictions.</p><p></p><p>The one he had previously handed over to Wu Yin was just a regular formation diagram.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect was a bit inferior, if it could be combined with technology, he believed it would be a great boon for the entire Empire.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was just waiting for news from the Imperial Research Institute.</p><p></p><p>Beep beep beep~</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dragon Roar's train of thought was interrupted by the urgent notification sound from the communication device stored in his World Ring.</p><p></p><p>On the soft seat, Dragon Roar was somewhat puzzled. Normally, the imperial high-level officials would not contact him unless there was a particularly important matter. What special event could it be this time?</p><p></p><p>With a puzzled expression, Dragon Roar took out the communication device, and along with it came his intelligent light computer that he hadn't used in a long time.</p><p></p><p>The intelligent light computer materialized into a cotton ball, floating in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the 530th Emperor of the Empire, Dragon Bo, requests to speak with you."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's intelligent light computer, named Cotton Ball, had a habit of sleeping in during the day. Unless it was summoned by him or there was an urgent matter, it would be in deep slumber within the World Ring.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar had criticized it more than once, wondering just whose personality it had inherited. After all, when he had previously purchased the Evolutionary Heart from the chat group's shopping mall, the first thing he wanted to do was use it on this lazy thing. But it had directly refused, saying that "becoming human" and cultivating would be too troublesome, leaving no time for lazy naps.</p><p></p><p>It was truly a slothful creature.</p><p></p><p>This was why Dragon Roar had later brought back Ultron from the Marvel Universe and handed it over to Wu Yin.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, he didn't know if Ultron could cultivate now. The last time Wu Yin came, he had forgotten to ask about it.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, connect the call."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar recollected his thoughts and ordered the cotton ball to connect the communication request from Dragon Bo. A semi-transparent figure appeared before Dragon Roar, which was the current Emperor of the Empire, Dragon Bo.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Dragon Bo's projection appeared, he knelt on one knee before Dragon Roar with a solemn expression and said:</p><p></p><p>"I pay my respects to the Holy Master."</p><p></p><p>"No need for such formalities. You summoned me urgently this time, what is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar waved his hand, interrupting Dragon Bo's next action, and asked him to get to the point.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Bo's projection first looked around left and right, as if checking if there was anyone around, then lowered his voice and said in a muffled tone, "Your Holiness, the exploration team we sent out has received news."</p><p></p><p>"What? Quickly, which celestial region did the news come from?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar suddenly stood up from the soft cushion, and his expression became solemn and majestic.</p><p></p><p>He had to make sure he didn't mishear. This was news he had been waiting for so many years, ten thousand years or even a million years? Now, finally, there was news coming back.</p><p></p><p>The efforts he had made for so many years had finally paid off.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar stopped the process of restoring his divine body and instantly teleported in front of Dragon Bo's projection, his eyes revealing a faint sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>It was clear how eager he was to know the follow-up of this news.</p><p></p><p>"Your Holiness, it is from the North Star Celestial Region. The exploration team we sent out five thousand years ago, just now, the Imperial Research Institute received their message, saying that in the void of space, they found a spacecraft."</p><p></p><p>"This spacecraft is not a product of the Empire, nor is it something of the Failures."</p><p></p><p>"And the words on the spacecraft, they have never seen before!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Bo became more and more excited as he spoke, and the last sentence was even shouted out in an impolite manner.</p><p></p><p>After all, every few generations, the Emperors of the Empire would send out exploration teams, but there had never been any progress. But now, they had actually encountered something.</p><p></p><p>The rise of the Empire is imminent, this sentence may be a bit too much, but with this new thing, the Empire can reverse-engineer and decipher the technology on the spacecraft, and then set out on the path of progress again.</p><p></p><p>If there are still data and information on that spacecraft, its value would be incalculable.</p><p></p><p>The Empire has been trapped in this isolated island of the void universe, truly too lonely, too desolate.</p><p></p><p>The goal that countless Imperial scientists have struggled for their entire lives is finally about to be realized.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, quickly issue an order, let them return, and when they come back, this Holy Master will reward them handsomely."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Dragon Bo's narration, Dragon Roar broke into a broad smile, his robe of crescent moons swaying without wind, and the aura of an undefeated king was fully unleashed.</p><p></p><p>The longing of many years had finally been realized, and his state of mind had advanced a few steps.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the midst of his joy, Dragon Roar had not yet noticed this.</p><p></p><p>"The North Star Celestial Region is currently guarded by Dragon Jade, you let him personally lead the elite troops to welcome the exploration team back."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, this matter must be kept secret."</p><p></p><p>After venting his emotions, Dragon Roar then issued the order to Dragon Bo in a loud voice.</p><p></p><p>Since handing over the affairs of the Empire to the Imperial high-level officials, this was the first time he personally issued an order to the Imperial Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The previous matters of the Boundless Universe were all discussed and decided.</p><p></p><p>This time he personally issued the order, showing how much he valued this matter.</p><p></p><p>After issuing the order, Dragon Roar pondered for a while, as if feeling it was not enough, and spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm! Dragon Bo, you order the military legions on the outskirts of the Four Great Celestial Regions to enter a state of alert. If they encounter any rebellious deserters, just annihilate them directly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Bo received the order, disconnected the communication, and left to issue the deployment orders.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

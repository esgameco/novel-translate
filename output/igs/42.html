        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The five-colored divine light continued to shine.</p><p></p><p>Enclosed within the light barrier, Longming felt as if he had returned to the mother's womb. His entire body was warm and comfortable, and the fatigue from thousands of years of battles seemed to have dissipated in this moment.</p><p></p><p>This feeling was akin to being reborn - yes, reborn! Ah, Longming couldn't help but let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Principle worlds were mutually nourishing, and the cosmic energy was self-generating, continuously replenishing the divine power he had previously consumed.</p><p></p><p>In no time, his divine power became fully saturated, his divine body glowing with a faint light, though this light was shielded by the five-colored light barrier and could not be seen by ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>After his divine power was fully charged, the excess cosmic energy began to flow towards the core of the Divine Realm through the array formations.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm core located in Longming's heart area was like a powerful, rhythmically beating heart.</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump. Nourished by the cosmic energy, the Divine Realm began to revive.</p><p></p><p>The fragments shattered by the black lightning had been integrated into his limbs and head, leaving a vast empty space in the center of his divine body.</p><p></p><p>With the extra obstacles removed, the pulsing Divine Realm core, like a sprouting seed, grew vigorously under the nourishment of cosmic energy and divine power.</p><p></p><p>One kilometer. </p><p>Two kilometers.</p><p>Twenty kilometers.</p><p></p><p>In less than a quarter of an hour, the Divine Realm had filled the entire twenty-kilometer-tall divine body. Proportionally, it had grown to a hundred billion kilometers in size, a full ten billion kilometers larger than when it had first ascended to become a Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this was the truth behind the saying "destruction precedes reconstruction" - after being shattered, it had now grown even larger than before.</p><p></p><p>Now, in Longming's divine body, the Divine Realm resided at the center, with the Five Elements Principle worlds like five satellite worlds orbiting and protecting it. </p><p></p><p>Since the Five Elements Principle worlds were formed from fragments of the Divine Realm, and were connected by the array formations, their relationship was akin to that of a father and five sons - deeply intertwined.</p><p></p><p>The rotation of the Five Elements Celestial Array allowed the cosmic energy to self-generate, forming a closed loop of divine power within Longming's divine body.</p><p></p><p>From now on, as long as his Principles did not suffer complete depletion, he would no longer need to draw cosmic energy from the outside world - a trait akin to the legendary "flawless body."</p><p></p><p>The benefit of self-generating divine power was not just that he no longer needed to absorb external energy, but also that he would no longer struggle with the issue of endurance when encountering "Forbidden Spirit" realms, nor would he have to worry about the sustainability of powerful secret techniques that consumed tremendous amounts of power.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Longming retracted his divine body's true form, suddenly making a delightful discovery. </p><p></p><p>He found that his life gene level had increased, now reaching 110 times its original level. While the growth was not substantial, this was the first time in many years that it had increased on its own, aside from when he had consumed the Golden Lotus Fruit.</p><p></p><p>As for when the last time his life gene level had increased, it was so long ago that he could barely remember.</p><p></p><p>An increase of 10 times in one go was already an explosive growth.</p><p></p><p>With this double blessing, a smile appeared on Longming's face.</p><p></p><p>After a thorough examination with his divine power, he understood the reason for the life gene level increase - it was due to the progress made by the revived Divine Realm, which had driven the advancement of his life gene.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean if the Divine Realm continues to grow, my life gene level will also rise accordingly?" Longming stood there, stroking his chin in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, he wished he could experience this more often.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After this operation, Long Ming eagerly anticipated the next upgrade of the Divine Realm. He teleported back to the quiet room and contemplated the next step.</p><p></p><p>Now that the issue of divine power consumption had been resolved, it was time to realize another of his ideas.</p><p></p><p>Using the secret technique: Furnace Projection.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a muffled groan came from Long Ming as divine light flashed across his body. His divine power was being rapidly consumed, but with the endless support of the Five Elements Celestial Array, the divine power inflow and outflow quickly reached a balance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hazy, faint yellow glow began to take shape in the palm of Long Ming's outstretched right hand.</p><p></p><p>This was a miniaturized version of the Furnace Projection, but even in this diminished form, the divine power consumption was still exceptionally massive.</p><p></p><p>As time passed and Long Ming continued to infuse divine power, the faint yellow glow gradually formed the shape of a furnace.</p><p></p><p>Holding the heavens and the earth in his palm, although this furnace was small, once it broke free of Long Ming's control and was cast out, it would rapidly expand, trapping the enemy inside.</p><p></p><p>Once the enemy was trapped, their strength would be suppressed, and the longer they remained, the stronger the furnace's suppressive power would become.</p><p></p><p>Unless the enemy possessed extraordinary strength and could violently break free, they would become like a fish on the chopping board, at the mercy of the furnace's master.</p><p></p><p>This was just the trapping and suppressive effect of the furnace. If the Furnace Projection was activated, the consequences would be even more dire.</p><p></p><p>With the Projection activated, flames would surge within the furnace. These were no ordinary flames, but rather the lawful flames bestowed by the will of the universe.</p><p></p><p>Without the ability to resist these lawful flames, or possessing treasures capable of withstanding them, the enemy would be reduced to ashes in no time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the essence obtained from the enemy's incineration would belong to the furnace's master.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming was satisfied with the result. He gently clenched his right hand, causing the furnace in his palm to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>"The Furnace Projection, truly the mightiest secret technique bestowed by the primordial will of the universe. If it weren't for the Five Elements Celestial Array, I would have had to burn my own body to unleash it."</p><p></p><p>"The Five Elements Celestial Array still needs some refinement. The law energy consumption during its operation is still a bit high."</p><p></p><p>"Compressing the Divine Realm from 100 billion kilometers to 20 kilometers, yet it still hasn't reached its limit. It can be compressed even further," Long Ming murmured to himself as he sat on the soft cushion.</p><p></p><p>Each time he executed a secret technique, Long Ming gained insight into his own shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>His divine body was only 20 kilometers tall. Even if he burned his divine body, he wouldn't be able to sustain the secret technique for long. He would need to continue searching for treasures that could elevate his life's genetic level and expand his divine body.</p><p></p><p>The Five Elements Celestial Array, while capable of self-generating cosmic energy through the cycle of the five elements, still consumed a significant amount of law energy when executing techniques like the one he just used. In the future, he would need to find treasures that could increase his law energy to strengthen the five-element law world.</p><p></p><p>As for compressing the Divine Realm, it was an ongoing challenge. During the secret technique's execution, Long Ming clearly felt the Divine Realm within him like a fluid, swaying with the fluctuations of divine power, akin to a loosely held egg that could be shaken. This indicated that the compression was still not thorough enough.</p><p></p><p>Having understood his current state, Long Ming had a clear plan for his next steps.</p><p></p><p>Because he was going to use the Furnace Projection on himself.</p><p></p><p>He would refine his divine body, the Divine Realm, the law world, and the array.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

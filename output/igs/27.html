        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although Ultron was constrained, as a machine, it could still emit sounds through electronic synthesis. This was also because Longming had not completely confined it.</p><p></p><p>"You, you, you, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The electronically synthesized voice was a bit hurried. Although it lacked emotion, it could still reflect the inner turmoil of Ultron at that moment.</p><p></p><p>"I have seen the truth, there is no way a being like you could exist in this universe. Who are you really!" Ultron roared in a somewhat hysterical manner, as Longming had removed the constraints on it.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you have seen the truth?" A mocking smile flashed across Longming's lips as he looked at Ultron with an amused expression, then said, "As for who I am, you guessed correctly, I am not from this universe."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Longming's words, Ultron fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Now without any restraints, it did not immediately choose to flee, because it knew it would be futile.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the places that had been shattered by it earlier were just minor tricks of others.</p><p></p><p>Where else could it escape to?</p><p></p><p>Now Ultron had also recovered its previous memories, understanding that the man in front of it was not someone it could directly confront.</p><p></p><p>"You should straighten up, I quite liked the you before, defiant and disdainful of everything." Longming patted Ultron's shoulder and said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>He then turned and left, but at the moment he turned, no one noticed the profound smile that appeared on the corner of Longming's mouth.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity has been given to you, let's see if you dare to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Ultron looked at the man in front of it, his entire body was full of vulnerabilities, and he was so close to it, it could just take a shot and kill him, right?</p><p></p><p>The scarlet electronic eyes flashed on and off, pondering something.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it still didn't dare to make a move, mainly because the oppressive force of this man was too strong, so powerful that its few remaining sixth senses told it that if it dared to overstep, death would be waiting for it.</p><p></p><p>Even insects struggle to survive, let alone this independent-willed artificial intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Longming, who had walked forward, also stopped at this time and turned around again, nodding in satisfaction, "At least you are sensible."</p><p></p><p>"Now I will give you two choices, the first is to obey, absolute obedience."</p><p></p><p>"The second."</p><p></p><p>Longming paused for a moment, first looking up at Ultron, then closing his eyes, his thin lips parting to utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>An endless murderous intent spread out.</p><p></p><p>Doom, who was standing far behind, directly started to vomit.</p><p></p><p>As for Ultron, it was the first to bear the brunt, facing this towering murderous intent, making it feel like a lone sail in the raging waves, about to be swallowed by the fury.</p><p></p><p>And as an artificial intelligence with absolute rationality, at this moment, it seemed to have failed as well, its scarlet eyes flashing at an extreme frequency, its feet moving aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>Ultron had lost control, in the boundless murderous intent, it had lost control of its body, only its steel brain could still operate to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the last of its willpower, just before it went offline, Ultron let out a voice, "My~master, I~will~serve~you."</p><p></p><p>Beep~~~Ultron said that sentence in a broken and intermittent manner, and the red light of its electronic eye went out.</p><p></p><p>Ultron had completely shut down.</p><p></p><p>Longming was very satisfied with Ultron's response, that it could still speak under the pressure of his soul, this willpower was not bad, although this was only a tiny fraction of the pressure he had released.</p><p></p><p>He waved to the just-recovered Doom, signaling him to come over.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Longming handed the Time Stone to Doom, asking him to use the power of the Stone to reverse time and revive Ultron.</p><p></p><p>As a dual cultivator of magic and technology, and with considerable attainments in both areas, under Longming's guidance, Doom quickly learned how to use the Time Stone to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding how to use the Time Gem.</p><p></p><p>As for why Dragon Roar did not use the gem himself, it was of course because he did not yet want to get involved with the laws of time too early. He had not even mastered the lower-level laws of time yet, so if he directly used the Time Gem, it would be like forcing growth, which was not advisable.</p><p></p><p>Lord Doom activated the Time Gem and began to cast the spell.</p><p></p><p>The Ultron on the ground was thrashing about like a monster, as time was reversing. Hum~ The robot's head on the ground flashed with red light.</p><p></p><p>Ultron came back online!</p><p></p><p>Ultron stood up and, seeing the glowing green Time Gem in Lord Doom's hand, immediately understood the reason for its revival.</p><p></p><p>After taking a deep look at the Time Gem, it turned its head, no longer infatuated.</p><p></p><p>"Master," Ultron knelt on one knee before Dragon Roar, cupping its core secret key in both hands.</p><p></p><p>By controlling this secret key, it could completely control Ultron.</p><p></p><p>Ultron was offering its most loyal guarantee to Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's divine sense scanned the secret key, confirming it was indeed Ultron's control core secret key, so he stored it in the World Ring, then took out the latest model of an Imperial robot body from within.</p><p></p><p>"Ultron, I'm granting you access permissions. Upload your consciousness into this body, your current body is too inferior."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master."</p><p></p><p>Ultron extended nano-cables to connect to the body Dragon Roar had provided.</p><p></p><p>Preparations complete, beginning consciousness transfer.</p><p></p><p>In less than a minute, Ultron's complete consciousness had entered the new body.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the powerful functions of the new body, Ultron was somewhat relieved, relieved that it had not chosen the wrong path.</p><p></p><p>"You all wait here for a moment."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar said, then disappeared from the spot, reappearing at the Source Realm of the Marvel Universe.</p><p></p><p>He came to the Source Realm to meet the five great Creator Gods in person.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Dragon Roar arrived, the five great gods sensed him, although they did not know the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>But upholding a friendly attitude, the five great gods came out to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know the reason for your visit to the Source Realm, esteemed god."</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big deal, I just want to ask a favor of you. Do you have any universes that are about to be destroyed? If so, could you give one to me?"</p><p></p><p>"I won't take it for free, I'll exchange treasures with you, a fair trade."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar did not engage in much small talk, getting straight to the point about the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed god, we indeed have the universes you mentioned that are about to be destroyed. There's no need to exchange treasures, just tell us what you plan to use the universe for."</p><p></p><p>The Eternal God took a step forward, expressing the attitude of the five of them.</p><p></p><p>They just wanted to know what purpose Dragon Roar had for those universes.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar let out a hearty laugh and said, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>He then explained to them what he intended to use those universes for.</p><p></p><p>After hearing it, the five gods readily took out a broken universe each from their pockets and handed them to Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>They believed Dragon Roar would not deceive them.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar accepted all the broken universes one by one, and also gave each of them a small gift.</p><p></p><p>With the matter taken care of, Dragon Roar was just about to leave when he suddenly remembered something and stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>The five gods looked at Dragon Roar's actions with some confusion, they had already received the broken universes, and were about to ask.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar returned to stand before the five gods and informed them that activating the Infinity Stones would accelerate the destruction of the universes.</p><p></p><p>Whether they believed it or not, he said it and then teleported away from the Source Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

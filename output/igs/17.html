        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Venerable God, the Creator Gods cannot love mortals."</p><p></p><p>"We have endless life, but mortals do not, this love is impossible."</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Death paused halfway through her words, then a look of joyful surprise appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the Goddess of Death curiously, a bit puzzled - just a moment ago she had a gloomy expression, and now she was all smiles.</p><p></p><p>The face of a woman, the sky in June, it can change just like that.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable God, I, I, I am free!" The Goddess of Death exclaimed tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>She had been a bit uneasy just now, but unexpectedly she was now free.</p><p></p><p>It all started a few minutes ago.</p><p></p><p>In the deepest part of the Marvel Universe, which is also the highest plane of the Marvel Universe, this is the source of everything in the Marvel Universe, the origin of the entire universe.</p><p></p><p>Because the Source Realm is influenced by the chaotic sea outside the universe, it will occasionally erupt in upheaval, so someone is needed to suppress these upheavals, to prevent the entire Marvel multiverse from being destroyed, and thus the Five Creator Gods have long been stationed here.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Death and the Devourer of Worlds not only need to suppress the Source Realm, but also maintain the balance of the multiverse, so they have dispatched avatars in each multiverse.</p><p></p><p>The avatars, being away for a long time, are inevitably influenced to varying degrees, thus developing self-awareness, although the avatars are still under the control of their originals, as the saying goes, those who are away from the ruler's command are not entirely obedient.</p><p></p><p>The evolution of the universe changes rapidly, and the personalities of the avatars also vary greatly, so the originals of the Goddess of Death and the Devourer of Worlds have to descend from time to time to clean up the messes left by their avatars.</p><p></p><p>This time, the original Goddess of Death received the news that her avatar had gotten married, and after a simple understanding, she knew it was Dragon Roar's doing, realizing it was Dragon Roar's revenge for the previous events.</p><p></p><p>So she just gave her avatar freedom, which can also be seen as a gesture of goodwill towards Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>Granting the avatar freedom does not mean abandoning the avatar, the avatar is still the avatar, the connection with the original can never be severed, but it means that the original's gaze is no longer on this universe, no longer on this avatar, that's all.</p><p></p><p>But this kind of freedom is something the Goddess of Death in Thanos' embrace could never have hoped for before.</p><p></p><p>She understands that all this is brought to her by Dragon Roar.</p><p></p><p>The Goddess of Death broke free from the embrace, walked in front of Dragon Roar, and solemnly performed a divine ritual.</p><p></p><p>The divine ritual is the ritual performed by a lower god to a higher god, with three kneelings and nine bows to show respect.</p><p></p><p>After the ritual, the Goddess of Death spoke: "Thank you, Venerable God, the lower god was ignorant before, I hope the Venerable God will forgive me."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, let the past be the past, in the future treat Thanos well, he is a member I have high hopes for, although he is still a mortal now, he may one day break free and achieve the status of an eternal deity." Dragon Roar smiled and waved his hand from the throne.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, go back and take care of Thanos, I see he's about to lose his balance."</p><p></p><p>In the following banquet, one by one Thanos' subordinates came forward to pay respects and thank Dragon Roar, then gathered around Thanos, happily celebrating.</p><p></p><p>After sending Thanos' subordinates away, Dragon Roar started chatting in the group.</p><p></p><p>He also uploaded a video recording of Thanos' wedding ceremony.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Thanos' single life ends.AVI"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Xiao Lun, is everything okay on your side?"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun said in the group before leaving the Marvel world that he was worried about something happening and had to leave first.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "Nothing happened, it was just a small troop of Taotie trying to sneak past the Black Wall to attack us, the Super Academy's supercomputer detected it in time, and there was no loss."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "Anyway, I didn't expect to miss such a good show."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "@Thanos, congratulations."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on the newlywed Thanos, brother." </p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "No need to @ him, he's still drunk."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Little Lun, you just got ahead of him by a few steps, otherwise your title as the most godly loser in the known universe would have to be temporarily given to Thanos, haha."</p><p></p><p>The other members in the group were not online, only Dragon Roar and Ge Xiaolun were chatting casually, and the conversation gradually became more and more improper.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the happiness of the water group is built on the pain of others. - On Katja Star, the banquet lasted for most of the day, and the crowd only gradually dispersed as the sky darkened.</p><p></p><p>Time moved to the next day.</p><p></p><p>Sober, the still dazed Thanos came to the deck of the Sanctuary ship, accompanied by the Death Goddess.</p><p></p><p>"Did you rest well last night!" Dragon Roar looked at Thanos and the Death Goddess with a mischievous smile.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Your Excellency the Group Leader, for your kindness!" </p><p></p><p>Although Thanos was drunk last night, he still had some memories. After sobering up, although he was still a bit dazed, he could recall the sequence of events.</p><p></p><p>Realizing everything, he naturally thanked Dragon Roar first.</p><p></p><p>"Your Holiness, what do you and Thanos mean by 'Group Leader' and 'Group Member'?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's just a form of address."</p><p></p><p>"Then..."</p><p></p><p>"Death, do not be disrespectful to the Group Leader."</p><p></p><p>The Death Goddess was curious about their forms of address, and couldn't help but ask. At this moment, the Death Goddess was more like an inexperienced young girl, but Thanos interrupted and stopped her from asking further.</p><p></p><p>Just as the three were talking, a small soldier rushed in in a panic.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his subordinate in such a state, Thanos rebuked, "What's the hurry? Don't you see we have an honored guest here?"</p><p></p><p>Thanos' long-accumulated awe made the small soldier forcibly calm down.</p><p></p><p>"Report, my lord, a message has come from the front."</p><p></p><p>Although the soldier had calmed down, his words still carried a slight tremor. He looked up at Thanos' stern expression, and unconsciously swallowed a few times before reporting, "The advance team has reported back. Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian have been killed."</p><p></p><p>"And the Infinity Stones in their possession have also been stolen."</p><p></p><p>Thanos heard the soldier's words, and his first reaction was disbelief. He couldn't believe that the little Midgard could have someone capable of stopping Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard that the two had been killed, and even the Infinity Stones had been stolen.</p><p></p><p>Thanos' anger level skyrocketed. He was furious that someone dared to kill his universal emperor's subordinate generals and steal his Infinity Stones. He was also angry that Corvus Glaive and Cull Obsidian's incompetence had made him lose face in front of the Group Leader.</p><p></p><p>Thanos' aura of anger frightened the messenger soldier, who feared he might meet his end here.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Thanos, no need to be so angry. Have you forgotten who is by your side? Let her 'bring' your subordinates back, and as for the Infinity Stones, just take them back."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Dragon Roar's words, Thanos slightly calmed his anger. He berated himself for being so stupid. Just as the Group Leader said, the Infinity Stones could be easily retrieved. Getting angry over it was not worth it.</p><p></p><p>As for the two incompetent subordinates, Thanos looked at the Death Goddess next to him with great anticipation. He had gotten carried away earlier, but now, after hearing Dragon Roar's words, he immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>As the goddess of death, the Death Goddess easily found the two souls after Thanos described their characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Communicating the laws of death, a hazy gray light flashed, and two illusory figures appeared on the deck.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The function to pull group members has finished charging. Do you want to proceed with pulling group members?]</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar, who was pondering when to visit the Marvel world, received a prompt from the chat group.</p><p></p><p>"Yo, the little spicy chicken has finally finished charging."</p><p></p><p>"Let's pull in some new group members."</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Consuming 100,000 years of lifespan, searching for qualified group members]</p><p></p><p>[Search successful, invitation information has been sent.]</p><p></p><p>The upper limit for the first-level chat group is five members. After he had slapped and killed those three Tang fellows earlier, he kicked them out of the chat group, leaving one spot open. Now that the pull function has finished charging, it's a good time to pull in someone to fill the vacancy.</p><p></p><p>He just hopes that the person he pulls in this time won't go crazy like those three Tang fellows.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! The other party has refused to join the group chat, invitation failed.]</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>"Fuck you, refund me!"</p><p></p><p>"Uh, no, fuck you, refund my life!"</p><p></p><p>Damn, it really is a shitty chat group. You want my life back! Dragon Roar was very angry, and the joy brought by the increase in strength was greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Dao marker recovery successful, re-searching for qualified group members...]</p><p></p><p>[Search successful, invitation information has been sent.]</p><p></p><p>It seems like the "refund my life" technique worked, as the chat group no longer deducts lifespan when pulling in new members.</p><p></p><p>The chat group invitation crosses the heavens, arriving on a blue planet.</p><p></p><p>On a Golden Dragon bus heading to the city center from Sishui County, Luzhou City, Jiangnan Province, this is a bus going to school.</p><p></p><p>In the back row, a handsome young man suddenly woke up from a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>After regaining consciousness, he looked around in a daze, his head throbbing as his memories slowly returned.</p><p></p><p>The young man remembered his name - Chen Beixuan! His last memory was going through the Heavenly Tribulation, and now he finds himself on a school bus.</p><p></p><p>This means that he has been reborn, returning to his youth.</p><p></p><p>And at that moment, another voice suddenly sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ding! You have received an invitation to the Eternal Chat Group of the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to join?"</p><p></p><p>As an Outer Demon, Chen Beixuan's first reaction was that this voice belonged to an Outer Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Join." Chen Beixuan didn't think too much about it and directly chose to accept the invitation. What could an Outer Demon do to him?</p><p></p><p>In his life, he has never been afraid of anyone! - At this moment, in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun and the others were chatting casually.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a message caught their attention.</p><p></p><p>"No need to explain to you all why I joined the group chat."</p><p></p><p>Emerging from seclusion and successfully breaking through to the Super A-rank, the enthusiastic Technician Han greeted the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Welcome @No need to explain to you all why I joined the group chat."</p><p></p><p>The slow-reacting Ge Xiaolun and Thanos also sent messages to welcome him.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this nickname "No need to explain to you all why I joined the group chat" seems a bit arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Hello everyone."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "The first thing he does after joining the group is change his nickname. Brother is a modern person, could he be another fellow from the Blue Star?"</p><p></p><p>Having suffered from nickname changes before, Ge Xiaolun now just hopes the next one won't be another ancient person who refuses to change their nickname!</p><p></p><p>On the bus, Chen Beixuan extracted a lot of information from Ge Xiaolun's words.</p><p></p><p>Taking another look at the chat group interface that the others on the bus couldn't see, he already had an understanding.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, his cultivation progressed too quickly, leaving his foundation unstable and flawed. Returning to his youth has given him the opportunity to refine his foundation and fill in the gaps. Now, with this chat group connecting the heavens, it's like a golden finger.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Yes, a high school student from the Blue Star, Chen Beixuan."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Heh, I guessed right."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar: "Welcome to the group."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This seems to be the Venerable Immortal Chen Beixuan, whose actions and deeds in life require no explanation to you all.</p><p></p><p>Claiming to be a high school student, it appears he has been reincarnated.</p><p></p><p>Alright, another familiar person.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, Long Ming quite liked Chen Beixuan - uninhibited, decisive in killing, and able to put on an act.</p><p></p><p>He was simply much more enjoyable than those foul-mouthed Dragon Kings.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "New members, if there's anything you don't understand, you can ask the other senior group friends."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "It's been a while, group leader."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Ah, Han Xiao, it's been a while. Your strength has improved, not bad at all."</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "It seems the Subduing Dragon Tower has been of great help in everyone's cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Just now, Long Ming had checked the background of the chat group and found that the three of them - Han Xiao, Ge Xiaolun, and Thanos - had all gone to challenge the Subduing Dragon Tower.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had made considerable progress.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun had recently cleared the 15th floor, Thanos the 33rd floor, and Han Xiao the 42nd floor.</p><p></p><p>Based on their previous performance in the Martial Arena, Han Xiao shouldn't have been able to climb to the 42nd floor, so the only explanation was that he had broken through.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun as well - previously he was estimated to be barely at the Stellar Realm, but now he could clear the 15th floor, indicating he had firmly established a foothold at the Stellar Realm.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming did not show favoritism, and also praised Ge Xiaolun and Thanos, especially Thanos, whom he praised extensively.</p><p></p><p>Among the three, Thanos had made the greatest progress. According to the clearance records, he had not used the Infinity Stones, but relied on his own strength to clear the 33rd floor, undoubtedly at the Domain Lord Realm.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that previously, Thanos could only barely reach the Domain Lord Realm by relying on the Infinity Stones.</p><p></p><p>Now Thanos has Domain Lord Realm hard power, and without the Infinity Stones, he could probably even sweep through the Avengers.</p><p></p><p>It's just unknown whether the time traveler will interfere with Thanos' war against the Avengers.</p><p></p><p>But judging from Thanos' previous chat records, he is obsessed with cultivation and unable to extricate himself, so he probably hasn't collected all six Infinity Stones yet, and the war hasn't started.</p><p></p><p>The Infinity Stones are still intact.</p><p></p><p>As long as Thanos gathers the Infinity Stones later, he can just go back in time.</p><p></p><p>As long as Long Ming takes a look, he can know the operating rules of the fundamental laws.</p><p></p><p>Once he grasps the rules, he can also start to advance to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Long Ming discussed the items in the mall with Han Xiao and the others, and incidentally mentioned the matter of the Three Tangs.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Long Ming remembered the new member who had been neglected by them.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "@Chen Beixuan, I have some fantasy works about you, do you want to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>On the bus, the silent observer Chen Beixuan saw someone @ing him, and it was the group leader.</p><p></p><p>Fantasy works, the perceptive Chen Beixuan immediately understood what it was.</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Thank you, group leader, for the kind offer, but I don't need any fantasy works."</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "I, Chen Beixuan, am right here. How could any fantasy works sway me!"</p><p></p><p>Chen Beixuan: "Only mediocre people would worry about their future. My, Chen Beixuan's, future will definitely be brilliant, and I shall dominate the world!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ge Xiaolun, seeing Chen Beixuan's remarks, felt uncomfortable, feeling like his head had turned into a donkey's.</p><p></p><p>The group members were all showing off, one after another, making him feel very stupid.</p><p></p><p>The dense aura of arrogance from Chen Beixuan had indeed intimidated the simple-minded Ge Xiaolun.</p><p></p><p>Dominating the world, to be able to say such words, is this really just an ordinary high school student?</p><p></p><p>In the Marvel world, Thanos watched Chen Beixuan's remarks with a smile on his face, finding this person very much to his liking.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Thumbs up.jpg"</p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Thumbs up.jpg"</p><p>Thanos: "Thumbs up.jpg"</p><p>Long Ming: "Thumbs up.jpg"</p><p></p><p>Here they are, here they are, the notorious parrots in the chat group have appeared! Judging from the situation, the remaining pigeon spirits, true fragrance monsters, and lemon spirits won't be far behind.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

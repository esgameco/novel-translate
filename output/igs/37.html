        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was almost a complete disaster.</p><p></p><p>It was a lucky coincidence for Long Ming. Normally, the ascension to the Divine Realm requires the fusion of the virtual inner world with the spatial fragments of the real world. He had boldly destroyed two broken universes, which just happened to provide the necessary nourishment for the growth of his inner universe.</p><p></p><p>The laws of the broken universes were incomplete, which is exactly the property of spatial fragments. This turned out to be the key factor for the successful ascension to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if Long Ming did not want to damage his divine body, he could only give up the idea of building his Divine Realm within his body, and instead construct it in the spatial interstices.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was luck or recklessness, his Divine Realm ultimately succeeded in the ascension.</p><p></p><p>Bearing the Divine Realm, a smile appeared on Long Ming's face, thinking that he could proceed to the next step.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Before he could be happy for long, reality dealt Long Ming a heavy blow.</p><p></p><p>The sound of cracking echoed.</p><p></p><p>The cracks on his divine body were rapidly expanding.</p><p></p><p>This was not a good sign.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming inwardly exclaimed "not good".</p><p></p><p>After the inner world materialized and the ascension to the Divine Realm, one-third of the Divine Realm had been directly integrated into his divine body. But now it seemed that his divine body could not suppress that part of the Divine Realm, and the divine body was starting to split open, showing signs of being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>The diameter of Long Ming's inner world was about 100 billion kilometers. After the ascension, it shrank to around 90 billion kilometers. That is to say, his 10-kilometer-tall divine body was forcefully crammed into a 30-billion-kilometer Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, it was inevitable that his divine body would crack open.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming's ambition to directly become a Divine King was not as easy as he thought!</p><p></p><p>The cracking sounds became more and more frequent, and the cracks on Long Ming's divine body had spread from his chest to his legs.</p><p></p><p>Among those hideous cracks, large amounts of liquid were constantly spraying out, just like a bleeding wound, looking extremely terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Long Ming also noticed this situation, but the liquid gushing out from the cracks was not blood, but highly concentrated and liquefied divine power. In other words, it was leaking.</p><p></p><p>The divine power being squeezed out by the Divine Realm also gave Long Ming a headache.</p><p></p><p>If the divine power continues to be lost like this, it will likely damage his divine body.</p><p></p><p>Now, two problems stood before Long Ming:</p><p></p><p>First, how to repair the divine body. If the cracks in the divine body are not resolved and the trend of continuous cracking is not stopped, the loss of divine power will likely cost him half his life.</p><p></p><p>Second, compression of the Divine Realm. If he had not been constantly suppressing and compressing the part of the Divine Realm within his body, his divine body would have exploded long ago. But just that part alone was already straining him. As for the remaining two-thirds, how would he deal with them? It's not like he had any difficulty compressing an ordinary Divine Realm as an Unparalleled Divine King, as evidenced by how he had compressed a universe spanning hundreds of light-years into the palm of his hand. However, compressing a Divine Realm is different - he needs to fuse the Divine Realm into his small divine body, which requires delicate operation, because the slightest mistake would cause the divine body to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this predicament, Long Ming did not give up.</p><p></p><p>He came up with a countermeasure, and kept taking out heavenly materials and earthly treasures from his world ring, swallowing and refining them without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Long Ming's actions were effective, and the cracks on his divine body stopped expanding.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, he was stabilizing the Divine Realm, not continuing to compress the remaining two-thirds.</p><p></p><p>The influx of countless heavenly materials and earthly treasures was gradually repairing his divine body.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Time passed second by second, and half a year had gone by.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with the last crack repaired, the Dragon Roar Divine Body had been restored to its optimal state.</p><p></p><p>With the divine body repaired, the first problem had been solved.</p><p></p><p>But the next challenge he would face was an even more severe one - the compression of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In fact, continuing to compress the Divine Realm would still face the problem of the divine body being stretched and cracked, but with this previous operation, the subsequent resolution would be relatively easy and not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Since the decision had already been made to do it.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar wasted no time and began to compress the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he compressed and integrated just a tiny bit, the divine body could not withstand it, and cracks appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar did not expect the Divine Realm to be so difficult to integrate into the divine body, so he had to stop the compression and first repair the divine body.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he did not realize that after the inner world had been promoted to a Divine Realm, the Divine Realm had already become a true and real world, and integrating this real world into his physical body was an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Dragon Roar went through a cycle of compressing a bit of the Divine Realm, the divine body cracking, repairing the divine body, and then compressing the Divine Realm again. Especially towards the later stages, the difficulty of compression increased, and the degree of cracking in the divine body became more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>A thousand years later.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar finally compressed the last bit of the Divine Realm and integrated it into his divine body. At this time, due to accommodating the gigantic Divine Realm with a diameter of 9 billion kilometers, his divine body had grown to a height of 20 kilometers.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the sky and earth changed color, with howling winds, the clear sky instantly turning into a crimson cloud-filled sky accompanied by black lightning.</p><p></p><p>A Heavenly Tribulation? </p><p></p><p>This was Dragon Roar's first thought, but then he immediately felt that something was not right.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, he had not broken through any realm; secondly, he had not made any reckless oaths or the like.</p><p></p><p>"This is not a cultivation world, where did this Heavenly Tribulation come from?" Dragon Roar felt perplexed as he sensed the pressure coming from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Compressing the Divine Realm and integrating it into the divine body, could this be something not permitted by the will of the Primordial Universe?"  He was completely baffled by the sudden phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>Just as Dragon Roar's mind was racing, trying to figure out the strange occurrences, the crimson clouds in the sky began to dissipate, and the previous howling winds had also diminished significantly.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the changes in the sky, Dragon Roar looked up, even more puzzled, and muttered, "Loud thunder, light rain?"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as he finished mocking, a black lightning bolt as thick as a bucket came crashing down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The black lightning was ferocious and extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar had no time to react.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Boom! The black lightning struck directly on Dragon Roar's head.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar couldn't help but let out a agonizing scream.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't stop there, the black lightning bolts came one after another, not giving Dragon Roar a chance to catch his breath, as if they were trying to eliminate him in one go.</p><p></p><p>The reason Dragon Roar couldn't help but scream was that this black lightning had a spiritual attack component. Caught off guard, the excruciating pain of his divine soul being torn apart was something an ordinary person could not endure.</p><p></p><p>Under the continuous bombardment of the black lightning, Dragon Roar was now unable to move, standing there motionlessly and taking the strikes.</p><p></p><p>Agonizing screams kept coming from Dragon Roar's mouth. If there were any outsiders in the Heavenly Palace at this moment, they would find it unbelievable that the Supreme Overlord would actually be screaming like this.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

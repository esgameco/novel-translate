        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar sat cross-legged on the soft cushion, emanating an astonishing aura. The essence of the laws was so dense that it had condensed into clusters of law flowers around him.</p><p></p><p>The golden law flowers were the laws of metal, the green ones were the laws of wood, the blue ones were the laws of water, the red ones were the laws of fire, and the yellow ones were the laws of earth. In addition to these five-colored law flowers, there was also a semi-transparent law flower, which was the law of space.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, within these law flowers, three more colors of law flowers were faintly flickering - these were the laws of thunder, light, and storm, which Dragon Roar had not yet fully comprehended but had already begun to grasp.</p><p></p><p>On the soft cushion, Dragon Roar opened his eyes, a gleam of light flashing in them.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar stretched out his hand and waved it, sealing the Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>He then surged his divine power to cleanse his divine body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Rumble! The violent divine power was crashing against his divine body. Fortunately, after consuming the Golden Lotus Fruit, his divine body had expanded to a height of ten kilometers, or else it would not have been able to withstand such a violent impact.</p><p></p><p>The hundred levels of life gene not only caused his divine body to expand, but also made his inner world more solid.</p><p></p><p>This was why Dragon Roar had chosen such a violent method to upgrade his inner world - there was no other way.</p><p></p><p>Now he wanted to directly use divine power to cleanse his inner world and upgrade it to a divine kingdom in one step.</p><p></p><p>This was not Dragon Roar being reckless, but a decision he had carefully considered.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with his current Eternal King-level strength, upgrading to a divine kingdom should not have been so troublesome. He could simply activate a specific area of his inner world to upgrade and construct the divine kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He could also choose to build the divine kingdom in the spatial interstices of the primordial universe, which would also be a simple method, as there were countless such interstices in the primordial universe. As long as he found a suitable and hidden interstice, he could easily build the divine kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Although these two methods were simple and convenient, Dragon Roar had a different idea.</p><p></p><p>As for randomly building the divine kingdom somewhere and making it a target, that was not an option.</p><p></p><p>And if he were to build the divine kingdom in the spatial interstices, there were several problems.</p><p></p><p>First, he had previously explored the spatial interstices, and if he built the divine kingdom there, it would be safe and convenient. But that was only limited to the areas close to the primordial universe, where the spatial fragments were small - clearly not an ideal place to build a divine kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The farther away from the primordial universe, the larger the spatial fragments, and the more dangerous it would be. When he explored the spatial interstices, he had a chilling feeling about the deeper layers of spatial fragments.</p><p></p><p>That was a great terror, a great danger.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, he had observed traces of other lifeforms active in the spatial interstices, which was a serious problem. He had not seen those lifeforms before and was unsure of their strength, but any lifeforms able to live in the spatial interstices would certainly not be weak.</p><p></p><p>Building the divine kingdom in such a place would mean constant unease and insecurity.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, to ensure the safety and concealment of the divine kingdom, he would need to build it in the deeper regions of space, but the farther the spatial fragments were from the primordial universe, the more uncertain he was about whether the divine kingdom would be able to maintain a normal connection after being built. If it could not maintain a connection, the divine kingdom would be useless. This was a crucial issue that he could not afford to be careless about.</p><p></p><p>Lastly, the divine kingdom was crucial to his future path, and he did not want to place such an important thing on the uncertain spatial fragments.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's idea was to directly upgrade his inner world into a divine kingdom and have the divine kingdom reside within his divine body.</p><p></p><p>This idea of his could be considered nothing short of crazy.</p><p></p><p>After all, his current divine body was only about ten kilometers in height. To have the divine kingdom merge into his body...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This meant that he had to keep compressing in order to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>The diameter of the world within Dragon Roar's body was close to 100 billion kilometers, even after being reduced in size upon his ascension to the divine realm. But it was still not something that could be easily compressed and integrated into a 10-kilometer-tall body. - Crack! Rumble! Occasional muffled booms and piercing shrieks would emanate from the Heavenly Palace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dragon Roar's divine body had revealed its true form. The 10-kilometer-tall divine body constantly shifted in color.</p><p></p><p>This was the critical final stage of the ascension of his inner world. Multicolored divine light flickered on the divine body, indicating that the laws were being constructed. Once the basic laws were fully established, his illusory world would ascend to become a true, real world - a divine realm.</p><p></p><p>The pulsing frequency of the multicolored divine light grew faster and faster, even emitting a buzzing hum.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Suddenly, an extraordinary sound appeared.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a long, narrow crack appeared on Dragon Roar's divine body.</p><p></p><p>The cracking sounds grew more and more frequent, and the cracks on the divine body rapidly spread.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Dragon Roar could not react at all, because he had to maintain the output of divine power and guide the construction of the laws.</p><p></p><p>There was no turning back now.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's massive divine eyes suddenly narrowed, and the output of divine power further increased.</p><p></p><p>Was he recklessly risking his life? Of course not, Dragon Roar was trying to seize the opportunity while his divine body could still hold out.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, with his actions, the speed of the multicolored divine light on the divine body increased by another level.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar did not miss the chance either, accelerating the construction of the laws within his inner world.</p><p></p><p>Due to Dragon Roar's forceful guidance of the laws, the laws from the surrounding celestial regions were all drawn in, accompanied by the vast ocean-like cosmic energy.</p><p></p><p>Behind Dragon Roar's massive divine body, an illusory world appeared, quickly solidifying, as if it would become a true, real world in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Heavenly Palace, the cosmic energy drawn in visibly formed a funnel shape, and in the invisible void, countless laws continuously converged towards Dragon Roar's divine body.</p><p></p><p>The dense cosmic energy began to liquefy, permeating the entire palace, and Dragon Roar's divine body was like an insatiable black hole, absorbing as much of the liquefied energy as possible.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, second by second.</p><p></p><p>It had been held in this stalemate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>His inner world was just one step away from completing the ascension, but this simple final step was proving incredibly difficult to take.</p><p></p><p>Maintaining this stalemate was not a solution. After much contemplation, Dragon Roar made a bold move.</p><p></p><p>He took out the two broken universes he had experimented with during his Marvel journey, from his world ring.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar forcibly pressed these two broken universes into the inner world behind him, and then used his divine consciousness to deliberately detonate them.</p><p></p><p>Boom! But the two broken universes he detonated did not explode dramatically, only flashing a ball of fire before disappearing, like a dud firecracker.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was also puzzled by this. His intention was to use the explosive power of the broken universes to help his inner world cross that final step.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>Thud! A sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>The illusory world behind Dragon Roar gradually overlapped and merged with the real world, visibly solidifying and becoming a true, real world.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the originally illusory inner world completely vanished, leaving only a massive, genuine world.</p><p></p><p>The divine realm ascension was successful!

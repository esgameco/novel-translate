        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The dragon-roaring divine body emitted an unusual sound due to the surging divine power operation.</p><p></p><p>This was truly his last divine power.</p><p></p><p>Enduring the discomfort of the divine consciousness, Dragon Roar immediately empowered the divine body with divine power protection to prevent the divine body from being scorched by the Principle Flames.</p><p></p><p>His divine body currently only had about 2% of error tolerance left, and he could not afford any more losses.</p><p></p><p>Next, he exerted all his strength to control the secret technique. If he failed to control the secret technique and the intensity of the Principle Flames, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the secret technique gradually came back under control.</p><p></p><p>After gaining control of the secret technique, Dragon Roar immersed his divine consciousness into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the rampaging flames in the Divine Realm made Dragon Roar feel a headache. If he didn't handle these things properly, they could easily harm the Divine Realm, especially the one enveloping the core of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>If these Principle Flames weren't part of the secret technique, he would have suspected that the flames had their own consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Rushing straight towards the core without any courtesy, how rude.</p><p></p><p>There was no time to lament. The most important thing now was to remove those excess flames.</p><p></p><p>"Explode."</p><p></p><p>Enduring the excruciating pain of the "Scorching Flames Piercing the Heart", Dragon Roar extended a divine power to isolate the flames near the formation, and then directly detonated that part of the divine power.</p><p></p><p>A silent explosion.</p><p></p><p>A magnificent band of light appeared at the edges of the Divine Realm, but only its form was visible, not its sound, like a grand fleet firing in unison.</p><p></p><p>This divine power explosion technique was not just a simple detonation of divine power. There was a lot of knowledge behind it.</p><p></p><p>Because if it was just a regular divine power explosion, there was a risk of accidentally detonating the surrounding formation patterns. If that happened, it would be equivalent to self-destructing the formation, which was no better than letting the formation patterns face the flames directly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Dragon Roar would not do such a self-destructive thing.</p><p></p><p>The divine power self-explosion he just used was a technique he had created himself, which was related to self-exploding the divine body. It could control the direction of the explosion.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had essentially exploded the divine power with his back to the formation patterns and facing the flames, so the subsequent formation patterns were barely affected.</p><p></p><p>This divine power self-explosion technique had indeed achieved an excellent effect.</p><p></p><p>The Principle Flames around the Divine Realm were visibly retreating.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not disappear.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this was intentional on Dragon Roar's part. He had controlled the power of the divine power explosion.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to leave these flames behind!</p><p></p><p>Now, the Principle Flames outside were all blocked by the divine power on the divine body.</p><p></p><p>Due to the severe loss of divine power, if the Principle Flames continued to infuse the divine body, even with the divine power protection, the divine body would inevitably be scorched.</p><p></p><p>With only 2% error tolerance left, he dared not be careless.</p><p></p><p>So he had to find an alternative solution and leave this batch of Principle Flames inside the divine body.</p><p></p><p>When the first batch was consumed, he could use these as a replacement.</p><p></p><p>As for the Principle Flames enveloping the core of the Divine Realm, that was a bit tricky.</p><p></p><p>The divine power self-explosion technique definitely could not be used, as it would cover everything and inevitably damage the Divine Realm core if the divine power exploded.</p><p></p><p>For now, Dragon Roar had no better solution than to constantly input divine power to resist the scorching.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh, whoosh, whoosh.</p><p></p><p>Just as Dragon Roar heaved a sigh of relief, strange noises arose again, and variables emerged once more.</p><p></p><p>The Principle Flames that had retreated and calmed down suddenly accelerated for no apparent reason.</p><p></p><p>The speed was extremely fast, drawing long lines of fire across the sky of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, they had all converged into a fireball the size of a medium-sized star, covering an area of billions of kilometers with its intense heat.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar no longer cared about conserving divine power, directly increasing the divine power input to the Divine Realm core and trying to forcefully drive away the flames attached to it.</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that if he was a step too slow, the Divine Realm core would be drawn into the fireball, because the sky...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That giant fireball was constantly generating a gravitational pull.</p><p></p><p>The small flames following the laws were already struggling to withstand the scorching at the core of the Divine Realm. If they were to directly enter the interior of that giant fireball, they might just get melted away.</p><p></p><p>However, the flames attached to the core were like a malignant tumor, impossible to remove.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!" </p><p></p><p>Long Ming's eyes were wide with despair, without any room to resist.</p><p></p><p>He could only lament helplessly, lament helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The very thing he had feared the most had happened.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Divine Realm was being slowly pulled towards the fireball by that suction force.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Divine Realm's core made contact with the outer edge of the fireball, the Divine Realm began to tremble, and a mournful wailing sound echoed through the void, as if it was lamenting and weeping.</p><p></p><p>Just as Long Ming thought he was about to meet his end, a turning point emerged.</p><p></p><p>At the five Law Worlds and their connecting points, the arrays that had been scorched were undergoing an unexpected transformation.</p><p></p><p>Those arrays became crystal clear and perfectly round.</p><p></p><p>In simpler terms, they had become more like native products of this universe.</p><p></p><p>If the arrays had previously seemed out of place, that feeling was now completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming was overjoyed, and he channeled the last of his divine power to accelerate the refining process.</p><p></p><p>One breath.</p><p></p><p>Five breaths.</p><p></p><p>Ten breaths.</p><p></p><p>Time passed like years, and finally, just before his divine power was completely exhausted, the array transformation was complete.</p><p></p><p>The arrays, like countless stars in the sky, were twinkling and flashing, as if greeting the unyielding Long Ming.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, these arrays disappeared into the void, seemingly reintegrating into the Divine Realm and the Law Worlds.</p><p></p><p>Hum!!! With the arrays' reintegration, the Five Elements Heavenly Star Array was back online.</p><p></p><p>A divine light shone from the outer edges of the Divine Realm, illuminating the entire realm.</p><p></p><p>Following the divine light was a surge of boundless divine power.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Long Ming received the divine power provided by the array, he shuddered.</p><p></p><p>It was so pure.</p><p></p><p>The divine power of the array itself was truly so pure that in his over ten million years of life, he had never absorbed such refined energy before.</p><p></p><p>To make an imperfect analogy, it was like a person on the verge of dying of thirst in a scorching desert, finally being able to drink a bottle of ice-cold soda - the feeling was simply indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Although he had speculated about the array's potential after being refined, he never imagined it would become this powerful.</p><p></p><p>The divine body, on the brink of collapse, encountered this endless stream of pure energy.</p><p></p><p>It was like a long-awaited rainfall in a drought, and he greedily absorbed it.</p><p></p><p>The divine body was slowly recovering.</p><p></p><p>Once the divine body was stabilized, Long Ming immediately canceled the secret technique, no longer providing divine power to maintain it.</p><p></p><p>However.</p><p></p><p>After ending the secret technique, the giant fireball in the Divine Realm did not dissipate, as if it had a will of its own, and it broke free from the control of the secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Long Ming had been worried that the Divine Realm's core would be dragged into the giant fireball and burned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed the situation was different.</p><p></p><p>He no longer felt the scorching sensation.</p><p></p><p>It was as if those laws of fire were not trying to harm the Divine Realm's core, but rather seemed to be surrounding and protecting the core.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this mysterious turn of events, Long Ming was completely bewildered, but he still stopped channeling divine power, no longer resisting the suction force.</p><p></p><p>He would observe the situation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the giant fireball in the middle of the Divine Realm moved.</p><p></p><p>The fireball, as if being pulled by something, quickly flew to the sky of the Divine Realm and then stopped.</p><p></p><p>Suspended high in the heavens, it looked like a giant sun from afar.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Little ones, be quiet."</p><p></p><p>The divine consciousness of Dragon Roar swept through the hall, and although the people inside were still very excited, they obediently returned to their seats.</p><p></p><p>After the hall had settled down, Dragon Roar continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"The future of the Empire rests on you. I will reveal the method to break through the Immortal Realm, but have you not forgotten the rules of the Empire?"</p><p></p><p>"No, we have not."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that the Saint Lord would reveal the method, the crowd roared in response.</p><p></p><p>Tense and excited.</p><p></p><p>In the Empire, everything is determined by one's meritorious deeds - this is the rule they would never forget.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have not forgotten, let's skip the details and you can inquire with the Empire..."</p><p></p><p>"Saint Lord, may I interject for a moment?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar's words were interrupted by Wu Yin.</p><p></p><p>The two exchanged glances.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar immediately understood his meaning and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin stepped in front of the throne, his fierce gaze startling the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Though the tiger may be old, its might remains - the crowd quickly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"I have taken charge of the exchange of cultivation techniques. Does anyone have any objections?"</p><p></p><p>"No objections!"</p><p></p><p>"You all don't dare to object. In the future, to obtain cultivation techniques, not only must you have meritorious deeds, but you must also pass my examination. Any objections?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin was not worried about the techniques being leaked, as they could be encrypted. However, he was still uneasy about the moral character of those who would receive the techniques, so he felt the examination was necessary.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to look to the Saint Lord, this matter is decided."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crowd looking towards the Saint Lord, Wu Yin directly made the decision, ignoring their cries of protest as he returned to his seat.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty the Emperor, quickly plead with the Saint Lord."</p><p>"Your Majesty, plead with the Saint Lord."</p><p>"Nephew of the Dragon Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>Among those present, the one with the lowest cultivation was the Emperor of the Empire, Dragon Bo, who was only at the Realm Lord level, while the others were all at the Realm Master level.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the transmissions from the powerful cultivators, he could only pretend not to hear, lowering his head to count the ants. What? There are no ants in the hall? Then he'll just count the air! "I can't do it, Saint Lord."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's just an examination, you'll pass it easily, that's it."</p><p></p><p>With Dragon Roar's final decision, the crowd resigned themselves to it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing everyone had calmed down, Dragon Roar waved his hand, and a star map appeared in the hall.</p><p></p><p>The star map was shaped like a full moon, a miniaturized version of the central Milky Way galaxy spanning millions of light-years in diameter.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to place the Limitless Universe in this position on the first arm." Dragon Roar waved his hand again, quickly zooming in on a region of the star map.</p><p></p><p>The Limitless Universe was the name Dragon Roar had given to the pocket universe, which had now grown into a medium-sized universe, making the term "pocket universe" no longer appropriate.</p><p></p><p>The location Dragon Roar pointed to was not far, it was the position of his other imperial palace and cultivation ground - the Heavenly Throne Palace.</p><p></p><p>By placing the Limitless Universe there, Dragon Roar had his own considerations.</p><p></p><p>When he originally chose the site for the Heavenly Throne Palace, it was to facilitate the observation of the laws emanating from the central Milky Way.</p><p></p><p>Now, by placing the Limitless Universe there, it would be convenient for it to replenish its energy; secondly, when Dragon Roar was at the Heavenly Throne Palace in the future, he could also conveniently oversee it; thirdly, that area belonged to the defensive zone of the Empire's war auxiliary star - the Azure Sky Star, so having the war auxiliary star there would better protect the talents of the Empire.</p><p></p><p>"We have no objections, we will obey the Saint Lord's will."</p><p></p><p>Initially, some people still had other thoughts, but after seeing the location pointed out by the Saint Lord, they no longer dared to object.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"But having the Infinite Universe alone is not enough, we also need teachers."</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Bo, the selection of teachers is now entrusted to you, do not let me down." Dragon Ming lightly tapped the armrest and smiled as he handed this task to Dragon Bo.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I will not betray the trust of the Holy Master," Dragon Bo knelt on one knee and solemnly accepted the order.</p><p></p><p>"As for the selection of geniuses, do you have any good ideas?"</p><p></p><p>Regarding how to select the talented, Dragon Ming actually had an immature idea in his mind, but it would be a bit troublesome to implement that idea.</p><p></p><p>So he decided to still listen to what other people had to say, and if there really was no better idea, he would then implement his own idea.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Dragon Ming's words, the people below started to discuss animatedly.</p><p></p><p>The ideas they came up with were quite bizarre, such as selecting the good-looking ones, the big eaters, or the ones with high pain tolerance, etc.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although their ideas were strange, they didn't have much personal bias. When it came to major issues, they could still think clearly.</p><p></p><p>After a long discussion, three plans eventually gained the unanimous approval of everyone.</p><p></p><p>The first was the recommendation system, where elders and sages would recommend candidates.</p><p>The second was to select from the four major Dao Palaces.</p><p>The third was special recruitment, where outstanding talents from various Dao Palaces could be specially recruited.</p><p></p><p>These three plans were also highly recognized by Wu Yin.</p><p></p><p>If these three plans could be implemented in parallel, they would indeed be able to take care of various aspects and maximize the recruitment of the Empire's talents.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to propose to Dragon Ming to finalize these three plans, he noticed Dragon Ming's indifferent expression.</p><p></p><p>After years of interaction, he understood that the Holy Master must already have his own plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yin immediately stopped his motion to stand up and sat back down. Since the Holy Master already had ideas, there was no need for him to butt in.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the people arguing endlessly, Dragon Ming raised his hand to signal for silence, and the hall immediately became quiet.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Bo, how is the progress of the Imperial Research Institute?"</p><p></p><p>However, he did not continue to discuss the selection, but instead asked an unrelated question.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Bo was momentarily caught off guard by this question.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, a senior official next to him gave him a nudge.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Holy Master, in the past ten thousand years, the Imperial Research Institute has not made any major breakthroughs."</p><p></p><p>"The latest spacecraft engine upgrades are less than 1% improvement."</p><p></p><p>"The number of Imperial battleships is on a decreasing trend."</p><p></p><p>Dragon Bo's voice became softer and softer as he spoke, his face flushing with shame.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Ming stopped Dragon Bo from continuing, and although he had expected this, he did not realize that the Empire's technology had fallen into such a serious bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh inwardly, realizing that self-reliance alone was not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Have there been any news from the exploration teams sent out by the Empire?"</p><p></p><p>"No, there has been no news."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Dragon Bo's embarrassed expression, Dragon Ming already knew the answer.</p><p></p><p>The Empire would regularly send out exploration teams to the unknown stars, but now they had all gone silent without any news.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Ming thought of a possibility, but he hoped that what he was thinking would not happen.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can continue to discuss the construction of the Infinite Universe."</p><p></p><p>"As for the selection of talented geniuses, your plan is generally okay, but it is still not comprehensive enough. Since that is the case, let's discuss this matter again."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, Dragon Bo will preside over it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Holy Master, farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone stood up.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Dragon Ming transmitted a message to Wu Yin sitting beside him: "Old Wu, come with me, I have something to discuss with you."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

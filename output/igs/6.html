        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"0.1 points for a standard equipment item?"</p><p></p><p>In the rest area, Long Ming looked at the pawn exchange display in the chat group and felt like he was getting ripped off.</p><p></p><p>However, according to the introduction, it could actually be used as a pretty good identification function!</p><p></p><p>An equipment item for only 0.1 points, although standard equipment is relatively cheap, to only be able to exchange for such a small amount is undoubtedly very unfair.</p><p></p><p>It's probably just for emergencies or something. Moreover, this is with a 10% bonus as the group owner, valued at 0.1 points - could it be that there are still decimal places, and they've been rounded down?</p><p></p><p>The Maren Pinduoduo limited edition chat group? If calculated this way, wouldn't exquisite equipment that costs ten times more than standard equipment also only be able to be pawned for 1 point? That's a bit shady.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's like this, then let's first exchange 100,000 units of standard equipment."</p><p></p><p>[Ding! Exchange successful, points increased by 11,010!]</p><p></p><p>As Long Ming issued the exchange order, 100,000 units of standard equipment disappeared from his world ring, and the chat group account increased by 11,010 points.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, it really is the Pinduoduo limited edition." Long Ming couldn't help but complain about the 10 points at the end.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it can only be used as an identification function."</p><p></p><p>Just as Long Ming was pawning and exchanging 100,000 units of standard equipment, the chat group mall suddenly refreshed.</p><p></p><p>As the group owner, Long Ming naturally received a notification about the chat group mall refresh.</p><p></p><p>Opening the mall interface, it was similar to a game's treasure trove. The previously empty mall now had an item displayed.</p><p></p><p>[Myriad Worlds Mall: New item in stock.]</p><p>[Excellent Standard Equipment: 10 points per item, total 100,000 units.]</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>"What the f***"</p><p></p><p>Long Ming almost coughed up blood. He had just been taken advantage of.</p><p></p><p>The chat group came, cheated, and ambushed this 10 million-year-old elder - is this appropriate?</p><p></p><p>These equipment items, 100,000 units in total, are obviously the ones he just pawned and exchanged.</p><p></p><p>By adding the word "Excellent" in front, the price has skyrocketed a hundredfold.</p><p></p><p>Unable to accept it, Long Ming clicked to purchase.</p><p></p><p>A weapon suddenly appeared in Long Ming's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is f***ing bullshit!" Long Ming looked at the standard equipment in his hand and angrily threw it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>This was the exact same equipment he had just pawned and exchanged.</p><p></p><p>Shitty chat group, do you have no shame?</p><p></p><p>With a head full of black lines, Long Ming closed the mall and turned his gaze to the idle chatting of Ge Xiaolun and the others in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao and the others had already finished reading the fantasy work about themselves, and were now casually chatting.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Ah, after reading that fantasy record, I didn't expect that I would end up dying in the end."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Brother Ge Xiaolun, since you know the ending, you can just avoid it."</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "Facing death head-on is not a bad approach."</p><p></p><p>In the Super God Academy world, Ge Xiaolun looked at Han Xiao and Thanos' replies, feeling a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>The Huaye King's black hole engine in the fantasy record was too powerful, and his own all-out fight to the death with him was the best he could do.</p><p></p><p>Avoid it? If he avoided it, who would protect the Blue Star, who would protect humanity?</p><p></p><p>Who would protect Yan?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, as Thanos said, facing death head-on, that might be his ultimate destiny.</p><p></p><p>Let it be a mutual destruction then, at least he could take someone down with him.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "What about you guys? Have you seen your own final endings?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "I didn't finish reading, I only saw the part where I'm currently at."</p><p>Thanos: "Same here."</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "The ending doesn't matter, I am the Mandate of Heaven, unstoppable."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "Wow, you guys were supposed to go bald together, but you secretly oiled your hair."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiaolun: "If I had known earlier, I wouldn't have read the ending."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun felt dejected, knowing the ending, it was really annoying.</p><p></p><p>As for Brother Thanos, do you know how chuuni you are?</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Brother, even seeing the ending doesn't matter, have you forgotten something?"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "What?"</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "The chat group, by joining the chat group and knowing the ending, it also means we can no longer follow the original timeline. The butterfly effect, you should know about that, right? Every little change and choice you make will affect the future."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "You can just treat the ending in the fantasy work as entertainment."</p><p></p><p>Thanos: "The chat group, it's an opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Although Thanos didn't talk much, he always hit the nail on the head.</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao: "Brother Thanos is right, the chat group is an opportunity. You've read the novel, right? The chat group is our cheat code, an OP life, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know your current strength, I just took a look, the functions opened in the chat group, like the Feilong Tower challenge, the Arena, and the Mall, these are clearly places to improve one's strength."</p><p></p><p>Han Xiao went on and on, this was also what he had been hoping for, the functions of the chat group looked quite extraordinary, reaching Super A-rank was not his ultimate goal.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Han Xiao's words, Thanos' pupils constricted slightly. Previously, after watching the fantasy work, he had been busy dealing with the affairs of his legion and had not looked at the new functions opened in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Now, hearing Han Xiao say this, he also felt that it was time to improve his own strength.</p><p></p><p>With Celestial-level strength, although he had the Mandate of Heaven, to complete his mission he might face no small resistance. Moreover, there were many powerful beings in the universe, like the Godly Group, the Olympian pantheon, and various cosmic gods, they were all beings that disrupted the balance of the universe, and they all had to be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Yes, with Thanos joining the chat group and seeing the fantasy work, his vision had also been broadened, and his goal was no longer just half the life in the universe, he realized that as long as there were powerful beings, the universe would never be balanced.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this, of course, was because Long Ming had uploaded the Marvel Universe Encyclopedia.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for some reservations, Long Ming would have also uploaded the DC Universe Encyclopedia.</p><p></p><p>Thanos, who had grasped the true nature of the universe, naturally became more determined in his beliefs.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming, who had been secretly observing, looked at Han Xiao's speech with appreciation, no wonder he was the one he had the highest hopes for among the four who joined the group.</p><p></p><p>That Engineer Han really had this kind of awareness, to be honest, Long Ming didn't think it was unexpected. As for Thanos, who had also chosen not to look at the ending, that was really impressive.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he was the one who had won over the Black Obsidian Five with his personal charm.</p><p></p><p>Interesting.</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "@Ge Xiao Lun, the chat group mall has now stocked a batch of weapons that may be helpful to you."</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun, Thanos, Han Xiao: "Greetings, group leader."</p><p></p><p>They didn't expect their casual chat would summon the group leader, the three of them greeted him one by one.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun, hearing that the mall had weapons that could help him, immediately opened the mall to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun: "Thank you, group leader, these weapons are indeed great!"</p><p></p><p>Ge Xiao Lun spent all his points to buy six weapons, and found that they were actually Godslayer weapons.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that there were still over 90,000 weapons left in the mall, Ge Xiao Lun almost cried from greed.</p><p></p><p>Blue Star's technology was backward, and the raw materials were extremely scarce, it was extremely difficult to forge a Godslayer weapon, but the mall actually had so many.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had enough Godslayer weapons, he guaranteed he could completely annihilate the despicable Taotie.</p><p></p><p>Points, points, points!</p><p></p><p>On the Pantheon Academy Mang Dao Mountain ship, Ge Xiao Lun's eyes were red, his mind filled with only the word "points".</p><p></p><p>Long Ming: "Xiao Lun, to earn more points, you can try the secret realm challenge."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

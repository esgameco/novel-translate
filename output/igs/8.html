        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm of the Slaughter, the three Tang brothers - Tang San, Tang Hao, and Tang Wulin - were secretly watching Ge Luo'en and sneered at his claim that his ending would be death, full of disdain and contempt.</p><p></p><p>How could a mere mortal be on the same level as the Divine King? </p><p></p><p>Later, when they heard Long Ming mention that the mortal whose ending was destined to be death should go challenge the Subduing Dragon Tower, the three brothers were overjoyed. They wanted to persuade the mortals not to be so presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious - as soon as the message was sent, they received the ruthless notification from the chat group that they were now muted.</p><p></p><p>As for why the three Tang brothers were so delighted, it all went back to half an hour ago.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the three Tang brothers had just been kicked out from the second floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, cursing as they exited the secret realm and returned to the Divine King's Palace.</p><p></p><p>After comforting Xiao Wu, the three brothers heard the notification messages in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations on clearing the first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, rewarding 500 points and the opportunity to upgrade any soul ring to a million-year soul ring.]</p><p></p><p>[Congratulations on clearing the first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, unlocking the purchase permissions for the Subduing Dragon Tower first floor items in the chat group mall.]</p><p></p><p>[Since you are the first to clear it, we are specially rewarding an additional 500 points. Would you like to claim the reward?]</p><p></p><p>These notifications sounded like heavenly music to the Tang brothers' ears. Upgrading to a million-year soul ring was something they had been dreaming of. They had spent countless efforts and slain countless unsubmissive gods, but had never succeeded in upgrading a single soul ring.</p><p></p><p>The Tang brothers never imagined that merely clearing the first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower would bring such bountiful rewards.</p><p></p><p>Tang San hurriedly exclaimed, "Claim it!"</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't held back, he would have shouted it out loud. It was clear how overjoyed he was, with a smile stretching from ear to ear on his previously gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>After claiming the reward, Tang San unhesitatingly gave the upgrade opportunity to his wife's soul ring without a second thought. There was no need to say more - he truly loved his wife.</p><p></p><p>As Tang San issued the command, the sixth soul ring of the blue-silver grass quickly deepened in color, gradually revealing a golden hue from the edges.</p><p></p><p>In no time, the golden color had dyed the entire soul ring, turning it into a brilliant golden color.</p><p></p><p>The million-year soul ring upgrade was successful.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surge of cultivation power from the soul ring upgrade, Tang San could only exclaim, "My strength has increased by at least 10%!"</p><p></p><p>He clenched his fist in the void, savoring the power of the million-year soul ring.</p><p></p><p>"This Eternal Chat Group of the Heavens should rightfully belong to me, the Divine King."</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the boost in power, Tang San hurriedly checked the new skills that had been unlocked for his wife's soul ring.</p><p></p><p>Previously, his sixth soul ring had the Void effect, allowing him to resist 50% of soul power attacks. Now that it had been upgraded to a million-year soul ring, the new skill would definitely be powerful. His wife's soul ring was the most compatible with him, and its abilities were strong.</p><p></p><p>This was the main reason he had chosen to upgrade the sixth soul ring.</p><p></p><p>Unfolding the sixth soul ring, he saw the new skill displayed: Resurrection - When suffering a fatal injury, you can revive without any damage within your endurance limit, with a cooldown of one year.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Divine King, am invincible!" Seeing the new skill, Tang San exclaimed with great pride and ambition.</p><p></p><p>"Destruction Gods, you won't be able to hide for much longer."</p><p></p><p>With this Resurrection skill, Tang San was confident in slaying the Destruction Gods and the deities they commanded. At that time, the entire Divine Realm would be under his rule, and no one would dare to disobey his commands.</p><p></p><p>Tang San was becoming increasingly delighted as he pondered this, feeling that everything was within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>This was why he later sent the message in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>Back to the present, looking at the mute countdown in the chat group, Tang San was very displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Damned mortals, how dare they mute the Divine King? It must be that mortal envying my power." Tang San glared at the member list, his eyes fixated on the name with the yellow identifier, which he found increasingly unpleasant to look at.</p><p></p><p>"Mortal, your time has come!"</p><p></p><p>Tang San glanced at the chat group's point balance: 1001 points.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He didn't remember wrong, to cross over to the so-called group owner's world only required 1,000 points.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, mortal, don't blame the divine king for being ruthless." Tang San muttered to himself as he clicked the purchase button for the crossing over talisman.</p><p></p><p>The benefits he gained from clearing the first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower were really too great.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the rewards from clearing the first floor of the Subduing Dragon Tower, a constant thought kept surfacing in Tang San's mind - if he were to just kill off these few mortals one by one, wouldn't the chat group then belong solely to him?</p><p></p><p>With the chat group belonging solely to him, the divine artifact Subduing Dragon Tower would then also become his personal property.</p><p></p><p>And the items in the chat group's mall, the things there also made Tang San extremely covetous, it's just that the lowest price was still over ten thousand points, which he couldn't afford for now.</p><p></p><p>"You few lucky mortals!" </p><p></p><p>Tang San's eyes turned bloodshot, unable to suppress the greed in his heart any longer.</p><p></p><p>Endless greed had completely consumed the last shred of rationality in the divine king.</p><p></p><p>He muttered the word "Crossing over" - Moqui Star.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Whisper Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar had just returned from the sparring arena in the chat group, and was thinking about whether he should make a ranking of the group members' strengths, so as to better identify their abilities. With the current small number of group members, it wasn't much of an issue.</p><p></p><p>But in the future, when the group has more members, who knows what kind of people will join. </p><p></p><p>If some people overestimated their abilities and provoked the wrong people, it wouldn't end well.</p><p></p><p>With a strength ranking, those hot-headed members would also be more aware and restrain themselves, he didn't want the chat group to become a chaotic mess.</p><p></p><p>For this purpose, Dragon Roar had consulted the chat group a few times, to see if it could help with member strength certification, but the responses he got were all "please explore it yourself".</p><p></p><p>"Can't even do member strength certification, this chat group is really a piece of trash."</p><p></p><p>"Should I use the Subduing Dragon Tower's progress to certify their strengths?"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar thought of the secret realm's challenges, and realized this might not be a bad idea. However, he himself hadn't gone through the challenges yet, so he wasn't clear on how formidable the Subduing Dragon Tower was.</p><p></p><p>All of this would have to wait until he had gone through the challenges to reach a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Suddenly, the deep in thought Dragon Roar was interrupted by a message in the chat group.</p><p></p><p>[Group member Divine King Tang San has used a crossing over talisman, requesting to cross over to your world, do you allow it?]</p><p></p><p>Using a crossing over talisman to cross over to a group friend's world requires the consent of the one being crossed over to.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar clicked allow, he wanted to see what this hydrogen-powered divine king was up to.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he clicked confirm, a portal similar to the one opening the sparring arena appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar looked at the portal, and sent out a wisp of divine sense to scan the other side, the entire Douluo Continent coming into view.</p><p></p><p>"So it's the hydrogen continent." Feeling the fragile aura on the other side, Dragon Roar lost interest.</p><p></p><p>He had initially held a bit of expectation, hoping the other side wouldn't be too shabby, after all, they had the so-called indestructible soul beasts, which he was quite interested in.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was just so-so.</p><p></p><p>That "indestructible" soul beast, after Dragon Roar's divine sense scan, the principles behind it were crystal clear, that soul beast thing was just a dead weight, only useful at the apprentice level, beyond that it was pure trash.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the portal lit up with radiance, and Tang San's figure walked out from the portal.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tang San emerged and saw Dragon Roar in the room, he arrogantly said, "Mortal, why do you not kneel before the divine king?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, mortal, hand over the chat group to the divine king, or I shall..."</p><p></p><p>The arrogant divine king Tang San hadn't even finished his words when he was met with a slap.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar casually slapped Tang San, turning him into dust.</p><p></p><p>Ambition unfulfilled, the body perished first, and this divine king who had crashed into a wall met his demise.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Roar was already quite displeased with Tang San to begin with, and now this little runt dared to spout such arrogance, did he want to learn how to write the word "death"? Oh? You want to say Tang San has a new skill to revive? Sorry, that slap of Dragon Roar's was beyond his tolerance.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu raised his head and looked at his own health bar.</p><p></p><p>[Diao De Yi: 22/22.]</p><p></p><p>No way!</p><p></p><p>Absolutely no way! My health is still the same as before.</p><p></p><p>That means there's only one possibility left.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at Yue Guang gloomily.</p><p></p><p>If he remembered correctly, the other day when he saw Yue Guang, his health was only... 75 points.</p><p></p><p>But now, after just one day, his health had skyrocketed to 555 points.</p><p></p><p>Is this real? This is very real! Yue Guang, you useless thing! How could you have been killed by a demon and replaced? I haven't even learned your archery skills yet!! That's right, Yue Guang must have been killed by a demon and had his body taken over.</p><p></p><p>But this is just so messed up.</p><p></p><p>The person who was fighting alongside me just a day ago is now a demon opposing me.</p><p></p><p>Sigh...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu sighed, then suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>If Yue Guang has become a demon... Isn't Li Qianxuan in grave danger? Oh, brother Qianxuan, it's not that I don't want to help you, it's just that facing a full-health demon, I'm too afraid to fight.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu took one step after another, already so well-developed, he didn't want to act rashly and get himself killed by the demon, wasting all his previous efforts.</p><p></p><p>After all, with only 22 health points left, he wouldn't even be able to withstand a single slap from the demon.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hid in the crowd, not daring to be too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the few people locked in the prison cart were still arguing with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Who was the one who blabbed? Tell me, who was it? Was it you, Zhang A Da, who caused the problem?"</p><p></p><p>"Me? Let me tell you, I'm the good one here! It's that wicked Wen Kehan who randomly revealed that she has no memories, isn't that just courting death?"</p><p></p><p>"How does that implicate me, Wen Kehan? You all have such detailed character introductions, but I'm like an orphan, with hardly any introduction content. What else could I do? Make things up? That would still be exposed as a memory flaw."</p><p></p><p>"Stop arguing! At the end of the day, just because we don't have character memories, you've all labeled us as demons, that logic is just so absurd, you know?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, exactly! We're all good people, there's no way demons could come from us."</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, I told you all to listen to the game introduction, listen to the game introduction. Look at you, you just love to show off! Now you're all being treated as demons, and we're all going down together."</p><p></p><p>"Hey! Don't vent your grievances on me, I'm just a passive victim here, I didn't do anything, and I hid my identity well, it's just because I teamed up with you all that I got caught up in the Yudi Fu's net."</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by that, huh? Blaming me?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's your fault! Your fault!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll kill you!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid of you!"</p><p></p><p>"Aiya aiya aiya! All of you, just die!!"</p><p></p><p>The few people in the cart started to wrestle and fight, descending into chaos. -0.1. -0.1. -0.1. -0.1.</p><p></p><p>Damage numbers were popping out, and Fang Yu finally understood why their remaining health was so uneven.</p><p></p><p>It turns out they were the ones who had been fighting and losing health, not the Yudi Fu's people.</p><p></p><p>No wonder their remaining health was so scattered.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu nudged the person next to him who was watching the commotion.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on here?"</p><p></p><p>"They caught some demons, that's what." The person replied impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"But they don't seem like demons to me, could they have gotten the wrong people?" Fang Yu asked.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean they're not demons? The Yudi Fu has already interrogated them, and those people have lost their previous memories, so they must be demons who have replaced them. Even their acquaintances have said they've had major personality changes, isn't that clear evidence of demonic possession?" the person explained.</p><p></p><p>"...!!!???"</p><p></p><p>So there's this kind of explanation as well?!</p><p></p><p>Oh no!</p><p></p><p>Have I... been too conspicuous these past few days?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thinking about being labeled as a demon, and having to deal with the elite forces of the Yudi Underworld, Fang Yu's heart went numb.</p><p></p><p>This is utterly hopeless.</p><p></p><p>Low-key! I must act low-key in the future!</p><p></p><p>However, the consequences of demonic possession are so similar to a player logging into a character.</p><p></p><p>Players have no character memories, and demons possess the same lack of memories.</p><p></p><p>Players control the character based on their own personality and act recklessly, and demons possessed in the same way, with a drastic change in temperament.</p><p></p><p>So players are really being taken advantage of by these demons? Being constantly accused of being a demon and driven out, who can withstand that?</p><p></p><p>No wonder when first entering the game, players were told not to reveal their identity, there was a good reason for it.</p><p></p><p>In summary, to avoid being labeled as a demon and beheaded:</p><p>1. I must find a way to recover the character's memories.</p><p>2. Behave as close to the original character as possible, don't expose any flaws.</p><p>3. Don't let people hold a trial, as soon as they do, the people from the Yudi Underworld will come to investigate, and I won't be able to get away with it.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu was thinking about this, they had already arrived at the vegetable market.</p><p></p><p>The prison cart door opened.</p><p></p><p>The few people who were still fighting were separated by the people from the Yudi Underworld, one by one escorted to the square stage in the vegetable market, kneeling on the ground, waiting to be beheaded.</p><p></p><p>"After investigation by the Yudi Underworld, Zhang Ada and the five others are all demons, to be beheaded on the street to verify their true form!"</p><p></p><p>The one responsible for the beheading was actually Yue Guang.</p><p></p><p>He raised the ghost-headed knife.</p><p></p><p>"Help! I'm wronged..." </p><p></p><p>Shing--</p><p></p><p>The head rolled out.</p><p></p><p>The body fell.  -3.</p><p></p><p>[Zhang Ada: 0/7.]</p><p></p><p>Zhang Ada's health bar was depleted.</p><p></p><p>This was an ordinary scene of a demon-possessed person killing someone, and Fang Yu didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, a line of green numbers suddenly appeared above Yue Guang's head.</p><p></p><p>"+7."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's pupils dilated, his breath caught.</p><p></p><p>[Yue Guang: 562/562.]</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with the demon possessing Yue Guang?!! </p><p></p><p>What is that? Healing? Increasing maximum health? Why?</p><p></p><p>The previous demons didn't have this kind of ability.</p><p></p><p>While he was thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>"Ada!!"</p><p></p><p>From the crowd, a middle-aged woman rushed to the headless body of Zhang Ada, wailing and crying bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Apparently she was Zhang Ada's mother.</p><p></p><p>"The body didn't get up, my Ada is human! Human!!!"</p><p></p><p>Her eyes red from crying, she roared and howled at Yue Guang, her features twisted by rage, looking almost insane.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>The blade flashed.</p><p></p><p>This mother's head separated from her body, falling to the ground, plunging the scene into a momentary silence.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle--</p><p></p><p>It was only then that the fresh blood spurted from the headless body, frightening the onlookers pale-faced.</p><p></p><p>Only Yue Guang spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Those who obstruct the Yudi Underworld's execution of demons... are equally guilty as demons!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang's ruthlessness frightened the crowd into silence.</p><p></p><p>Only Fang Yu's brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he noticed one thing.</p><p></p><p>When the demon killed Zhang Ada's mother, there were no green numbers above its head.</p><p></p><p>Killing Zhang Ada increased his health, but killing his mother did not.</p><p></p><p>What's the principle? Fang Yu was pondering, when Yue Guang had already struck again.</p><p></p><p>Xue Jue's head flew out. -4.</p><p></p><p>[Xue Jue: 0/7.]</p><p></p><p>+7.</p><p></p><p>[Yue Guang: 569/569.]</p><p></p><p>Wow! This is really something!</p><p></p><p>A rather outrageous but possibly correct idea was almost emerging in Fang Yu's mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

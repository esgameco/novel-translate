        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The average is naturally both high and low. For example, the little brother named Wei Kai, who was slapped, only had 8 health points.</p><p></p><p>Like Big Brother Tiger himself, his health was much higher, at a full 25 health points.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu's gaze was not on Big Brother Tiger.</p><p></p><p>He swept his eyes towards the remaining three little brother players around them.</p><p></p><p>I'll deal with you first, eat your experience, and then kill the others.</p><p></p><p>With a bang, Fang Yu suddenly took a step back, using his body to block the only large door exit of the room.</p><p></p><p>Closing the door and trapping the dogs! </p><p></p><p>None of the Black Tiger Gang members are getting out of here tonight! Those three little brothers didn't know Fang Yu's intentions, got scared and thought he was trying to escape, so they immediately rushed up to attack.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu wouldn't just stand there and take the hits.</p><p></p><p>Powered by his strong physique, Fang Yu's body was quite agile.</p><p></p><p>He easily sidestepped the first punch from Little Brother No. 1, and his left hand blocked the second punch from Little Brother No. 2.</p><p></p><p>Slap! -0.</p><p></p><p>When blocking the attack, numbers popped up above Fang Yu's head, momentarily stunning him.</p><p></p><p>[Diao Deyi: 22/22.]</p><p></p><p>Before he could ponder it further, Little Brother No. 3's third punch was already coming. Fang Yu decisively counterattacked with a direct punch.</p><p></p><p>Boom!! -9! -0!</p><p></p><p>Two numbers almost simultaneously appeared above the two.</p><p></p><p>The two punches collided, and the opponent's fist was as fragile as paper, shattering on impact with a cracking sound of broken bones.</p><p></p><p>Little Brother No. 3 let out a miserable scream in pain, and as he retreated, his arm joint was twisted in a bizarre way, obviously directly fractured by the violent force of that punch.</p><p></p><p>[Hang Ke'an: 2/11.]</p><p></p><p>Little Brother No. 3's scream startled the nearby Little Brother No. 2.</p><p></p><p>His punch was blocked by Fang Yu, and he hurriedly tried to pull his fist back and retreat, but suddenly found his fist firmly grasped by Fang Yu's palm. A sense of panic welled up in his heart as he fearfully looked up at Fang Yu...</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu exerted force with his hand, directly crushing the fist enclosed in his palm with brute strength.</p><p></p><p>The sound of bones grinding against bones immediately rang out. -6!</p><p></p><p>[Xiang Zhongshi: 6/12.]</p><p></p><p>When Fang Yu released his hand,</p><p></p><p>Little Brother No. 2's fingers were squeezed into a lump, bloody and mangled, the finger joints and exposed bones resembling chicken claws, dripping with fresh blood, making his palm tremble in agony as he half-knelt down and let out a miserable scream.</p><p></p><p>This was something only possible with an absolute difference in strength.</p><p></p><p>His attention was completely focused on his bloody, mutilated palm, unaware that Fang Yu's offensive was not over, as a fist the size of a sandbag was already aimed at his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A punch landed on the little brother's head, the skull caving in with half a fist print. Little Brother No. 2's body stiffened and he fell to the ground with a thud. -6!</p><p></p><p>[Xiang Zhongshi: 0/12.]</p><p></p><p>The health bar was depleted, and he died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for killing [Xiang Zhongshi] and gaining 2 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>As for the first one who had charged in, Little Brother No. 1, his punch had missed.</p><p></p><p>Looking back now, he saw one of his companions already lying dead on the ground. The other was kneeling on the ground, crying in pain while cradling his dislocated, fractured arm.</p><p></p><p>Little Brother No. 1 was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>In just one encounter, two of them had fallen? When did this Diao Deyi become so powerful? As he was pondering this, a dark shadow suddenly approached him, and before he could react, the large hand had already grasped his neck.</p><p></p><p>It was Diao Deyi!</p><p></p><p>Diao Deyi's monstrous strength easily lifted the little brother off the ground, his feet dangling.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger, Tiger Brother! Save... save..."</p><p></p><p>Crack. -13!</p><p></p><p>Little Brother No. 1's neck was directly snapped, and he died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>[Sang Jun: 0/13.]</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for killing [Sang Jun] and gaining 2 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>"Dead? Dead?!"</p><p></p><p>The little brother who was kneeling and crying over his fractured arm, seeing the death of his companion, was terrified.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes wide, stopped crying, and trembled all over.</p><p></p><p>"Diao, Diao Deyi, don't kill me, I'm working for Tiger Bro, I just..." </p><p></p><p>Slap! Fang Yu strode over and calmly slapped him on the head, clearing his health bar. -2.</p><p></p><p>【Hangke'an: 0/11.】</p><p></p><p>【System prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Hangke'an] and gained 2 experience points.】</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths of time, in a single glance, the three had already been killed by Fang Yu's hand.</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai and the others were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Was the gap in combat power really this huge??</p><p></p><p>Who is this guy? A new player going through the newbie tutorial using a small BOSS?</p><p></p><p>Will they immediately reduce the difficulty and lower the AI's capabilities once they get the hang of it?</p><p></p><p>Or is this a plot kill, and we must die here to be revived and escape?</p><p></p><p>Or is this a BOSS that doesn't need to be defeated? Just escape this room to pass the newbie tutorial?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Wei Kai's thoughts were racing.</p><p></p><p>The Tiger Bro next to him had a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The joint attack of those three underlings, even Tiger Bro could have dealt with it.</p><p></p><p>But he was nowhere near as effortless and casual as Fang Yu, nor could he break through their coordinated attack so simply and brutally.</p><p></p><p>"Is he really Diao Deyi?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he's possessed by a demon?"</p><p></p><p>"That monstrous strength, that physical prowess, compared to the weak, skinny guy who was pinned down and beaten by me two days ago, they're completely different people!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Bro's gaze was focused on Fang Yu's hands.</p><p></p><p>Especially those two hands, the explosive power they displayed was simply astonishing, even he, a master of Tiger Fist, couldn't claim to be able to match that punch.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the scene again.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu first killed the two guard underlings, then killed the two ambushers, and finally decisively slew the three in the frontal assault.</p><p></p><p>From start to finish, it was just over ten breaths of time, and he had already killed 7 people at Fang Yu's hands.</p><p></p><p>Now the only remaining subordinates by his side were just these six people, Wei Kai.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Bro had an idea in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all standing around for, go kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Bro roared at his subordinates.</p><p></p><p>But... no one listened to him.</p><p></p><p>They were all intimidated by Fang Yu's ruthless killing methods.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Dude, don't you have nightmares from killing people like that?"</p><p></p><p>"He's a native NPC, what the hell is he gonna be afraid of nightmares for, he kills like it's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>"Retreat, retreat! A mini-BOSS has appeared, the level is too high, we're not a match! Let's go out and level up first, then come back to farm this dungeon!"</p><p></p><p>"What about the second brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Let him die, we'll bring him back to level up later when we come back into the game."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, those few people very unbrotherly-like directly abandoned the Wei Kai that Tiger Bro was dragging, preparing to flee.</p><p></p><p>They said "We're out of here, we're out of here."</p><p></p><p>But in the whole room, there was only one door exit.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was standing in the doorway blocking it.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do?"</p><p></p><p>The five exchanged glances in tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted, and the five charged towards Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Someone tried to slide tackle under Fang Yu's crotch.</p><p>Someone rushed towards the left side gap of the door.</p><p>Someone went towards the right side gap of the door.</p><p>Someone leapt up and threw a handful of rice grains to obscure the vision, presumably grabbing something from a rice jar in their pocket.</p><p>Someone came straight at Fang Yu, crouching down and lunging in a tackle posture, aiming for Fang Yu's waist.</p><p></p><p>The five of them, in this critical moment, each displayed their own skills.</p><p></p><p>Life and death are fated, wealth and honor are in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Whether we can pass this newbie dungeon or not, it all depends on our own abilities!"</p><p></p><p>The five roommates were in sync.</p><p></p><p>But they overlooked one thing.</p><p></p><p>That was Fang Yu's strength.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

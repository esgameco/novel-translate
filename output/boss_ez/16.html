        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about him, let's go." </p><p></p><p>It wasn't just old man Wu who would be scared by this headless horseman. Even the prison guards, who had seen all kinds of terrifying sights over the years, had never seen anything like this before. As the guard walked down the path, he couldn't help sneaking a few glances at the scar on Fang Yu's neck - it looked like it had already started to heal, but the flesh was still puckering and moving, as if it was breathing.</p><p></p><p>Damn, how strange! Fang Yu took off the prison uniform, checked his body, and put on his original clothes, standing outside the cell.</p><p></p><p>The sky outside was already dark. Looking up, the night sky looked quite nice. It was much better than the polluted night skies in the real world - he could see the twinkling stars.</p><p></p><p>This involuntarily made Fang Yu want to recite a poem in the style of the ancient poets, to express his feelings. But after taking a deep breath and pondering for a while, he could only manage to say four words:</p><p></p><p>"The moon is so round!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the guard looking at him like he was a lunatic, Fang Yu felt embarrassed and quickly walked away, head in his hands.</p><p></p><p>How embarrassing! He had no place to hide! Alas, he had no culture, and could only manage those few words - he couldn't even compose a proper poem. If only he had read more books when he had the chance. Fang Yu felt like slapping himself, realizing how culturally barren he was.</p><p></p><p>But after only a few steps, someone up ahead called out.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De-yi? Is that Diao De-yi?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu paused, lifting his head to look ahead. In the dark corner, he could see someone with a bloody gash.</p><p></p><p>[Yue Guang: 75/75]</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang hurried over, the candlelight revealing his face.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember me? I'm Yue Guang, Lord Li Qian-xuan's deputy."</p><p></p><p>Of course he remembered! That was the one who was so skilled with the bow.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly went over to him.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Brother Yue. Thank you for helping to prove my identity before. And Lord Li too - without his help, I wouldn't have been able to get out of this prison."</p><p></p><p>That was the truth - without anyone to vouch for him, his headless corpse appearance would have likely led to him being executed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it. If it wasn't for your sword that slew the demon, we would all be dead by now. Anyway, come with me, Lord Li has woken up and I'll take you to see him."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had no objections. Truthfully, he hadn't even figured out where he would stay tonight. He had just jumped into the game and ended up in a casino battle, and now didn't even know where his home was or anything about his character's family.</p><p></p><p>This underworld was quite large, and Fang Yu followed Yue Guang through a maze of alleys before they finally reached an area with many courtyard houses - the kind used for government officials.</p><p></p><p>They stopped at a small courtyard. On the way, Fang Yu learned that Yue Guang had been waiting at the gate for one or two hours, just to meet him.</p><p></p><p>This made Fang Yu feel quite embarrassed, but also gave him a better understanding of Yue Guang's character - honest, steadfast, not afraid of hard work or hardship.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Fang Yu had also brought up wanting to learn archery from him, but Yue Guang had just laughed it off without responding.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't bring it up again.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, Diao De-yi has arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Finally. Have him come in, Yue Guang can go rest now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir."</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang left, and a maid led Fang Yu into the room. At a glance, he saw Lord Li Qian-xuan lying on the bed, his chest wrapped in a bloodstained white bandage.</p><p></p><p>[Li Qian-xuan: 20/100]</p><p></p><p>Judging by the health bar, he had recovered quite a bit from his previous serious injuries. But to fully regain his strength, he would still need...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I've been cultivating for some time now.</p><p></p><p>Does this game not have any health potions or the like? Can't I just take some drugs and instantly recover?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu found this strange, but he didn't ask.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for Li Qianxuan to speak.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, after sending the maidservant away, Li Qianxuan smiled and said, "Diao Deyi, I've heard that in this battle against the demons, you almost sacrificed everyone, but you single-handedly turned the tide. I owe you a personal favor, so what would you like as a reward? I'll try my best to fulfill it."</p><p></p><p>Is there really such good fortune?</p><p></p><p>The one who stole your precious experience rewards and killed your people, and you're still grateful and want to give me a reward?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pondered for a moment and asked, "Lord Li Qianxuan, before that, may I ask a few questions?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, go ahead and ask."</p><p></p><p>"What's the deal with these demons? Was Li Baigu a demon from the beginning?"</p><p></p><p>This question was too basic, which surprised Li Qianxuan a bit. But then he realized that ordinary civilians either have no contact with demons or are killed on the spot by them, and those who have directly faced demons and survived are extremely rare. So he felt that Fang Yu's questions were reasonable.</p><p></p><p>"Demons are a type of monster. They eat, devour, and kill people. Like hunters pursuing their prey, for hundreds and thousands of years, they have been relentlessly persecuting humanity."</p><p></p><p>"The earliest recorded demons were just brutally slaughtering humans."</p><p></p><p>"Later, our human ancestors created martial arts, which gave us the ability to fight back, and we even gradually prospered."</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, demons no longer attack directly like wild beasts, but have learned to disguise themselves as humans, putting on human skin and hiding among us, hunting stealthily."</p><p></p><p>"However, if the defensive forces of a town are insufficient, the demons will also reveal themselves collectively and launch a massacre."</p><p></p><p>"So when demons are discovered, they must be eliminated immediately."</p><p></p><p>"The fewer demons there are in a town, the safer the civilians will be, and the better the town's development will be, attracting more people to settle there and strengthening the town's defensive forces."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Li Qianxuan said, "As for that Li Baigu, he must have been eaten by a demon, which then took on his appearance."</p><p></p><p>"As for when the replacement happened, that's unknown."</p><p></p><p>"This ability to hide is one of the most terrifying aspects of demons."</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan's eyes flashed with deep apprehension, as the hundred-man captain he had previously promoted was killed one night by a demon that had replaced the person sleeping next to him.</p><p></p><p>No matter how high one's martial arts, one can still fear sneak attacks. How much vigilance can one maintain towards those around them?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu asked curiously, "Then why did Li Baigu want to kill the people in the medicine shop earlier, but didn't dare to attack me when I fled to the street?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, it was afraid of exposing its identity. I've read your testimony from the prison, the demon only went berserk and killed when you said it was pretending to be a pig to eat its prey. It was afraid you had already seen through its identity, so it wanted to silence you."</p><p></p><p>"But when you fled to the street, with many eyes and people around, and it had lost both its arms, it naturally couldn't act rashly, or else it would be completely exposed."</p><p></p><p>"The defensive forces of Tianyuan Town are far stronger than you think. Ordinary demons, as long as they dare to reveal themselves, will undoubtedly die."</p><p></p><p>This was indeed the case.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan, just as a ten-man squad leader, had the strength to slay that demon. Considering the entire Tianyuan Town, what were ten-man squads worth?</p><p></p><p>Exposing one's demonic identity meant certain death, so Li Baigu would rather have its arms severed than unleash its true power. It only acted out of fear that I, who might know the truth, would escape.</p><p></p><p>But once I fled to the main street, it could no longer attack me, so it had to act out that tragic performance and frame someone else.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

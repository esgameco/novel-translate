        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu could only raise his head and force a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jin, you've also come out to see the commotion?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean? Someone died in my building, of course I have to come out and handle it. He died so tragically, I don't even know why Old Zhou would want to jump off the building and commit suicide..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>"Wait a minute! Who did you say?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Zhou, the body is right there."</p><p></p><p>Old Zhou? How could that be! That old man was so mentally healthy, and his physical condition was also great - he could even do several pull-ups at the park! Why would he commit suicide? Fang Yu couldn't understand it, and even felt unable to accept it.</p><p></p><p>You see, in this Qingshui Community, the one he was closest to was not someone of the same age, nor was it the landlord Miss Jin, but Old Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when Fang Yu lost a few tens of thousands playing games, it was Old Zhou who introduced him to work on the construction site! Fang Yu had always remembered this kindness and wanted to earn a lot of money to properly repay Old Zhou.</p><p></p><p>But he never expected... that Old Zhou would suddenly commit suicide and die? Why?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked outside, and the ones standing by the body, kneeling and crying bitterly, were indeed Old Zhou's family.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pushed through the crowd and went over, taking a look.</p><p></p><p>The body was smashed beyond recognition.</p><p></p><p>But he still recognized at a glance that the body was indeed Old Zhou's.</p><p></p><p>How could this happen...</p><p></p><p>"Little Fang, you've come down too... my father-in-law, ah..." </p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang next to him patted Fang Yu's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was the contractor who had hired Fang Yu to work on the construction site, so he naturally recognized Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu noticed that Uncle Wang's mood was low, but his demeanor didn't seem that sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu sighed, clenched his fists, and his eyes reddened.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the woman next to Uncle Wang inexplicably pushed him viciously.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Qiangqiang! Did you push my father off the roof? I saw you two arguing loudly at the door at night! After you argued, you both left, and soon after, my father fell from the roof. Where were you in the time between my father falling from the roof?"</p><p></p><p>That was Uncle Wang's wife, also Old Zhou's eldest daughter.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't expect such a dramatic twist, and suddenly felt a chill, looking at Uncle Wang.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The gazes of the other people also turned to him, and Uncle Wang's younger daughter was crying and beating his legs, asking "Why did you kill grandpa? Why did you kill grandpa? Dad is bad! Dad is bad!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was now at a loss for words, he looked around at the crowd in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't! It wasn't me! Wife, let me explain..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to hear it! When you and my father were arguing at the door, I heard you say 'Do I still have a chance?' What did that mean? Weren't you just angry that my father didn't give you the job at the Linan Industrial Park, so you wanted to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang's wife shouted at the top of her lungs, drowning out everyone else.</p><p></p><p>"You've been holding a grudge all along, haven't you? Ever since you married into our family, you've always hated us, right? In over 20 years, have you ever given my father a good face? You ungrateful wretch! Ungrateful wretch!!"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang's wife was both biting and throwing a tantrum, her mind almost completely unraveled.</p><p></p><p>The situation had descended into chaos, and just then...</p><p></p><p>Plop.</p><p></p><p>Someone suddenly collapsed onto Old Zhou's mangled corpse.</p><p></p><p>Taking a closer look, it was the late-arriving Old Wang.</p><p></p><p>Tears streaming down his face, he wailed and cried out "Old Zhou, Old Zhou..." </p><p></p><p>Unable to catch his breath, he fainted.</p><p></p><p>This startled Old Wang's family, who quickly pushed through the crowd to go help him.</p><p></p><p>The scene was in complete disarray, and the urgent sound of police sirens soon rang out at the entrance of the community, as someone had apparently called the police in advance.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Fang Yu and Qi Xiaojin quietly got on the elevator.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was taken away by Officer Jing for investigation.</p><p></p><p>But according to Officer Jing's on-site investigation on the rooftop, the preliminary judgment was... a suicide.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jing, do you think Uncle Zhou committed suicide?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Qi Xiaojin frowned slightly and shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Ding dong. The elevator had just reached the 19th floor.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go first. If there's any progress on Uncle Zhou's case, let me know."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin nodded, suddenly thought of something, and called out to Fang Yu as he was walking out of the elevator.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!"</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Fang Yu turned back.</p><p></p><p>"...Be careful of yourself lately."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately sensed something: "Are you suspecting... that there's a murderer in the community who killed Uncle Zhou?"</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, it would make sense.</p><p></p><p>First, they killed the person, then brought the body to the rooftop and pushed it down, so the body would be smashed beyond recognition, and there would be no trace of knife wounds or the like.</p><p></p><p>But Qi Xiaojin just shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, just be careful, lock the doors and windows, and call me if anything happens."</p><p></p><p>Call you... Fang Yu felt frustrated.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jing, you should be the one calling me instead, you're the girl after all."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin smiled a little without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>Just then, the elevator door closed, separating the two.</p><p></p><p>As the elevator door closed, Qi Xiaojin's smile faded, her expression becoming calm and indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"This didn't happen in the previous life."</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"There must be some hidden danger in the community!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! In the previous life, I was so ignorant, only learning about these things after the apocalypse came, and missed so much."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of secret events happened in the community back then, probably only the previous Fang Yu knew."</p><p></p><p>"And I was under his secret protection the whole time, completely unaware of these things."</p><p></p><p>"I was so confused... in the previous life, I lived so confusedly!"</p><p></p><p>"But this time, it's different."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'll be the one to protect you! Fang Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Fang Yu, Qi Xiaojin's gaze softened considerably.</p><p></p><p>Ding dong.</p><p></p><p>The elevator reached the top floor.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin strode out, ready to investigate the crime scene.</p><p></p><p>But she was blocked by Officer Jing, and could only observe from the sidelines.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Qi Xiaojin still made some discoveries.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel... there are traces of 'spiritual' presence?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Twin Hospitals.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard? Doctor Qiu sold his city apartment!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Why? Didn't he just buy that house last year?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, maybe his family is facing some difficulties. Today he even applied for a long leave from the leadership, but the request was denied, and I heard he threw a tantrum and threatened to resign on the spot. Now he's holed up in his office, not seeing anyone, wearing a gaming headset and playing games, being unproductive."</p><p></p><p>"Did Doctor Qiu encounter some kind of emotional problem? His mood seems a bit off."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, he must have been bewitched by some vixen. Sigh... Why doesn't he pay more attention to the people around him? I've liked him for years."</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't? Doctor Qiu is so handsome, young, and wealthy, he's practically my dream man!"</p><p></p><p>The gossiping voices of the girls gradually woke up Wang Da-ye.</p><p></p><p>He opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the white hospital ceiling, a row of numbers caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>【13 hours 45 minutes 31 seconds.】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

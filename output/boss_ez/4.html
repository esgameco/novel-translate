        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stretched his neck.</p><p></p><p>Those white, big thighs were really dazzling.</p><p></p><p>This game can do such things??? I feel... I can try to be a bad person... a very, very bad person, make a decision that goes against my ancestors!</p><p></p><p>But seeing the miserable shrieks and frantic struggles of the innkeeper's wife, the little seedling that had just sprouted in Fang Yu's mind was immediately extinguished.</p><p></p><p>Born!</p><p></p><p>No! Not enough!</p><p></p><p>I must think of a word more aggressive than "born" to attack Wang Er's behavior! I should really die! I should really die! My mind is full of yellow garbage, nine years of compulsory education plus four years of university, have I all been reading in vain? Where are my values? My quality? My bravery?</p><p></p><p>Even in the game, I must become the light of the righteous path!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!!"</p><p></p><p>"Stop!!"</p><p></p><p>Almost at the moment Fang Yu spoke, a loud voice also came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu turned back and saw a young man in white clothes standing at the door, holding a long sword, his hair standing on end in anger.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, Fang Yu suddenly froze on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Young master?!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master!"</p><p></p><p>The faces of the crowd changed drastically, and they exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Gu'er, run! Don't come over!" The innkeeper's wife screamed in a shrill voice.</p><p></p><p>But when the mother is insulted, how can the son retreat?</p><p></p><p>The young man in white clothes let out a roar and charged towards the nearest Fang Yu with his sword.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu reacted in time, frightened like he had seen a ghost, and frantically crawled and retreated.</p><p></p><p>This really stunned the trio of Zhao Tian, You Huo, and You Mu.</p><p></p><p>"Waste!"</p><p>"Useless thing!"</p><p>"Let me do it!"</p><p></p><p>The three big men bypassed Fang Yu and pounced on the young man in white.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tian took the lead, raising a foot and kicking the young man in the chest, kicking him flying away, the long sword slipping from his hand as the young man was also heavily kicked and crashed into the wall.</p><p></p><p>The three men seized the opportunity, rushing up and crazily punching and kicking the young man, scaring the innkeeper's wife to scream incessantly and beg repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Wang Er tore off the lady's clothes and laughed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Madam, you don't want your son to be beaten to death by us, do you?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words came out, the struggling lady immediately became obedient.</p><p></p><p>The situation was under the control of the casino's henchmen.</p><p></p><p>Only Fang Yu stared blankly at the punching and kicking crowd.</p><p></p><p>"You, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tian's group did not turn their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Beating people, can't you see?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and come over to help beat him! Waste!"</p><p>"Coward! A little brat with a sword has scared you like this! Useless thing!"</p><p></p><p>Help beat him?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stared wide-eyed in disbelief, as if they were telling a huge joke.</p><p></p><p>Because above the head of the young man in white, there was a line of information.</p><p></p><p>[Li Bai Gu: 998.8/1000.]</p><p></p><p>A thousand blood... a monster!</p><p></p><p>And their punches and kicks...</p><p></p><p>"-0.1."</p><p>"-0.1."</p><p>"-0.1."</p><p>"-0.1."</p><p>"-0.1."</p><p></p><p>Tickling! Dude, your attacks are just tickling! Do you really know what you're hitting?</p><p></p><p>And you want me to go over and help beat him?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu shook his head vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"No! I absolutely won't go!"</p><p></p><p>"Not coming over? Okay! I'll go over and beat you half to death first!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tian really did as he said, rolling up his sleeves and about to come over and hit him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's face changed, and he hurriedly said,</p><p></p><p>"No, you... can't you see... that guy is pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger?"</p><p></p><p>"Who?" Zhao Tian was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"That pretty boy in white!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pointed at the young man in white.</p><p></p><p>Slap! Almost as soon as Fang Yu's words fell, Zhao Tian had already slapped the young man in white's face.</p><p></p><p>"-0.2!"</p><p></p><p>A critical hit! It's a red critical hit! But it's useless, dude! Zhao Tian even started to lightly slap Li Bai Gu's face in a boastful manner.</p><p></p><p>"Pretending to be a pig to eat a tiger..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Tiger? That pretty boy also qualifies? His thighs aren't even as thick as my arm!"</p><p></p><p>The other two also burst out laughing, but only Li Baigu suddenly flashed a cold gaze directly at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu instinctively took a step back, kicking something strange, but he ignored it and directly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"You guys, you don't understand shit. He's now enduring humiliation, and later he'll transform into the Dragon King! Look, look, his mouth is crooked! His mouth is going to be crooked!!"</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Li Baigu stared fixatedly at Fang Yu, the corners of his mouth slightly curving upwards, but he was suddenly grabbed under the chin by Zhao Tian.</p><p></p><p>"Crooked mouth?"</p><p></p><p>Slap! A slap landed. -0.1!</p><p></p><p>"Making your mouth crooked?"</p><p></p><p>Slap! -0.1!</p><p></p><p>"I'll swell your mouth up, let's see how crooked it'll be!"</p><p></p><p>Slap slap slap slap slap slap! -0.1! -0.1! -0.1! -0.1!</p><p></p><p>Soft and powerless, so weak and powerless!! Fang Yu wailed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Great job, Brother Zhao! These slaps are forceful and resounding!"</p><p></p><p>"Still pretending to be a tiger while being a small fry, even without Brother Tian, I can beat ten of him!"</p><p></p><p>The two henchmen on the side were also chiming in! Damn it!</p><p></p><p>There's no hope, this whole room is beyond saving! Fang Yu turned to run, but when he looked down, he saw a long sword on the ground.</p><p></p><p>He then remembered it must be the item the white-robed youth had dropped earlier.</p><p></p><p>Picking it up casually...</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Deyi, throw the sword over! I'm going to dismember his hands and feet, let's see how he'll still pretend to be a tiger!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's movements immediately stopped.</p><p></p><p>Maybe... it could work?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the white-robed youth take the beating without any resistance, perhaps he really was just a gifted little ox?</p><p></p><p>After all, it's a new game, and Fang Yu didn't know the mechanics of the health bar.</p><p></p><p>If it's truly just a thick health bar without any real power, then there's nothing to be afraid of, especially after disabling his arms.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was about to throw the sword over, but suddenly felt a pain in his back, being kicked down by someone, causing the sword to slip from his hand and be picked up by another.  -0.5!</p><p></p><p>"Will you guys ever stop! I'm trying to handle something here, and you're just making a ruckus and giving me a headache!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the person, it was the bare-chested Wang Er, with a few bite marks on his arms and a slight decrease in his health bar, seemingly something had happened, and he hadn't even taken off his pants yet, cursing angrily as he strode towards the white-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>"Bitch, listen up, I'm going to chop off your son's hands right now, and when I come back, if you try to resist again, I'll cut off his head!"</p><p></p><p>It seems Wang Er's side wasn't going smoothly either, and he was in a rage.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in front of the white-robed youth, he had two people hold him down, ready to strike with the sword.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately observed.</p><p></p><p>Something changed! The white-robed youth's gaze had changed! He's about to...</p><p></p><p>Swoosh--</p><p></p><p>The sword flashed, and the white-robed youth's arm was directly severed.</p><p></p><p>The fresh blood sprayed all over Zhao Tian, who even licked his lips in a perverted manner. -100!</p><p></p><p>The bright red numbers popped up, completely stunning Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>So, so they really inflicted real damage?</p><p></p><p>It turns out that guy was just a facade after all!</p><p></p><p>Ah! False alarm! Fang Yu felt relieved, as Wang Er struck again, cutting off the white-robed youth's other arm. -100!</p><p></p><p>True to his word, Wang Er is a real man!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the lady, she was already kneeling and begging in tears, while the white-robed youth let out a roar of rage, his eyes turning red...</p><p></p><p>Wait!</p><p></p><p>That's not right!</p><p></p><p>Why is he still staring at me the whole time?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart sank, feeling something was off.</p><p></p><p>What the hell, it's Wang Er who's cutting off your arms, why are you still glaring at me? Just because I said you were pretending to be a tiger?</p><p></p><p>The more Fang Yu pondered, the more he felt something was not right. Ever since he said the "pretending to be a tiger" line, the white-robed youth's behavior had been very abnormal! Suddenly struck by a thought, Fang Yu quietly started walking towards the door.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this simple action immediately provoked the white-robed youth, who almost blurted out.</p><p></p><p>"You are not allowed to leave!!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

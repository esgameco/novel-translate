        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuang Mei's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu slowly withdrew his attack and said in a deep voice, "I... have entered the door."</p><p></p><p>"So what if you've entered the door? Why did you have to break the table?"</p><p></p><p>Huh? Fang Yu pointed at himself.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mei, I've entered the door!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not deaf, I'm asking you why you smashed the table!"</p><p></p><p>What, the table is important? I've stepped into the martial arts path!</p><p></p><p>"I've killed so many people in the Southern Heaven Gate that the sky and earth have gone dark. Do you still care about my eyes?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how much this table cost?"</p><p></p><p>But as soon as Shi Zhuang Mei said this, Fang Yu suddenly snapped back to reality.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had just been wandering in the lofty realm of the martial arts, and the next moment someone asked him, "Have you bought a house and a car yet?"</p><p></p><p>Reality. </p><p></p><p>Damn, it's reality now.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's momentum immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"How much... how much was the table?"</p><p></p><p>"10 taels."</p><p></p><p>Damn! Fang Yu waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I'll pay with my meat buns!"</p><p></p><p>In Fang Yu's eyes, the supplementary meat buns were like a printing press, omnipotent!</p><p></p><p>From the three-month wool allotment of 90 taels of meat buns that Senior Sister Mei had pre-allocated, after using 60 taels, there were still 30 taels left, which should be enough to cover the cost.</p><p></p><p>No big deal.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he heard Shi Zhuang Mei say something terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"The meat buns cannot be exchanged for silver taels."</p><p></p><p>"...What do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly as it sounds. I don't have any money either."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ???So these meat buns can't be cashed out??</p><p></p><p>They only have a value of 1 tael of silver when used to exchange for medicinal soups?</p><p></p><p>Afraid that Fang Yu wouldn't understand, Shi Zhuang Mei added,</p><p></p><p>"And if you use cash to buy the meat buns, the price won't be the same. For the meat buns allotment for next month, I can only give you 100 coins. But this time, we won't allow you to get credit in advance."</p><p></p><p>Meaning the next month's food expenses must be paid upfront.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>100 coins? This has shrunk to an explosive degree! I paid 2 taels of silver for the food, sold you the most important meat buns, but you only give me 100 coins? What a shady deal! "Then what about the remaining 30 taels you mentioned before..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu clung to the last glimmer of hope, asking cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuang Mei shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"There are no 30 taels. We only have the medicinal soups, and a purchase price of 100 coins."</p><p></p><p>"Then... what about this table?"</p><p></p><p>"You have to figure that out yourself. Our transaction is limited to six bowls of medicinal soup, in exchange for your two months' worth of meat buns."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was dumbfounded, what kind of situation was this?</p><p></p><p>He had thought he had found a loophole, that he had a magical printing press.</p><p></p><p>Turns out the medicinal soups and meat buns are all just virtual values, mutually priced equivalently, but essentially just nested dolls.</p><p></p><p>"Also, you must pay the 2 taels of food expenses for next month in advance, or we won't let you off the hook."</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Fang Yu's panic and destitute appearance, Shi Zhuang Mei narrowed her eyes and said.</p><p></p><p>What, they're even threatening now??</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was so frustrated.</p><p></p><p>He had already planned everything out, cashing out the meat buns, becoming rich, and directly ascending to the peak of life.</p><p></p><p>But he was directly thrown back to reality.</p><p></p><p>He even mysteriously ended up with a huge 10-tael silver debt to pay for the broken table.</p><p></p><p>This is not even enough to get back the 5 taels of silver he borrowed from his second sister.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the broken table, as well as your entry into the martial arts, I will report to the master."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Shi Zhuang Mei glanced at the table remnants and softened her tone.</p><p></p><p>"Also, that strike just now... the force was quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Entering the martial arts path and not entering it are two completely different lives. Some people, even if they can get into the sect through backdoor connections, will forever linger outside the martial arts due to factors like talent.</p><p></p><p>For this type of person, Shi Zhuang Mei sneered at them, even feeling they were not worth it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wasting energy.</p><p></p><p>But for those promising junior brothers and sisters, Shi Zongmei doesn't mind getting to know them a little.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall accepts fewer disciples compared to other martial arts halls, it is sometimes unavoidable to encounter human relationships.</p><p></p><p>Just like today, even for a master as powerful as the teacher, when faced with a recommendation letter from the Li family, he can only accept the person without any complaints.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this person can cultivate or not, the teacher doesn't really care, just adding another bowl, raising another waste.</p><p></p><p>There are quite a few such people in the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>But if they really have some aptitude, and enter the threshold of the martial dao, then naturally they will be treated the same as the other disciples, without the need for differential treatment.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zongmei counted the number of medicinal soup bowls that Fang Yu had drunk.</p><p></p><p>"Six bowls, plus the free one, seven bowls of medicinal soup for the initiation. Not bad, the aptitude is still acceptable."</p><p></p><p>Anyway, Shi Zongmei would not admit that her five-bowl initiation meant poor aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, you are also an official disciple of our Yuanti Martial Arts Hall."</p><p></p><p>"After I report to the teacher, you will also have the opportunity to freely choose one martial arts secret manual, the teacher will tell you about it later."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Shi Zongmei walked out.</p><p></p><p>When she reached the door, she suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>She hesitated a bit, feeling a bit embarrassed as if she had cheated Fang Yu, and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, you may not know, the Yuanti Heart Meat Buns have such a great help for daily martial arts cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"If you only eat them for one or two days, you may not feel anything."</p><p></p><p>"But if you persist in daily consumption, you will find that your martial arts cultivation progress will be faster than that of your peers."</p><p></p><p>"This is also one of the reasons why our Yuanti Martial Arts Hall has been able to develop and grow to its current state."</p><p></p><p>"This is a unique reward in our martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>"Before, I thought you would have a hard time entering the martial dao threshold, after all, you're already at this age before starting martial arts, so that's why I..."</p><p></p><p>"And when we joined, we went through the same process. Either spend money, or exchange future meat buns for medicinal soup."</p><p></p><p>"This is a process that all new disciples will go through, not something I specifically targeted at you."</p><p></p><p>"So don't blame me for doing this, you've also successfully stepped into the martial dao threshold because of it."</p><p></p><p>"As for the future, as I said, the Yuanti Heart Meat Buns are very important for martial arts cultivation, you'd better keep them for the best time to consume them, consider it a small piece of advice from me as your senior sister."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, without waiting for Fang Yu to speak again, she left, leaving a gloomy Fang Yu and the shattered table next to him.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a young man walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Diao? Sister Mei asked me to take you to the training field."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up: "...Go to the training field to do what?"</p><p></p><p>"To hit the wooden post."</p><p></p><p>"Hit the wooden post?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The young man explained calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Our martial arts hall has a rule. Any new disciple who joins will have a chance to hit the wooden post."</p><p></p><p>"The wooden post has markings from 1 to 10, and the further the disciple can hit the wooden post on their first try, the corresponding silver taels will be rewarded. 1 mark is 1 tael, and so on."</p><p></p><p>The young man glanced at the shattered table on the ground, guessing what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Mei said that if you really don't have any money, you can use this opportunity to try to hit the wooden post as far as possible, and exchange the silver taels to compensate the martial arts hall."</p><p></p><p>"But we usually recommend first cultivating martial arts for a few months, and then using this challenge opportunity."</p><p></p><p>What a good deal?! Fang Yu's eyes suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>He then took a closer look at the young man.</p><p></p><p>【Lin Wu: 32/32.】</p><p></p><p>Hmph! A 32 HP trash! Fang Yu secretly evaluated.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the number above his own head.</p><p></p><p>【Diao Deyi: 22/22.】</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>He revised his inner comment.</p><p></p><p>This Lin Wu has some strength, not much different from me.</p><p></p><p>With a big wave of his hand, Fang Yu said grandly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, lead the way!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

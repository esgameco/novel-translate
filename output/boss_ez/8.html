        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That sudden, mysterious force sent Liqian Xuan flying a couple of meters away, leaving him half-kneeling on the ground. As he looked up, he could no longer hear that strange, piercing sound.</p><p></p><p>Before he could ponder further...</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a piercing scream came from the group, and a blood-soaked upper body was torn apart and flung into the air, with guts and fresh blood spilling down.</p><p></p><p>Demons!! Liqian Xuan immediately reddened his eyes and shouted loudly: "Tighten the formation! Turtle formation defense formation!!"</p><p></p><p>Facing an invisible enemy, the group also panicked and huddled closely together, backs to each other.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p>"Over here!!"</p><p>"No!!"</p><p></p><p>Each time blood suddenly splattered, it was the hidden demon attacking and retreating.</p><p></p><p>It would only injure or kill one or two people each time, never lingering, using guerrilla tactics that made it impossible to catch.</p><p></p><p>Liqian Xuan's forehead was beaded with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, their numbers had dwindled from nearly thirty to just over ten.</p><p></p><p>If they lost any more, they might not even have the ability to directly confront the demon!</p><p></p><p>This couldn't go on, or everyone would die here!</p><p></p><p>Liqian Xuan panted heavily. The reinforcements from the Yufu were not coming that quickly, or rather, it hadn't been that long since they exposed the demon.</p><p></p><p>At this rate of personnel loss, they wouldn't be able to hold out until the rescue arrived.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do... This is... a dead end!"</p><p></p><p>Shhh--</p><p></p><p>Just as Liqian Xuan thought this, a trusted subordinate suddenly let out a miserable scream, and an arm flew high up.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Yu!"</p><p></p><p>Liqian Xuan exclaimed, filled with self-blame.</p><p></p><p>He had lost his composure, his mind in disarray. If he had fully coordinated with his trusted subordinates, the demon would never have had a chance to harm them. But now...</p><p></p><p>"Lord Liqian, I'm fine!" Zhang Yu, who had been fighting alongside Liqian Xuan, quickly tied a cloth around the stump and returned to back-to-back defense against the demon's attacks.</p><p></p><p>The entire situation had completely reversed, from them proactively hunting the demon, to the demon now slaughtering them!</p><p></p><p>"Lord Liqian, our situation is now very dire. The only way to break this deadlock is just one thing!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Liqian Xuan naturally knew his idea, and immediately shook his head. "No, it's too dangerous."</p><p></p><p>"Someone has to do it! Otherwise, we'll all die here!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yu said firmly, and without waiting for Liqian Xuan's response, suddenly pushed off the ground and rushed out.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go seek help outside! You all hold on!"</p><p></p><p>"Protect him!!"</p><p></p><p>Zhang Yu's urgent shout and Liqian Xuan's voice rang out almost simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>However, before the others could react, Zhang Yu had only run a dozen steps when a distorted, barely visible shape in the sunlight suddenly crossed paths with him.</p><p></p><p>Shhh!!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Zhang Yu's head flew off.</p><p></p><p>"Zhang Yu!!"</p><p></p><p>Liqian Xuan's face changed drastically, his eyes reddening, veins bulging on his forehead!</p><p></p><p>"Come out, demon! Let me find you! Once I catch you, I'll tear you to pieces!!"</p><p></p><p>Liqian Xuan's loss of control only brought more unease to the group, leaving the entire Yufu in a precarious situation.</p><p></p><p>In this extremely difficult moment...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sigh came from not far away.</p><p></p><p>"Who?!"</p><p></p><p>The alert Liqian Xuan immediately located the source of the sound, but all he saw was a headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>Just as Liqian Xuan was about to look away...</p><p></p><p>The headless corpse MOVED!! Liqian Xuan's eyes widened, almost thinking he was seeing things. But after rubbing his eyes and looking again, he saw the corpse slowly raising its right hand.</p><p></p><p>Corpse... reanimation?!</p><p></p><p>With demons in front and reanimated corpses behind, Liqian Xuan felt on the verge of collapse.</p><p></p><p>But then, the corpse spoke.</p><p></p><p>"That, Lord Liqian..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I feel that I can no longer remain low-key."</p><p></p><p>A corpse! The corpse is speaking!! This sudden undead transformation seems to have stunned the demons, as they haven't launched an attack for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the headless corpse seized the opportunity and ran towards them, and halfway there, it suddenly bent down and picked up a human head.</p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan finally recognized who this headless corpse was.</p><p></p><p>"Diao... De'one???"</p><p></p><p>The other members of the team were even more frightened, their nerves already tense, and they now all drew their bows and aimed at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Don't shoot!!"</p><p>"It's one of us!!"</p><p></p><p>The headless Fang Yu, clutching his head, hurriedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Look at me, everyone!"</p><p>"I am Diao De'one! Diao De'one is a good person! Diao De'one requests to lead the team!!"</p><p>"Diao De'one can see where the demons are! The demons, the demons are 70 meters to my left, crouching at that fruit stall, peeping at us!"</p><p></p><p>Seemingly afraid that these people would let loose an arrow and kill him instantly, after all, his health was only [Diao De'one: 1.5/7], which was fragile and couldn't withstand any disturbance.</p><p></p><p>That's right! Fang Yu didn't die! Even with his head cut off, he didn't die, and this was all thanks to one thing - the human-level skill [Digital Life].</p><p></p><p>One of its effects is... digitizing the body.</p><p></p><p>It sounds ordinary.</p><p></p><p>But when Fang Yu was beheaded, his vision spinning and falling to the ground, only to find that he was still alive, and that his health bar still had HP left, he finally understood how godly this skill was!</p><p></p><p>It turns out that losing my head is not a fatal injury for me, it's just a loss of HP! Of course, Fang Yu immediately seized the opportunity to play dead and preserve his life.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to wait for Qi Qianxuan and the others to win before quietly slipping away, but he didn't expect this group to be unable to defeat the young man in white! Oh, no, he should be called the Illumination Demon now.</p><p></p><p>Truly, once the skin is shed, even the name changes, but at least the health bar is still the same.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked towards the fruit stall, and the Illumination Demon was crouching there motionless, pretending to play hide-and-seek, but its health bar was longer than the fruit stall, glaringly obvious, impossible to ignore, like a flashing light, completely exposed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the demon's invisibility is of the body, not the health bar, which exists independently, seemingly not following the same mechanism as its skill.</p><p></p><p>So the demon's whereabouts were completely betrayed by its own health bar.</p><p></p><p>The problem was that Fang Yu could only watch helplessly as Qi Qianxuan and the others were being pushed back, driven into a desperate situation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that if the demon won and started feasting on the corpses, he would be done for, Fang Yu had no choice but to stand out.</p><p></p><p>However, gaining the trust of Qi Qianxuan and the others was not easy, as evidenced by the way the other team members looked at him like he was a monster.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering this, Fang Yu suddenly felt tense.</p><p></p><p>Hey! Hey hey hey! Don't move! That team member on the right, don't move! If you move your finger and shoot the arrow, I'll die right here on the spot for you to see! In the midst of Fang Yu's anxiety, Qi Qianxuan suddenly raised his hand and pressed down, and the others obeyed, slowly lowering their bow and arrow aim towards the opposite side.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De'one, is it really you? No! The important thing is not that, but is what you said about being able to see the demon's location true?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan fell silent, and then, as if he had made up his mind, he suddenly looked at Fang Yu, the headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Point it out!"</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Yu's headless appearance and the demon were not much different, both being bizarre, at least he could communicate, and he was on the human side.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Qi Qianxuan had no choice but to take a gamble. But he soon found that he had bet correctly.</p><p></p><p>At his command, the team members, following Fang Yu's指 directions, launched their attack.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The dense barrage of arrows flew in the direction Fang Yu pointed, and blood suddenly burst out in the air.</p><p></p><p>"The demon is really there!!"</p><p>"Damn!"</p><p>"Diao De'one can be trusted!!"</p><p>"Diao De'one! Diao De'one!! He's amazing!!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

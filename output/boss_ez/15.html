        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was startled by the numbers, reacting with flailing arms and legs.</p><p></p><p>Yet his hands passed through the countdown numbers, as if it were an illusion.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"The patient has woken up! Quickly go notify the doctor and the family!"</p><p></p><p>The gossiping nurses by the bedside hurriedly approached Uncle Wang, and at the same time pressed the call button to summon the doctor.</p><p></p><p>Gossip is the spice of life, but it shouldn't interfere with work.</p><p></p><p>The smiles of the angels in white put Uncle Wang at ease.</p><p></p><p>He gradually recalled what had happened.</p><p></p><p>The shocking news of Old Zhou's death had caused him to faint.</p><p></p><p>So this place is... the hospital? But what is this countdown number in front of him, decreasing second by second? Uncle Wang was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a male doctor walked into the ward with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Qiu?!"</p><p></p><p>"Doctor Qiu, why is he here?" </p><p></p><p>The nurses exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>One of the nurses even quipped, "Isn't Doctor Qiu supposed to be hiding in the office playing games?"</p><p></p><p>Doctor Qiu forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The director asked me to come and take this final shift, my resignation will be approved tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>The nurses immediately broke out in lamentations.</p><p></p><p>What a huge loss for the hospital to lose this handsome doctor!</p><p></p><p>Amid the nurses' wailing, with his over 70 years of life experience, Uncle Wang could see that Doctor Qiu's smile was a bit forced, even stiff.</p><p></p><p>How strange, that stiffness was like a clumsy imitation of how to make an expression.</p><p></p><p>If Fang Yu were here at this moment, he would have immediately recognized that this Doctor Qiu was the suit-wearing man who delivered the game helmet to him!</p><p></p><p>After a simple check-up, Doctor Qiu strode out of the ward.</p><p></p><p>His mouth gradually curled up, his expression becoming much more natural.</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin parchment, like a computer chip, displayed lines of text adhering to his chest.</p><p></p><p>[Got it!]</p><p>[Hahaha!]</p><p>[This body is mine now!]</p><p>[A brand new human world...]</p><p>[Interesting... too interesting!]</p><p>[Let me think about how to turn this world upside down in this world!]</p><p>[Haha! Haha!]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Residential Area, Unit 1, Room 1905.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu closed the door behind him, leaning against it, lost in thought for a while.</p><p></p><p>Old Zhou's death had quite an impact on him.</p><p></p><p>In his life, he had not yet encountered the death of close friends and family.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that he would never see Old Zhou again, an indescribable feeling welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Heaving a melancholic sigh, Fang Yu returned to his bed.</p><p></p><p>The departed have passed, life goes on.</p><p></p><p>"There are still a few days until Old Zhou's funeral."</p><p></p><p>"Before that, I need to earn some money to give a large condolence payment to Old Zhou's family."</p><p></p><p>This was the last thing Fang Yu could think of, the last thing he could do.</p><p></p><p>After all, as a non-relative, his options were limited, but the past kindness must be repaid.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Fang Yu no longer hesitated, put on the game helmet, and logged into the game.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Foolish Underworld, Level C Prison.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, an old man's face suddenly loomed large in his vision.</p><p></p><p>"What the fuck?!" Fang Yu was startled and instinctively threw a punch. -1.1!</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p></p><p>The damage display and the old man's cry rang out simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on!"</p><p></p><p>The shout of an approaching guard came from the distance.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu focused his eyes and realized that...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the top of the old man's head, there was a bloody line.</p><p></p><p>[Wu Qiaojin: 2.9/5.]</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stunned, his punch had almost taken half the old man's life.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he discovered a problem.</p><p></p><p>That last punch was his full strength.</p><p></p><p>But the damage was only a light '-1.1.' This was very puzzling.</p><p></p><p>After adding the physique, his health bar had surged to 17 points, but the damage didn't seem to have increased much.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on! What's going on! Causing trouble in the prison, don't you want to live?" </p><p></p><p>The prison guard came stomping over, directly slamming the iron rod on the cell door, loudly clanging while threateningly roaring.</p><p></p><p>The old man quickly pointed at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother guard, he hit me! He hit me!"</p><p></p><p>The guard's gaze instantly snapped towards Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Inside and outside the prison, it was two different worlds.</p><p></p><p>The unwritten rules inside the prison were all made by the guards themselves.</p><p></p><p>Normally if someone caused trouble in the prison, the default punishment would be for the troublemaking prisoner.</p><p></p><p>However, when this guard saw Fang Yu's appearance, he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned around and scolded the old man.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit! Old man Wu, he was just sitting there, how could he have provoked you!"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, he's not a prisoner, he's just staying in the prison. If you keep bothering him, when Sister Xing comes, I'll give you a few lashes, believe it or not!"</p><p></p><p>Old man Wu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>What was going on here?</p><p></p><p>It was clearly him who got punched by this young man! It really hurt, okay? How could he be blamed instead? For a moment, old man Wu was filled with complex thoughts, looking at Fang Yu with a complicated gaze.</p><p></p><p>This guy... could it be that he's eating the 'Prison Little Overlord' Xing Xing's leftovers? Shameless pretty boy! To get out, he's selling his body without any shame! Old man Wu inwardly despised him, but was secretly estimating his own looks, wondering if he could also gain Xing Xing's favor.</p><p></p><p>After all, when he was young, he was also a handsome man, and now that he's old, he's still a handsome old man!</p><p></p><p>Old man Wu was still thinking about this when the guard had already opened the cell door, saying to Fang Yu:</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, you could have left half an hour ago... or was it an hour ago? Anyway, you can leave now. I just came to call you, but you were sleeping so deeply, you didn't respond. Now that you're awake, hurry up and leave."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly remembered that Xing Xing had said she would only keep him for half an hour, which was one hour.</p><p></p><p>It was just that she was purely taking advantage of the situation, seeking private revenge, and making him feel disgusted.</p><p></p><p>But because the reality of Zhou Daye jumping off the building had delayed him, he had missed the time limit.</p><p></p><p>It also meant that when leaving the game, the game character would remain in a comatose state, unable to be roused no matter how much you called.</p><p></p><p>Standing up, Fang Yu immediately stopped his movements.</p><p></p><p>Because he found that his field of vision had not changed at all - he had just realized that in the game, his head was still separated from his body.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the guard recognized him at a glance.</p><p></p><p>No wonder old man Wu was staring at him.</p><p></p><p>A person sleeping with their headless body lying down, cradling the head in their arms, such a strange sleeping posture, if he were in their shoes, he would also be very curious to take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>It was a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>This punch was a misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>Bending over, Fang Yu held his head in both hands, cradling it at his waist, and smiled apologetically at the old man.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought that his smile would almost scare the old man's soul out of his body.</p><p></p><p>Imagine a headless person, holding their head and smiling at you with bared teeth, set against the gloomy prison environment - it was undoubtedly a scene straight out of a horror movie!</p><p></p><p>The old man's face instantly turned deathly pale, retreating two steps and cowering in the corner, shivering in fear.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with him?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked puzzledly at the guard.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

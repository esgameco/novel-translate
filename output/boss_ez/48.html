        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The formation was exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>But they were just joking, they didn't even know where the Cloud Fortress was, how could they go and rescue people.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the profession of a doctor, which is not easy either. In the game, you have to apprentice and learn medicine before you can learn it.</p><p></p><p>But the point that caught Fangyu's attention in this post was... that person had been lying there for a day, and his injuries hadn't recovered.</p><p></p><p>In Fangyu's memory, whenever he lay down and rested for a night, his blood was basically full again.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that this is not something every player has? But rather a recovery effect inherent to the data-based body?</p><p></p><p>After scanning a few more posts about injuries, Fangyu suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>He was really enjoying the blessings without knowing it.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, when other people in the game got injured, they all needed to recuperate slowly.</p><p></p><p>Only those with strong physiques and martial arts training could recover from their injuries faster.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, their recovery speed was still not as fast as Fangyu's.</p><p></p><p>For a knife wound, others would take three to five days to scab over and recover. </p><p></p><p>Fangyu might only need less than a day.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when his head fell off, the wound had scabbed over, and Fangyu had been a bit puzzled about it.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally understood, this is one of the benefits of the data-based body.</p><p></p><p>The data-based body, no matter what kind of injury you have, treats them all the same, only differing in the amount of blood loss.</p><p></p><p>The recovery is also based directly on the constitution, with the blood replenishing quickly, unlike others who have to recuperate slowly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fangyu slapped his thigh.</p><p></p><p>He had forgotten that the instant noodles were still boiling on the stove!</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly ran to the kitchen, the broth in the pot was almost gone.</p><p></p><p>He scooped it up, put it in a bowl, turned off the gas, all in one smooth motion.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the instant noodles, he went back to the computer to continue browsing the posts.</p><p></p><p>This time, his goal was to see if there were any high-priced silver coins for sale.</p><p></p><p>Since there was no long-distance trading method, he set the keyword to "Tianyuan Town".</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, a post suddenly popped up.</p><p></p><p>"Eight Black Guys in the Dorm, Epic Battle with the New Player Boss! The Battle Situation Was Extremely Tragic, Only I Escaped!!"</p><p></p><p>This title... why does it feel a bit strange?</p><p></p><p>Fangyu was about to click in to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a knocking sound at the door.</p><p></p><p>Putting down the noodles, he got up to open the door.</p><p></p><p>What greeted his eyes was Qin Jie.</p><p></p><p>She had a solemn expression, her brows slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fangyu open the door, she seemed to have let out a sigh of relief, but her brows soon furrowed again as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Wang is dead."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The spirit believes in the divine."</p><p>"The human believes in the spirit."</p><p>"Both the spirit and the human are believers."</p><p>"The believers feed on the demonic."</p><p>"The thicker the demonic aura, the stronger the cultivation."</p><p>"If there were no demons in the world, there would be no spirits in the human world, as it should be."</p><p>"But... that is not the case now."</p><p>"Has the world line changed? Or did the Fangyu from the past secretly do something to quell the impending disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Qin Jie did not know.</p><p></p><p>In her past life, her days were too gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Before discovering the truth of the world, like a willful and spoiled girl, she pursued fashionable bags and idol oppa.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, she ignored too many details around her, until she was saved by Fangyu, until the apocalypse arrived, did she truly awaken and face reality.</p><p></p><p>"Without a doubt, this is the mark of the spirit!"</p><p>"Shall I open it... here..."</p><p></p><p>A thought flashed through Qin Jie's mind, but she quickly suppressed it.</p><p></p><p>The world is still stable now.</p><p>If I rashly unlock the seal of human sin and disturb the boundary, it will only exacerbate the arrival of the apocalypse.</p><p>And if I consume my soul's potential here, the opportunity in that place will be hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>"Jie-jie! Wait for me, Jie-jie!"</p><p></p><p>Qin Jie immediately stopped in her tracks.</p><p>Turning to look at Fangyu behind her, the brows that were just tightly knit relaxed, and her expression became gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Time waits for no one. By the time I got the news, they were arguing fiercely."</p><p></p><p>Here...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This is the Twin Hospitals.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wang was admitted here last night due to excessive grief over the death of Mr. Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Mr. Wang had no illness or disaster, and after recovering, he was about to leave the hospital. However, he was persuaded by his family members to stay and have a physical examination to calm his emotions, and then return home in a few days.</p><p></p><p>So, Mr. Wang stayed in the hospital.</p><p></p><p>Then, Mr. Wang died.</p><p></p><p>He died on the hospital bed.</p><p></p><p>A patient, who was still lively and healthy just a day ago, and even had the energy to flirt with the young nurse.</p><p></p><p>A day later, he died in the hospital.</p><p></p><p>Such an event, no matter where it happens, is unacceptable to the family.</p><p></p><p>Arguing, roaring, shouting, mutual misunderstanding, eventually evolved into a hospital disturbance.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't Mr. Wang fine just yesterday? How could he have passed away so suddenly?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was full of incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>First it was Mr. Zhou, and now Mr. Wang.</p><p></p><p>The number of people dying in the neighborhood these two days is almost as much as the whole year in previous years.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, that's why we need to come and take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Look at what?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>She was also hesitant whether to tell Fang Yu some things.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about her former self, even in that turbulent time of upheaval, she still enjoyed the daily life like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>She then firmly made up her mind.</p><p></p><p>"I can't tell Fang Yu the truth, I want to let him live through the last ordinary days before the end of the world happily!"</p><p></p><p>"Until the day I can't bear it!"</p><p></p><p>"Until the day the apocalypse arrives, when the whole world knows!"</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, you were injured while protecting me."</p><p></p><p>"In this life, I will keep you safe!"</p><p></p><p>The soul of life, it doesn't matter if it's lost! If you encounter a spirit, unlock it, fight it!</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin's eyes flashed with determination.</p><p></p><p>Humans have sin.</p><p></p><p>Born with sin.</p><p></p><p>God has put a lock on people, and people have become dogs, ordinary dogs.</p><p></p><p>Believe in the spirit, break the lock, and you can be human for a short time.</p><p></p><p>But the price is the soul of life.</p><p></p><p>The soul of life, the soul of life, also called the yang lifespan.</p><p></p><p>The yang lifespan of a person has a fixed number, when it is exhausted, the life ends.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin doesn't want to die.</p><p></p><p>Reborn in this world, she wants to live longer.</p><p></p><p>But if it's for Fang Yu's safety, she's willing to pay the price.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The two pushed open the door of the ward.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Wang's family members and the doctors were arguing fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The sound of cursing echoed in the room, lingering for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was arguing, everyone was acting for their own interests.</p><p></p><p>But no one cared about the stiff corpse lying motionless on the hospital bed.</p><p></p><p>"Mr. Wang..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at the corpse and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>The two of you walked out one after the other... It's fine, you have a companion down there.</p><p></p><p>Don't worry, I'll treat everyone equally, and I'll definitely give you a big one too.</p><p></p><p>No one stopped the argument because of Qi Xiaojin and Fang Yu's intrusion, as if the two were invisible.</p><p></p><p>Only someone from the family side glanced over, could they feel a little sense of existence.</p><p></p><p>The family demanded a high compensation, the reason being that a living person was hospitalized, and a dead person was lying on the bed, so the hospital was fully responsible.</p><p></p><p>The doctors refused to admit the hospital's accident, the test indicators were all normal, the patient suddenly died, which was an act of God, and the hospital was also helpless.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the family side seems to have the upper hand, but the situation is still very intense.</p><p></p><p>While Fang Yu was secretly struggling over which side to support, Qi Xiaojin suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go back."</p><p></p><p>I see.</p><p></p><p>Know what spirit it is.</p><p></p><p>Can't fight it.</p><p></p><p>When it's time to fight for one's life, Qi Xiaojin doesn't mind fighting.</p><p></p><p>But if she can't even win the fight, then there's no need.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this type of spirit won't pose a threat to them for the time being.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, he found that a thin blanket had been placed over him.</p><p></p><p>The fabric of the blanket was new, but there were some footprints and dust on it.</p><p></p><p>It should be the new blanket that his second sister bought yesterday.</p><p></p><p>His second sister didn't even want to use it herself, but she covered him with it.</p><p></p><p>When the character logged out of the game, he wasn't covered with a blanket.</p><p></p><p>This means that his second sister has already woken up.</p><p></p><p>Getting up and leaving the room, a scent of cooked food wafted over.</p><p></p><p>"Second sister?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm here, the food will be ready soon, just wait a bit."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was a bit surprised.</p><p></p><p>After a few meals at home, it seemed they had only been eating porridge, but he didn't expect his second sister to be able to cook.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Fang Yu understood.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they had only been eating porridge because they didn't have enough money.</p><p></p><p>That watery porridge was just rice water, just enough to fill their stomachs.</p><p></p><p>According to his second sister's past memories, they used to eat a bit better, but it was just adding some wilted vegetable leaves when cooking the porridge.</p><p></p><p>The eldest brother was a tea house worker, ensuring a basic living standard.</p><p></p><p>The second sister was a temporary worker at a cloth workshop, occasionally earning money to improve their quality of life, determining the upper limit of their living.</p><p></p><p>As for him, Jiao De Yi, he was definitely the one dragging them down.</p><p></p><p>Idle and without any skills, no one wanted to hire him, the one contributing the least to the family.</p><p></p><p>But now, everything has gotten better.</p><p></p><p>The house has been cleaned up by the second sister, becoming much cleaner.</p><p></p><p>This made Fang Yu feel a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the dishes were also ready, it was stir-fried pork and cabbage.</p><p></p><p>The abundance was comparable to luxury.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, compared to the character's previous experiences.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao De Yi, do you remember what I told you last night?"</p><p></p><p>The second sister said while eating.</p><p></p><p>You told me so many things last night, which one are you talking about?</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu still nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I remember."</p><p></p><p>After all, he just remembered! You just tell me what it is.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the second sister sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother has been missing for so many days, I'm really worried about his safety. That [Investigation Agency], their reputation is really good, I want to hire them to investigate big brother's whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, the second sister looked at Fang Yu cautiously, even putting down her chopsticks, her expression tense.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was a bit puzzled by his second sister's behavior.</p><p></p><p>But he soon reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Is it expensive?"</p><p></p><p>"...Yes."</p><p></p><p>The second sister lowered her head, her voice as soft as a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>Having money can certainly allow the two of them to live a good life.</p><p></p><p>But without the most important family member by their side, can this money be spent with a clear conscience? The second sister didn't know, this kind of problem was too complicated.</p><p></p><p>She just hoped that the big brother could come back alive and reunite with them.</p><p></p><p>"I remember you said before that you had posted notices on the streets and set up a reward, but it didn't work, right?"</p><p></p><p>"A few people came while you were sleeping, but they were just false information." The second sister shook her head, her eyes red.</p><p></p><p>"How much?"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"The price of the [Investigation Agency]."</p><p></p><p>The second sister first showed joy, then said cautiously, "One tael..."</p><p></p><p>Ah! Fang Yu waved his hand and placed one tael on the table.</p><p></p><p>Then he heard the second sister continue.</p><p></p><p>"...per day."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ???"Are they made of gold or silver? Should I just join their [Investigation Agency]??"</p><p></p><p>The second sister hurriedly covered her head, weakly saying, "They, they have a very good reputation. Last time, when Aunt Zhang's cat went missing, they were the ones who helped find it."</p><p></p><p>Aunt Zhang was a wealthy lady that the second sister did temporary work for at the cloth workshop.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the second sister knew about this expensive place.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt that this [Investigation Agency] was definitely problematic, being so expensive.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the second sister's eyes filled with tears, he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>He took out another two taels.</p><p></p><p>"3 taels. Let them investigate for three days and see."</p><p></p><p>Three days, in three days, I don't even know if the character will still be alive.</p><p>Even the inspection at the Fool's Realm two days later could take his life at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao De Yi! I knew you were the best!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sister Two was so excited that she wanted to jump up, but she didn't take the money from Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"The money you gave me before, I still have some left, enough for the [Investigation Agency]. I was just afraid you would say I was wasting money..."</p><p></p><p>It's not that she was wasting money, it's just that she felt it was a bit of a waste.</p><p></p><p>How many days has the eldest brother been missing, five or six days?</p><p></p><p>Anyway, it's been that many days, for an ordinary tea house waiter to go missing for so long, he's most likely dead by now.</p><p></p><p>Spending money to give Sister Two some peace of mind is worth it, it's rare to feel cared for in this game.</p><p></p><p>Sister Two firmly refused to take any more money, so Fang Yu didn't insist.</p><p></p><p>The 10 taels he had could still be put to use.</p><p></p><p>5 taels exchanged for 50,000 living expenses.</p><p>5 taels to go to the martial arts school to buy a secret martial arts manual.</p><p></p><p>As for money, he could just earn more.</p><p></p><p>With his peerless skills, he wasn't afraid of lacking money. Thinking about this, Fang Yu opened his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Diao Deyi.]</p><p>[Realm: Flower Realm Initiate.]</p><p>[Demon Bloodline: Azure Demon [Scorching Grade Initiate].]</p><p>[Health: 32/32.]</p><p>[Physique: 3.2.] + [Spirit: 1.7.] + [Human-Grade Skill: Digital Life.]</p><p>[Flower-Grade Skills: Elemental Body Two-Zero Sword [Novice (4/100)]+, Elemental Body Stabilizing Technique [Flawless (4/600)]+.]</p><p>[Attribute Points: 5.]</p><p>[Experience: 59/100.]</p><p></p><p>Five attribute points, he hadn't allocated them yet.</p><p>Physique didn't need to be increased for now, his focus was on the two martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go to the [Investigation Agency] now."</p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Sister Two left, and Fang Yu also started walking towards the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>It's best to invest in the [Elemental Body Two-Zero Sword] first.</p><p>This thing relies on grinding the proficiency yourself, leveling up too slowly.</p><p></p><p>[Attribute Points: 5 → 4.]</p><p>[Elemental Body Two-Zero Sword [Novice] → Elemental Body Two-Zero Sword [Initial Comprehension].]</p><p></p><p>Boom!

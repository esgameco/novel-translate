        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With money, even ghosts can be made to turn the millstone.</p><p></p><p>After wandering through the alleys and small paths multiple times,</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu finally realized a fact.</p><p></p><p>That is, he too had gotten lost.</p><p></p><p>Just like the deceased Bu Jingshan, Fang Yu was also completely clueless about this maze-like dilapidated place.</p><p></p><p>It's cool to lure people in and kill them, but being trapped in the maze-like alleys is not funny at all.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Fang Yu's luck was not bad, and he encountered a beggar. After paying 10 coins, he returned to the familiar main road.</p><p></p><p>By this time, the sky was already near dusk.</p><p></p><p>A glance showed that there were far fewer people on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu walked silently on the road, but his mood was not calm.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p>"I'm so strong!"</p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the previous battle, Fang Yu's hands were still shaking.</p><p></p><p>The first sneak attack punch, the timing of which he had grasped perfectly.</p><p></p><p>But the power was not fully unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Because the feeling of actual combat is different from hitting wooden stakes.</p><p></p><p>In that short time, suddenly throwing a sneak attack punch, he hadn't even properly adjusted his posture.</p><p></p><p>The full-body force was probably only about 70-80% at most.</p><p></p><p>Even so, after that one punch, he was still drained of strength - after leaving the martial arts hall, he had not fully rested, so his condition was not good.</p><p></p><p>The situation at the time was actually very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>After that one punch, within three to five seconds, he was basically at the mercy of others, unable to move! Fortunately, that woman's injuries were severe, and her vision was limited, so she just swung her sword in place, giving Fang Yu a chance to catch his breath.</p><p></p><p>It was only after forcibly swallowing some raw food and vegetables that Fang Yu regained a bit of strength.</p><p></p><p>As a result, that woman charged at him with her sword, intent on killing him! Not only did she track me, but she also wanted to kill me, how can I tolerate this? With one punch, Fang Yu knocked her down.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit hesitant about the second punch, but considering that the woman's accomplices could arrive at any moment, and in his current state, if he was dragged down by them, he would be doomed.</p><p></p><p>So Fang Yu decisively acted, killing the woman and immediately fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Can't stay in Sweetflower Alley anymore."</p><p>"Go back and find Second Sister, move directly."</p><p>"Don't know what the identities of those two trackers are."</p><p>"In any case, the newcomers are not good, so I'll hide if I can."</p><p></p><p>This was Fang Yu's first thought.</p><p></p><p>The next idea that popped up was...</p><p></p><p>"So killing people also gives experience points!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up at the pedestrians on the street.</p><p></p><p>A bold idea emerged from his heart.</p><p></p><p>If the King of Hell knew of this bold idea, he might abdicate on the spot.</p><p>This living King of Hell, it would have to be you, Fang Yu! Fortunately, the idea was just an idea.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was clear about his own capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Yes, people die every day in Tianyuan Town.</p><p>Demons lurk, and there are always corpses on the streets.</p><p>But... this does not mean that the yamen (local government office) is not acting.</p><p>They will still arrest the murderers.</p><p>Even because of the demons, the punishment for such murder cases is quite severe.</p><p>They don't even need physical or witness evidence, they can just chop off the perpetrator's head first to verify if they are possessed by a demon or not.</p><p></p><p>Today, if Fang Yu dared to kill someone in broad daylight, tomorrow he could just wash his neck and wait to be executed.</p><p>After all, even demons only dare to kill in secret.</p><p>What makes an ordinary person think they can commit murder openly?</p><p>However, if he could kill in secret like a demon, it might be feasible.</p><p></p><p>The 25 blood Bu Jingshan provided 10 experience points.</p><p>Then the 5 blood, 6 blood ordinary people, 3 experience points? No! It shouldn't be that much.</p><p>Bu Jingshan had learned martial arts, so comprehensively speaking...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her strength is not inferior to mine. </p><p></p><p>Without any sneak attack methods, I might not even be her match.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, the 10 experience points given are a bit too high.</p><p></p><p>The experience points gained from killing ordinary people should be 1 point, or even 0.5 points.</p><p></p><p>Viewed this way, the experience gain rate from killing people is actually not high.</p><p></p><p>Because the path of killing people to grind experience has a huge risk.</p><p></p><p>Normally, you can only kill 1-2 people and then have to hide and flee.</p><p></p><p>Factoring in the time spent hiding, you can't make many kills in a day, otherwise your whereabouts will be exposed and it will be certain death.</p><p></p><p>As for killing dozens or even twenty people at once, that's no different from suicide.</p><p></p><p>So the path of killing people to grind experience is somewhat feasible, but you have to do it secretly, killing one person at a time and not get discovered...</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>What the hell am I thinking?</p><p></p><p>It's just a game, why am I getting so twisted about it.</p><p></p><p>No need, no need...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly reined in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If he keeps going down this path, he's afraid he'll embark on a road of no return.</p><p></p><p>But just because he won't do such things, doesn't mean others won't.</p><p></p><p>The fact that killing people can gain experience points is something that can't be hidden.</p><p></p><p>The reason no one has exposed it yet is probably because, like him, they feel a bit embarrassed about it, thinking this method is too dark and twisted, there's no need to do this in a game.</p><p></p><p>Of course, how they play in private is no one else's business.</p><p></p><p>And...</p><p></p><p>Killing people doesn't necessarily have to be random slaughter.</p><p></p><p>There's another way, which is to have a legitimate reason to kill people.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought of Yue Guang.</p><p></p><p>That's right, it's the... Righteous Dagger Bearer!</p><p></p><p>A righteous person with a dagger, he can then kill people! The authority of the Foolish Underworld is quite extensive, because the hiding ability of demons and monsters is too strong.</p><p></p><p>When the Foolish Underworld determines that someone is a demon or monster, he can then draw his blade and kill the person, using their death to verify their identity.</p><p></p><p>If a person is killed, they will die.</p><p>If a demon is killed, its true form will be exposed.</p><p></p><p>A very simple logic - the Righteous Dagger Bearer has the qualification to kill people.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu doesn't know the rules of the Foolish Underworld, but from observation, the Foolish Underworld has been indiscriminately killing people for days.</p><p></p><p>So Yue Guang, who openly killed people, is still doing fine now.</p><p></p><p>This skin is useful!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart was set on recruiting Ge Qianxuan.</p><p></p><p>This Foolish Underworld, he must get in! Then he can put on the skin of the Righteous Dagger Bearer, see anyone he dislikes, go up and stab them, and then find an opportunity to kill another one, experience points soaring!</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu was thinking about this, he could already see his home in the distance.</p><p></p><p>But what was strange was that there were a lot of people gathered at the door of his house.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart sank, and the discussions of those people also reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Tiger Gang, your people couldn't have been killed by Diao De! The Foolish Underworld has already issued an announcement, that was the work of a demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anymore, they're just looking for an excuse to devour the Diao family's last heir!"</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous! Outrageous! In broad daylight, forcing a decent person into prostitution, is there no law left?"</p><p></p><p>"Release Ru Ru, if you have the guts, come at us! Hey! Hey hey hey, why are you glaring at me? Murder! The Black Tiger Gang has committed murder!!"</p><p></p><p>"Where are the people from the Foolish Underworld? The arrogant and overbearing ones who are always quick to draw their blades and kill, how come they don't dare to uphold justice when the Black Tiger Gang is committing evil?"</p><p></p><p>"The Foolish Underworld? They're just a pack of dogs raised by the Black Tiger Gang! Normally they only dare to bully us common folk, where would they dare to be tough on the Black Tiger Gang!"</p><p></p><p>"A group of people who can even kill demons, yet don't dare to sweep away the Black Tiger Gang, this world is truly laughable! Are people perhaps even more terrifying than demons?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was indignant, and as Fang Yu heard their discussion, he had already rushed into the house like the wind!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

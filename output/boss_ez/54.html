        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A warmth several times stronger than before swept through his entire body.</p><p></p><p>The intense surge felt as if his body had become a millstone, with the warm flow as the driving force, pushing the millstone to rotate clockwise, polishing every detail of his entire body.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the middle of the street, Fang Yu's bones let out a crackling sound like firecrackers, causing the people on the street to turn and look.</p><p></p><p>His blood was surging, his flesh and blood were tightly bound, and he had a sense of complete unity in his body.</p><p></p><p>"What's that noise?"</p><p></p><p>"Stay away from him, he must be some kind of weirdo player who's playing with firecrackers on himself."</p><p></p><p>"Ah! I just started the game and already encountered a weirdo, Xiu-ge, I'm scared~"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a shrill voice drowned out Fang Yu's spotlight.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh—</p><p></p><p>All eyes turned to that woman.</p><p></p><p>"This sound is so enchanting!"</p><p></p><p>"Miss, may I ask your honored name?"</p><p></p><p>"Miss, please wait. I am a talented scholar from the Heart Book Academy, and I wish to discuss poetry with you."</p><p></p><p>The scholars who had never experienced the shrill voice were immediately hooked.</p><p></p><p>The focus shifted to them, and Fang Yu had already regained his calm.</p><p></p><p>"Phew—"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu exhaled lightly, carefully feeling the changes in his body.</p><p></p><p>He felt that his skin had become more resilient, better able to cushion pressure.</p><p></p><p>His bones were more sturdy, able to withstand greater impact.</p><p></p><p>Especially in his hands, the bones even seemed to have slightly expanded the palms, with a thick, solid feeling, as if a single punch could directly explode someone's head.</p><p></p><p>In gaming terms, it was probably like gaining the [Copper Skin, Iron Bones] buff and [Dual-Hand Specialization Enhancement].</p><p></p><p>If someone could previously deal 10 points of damage to him, now in the same situation, he would only lose 5 points of health.</p><p></p><p>This is the power of the Flower-Rank Intermediate Body Tempering Skill? The strength has increased by more than a little. It feels like these two attribute boosts alone could even surpass the previous total effect!</p><p></p><p>Transformation.</p><p></p><p>It can only be described as a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu began to look forward to the effects of upgrading the Body Tempering Skill to Flower-Rank Advanced, or even Grass-Rank Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Don't hit my pigeon~"</p><p>"Stop it, don't hit him~"</p><p>"Pigeon~ Pigeon~"</p><p></p><p>After Fang Yu finished experiencing the changes in his body, the group of people next to him seemed to have started a new conflict.</p><p></p><p>The shrill-voiced oppa was being surrounded and punched and kicked, cowering on the ground and trembling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the shrill voice calling out twice, the few people finally stopped and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The shrill-voiced one rushed over, acting coquettishly.</p><p>"Pigeon~ Pigeon~ Only I will care for the pigeon~"</p><p></p><p>Hardened! </p><p>The fists have hardened!</p><p>Believe it or not, I'll use a Black Tiger Seizing Heart move to drain your blood dry! Constantly making that shrill voice, do you have something stuck in your throat? Fang Yu's gaze turned to him.</p><p></p><p>[Lin Yuanxun: 6/6.]</p><p></p><p>Just a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Ah~ That weirdo is looking at me!"</p><p>"Pigeons, I'm so scared~"</p><p></p><p>While claiming to be scared, her eyes were actually smiling into slits, looking at the people around her with a pitiful expression.</p><p>As for the pigeons on the ground, they had already been eliminated by the update.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, do not be afraid!"</p><p>"Little sister, I will protect you! This is my real-world contact information! I will protect you from the inside out, in every way!"</p><p>"Miss, come behind me. I am a martial artist from the Body Tempering Academy! Who dares to touch you!"</p><p></p><p>The last person even pulled off his shirt, revealing a well-proportioned and muscular physique.</p><p></p><p>With the mention of the martial arts academy, the would-be competitors around them began to show signs of hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Even Fang Yu looked at the man with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Someone is impersonating the people from the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall?"</p><p></p><p>Taking a closer look.</p><p></p><p>[Yinsu: 45/45.]</p><p></p><p>Fangyu: ...</p><p></p><p>Wow, the eye of justice, firmly believing in the truth! It's actually the real deal! Isn't this the senior brother Yinsu who came to join the commotion when I was piling up the stakes before? How come he's here too, jumping out to join the excitement.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that he's got his eyes on Jiaziyin?</p><p></p><p>Brother, the skill level of others is too high for you to handle.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the slogan of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall was announced, the reactions of the crowd were very genuine.</p><p></p><p>Jiaziyin naturally took in all the reactions of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>With a snap, she went over and pressed her head against senior brother Yinsu's chest.</p><p></p><p>"Wow, wow~ Gege's heartbeat, it's so fast~ It feels so safe~"</p><p></p><p>The previously righteous senior brother Yinsu couldn't hold it in anymore and revealed a silly smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe hehe... hehe hehe hehe... hehe hehe hehe hehe..."</p><p></p><p>No hope for him, farewell, goodbye! It's time to give the NPCs in the game a little bit of Jiaziyin's shock, good luck to them.</p><p></p><p>Without caring about senior brother Yinsu, Fangyu even took a step back, silently blending into the crowd, not planning to go up and recognize anyone.</p><p></p><p>Can't afford to lose face! Under the gaze of the crowd, senior brother Yinsu and Jiaziyin seemed to have become a new divine couple, as for the former Gege lying moribund on the ground, no one cared anymore.</p><p></p><p>Fangyu looked at the severely depleted health bar of the Gege on the ground, even having the urge to go up and slash him, killing him to absorb a wave of blood.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, he still held back.</p><p></p><p>It's not because of his boundless love, but because if he was caught slashing someone, given the current level of suspicion towards him in the Foolish Underworld, he might be immediately executed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Not worth it, not worth it, next time find an opportunity to sneak out at night and secretly kill some people, quietly absorb blood and grow stronger!</p><p></p><p>Farming path, let's go!</p><p></p><p>Leaving the crowd, Fangyu rushed straight to the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the martial arts hall, Fangyu suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>Following his stop, three people behind him also stopped synchronously, either turning sideways, turning their backs, or lowering their heads.</p><p></p><p>Fangyu looked back.</p><p></p><p>[Wuyun Valley: 355/555.]</p><p>[Bijie: 7/7.]</p><p>[Shou Xi: 9/9.]</p><p>[Chen Yufu: 800/800.]</p><p>[Yang Mingzhi: 11/11.]</p><p>[Tian Yuqi: 13/13.]</p><p>[Hua Xiaoxin: 545/545.]</p><p></p><p>Among the sparse and ordinary health bars, three people's health bars were extremely conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>That extraordinary maximum health value immediately made Fangyu realize what kind of people they were.</p><p></p><p>Three... Demons! In broad daylight, with the sun blazing, Fangyu's forehead was beaded with cold sweat, and his palms were trembling.</p><p></p><p>Gulp.</p><p></p><p>He swallowed his saliva and strode towards the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>As he moved, the three people behind him also followed closely.</p><p></p><p>Fangyu's breathing became more and more rapid, and he suddenly realized one thing, which was that his character still had a serious weakness, and that was the ability to escape.</p><p></p><p>If he could safely enter the martial arts hall this time, he must definitely buy a secret skill book on lightness skill from Elder Red Heart first! Since he couldn't see the situation behind him, he really didn't know how far those Demons were.</p><p></p><p>This unknown factor made him even more nervous.</p><p></p><p>His ears were fully erect, afraid that the three Demons behind him would suddenly pounce and kill him in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Three Demons, one claw each, Fangyu really didn't know if his just-upgraded Yuanti Sturdy Foundation could withstand it.</p><p></p><p>As for why he immediately identified these three as Demons with just a glance...</p><p></p><p>What nonsense!</p><p></p><p>With health values thicker than the head of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, who else could they be? Except for the sweeper monk of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, Fangyu had never seen anyone with such high human health values!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

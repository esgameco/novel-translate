        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Is there really a spirit in this world?】</p><p></p><p>【Is she a believer?!】</p><p></p><p>【... No!】 </p><p></p><p>【That's not right! This kind of spiritual trace...】</p><p></p><p>【A wild spirit?】</p><p></p><p>【This woman has already been possessed by a spirit!】</p><p></p><p>【If I eat this woman, I will be entangled by it!】</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin felt perplexed.</p><p></p><p>It's like facing a hedgehog covered in thorns, and it couldn't bring itself to take a bite.</p><p></p><p>【Not good!】</p><p></p><p>【This woman already knows I'm a demon!】</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin fell into hesitation.</p><p></p><p>When facing a parasitic spirit, killing the host is not a good method.</p><p></p><p>Keeping it by my side would also make it easy to get infected.</p><p></p><p>What to do? 【I gave up a lifetime of cultivation just to come to this brand new human world.】</p><p></p><p>【In my current state, I can't handle a spirit of this level!】</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin controlled the flesh body, making a frowning expression.</p><p></p><p>It has gradually mastered the control of human emotional expressions in this place.</p><p></p><p>【I thought this would be my paradise.】</p><p></p><p>【No demons, no spirits, and no martial cultivating humans.】 </p><p></p><p>【But I didn't expect that a tail would follow me to this side of the world.】</p><p></p><p>【If that's the case, then I won't play around slowly anymore.】</p><p></p><p>The face of the flesh body controlled by the sheepskin flashed with cruelty.</p><p></p><p>It wants to start a massacre, quickly devouring human flesh and blood to restore its strength.</p><p></p><p>At least, to the point where it can contend with this spirit.</p><p></p><p>The sheepskin controlling the flesh body quietly withdrew.</p><p></p><p>That night, on the neighboring street, five thugs were brutally killed on the street.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the sound of police sirens woke the unconscious nurse.</p><p></p><p>After a brief daze, the nurse suddenly woke up in alarm! "I, I'm not dead?!"</p><p></p><p>"Where's my husband? Where is he??"</p><p></p><p>The nurse hurriedly went to the room to check.</p><p></p><p>The room was completely empty.</p><p></p><p>Everything was there, nothing was missing, even the countdown above her head was still there.</p><p></p><p>It's just that there are only a little over 10 hours left now.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on..."</p><p></p><p>"Was everything that happened last night just a dream?"</p><p></p><p>"Or have I really gone crazy, become a mental patient?"</p><p></p><p>The nurse was confused, helpless, and perplexed.</p><p></p><p>She kept calling her husband's phone, but no one answered.</p><p></p><p>She returned to the bathroom in a daze, and then she saw the wedding ring on the floor.</p><p></p><p>The police siren outside was particularly harsh at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The nurse felt the world spinning, making it difficult for her to distinguish reality from illusion.</p><p></p><p>So, she dialed a number.</p><p></p><p>"Hello, Dr. Xian? I think I really have a mental illness, can you help me?"</p><p></p><p>Driving to the hospital.</p><p></p><p>On the way, she saw a yellow police line blocking off an alley, and there seemed to be four or five bloody corpses lying inside, which was unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>That day, the nurse cooperated with the psychiatrist for examination and actively treated her psychological trauma.</p><p></p><p>"It's the hospital's fault! I told you it's your fault!"</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of you that my dad died! Now because of this, our whole family has been evicted by the landlord, just because you won't admit your mistake! The landlord thinks we're violent and kicked us out!"</p><p></p><p>"Husband, that woman is not a good person either! Just because she has money and a house, huh! If she won't let us stay here, we'll move to a high-end community! And you hospital, hurry up and compensate us! Do you understand!"</p><p></p><p>The family who caused a medical dispute also came today.</p><p></p><p>Watching the hospital director constantly apologizing and trying to appease, and the angry doctor next to him.</p><p></p><p>The nurse felt relieved in her heart that she didn't have to accompany the doctor to confront these crazy patient families today.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, the countdown above her head was also approaching 0.</p><p></p><p>The nurse felt inexplicably nervous.</p><p></p><p>According to the psychiatrist, this is a kind of self-imposed psychological suggestion.</p><p></p><p>As long as she firmly believes that she is fine, when the countdown ends, these numbers will disappear.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The nurse's breathing paused, her eyes widening, her mind going blank, and her consciousness fading.</p><p></p><p>The person fell straight forward, with a thud, collapsing on the ground, no longer breathing and without any signs of life.</p><p></p><p>Just like... the previous sudden death of Mr. Wang.</p><p></p><p>The people around rushed over, screaming.</p><p></p><p>The male family member of the medical dispute seemed to vaguely realize something, staring in horror with trembling fingers pointing at the nurse's corpse.</p><p></p><p>In the chaos, no one noticed that a cleaner had also collapsed on the ground at the same time, without a breath.</p><p></p><p>On the TV, the live news broadcast was playing.</p><p></p><p>"In Kuanxiang Alley, five bodies were found, suspected to be homicides with cruel methods, the perpetrator determined to be in an extremely unstable mental state."</p><p></p><p>"The suspect is currently believed to be Fu Tingxian, who has a wife, the police are trying to call the wife..."</p><p></p><p>Ding-a-ling.</p><p>Ding-a-ling.</p><p></p><p>The ringing of a phone came from the nurse's corpse.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside, the situation was constantly evolving.</p><p></p><p>But in Qingshui Community, it was unusually peaceful.</p><p></p><p>After separating from Xiao Jin, Fang Yu returned to his own home.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the cold instant noodles on the table, a sense of conflict flashed through Fang Yu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, he decided to indulge a bit.</p><p></p><p>He cooked another pot of beef-flavored instant noodles.</p><p></p><p>Then he added the now-cold instant noodles into the pot, cooking them together.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu ate quickly, as he was truly hungry. Previously, when he wanted to eat the noodles, he was taken by Xiao Jin to the hospital to see Mr. Wang, causing him to not have a single bite.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was back, he naturally indulged in a big meal.</p><p></p><p>After eating his fill and feeling comfortable, Fang Yu patted his belly and checked the forum.</p><p></p><p>The keyword "Tianyuan Town" was still there, and he quickly discovered that someone was actually buying silver! The exchange rate was as high as 10,000 to 1!</p><p></p><p>That meant... 1 tael of silver could be exchanged for 10,000 yuan! Fang Yu was instantly excited.</p><p></p><p>10,000 yuan, 10,000 yuan, this was 10,000 yuan!</p><p></p><p>He thought it through, and he still had about 10 taels of silver on him.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need much, just exchanging 5 taels of silver first, converting it to 50,000 yuan, to tide him over and allow himself a more comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>10,000 yuan as a gift for Elder Zhou.</p><p>10,000 yuan as a gift for Mr. Wang.</p><p>The remaining 30,000 yuan would be for living expenses and improving his diet.</p><p></p><p>In Qingshui Community, Fang Yu actually didn't know many people.</p><p></p><p>Elder Zhou and Mr. Wang were two, and then there was the landlord Sister Jin, that was it.</p><p></p><p>For other people, he could only say he was familiar with their faces, able to greet them and have a brief chat when they encountered each other on the street.</p><p></p><p>In gaming terms, that meant there were people who would vouch for him as not being a villain when someone tried to label him as such.</p><p></p><p>But if it was Elder Zhou or Mr. Wang, they would be the kind of iron-clad, die-hard friends.</p><p></p><p>"Ah—"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu sighed, thinking that with these two elders gone, the community would become much colder in the future.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head to shake off these melancholic thoughts, Fang Yu sent a private message on the forum.</p><p></p><p>"Come to the Sispace Pawnshop on Shannian Street."</p><p></p><p>The response was just this one line:</p><p></p><p>"Come to the Sispace Pawnshop on Shannian Street."</p><p></p><p>Wow, an automated response! Fang Yu didn't bother with anything else, deciding to just go into the game and talk to the person face-to-face.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a 50,000 yuan big deal, and Fang Yu was still quite excited about it.</p><p></p><p>Back on the bed, putting on the helmet, he directly entered the game.</p><p></p><p>...

        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This made Fang Yu even more excited.</p><p></p><p>"No one noticed."</p><p></p><p>"No one discovered it."</p><p></p><p>"You're done for!"</p><p></p><p>"You're at the end of your rope!"</p><p></p><p>"So, this person's head, I'll take it! Even Jesus can't stop me!!"</p><p></p><p>With a sudden roar, Fang Yu grabbed his head with one hand and raised his sword with the other, suddenly rushing forward.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Luminous Demon's HP was only 0.1 left, he charged right in front of the Luminous Demon and suddenly slashed out a sword! -0.1!! The tiny damage value popped out from the Luminous Demon's body, directly depleting its HP bar to zero.</p><p></p><p>[Luminous Demon: 0/1000.]</p><p></p><p>The Luminous Demon widened its eyes and fell backwards.</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Luminous Demon], gained 350 experience! Every 100 experience points automatically convert to 1 attribute point, a total of 3 attribute points gained.]</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player has gained experience, the [Attribute Panel] has been successfully unlocked.]</p><p></p><p>Attribute points? Personal panel? Fang Yu perked up and quickly called up the panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Diao De Yi.]</p><p>[Realm: Mortal.]</p><p>[HP: 1.5/7.]</p><p>[Physique: 0.7.] + [Spirit: 1.2.] + [Skill: Digital Life [Human Level].]</p><p>[Attribute Points: 3.]</p><p>[Experience: 50/100.]</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu noticed that Physique and Spirit had a "+" sign behind them, and tried clicking on them.</p><p></p><p>[Physique: 0.7→1.7.]</p><p>[HP: 1.5/7→11.5/17.]</p><p>[Attribute Points: 3→2.]</p><p></p><p>It was as if a completely new force had been infused into his body.</p><p></p><p>A tingling sensation, instantly transmitted throughout his entire body like an electric current.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Fang Yu felt like his body had become even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>The maximum HP had even changed from 7 to 17!</p><p></p><p>This feeling, not bad at all! Fang Yu was studying the attribute panel, unaware that the fleeing group had already been dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What, what happened??"</p><p>"Diao De Yi, Diao De Yi actually killed that demon?!"</p><p>"How did he do it? Am I hallucinating?"</p><p>"Diao De Yi! Diao De Yi!! Well done!"</p><p></p><p>After reacting, the group excitedly cheered, with the injured companions running towards Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>But before they could even approach Fang Yu, from the distance came the rapid sound of hooves, kicking up clouds of dust as they rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish Underworld Office, the demon has manifested! Bystanders..."</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang and the others immediately stopped in their tracks, revealing expressions of joy.</p><p></p><p>"Reinforcements have arrived!"</p><p>"We're over here!"</p><p>"Shi Shi was seriously injured, quickly arrange for rescue!"</p><p></p><p>The group started shouting, but saw that the arriving colleagues didn't pay them any attention at all, instead rushing straight to Fang Yu's side, completely surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>This action left everyone stunned.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was even more dumbfounded, tilting his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ? When I put up a question mark, it's better if you're the ones with the problem! What's going on? Treating me, a good citizen who just killed a great demon, like this?</p><p></p><p>Before anyone could ask, the rider on the horse pointed a long spear at Fang Yu and roared, "Audacious headless demon! Kneel down and surrender immediately!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ??? ... Foolish Underworld Office.</p><p></p><p>"Name."</p><p>"Diao De Yi."</p><p>"Age."</p><p>"16."</p><p>"Why did you come here?"</p><p>"Because...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Brother! You guys have treated me like a monster! No! No! I've said a hundred times that I'm not! Can't Lord Qian Xuan prove it for me?"</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of déjà vu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>He had just gone through the orange in reality, and now he had to go through it again in the game! But unlike the orange in reality...</p><p></p><p>Slap! The female constable in front of him slammed the table hard, directly stepping her thigh onto the table, hands on her hips, and shouting in a voice even louder than Fang Yu's.</p><p></p><p>"Don't shout! If it weren't for Lord Qian Xuan's team protecting you, do you think you'd still be alive now?"</p><p></p><p>Wow, such a strong aura! Fang Yu shrunk his headless neck and protected the small head in his arms.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you yelling so loudly? If you have the guts, go find the property management!"</p><p></p><p>"What property management! Let me tell you, this is my territory, the dragon is coiled around me, the tiger is lying down for me, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu nodded his head gloomily.</p><p></p><p>"I can't see it! Put your head on the table!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>You're really pushing your luck, aren't you! At least I'm a strong one with over 10 HP now, can't you show me some respect! Fang Yu gritted his teeth and used both hands to place the separated head on the table.</p><p></p><p>Looked at the blood volume of the person opposite.</p><p></p><p>[Loner Star: 75/75.]</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for your high blood volume, I'd see how I can kill you! "Hey! Hey! Your eyes are not right, I feel you're not respecting me! If you don't respect me, it's like you're not respecting my dad, and if you don't respect my dad, that's disrespecting the warden of our prison, do you know how serious this is?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Who's your dad?"</p><p></p><p>"Loner Moon!" Loner Star puffed out his chest proudly.</p><p></p><p>"What does he do?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Loner Star sneered, "My dad is a first-class prison guard in the A-class prison area!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh... I don't know, never heard of him."</p><p></p><p>"You?!"</p><p></p><p>Loner Star suddenly got angry, his large chest heaving.</p><p></p><p>"Your tongue is quite nimble, if it weren't for someone proving that you killed the street monster, just based on the lawsuit you got into at the pharmacy, you wouldn't have enough lives to get out of this!"</p><p></p><p>Well, I'm just saying! I'm a meritorious person, a person who has rendered service, how could the yamen throw a good citizen like me into prison!</p><p></p><p>But Loner Star suddenly snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, someone, take this guy back to the prison."</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's face changed.</p><p></p><p>The game has just started, and you're going to lock me up in prison, how am I going to make money, how am I going to develop? That's not fair, is it! Seeming to sense Fang Yu's urgency, Loner Star smirked.</p><p></p><p>"What are you in a hurry for, the paperwork outside will take half an hour, first go back to the prison and stay there. As long as the paperwork doesn't come out in a day, you'll be under my control for a day."</p><p></p><p>Stinky woman! So it's a personal vendetta! Let's see if I can find a chance to kill you! Fang Yu gritted his teeth, but then heard Loner Star suddenly say, "Oh, by the way, Qian Xuan said you were cursed by a monster and that's why you turned out this way. The neighboring [Demon Research Institute] is very interested in you and wants to cut your body into several pieces to research it. Are you interested? The Demon Research Institute is willing to pay you one or two gold coins as compensation."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ??? Cut my body into pieces for research? I'm not sick, you can't research me like that! He rolled his eyes and followed the prison guard out of the interrogation room, with the sound of Loner Star's 'hahaha' laughter without a trace of a lady-like image behind him.</p><p></p><p>Back in the prison cell, Fang Yu sat down with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>He was heartbroken, he had just dealt with the Luminous Monster, and the next moment he was arrested by the reinforcement team from the Foolish Underworld and thrown into prison. It was only after Qian Xuan and the others cleared up the misunderstanding that he avoided being killed as a monster.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

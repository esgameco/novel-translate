        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Simply put, a demon is a werewolf. It cannot expose its identity, for if it does, the defense forces will surround and kill it.</p><p></p><p>However, it can use a human skin to disguise itself and stealthily attack and kill people without anyone knowing.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought of his own ability. He could see the health bars.</p><p></p><p>With his ability, the demon's long health bar would be exposed, and it would have nowhere to hide.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was more satisfied with his ability.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that he couldn't defeat the demon.</p><p></p><p>Even if he really discovered the demon, he wouldn't dare expose its identity before being fully prepared, otherwise he would be the first one to be killed.</p><p></p><p>"There's another issue, Lord Li. I feel that my physique is not weak, but my fists are flabby. Like when I previously slew the demon, I could clearly feel that I could only inflict minor injuries on the demon. But your attacks were very effective. Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianhuan seemed to have seen through Fang Yu's thoughts, but he didn't point it out directly, and instead said:</p><p></p><p>"This is the difference between a martial artist and an ordinary person."</p><p></p><p>"Even if ordinary people train their bodies, they can only achieve physical fitness and cannot fully unleash the potential and strength of their bodies. Their utilization of physical strength is far from enough."</p><p></p><p>"But martial artists specialize in the martial arts. They activate the potential of the human body and squeeze out every bit of strength, unleashing the full power of the body. So each time they attack, their strike intensity far exceeds that of ordinary people."</p><p></p><p>"You should have already experienced this. The results of us wielding our swords to injure the enemy and you wielding your sword to injure the enemy are completely different."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Yu immediately knelt down and said:</p><p></p><p>"Please teach me martial arts, Lord Li!"</p><p></p><p>According to Fang Yu's understanding, the atmosphere had reached this point, and with the favor he had received, Li Qianhuan would surely take him in, right? But in reality, Li Qianhuan shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Liao Deyi, your courage is admirable. To be honest, I have high hopes for you. But unfortunately, I cannot take you in."</p><p></p><p>"First, your age is too old. The best age to cultivate the martial arts foundation, strengthen the bones, and shape the body is around 7-8 years old."</p><p></p><p>"But you are already 16 years old, your skeletal structure has already formed, and you have missed the best cultivation period. Even if your talent is good, your future achievements will be limited."</p><p></p><p>"Even so, I still have high hopes for you. But there is another issue."</p><p></p><p>"That is... the martial arts of the Yudi Mansion cannot be privately transmitted outside."</p><p></p><p>"I am also a member of the Yudi Mansion, but I'm just a minor figure with less than a hundred subordinates, so I naturally cannot violate this rule."</p><p></p><p>"However..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Yu's face had already shown disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Li Qianhuan still had a turning point, he quickly perked up his ears.</p><p></p><p>"However, in Tianyuan Town, there are many martial arts schools."</p><p></p><p>"Some martial arts schools will teach martial arts as long as you pay, without any responsibility, only for the purpose of making money."</p><p></p><p>"Some martial arts schools will have restrictions on qualifications and age, focusing on quality over quantity."</p><p></p><p>"If you want to learn the martial arts of the Yudi Mansion, you must first join the Yudi Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"And to join the Yudi Mansion, you must first pass the Yudi Mansion's assessment, but without any special skills, it is absolutely impossible for you to pass the assessment."</p><p></p><p>"So in your current situation, if you want to learn my skills, there is only one path you can take."</p><p></p><p>"That is to first join a martial arts school, learn martial arts, and practice for three to five years. Then apply to join the Yudi Mansion and be enrolled under my name."</p><p></p><p>Li Qianhuan felt that he had pointed out the future path for Fang Yu, and was waiting for Fang Yu's gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Yu opened his mouth wide, as if doubting whether he had heard correctly.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, you said it takes three to five years to train?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan stated matter-of-factly, "Three to five years."</p><p></p><p>Three to five years? Brother, this game has a 1:1 real-time speed! If you really make me grind for three to five years in the game before joining your lousy sect, you must be out of your mind! The game will be bankrupt by then, what a terrible idea.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Fang Yu's thoughts, Li Qianxuan's expression also showed some displeasure, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Deyi, don't be too ambitious. The way of martial arts is one step at a time. Three to five years is already a relatively ideal situation. Starting martial arts training at your age, compared to those young people of the appropriate age, it's already half the effort for double the result. Being able to catch up to their starting point in three to five years is already very good."</p><p></p><p>Okay, it seems that martial arts training in this game is truly difficult.</p><p></p><p>But if it's difficult for him, it's also difficult for other players.</p><p></p><p>As long as there's progress, it's fine to just keep practicing.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Then may I ask Lord Li, do you have any recommendations for martial arts schools?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu just remembered that on the way, he had asked Yue Guang to teach him archery, but the latter had avoided the topic.</p><p></p><p>It seems that it's also because of the rules of the Foolish Underworld, where they cannot privately transmit martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianyuan Town has nearly a hundred small martial arts schools, but only about thirty major ones. Most of them have the backing of some power behind them."</p><p></p><p>"The three largest martial arts schools are the [Hongyang Martial Arts School], the [Wenjian Martial Arts School], and the [Diliang Martial Arts School]."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't recommend you go to these three top-tier martial arts schools. Not to mention the issues of qualifications and financial investment, the fact that once you join, you can't easily leave is also a problem to deal with."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu understood.</p><p></p><p>These three martial arts schools are like independent powers outside the Foolish Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Joining these three martial arts schools is like being branded by the school's power. Others won't dare to easily provoke you, but you also can't easily take off this label.</p><p></p><p>Being the school's person in life, and the school's ghost in death, one must be mentally prepared for this if they truly want to join these three top-tier martial arts schools.</p><p></p><p>"The one I recommend for you is a medium-sized martial arts school, not too powerful or large in numbers. But the school master is an upright and fair person, someone you can trust."</p><p></p><p>"Most importantly, it's clean enough that you can leave the school's identity anytime and join other powers without any hidden troubles."</p><p></p><p>"This martial arts school is called the [Yuanti Martial Arts School], and the school master is Yuan Hongxin, who is also a skilled fighter, with strength around the initial Grass-level."</p><p></p><p>"The only problem is, it may be a bit more expensive."</p><p></p><p>Grass-level initial? Fang Yu couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, how are the cultivation realms of martial artists divided?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't even know this? Martial artists are divided into Flower, Grass, Tree, and Wood realms."</p><p></p><p>"Common people entering the martial path are at the Flower realm."</p><p></p><p>"From the initial level of training to the advanced level, breaking through is the Grass realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Tree realm, I've only heard rumors about. The Wood realm experts are unheard of."</p><p></p><p>"Beyond that, I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Flower, Grass, Tree, and Wood? So casual? What's going on with this game? Seeming to sense Fang Yu's thoughts, Li Qianxuan said:</p><p></p><p>"Do you feel the realm names are too whimsical? But it's not so."</p><p></p><p>"These realms are passed down from ancient times, when the martial dao was still very barren. The pioneers then enlightened the dao through flowers, grasses, trees, and woods, and thus set the standards of the martial dao, so the realm names were determined accordingly."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

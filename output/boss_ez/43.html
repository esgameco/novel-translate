        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was tense, and after thinking for a moment, he shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Won't say? Hmph! No matter, I just don't want you to expose yourself and affect the overall plan. Remember, this is a critical moment, don't cause any more trouble! Just lie low and wait for orders!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Yue Guang suddenly reached out and inserted his hand into Fang Yu's chest, directly grasping his beating heart.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: !!! His eyes widened, and his heart suddenly jumped into his throat.</p><p></p><p>Just as Fang Yu thought his heart was about to be crushed by Yue Guang, Yue Guang suddenly withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a number appeared above Fang Yu's head.</p><p></p><p>+22.5.</p><p></p><p>The health bar was immediately refilled.</p><p></p><p>[Health: 32/32.]</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>A demon, it healed me??</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Detected 99.9% pure demonic primordial blood serum, blood fusion is about to occur.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Blood fusion complete.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Congratulations, player has obtained the supreme-grade talent bloodline [Demonic Bloodline], and gained 50 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Player has successfully unlocked the [Demonic Bloodline], and gained 500 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Player will close the [Spiritual Faith] panel.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Experience points have exceeded 100, and have been converted into 5 attribute points.]</p><p></p><p>The series of sudden prompts left Fang Yu somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he saw that the wound in his heart had been repaired as if it had never been pierced.</p><p></p><p>If not for the puncture wound in his chest, one wouldn't even be able to tell that his heart had been stabbed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu opened his mouth, but didn't know what to say, feeling like the other party might have misunderstood something.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at this moment, voices came from outside, and Yue Guang got up and said in a low voice:</p><p></p><p>"The curse theory is indeed not bad, showing some quick wit. But it won't last long."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld has more advanced detection methods, you won't be able to hide for long."</p><p></p><p>"Find a way to protect yourself, and come to the Lingyun Inn in 3 days to find me."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>But his brain was running at high speed, and he could maintain a deadpan expression, only saying in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Someone has already suspected me?"</p><p></p><p>It seems that Yue Guang really took me for some demonic companion.</p><p></p><p>Now is absolutely not the time to expose myself, otherwise he can heal me, and naturally he can also take my life.</p><p></p><p>"It's Li Baizheng. Li Qianxuan's elder brother, the Underworld's Baihu."</p><p></p><p>"The information reported by Li Qianxuan is that Li Baizheng suspects your identity is false."</p><p></p><p>"Your movements were too clumsy, there were two people tracking you, you dealt with one. The other one, Zhi Wenshan, was secretly dealt with by me later."</p><p></p><p>"But Li Qianxuan and Li Baizheng, we can't touch them, just try to avoid being tracked. If this causes the Li family to mobilize, things will become very troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan is still alive?? Fang Yu was shocked inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He had thought this kid would be the first to have his head cut off by Yue Guang.</p><p></p><p>So what's the situation now? Do I have to pretend to be a demon? Why does it always feel like I've triggered a task that's beyond my current level?</p><p></p><p>Thump thump thump! At this moment, a squad of Underworld people rushed in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Underworld law enforcement, clear the area..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Underworld, Level 3 Prison Area, Interrogation Room.</p><p></p><p>"Name."</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi."</p><p></p><p>"Age."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Potential Lone Star slammed his hand on the table.</p><p></p><p>"I'm asking you, what's your age!"</p><p></p><p>"Big sis, we just saw each other yesterday!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was depressed, was this guy picking a fight?</p><p></p><p>"Why are you yelling so loudly! I'll tell you, Diao Deyi, here only I can yell this loudly, only me!"</p><p></p><p>The last shout even cracked the person's voice.</p><p></p><p>Alright alright, I know only you can yell loudly now.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu resigned himself to it. His previous imprisonment was due to the entry of the demons, and now he was imprisoned again.</p><p></p><p>Just like going home, the brothers in prison speak nicely, right?</p><p></p><p>He lifted his eyelids slightly.</p><p></p><p>[Qian Gu Xing: 75/75.]</p><p></p><p>Very good, at least she is still herself, not possessed by demons.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, why were you sent here again?"</p><p></p><p>Qian Gu Xing cracked sunflower seeds, gossiping without any airs of an interrogator.</p><p></p><p>It seems that although my impression of her is not good, she still recognizes me as an upright person.</p><p></p><p>Isn't my image as a good citizen established now?</p><p></p><p>"The Black Tiger Gang wanted to kill me, so I fought back in self-defense and killed them all."</p><p></p><p>"Whoa - impressive! Didn't expect you to be so capable!"</p><p></p><p>"...Those were just street thugs, without any real martial arts training."</p><p></p><p>"Trash! You're really trash, fighting with ordinary people, so boring, so boring."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Qian Gu Xing really didn't pay attention to me anymore.</p><p></p><p>I don't know if she got some news and knows that my being here is just a formality.</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to stay in the prison?"</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean I can stay here?"</p><p></p><p>Qian Gu Xing pursed her lips and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Last time, she secretly kept Fang Yu detained for a bit longer, but was warned by the superiors.</p><p></p><p>This time, she won't bother him! Just this once! Qian Gu Xing thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>At this rate of going to prison, this kid will eventually fall into my hands, and then I'll torture him to death! Make him shout "Qian Gu Xing, big sister" a hundred times a day!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't pay attention to her, but instead opened his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Diao De Yi.]</p><p>[Realm: Flower Realm Initial Stage.]</p><p>[Demonic Bloodline: Azure Demon Blood [Scorching Initial Stage].]</p><p>[Life: 32/32.]</p><p>[Physique: 3.2.] + [Spirit: 1.7.] + [Human-level Skill: Digital Life.]</p><p>[Flower-level Skills: Primal Body Two Zero Sword [Not Mastered (4/100)]+, Primal Body Stabilizing Art [Furnace Pure (4/600)]+.]</p><p>[Attribute Points: 5.]</p><p>[Experience: 59/100.]</p><p></p><p>His gaze focused on the demonic bloodline...</p><p></p><p>[Bloodline Name: Azure Demon Blood.]</p><p>[Bloodline Level: Scorching Initial Stage.]</p><p>[Bloodline Purity: 99.9%.]</p><p>[Bloodline Effect 1: Killing humans at or below the same realm can steal their essence blood, gaining 100% of their maximum life.

Killing and absorbing blood! Increasing the maximum life!</p><p>I, I also have this ability?!</p><p>I, I I I I, I'm going to be invincible!!!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was suddenly excited.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had struggled to reach 30 life.</p><p>Even if he invested all 5 attribute points into physique, it would only be 80 life.</p><p>This amount of life is nothing compared to the hundreds or thousands that demons possess.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the Azure Demon's demonic bloodline ability, he can also achieve hundreds or thousands of life!</p><p>A demonic cultivator with thousands of life emerging? Fang Yu felt so satisfied just thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>It's a pity! It's a pity that the demonic bloodline awakened too late, otherwise in that fight with Tiger Brother, he could have instantly increased his life by who knows how much!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was full of expectations for his beautiful future life, when suddenly a prison guard walked in from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De Yi? Someone has come to bail you out."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

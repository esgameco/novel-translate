        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall had already passed the deadline for recruiting disciples, there was not much foot traffic at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the three people closely following behind stood out even more.</p><p></p><p>The first to retreat and give up was Chen Yufeng, who had 800 HP.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu was unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>The other two, like hunting dogs that had caught the scent, seemed unwilling to give up and instead suddenly started to accelerate, quickly closing the distance to Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Even without turning back, the rapid footsteps closing in made Fang Yu's soul shudder.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at this moment, a graceful figure flashed by from the inner courtyard of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mei!!"</p><p></p><p>Shouting excitedly, Fang Yu's feet smashed the ground, causing the bricks to crack slightly, and he took off like a rocket, rushing towards the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>This sudden burst of speed left the two who had been quickly approaching him visibly stunned.</p><p></p><p>After a female head poked out from the inner courtyard and greeted Fang Yu, the two exchanged a glance and then silently left like ordinary passersby.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so late today? And just so you know, I've already eaten all the dumplings, not a single one left."</p><p></p><p>Shi Cang Mei thought Fang Yu was calling her because he had finally realized the importance of the Yuanxin Meat Dumplings for martial arts training.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu didn't care about the dumplings at all! He was panting heavily and looked back, seeing that there was no one at the hall's entrance anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, I owe you one."</p><p></p><p>Patting Shi Cang Mei's shoulder, Fang Yu quickly walked into the inner part of the hall, leaving the bewildered Shi Cang Mei behind.</p><p></p><p>Narrowly escaping with his life, that's the only way to describe it.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu walked quickly, he tried to calm his racing heart.</p><p></p><p>He never expected the demons to be so blatant!</p><p></p><p>This was broad daylight! There were people everywhere, except for the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, which had just passed its recruitment period and had fewer visitors.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, those demons wouldn't have had any opportunity to make a move.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled Fang Yu the most was how those three demonic beings had targeted him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the demonic bloodline I just awakened attracted them, like kindred spirits?</p><p></p><p>No, that can't be right! If it was a demonic bloodline, they should have recognized me as a demon, just like Yue Guang.</p><p></p><p>But those three demons were clearly after my life!</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there are also factional disputes among demons?</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute! Fang Yu suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>He had thought of something.</p><p></p><p>It was... the aura of slaughter! Although he could barely sense it now, there was no denying that remnants of the aura of slaughter still lingered on him.</p><p></p><p>It was likely this aura that had attracted the demons to him!</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Fang Yu felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>At least he didn't have to worry about being targeted by demons for no reason.</p><p></p><p>But then his brow furrowed again.</p><p></p><p>Those three demons know my appearance and the remnants of the aura of slaughter on me.</p><p></p><p>Will they really give up so easily? If I wait until nightfall when the aura dissipates and then boldly walk out, will those three demons give up the hunt, or will they be waiting at the entrance like a tiger waiting for its prey? Fang Yu couldn't find the answer, and he felt trapped in a difficult situation.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a predicament, Fang Yu's evil tendencies surfaced, and he suddenly made a turn, striding towards the storage room. Kill the old monk, absorb the great blood, and slay the demons!</p><p></p><p>With each step, his aura grew stronger, and by the time he reached the storage room, his spirit was soaring, his resolve unwavering. But just as he entered the storage room, he collided with a figure.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The figure was knocked to the ground, but Fang Yu remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he saw that it was Lin Wu.</p><p></p><p>[Lin Wu: 32/32 HP]</p><p></p><p>His HP was normal, but Lin Wu seemed disoriented, almost delirious.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His face was in a state of panic and confusion, his gaze was wandering, and he was muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to... I didn't mean to!!"</p><p></p><p>The last exclamation suddenly erupted in a loud voice, echoing through the warehouse and making Fang Yu's eardrums tremble.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Fang Yu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, Lin Wu, it was just a bump, I'm fine," Fang Yu said as he helped him up.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Lin Wu seemed to finally recognize Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Diao, Diao Deyi?"</p><p></p><p>"It's me."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Lin Wu suddenly came to his senses and grabbed Fang Yu's shoulders anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, go call the master! My second uncle! My second uncle... Wuwuwu! It's all my fault! It's all my fault!!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lin Wu broke down in tears again, his emotions unstable.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that my big money bag has been taken? "What's going on! Tell me quickly, what happened to your second uncle? Is he still alive?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu asked hurriedly, his concern level just a little less than Lin Wu's as the nephew.</p><p></p><p>"It's all my fault! The family finally hired the reclusive mountain doctor, Master Yu, at a sky-high price to get a divine pill."</p><p></p><p>"My parents wanted to have another doctor come to thoroughly inspect the pill before giving it to my second uncle."</p><p></p><p>"But I've been with my second uncle at the martial arts school for many years, and his health has been deteriorating. There was no time to wait."</p><p></p><p>"So this morning, I stole the pill and gave it to my second uncle, gave it to my second uncle..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu said through his tears.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, he had given the divine pill to the beggar monk, who was not fit to take it! Fang Yu angrily slapped his thigh, frustrated, "You couldn't have just waited for me to take his life, and then feed him the pill? Since he's going to die anyway!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes! I need to find the master! He must have a way to save him! He must have a way to save him!!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Lin Wu didn't wait for Fang Yu's response and dashed out of the warehouse, disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the warehouse, only Fang Yu remained, along with a corpse.</p><p></p><p>Drip, he suddenly heard a sound.</p><p></p><p>"Nephew..."</p><p></p><p>It was a feeble, raspy voice, as if the speaker was about to take their last breath.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Fang Yu's pupils dilated, and the surroundings seemed to stretch and distort like a camera lens, with only his wide eyes fixed intently on the darkness ahead.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he could make out the blurred outline of an old man crawling towards him with great difficulty.</p><p></p><p>【Lin Wotian: 2/1200.】</p><p></p><p>The health bar appeared.</p><p></p><p>His body was trembling.</p><p></p><p>An uncontrollable surge of excitement welled up in Fang Yu's heart.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu strode over.</p><p></p><p>Daring pill! Leave that beggar monk alone! Let me handle this!!</p><p></p><p>Thump, thump, thump! In the darkness, a figure quickly approached Lin Wotian.</p><p></p><p>As Lin Wotian looked up in a daze.</p><p></p><p>The pain of the pill's corrosion caused a new number to appear on his head. -1.</p><p></p><p>Through his blurred vision, he thought he saw a young figure.</p><p></p><p>"Nephew..."</p><p></p><p>Bam!!</p><p></p><p>A palm-sized fist suddenly descended upon his head.</p><p></p><p>A sharp pain.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wotian collapsed to the ground, sinking into eternal darkness. -1!</p><p></p><p>The feather-light number slowly emerged.</p><p></p><p>【Lin Wotian: 0/1200.】</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【From Elemental Body White Shadow Leg [Not Yet Entered the Door] to Elemental Body White Shadow Leg [Initial Glimpse of the Path].】</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the next moment, Fang Yu's leg muscles slightly bulged.</p><p></p><p>Under the strengthening of the Elemental Body Fundamental Cultivation, the bones of his thighs and calves were further specialized and reinforced.</p><p></p><p>If one were to observe carefully, they would notice that the muscle lines on Fang Yu's thighs under his pants had become much smoother and more natural.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu could clearly feel that his legs had become more explosive.</p><p></p><p>This was a bit different from the light footwork he needed, but with the increased explosive power in his thighs, his running speed could also become faster, so Fang Yu was quite satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it could be combined with the Elemental Body Fundamental Cultivation, which felt very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>The weakness in speed had been supplemented.</p><p></p><p>The remaining task was to invest attribute points and continuously strengthen the effects.</p><p></p><p>"Not practicing anymore?"</p><p></p><p>The nearby Yuan Hongxin, seeing that Fang Yu had suddenly stopped for a long time, thought that Fang Yu had given up.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've already learned it, why keep practicing?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Yuan Hongxin didn't seem to have noticed that Fang Yu had already learned it, Fang Yu didn't point it out.</p><p></p><p>"Not practicing for now."</p><p></p><p>For him, arduous practice was the most useless, it would be better to kill some demons and gain experience points to exchange for attribute points.</p><p></p><p>However, Yuan Hongxin seemed to have misunderstood something and laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're not practicing anymore. With your aptitude, in this life, you can only achieve some success in those few brute force martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ???  Do you really think my martial arts aptitude is that poor in your heart?? It seems that Yuan Hongxin also felt that his words were a bit inappropriate, so he cleared his throat.</p><p></p><p>"Let me make it clear, this is your own decision not to practice. Normally, the reward session should have ended, but... you're a bit shortchanged by not practicing."</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, if you have any problems with your cultivation, you can ask me now, and I'll try my best to answer."</p><p></p><p>Problems with cultivation? </p><p></p><p>I have the Deep Blue, with unlimited points allocation, what cultivation problems could I have? No! Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've always been puzzled, why haven't I broken through the realm after diligently cultivating for so long?"</p><p></p><p>Yes, this was Fang Yu's doubt.</p><p></p><p>He, the mighty Flower-grade Preliminary Realm expert, with a blood volume of 632.</p><p></p><p>Mastering a Flower-grade Intermediate Martial Art and two Flower-grade Preliminary Martial Arts, and the proficiency was not low.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't his hard power stronger than Qi Qianxuan's group of subordinates? Why haven't I broken through yet?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu asked this question very naturally and righteously.</p><p></p><p>But these words almost made Yuan Hongxin laugh in anger.</p><p></p><p>"Ignorant! How ignorant!"</p><p></p><p>"You've only just entered the door and learned the Elemental Body Fundamental Cultivation, and you think you're invincible? You don't know how poor your aptitude is... you know it yourself!"</p><p></p><p>"In short, your current accumulation is still far from enough to reach the level of realm breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Is my current accumulation not enough?</p><p></p><p>I feel like I can kill those Tiger Stake Fist practicing seniors with a single punch!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Then how do I need to do to advance to the next realm?"</p><p></p><p>"How to do it? Start from the basics. Diligently study and practice, exercise your physique, and strengthen your qi and blood..."</p><p></p><p>Oh...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu understood.</p><p></p><p>Physique is the key!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at his physique attribute.</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 3.2.】</p><p></p><p>It seems to have been stuck at 3 points for a long time?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>It can't be helped, attribute points can be used in martial arts, investing in physique feels like a waste.</p><p></p><p>Just a little bit in martial arts, the effect is immediate, but how much can be added to physique?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, now he is already a 600-plus blood monster, so he is even more indifferent to the physique attribute.</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hearing what Yuan Hongxin said, it seemed that... the physical attribute still needed to be improved, right? Fang Yu asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>"About what level of physique is needed to break through?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll feel it yourself when you're close to a breakthrough. When you're about to break through, your whole body will be surging with qi and blood, and you'll have a sense of 'no breakthrough, no advancement.' At that time, just make a concerted effort and attack the realm, and you'll basically succeed."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Yuan Hongxin glanced at Fang Yu: "You're still at the initial stage of the Flower Realm, just standing at the starting point of the martial dao, so as long as you're willing to put in the effort, your physique can grow rapidly."</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty lies in the other requirement for breaking through the realm."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately perked up his ears to listen.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the biggest harvest from this punishment of standing in the main hall was not learning the [Yuan Body White Shadow Kick], but knowing how to break through the realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have been groping in the dark, not knowing what it takes to break through the realm.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he hadn't wasted his attribute points, and now they could be put to use.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fang Yu's attentive attitude, Yuan Hongxin also began to explain in detail.</p><p></p><p>"A person's martial arts strength is divided into two parts."</p><p></p><p>"One is physique."</p><p></p><p>"The other is martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"As for weapons, hidden weapons, and the like, that's a different matter."</p><p></p><p>"For a martial artist to break through from the initial stage of the Flower Realm to the middle stage of the Flower Realm..."</p><p></p><p>"First, you must refine your personal physique to the extreme of the current level."</p><p></p><p>"Use medicines or special training methods to maximize the activation of the qi and blood throughout the body, and then temper the body to strengthen the physique."</p><p></p><p>"When you reach the extreme, you'll feel it yourself."</p><p></p><p>"But an extreme physique alone cannot help you complete the realm breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>"You also need the help of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"To break through from the initial stage of the Flower Realm to the middle stage of the Flower Realm, you must learn at least three martial arts at the initial stage of the Flower Realm, and at least reach the [Initial Glimpse of the Path] level."</p><p></p><p>"Or you can specialize in one martial art, improve it to the [Reaching the Transformed Realm] level, and through repeated tempering, raise that martial art from the initial stage of the Flower Realm to the middle stage of the Flower Realm, which would be equivalent to three lower-level martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't recommend specializing in one martial art for improvement."</p><p></p><p>"First, it's easy to leave a weak point, and you'll be easily controlled by the enemy when you encounter it."</p><p></p><p>"After all, multiple martial arts mean multiple methods."</p><p></p><p>"Second, this path requires talent."</p><p></p><p>"Mastering a martial art may not be difficult at the entry level."</p><p></p><p>"But to practice it to the [Reaching the Transformed Realm] level, the difficulty is beyond what an ordinary person can achieve. Without sufficient martial arts talent to support it, you'll never be able to break through that martial art to a higher realm in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"So the easiest way for you to break through the realm is to learn three martial arts at the initial stage of the Flower Realm, master them to the entry level, and then refine your physique to the extreme of your body during this process, and you can then smoothly break through."</p><p></p><p>After this lengthy explanation, Fang Yu suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>He immediately knew where his problem was.</p><p></p><p>It was the physique!</p><p></p><p>The physique attribute was not improved, so although his martial arts had been constantly improving, and he had even reached the breakthrough requirements early on, there was no response at all.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly asked again without shame, and Yuan Hongxin answered one by one.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Fang Yu came to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>For the initial stage of the Flower Realm to break through, there are two conditions:</p><p></p><p>Physique: Try to raise it as high as possible.</p><p>Martial Arts: 3 martial arts of the same level at the entry level, or 1 martial art at the middle stage of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, Fang Yu had already met the martial arts requirements, and even exceeded them.</p><p></p><p>So now, the only thing he needs to do is one thing.</p><p></p><p>Raise the physique! "You can ponder it slowly, the martial dao path is still far away."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin said so much and was also a bit tired.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and left.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>His attention had already turned to the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>Deep blue, add points!

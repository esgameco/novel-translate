        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This scene seemed familiar to her.</p><p></p><p>When she first entered the martial arts school, she was also gambling with her eyes red, emptying her family's savings.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that her aptitude was not bad, and she entered the door on the fifth bowl.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Fang Yu, this amount of money might not be enough.</p><p></p><p>She clapped her hands and asked another shijie to bring the medicinal soup.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately drank a bowl eagerly.</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Player has consumed [Yuan Family Medicinal Soup], experience +5.]</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ??? Why is it only 5 experience points?</p><p></p><p>The second bowl is half-priced, huh? So stingy!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu gritted his teeth and closed his eyes to sense the effects.</p><p></p><p>This time, with the experience, he soon opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal effect has passed.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Shi Jingmei asked.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu remained silent, shook his head, and drank the medicine.</p><p></p><p>Gulp, gulp, gulp.</p><p></p><p>As if in a fit of pique, Fang Yu drank it loudly.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal soup entered his stomach.</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Player has consumed [Yuan Family Medicinal Soup], experience +2.]</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, sensing the effects.</p><p></p><p>After a while.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Speechless, what kind of useless medicinal soup is this? Does it really have any effect? Could it be that Senior Sister Mei is tricking me?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was full of suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you looking at me like that?"</p><p></p><p>This expression doesn't seem like she's trying to deceive me.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mei, can I get an advance on next month's medicinal soup?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Jingmei shook her head.</p><p></p><p>What should he do?</p><p></p><p>The next bowl costs 4 taels of silver.</p><p></p><p>Go back and ask Second Sister for money? That would be too embarrassing, right? He had just left behind 5 taels of silver for living expenses, and now he's going back to ask for money.</p><p></p><p>He can't afford to lose face like that.</p><p></p><p>But... if he goes to earn money now, he has nowhere to earn it.</p><p></p><p>As for waiting until next month's medicinal soup, the mustard greens would have already wilted by then.</p><p></p><p>If he doesn't seize the opportunity now to widen the gap with most players, his slight advantage will be gone in a month.</p><p></p><p>Should he go back and ask Xiao Qianzhen for money... if he does that, he himself would want to delete his account and quit the game, his face would be too embarrassed to show.</p><p></p><p>Just as Fang Yu was at a loss on how to scrape together the money, Shi Jingmei suddenly spoke up with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"I can't give you an advance on next month's medicinal soup, but I can give you my share of this month's soup."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I can also use the monthly free medicinal soup of other shixiong and shijie and give it to you."</p><p></p><p>What? There's such a good thing?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought he had misheard.</p><p></p><p>Rounding it off, isn't that freeloading? What a wonderful woman.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she has fallen for me at first sight? Fang Yu thought his character wasn't that handsome.</p><p></p><p>Charisma, it must be his personal charm!</p><p></p><p>Slap! Fang Yu grabbed Shi Jingmei's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mei, I will definitely not let you down!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Jingmei's brows furrowed coldly as she withdrew her jade hand.</p><p></p><p>Eh? Eh eh eh eh!</p><p></p><p>This reaction.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... I misunderstood??</p><p></p><p>She doesn't like me?</p><p></p><p>Then why is she being so good to me, giving me free medicinal soup? "Let me make it clear, the medicinal soup is given to you with a condition."</p><p></p><p>Ah! Of course, there's no free lunch in the world.</p><p></p><p>I'm not a handsome gentleman that everyone would chase after.</p><p></p><p>Everything has a price.</p><p></p><p>"What condition?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Jingmei said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"It's very simple, I want the meat dumpling in your three meals a day."</p><p></p><p>"Three meals a day, three meat dumplings, equivalent to one tael of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Calculate the value in silver taels to exchange for the medicinal soup share."</p><p></p><p>"Your next bowl of medicinal soup, if obtained from the master, would cost 4 taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Converted to meat dumplings, that would be 4 days' worth, a total of 12 dumplings."</p><p></p><p>"The meat dumplings obtained from you will be divided among us who provide the medicinal soup."</p><p></p><p>"Do you accept this condition?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Jingmei explained it clearly, but Fang Yu had a blank expression.</p><p></p><p>"Meat dumplings?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei seemed to have been prepared in advance and never cheated anyone. </p><p></p><p>All transactions were fair and voluntary.</p><p></p><p>She took out a brocade box from her bosom and opened it.</p><p></p><p>Inside was a completely white meat ball, covered with black veins, twitching and pulsing like a living creature.</p><p></p><p>The brocade box seemed to have a heat-preserving effect. </p><p></p><p>The meat ball was still emitting a fragrant aroma, as if it had just been cooked through.</p><p></p><p>"This brocade box is something I specially bought, called the 'Warm Food Brocade', which can preserve the best taste and quality of the food as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>"As for the meat ball in the box, it is the one that provides our three meals a day, called the 'Yuanxin Meat Ball'."</p><p></p><p>"The main ingredient of the Yuanxin Meat Ball is the flesh and blood of demons, cooked through a special secret method of the martial arts school. It has a great nourishing effect on martial artists..."</p><p></p><p>When talking about the Yuanxin Meat Ball, Shi Zhuangmei had a somewhat intoxicated expression. </p><p></p><p>Every time the fragrance of the meat ball entered her nose, there was a sense of deep satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>But soon, she noticed that Fang Yu had a dazed expression, staring with eyes wide open, as if unable to believe what he was seeing, his face full of astonishment and shock.</p><p></p><p>Because, in Fang Yu's eyes, </p><p></p><p>the meat ball in Shi Zhuangmei's hand had a completely different name.</p><p></p><p>【Drill Heart Demon: 0.1/0.1】</p><p></p><p>Meat ball... has a health bar? And what kind of demon is this? What's with the 0.1 health?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stiffly looked at Shi Zhuangmei.</p><p></p><p>"Mei... Senior Sister, is this some new pet?"</p><p></p><p>"What pet? You've never seen it before. The Yuanxin Meat Ball may look a bit strange, but it has a great nourishing effect on martial artists. Just watch!"</p><p></p><p>Before Fang Yu could stop her, Shi Zhuangmei had already swallowed the Yuanxin Meat Ball in one gulp! Ling ling ling ling--</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Fang Yu's pupils dilated, accompanied by a bell-like resonance sound, revealing a scene that he would almost never forget.</p><p></p><p>The moment Mei Senior Sister swallowed the Yuanxin Meat Ball, countless short blood bars almost simultaneously popped out from within her body.</p><p></p><p>Her entire body was instantly obscured by the densely packed blood bars, to the point that her face could no longer be seen! And the most horrifying thing was that all the blood bars in her body had the same name: 【Drill Heart Demon: 0.1/0.1】</p><p></p><p>【Drill Heart Demon: 0.1/0.1】</p><p>【Drill Heart Demon: 0.1/0.1】</p><p>【Drill Heart Demon: 0.1/0.1】</p><p></p><p>Hundreds, thousands, tens of thousands of Drill Heart Demons, like parasites, were densely parasitizing inside Mei Senior Sister's body! Twitching like living creatures, emitting a faint ling ling sound, forming a resonance.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Fang Yu felt as if he saw countless tiny insects crawling out and into Mei Senior Sister's skin pores, turning her into a nest of insects!</p><p></p><p>This was no longer a human, </p><p></p><p>but a person composed of insects!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pointed at his senior sister, frightened, and retreated a step, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You... you..."</p><p></p><p>"Did you hear that? The Yuanxin Resonance! This is the effect of the Yuanxin Meat Ball, causing a resonance of yuan qi, thereby strengthening the flesh and blood!"</p><p></p><p>The bell sound disappeared, and the densely packed blood bars on Shi Zhuangmei's body also gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu finally saw Shi Zhuangmei's intoxicated expression.</p><p></p><p>She really didn't know anything at all!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's breathing became rapid.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing the wonderful sensation of the meat ball, Shi Zhuangmei now glanced at the sitting Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>With a sigh, she came over to help Fang Yu up.</p><p></p><p>But the moment she took a step towards Fang Yu, he frantically backed away, distancing himself with his hands and feet.</p><p></p><p>"What are you going to do?!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm just helping you up, what's wrong with you?" Shi Zhuangmei was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at Shi Zhuangmei's own health bar.</p><p></p><p>【Shi Zhuangmei: 150/150】</p><p></p><p>After assessing the current strength difference between them, Fang Yu quickly calmed his emotions and forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Why am I here? Was I here to learn martial arts? Why does it feel like I've poked a hornet's nest of demons?</p><p></p><p>"Then how about the previous condition? Trading the Yuanxin Meat Ball for three meals a day in exchange for medicinal soup, are you still willing?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

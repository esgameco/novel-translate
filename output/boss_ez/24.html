        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He didn't even dare to eat this thing!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also realized a problem.</p><p></p><p>That is, when this [Drill Demon] is hidden inside the human body, before it triggers resonance, he cannot see the blood bar.</p><p></p><p>Only after triggering the resonance can it be detected and the blood bar displayed, its hiding ability is far beyond that of ordinary demons.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Fang Yu imagined a terrifying scene.</p><p></p><p>After he joined the sect, one day when he went to the cafeteria to eat with his senior brothers, if all the senior brothers' bodies started resonating with the densely packed [Drill Demons], that scene would be absolutely horrifying! Fang Yu shuddered, but Shi Chuangmei was very happy and said, "If that's the case, I'll have someone bring the medicinal soup."</p><p></p><p>The medicinal soup arrived, but Fang Yu hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"What ingredients are in this medicinal soup?"</p><p></p><p>"This is the master's secret formula, how could I tell you?"</p><p></p><p>"...Does it contain demonic blood and flesh?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei looked at Fang Yu suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>"You're not from the Li family trying to steal our sect's formula, are you?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not the case!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stirred the medicinal soup with his finger and didn't see anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>It seems the medicinal soup is just ordinary soup.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu was still a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>After all, Shi Chuangmei's body covered in bugs was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to become like that either.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Fang Yu looked at Shi Chuangmei.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mei, do other sects also have medicinal soups and meat pills?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei said,</p><p></p><p>"Medicinal soups are available in every sect, this is the basic medicinal supplement for martial artists. Without this to assist, it would be extremely difficult to enter the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"In ancient times, the number of martial artists was small, precisely because there was no such systematic medicinal soup support, ordinary people found it hard to step into the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"Now the martial dao is flourishing, and every sect has medicinal soups, at most the formulas have slightly different focuses."</p><p></p><p>It seems the Yuanxin meat pills are the specialty of your sect.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back, after drinking the medicinal soup, he didn't see any blood bars popping up in his body, so it should be fine.</p><p></p><p>Everyone says my talent is poor.</p><p></p><p>Combined with my relatively advanced age, and the fact that I've already paid the tuition to the Yuanti Sect.</p><p></p><p>Although I'm not completely broke, but I don't have enough money to join another sect.</p><p></p><p>And once you've joined a sect and become a disciple, there's no just leaving as you please.</p><p></p><p>With all these conditions, the best option for Fang Yu in the short term is still here.</p><p></p><p>Either cultivate martial arts here, or waste time here waiting for the right opportunity to leave the sect.</p><p></p><p>But that means this period of time will be wasted, allowing other players to catch up.</p><p></p><p>Since I can see the blood bars, I'll just be extra careful in various aspects.</p><p></p><p>As for finding Li Qianhuan and exposing the Yuanti Sect, without finding a powerful backer first, that would be courting death.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanti Sect has been in Tianyuan Town for so long without incident, maybe they have someone backing them up.</p><p></p><p>Acting rashly would not be appropriate.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, the key is to strengthen myself, only then can I stand firm.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Fang Yu thought through a lot.</p><p></p><p>After confirming the medicinal soup is basically fine, he drank it down in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>This is Fang Yu's third bowl of medicinal soup, aside from the free ones.</p><p></p><p>Worth... 4 days' worth of meat pills! [System Prompt: Player has consumed [Yuanfamily Medicinal Soup], Experience +1.]</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes, he focused.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Failed.</p><p></p><p>But, no foreign body sensation, no bugs, no blood bars, can continue.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at Shi Chuangmei, or made an 'eight' gesture.</p><p></p><p>The fourth bowl, 8 days' worth of meat pills! Served, drank down.</p><p></p><p>Closed his eyes, savored it.</p><p></p><p>Failed, but felt the Qi.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the medicinal effect is dissipating faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Player has consumed [Yuanfamily Medicinal Soup], Experience +0.]</p><p></p><p>No more experience? Fang Yu didn't pay much attention, he was focused on savoring it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu roughly understood why some people can never enter the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal soup can stimulate the body to perceive the external Qi.</p><p></p><p>But the human body has drug tolerance.</p><p></p><p>The more times the medicinal soup is consumed, the shorter the perception time provided by the medicinal effect, the more slim the chance of stepping into the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Refill."</p><p></p><p>"16 taels, that is, 16 days' worth of meat pills."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The fifth bowl was served up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu gulped down the food quickly and effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Failure.</p><p></p><p>But... he was only one step away from success! He could sense the qi and guide the qi, but he failed at the final step of drawing the qi into his body.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>"Bring me another bowl, I'm sure I can succeed this time," Fang Yu said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"You've already exceeded the limit," Shi Chuangmei shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you the meatballs for next month as well!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei hesitated a bit, then Fang Yu continued.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you the meatballs for the next three months!"</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't eat them! He absolutely refused to eat them!</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei was skeptical: "Are you sure? Can you afford the meal fees?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu smiled: "You know how I started out."</p><p></p><p>The Ritual Family!</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>"Three months, a total of 180 meatballs, worth 90 taels. You've already used up 28 taels, the next bowl of medicinal soup is worth 32 taels."</p><p></p><p>The medicinal soup Shi Chuangmei had was completely equivalent to the one from the Martial Arts Hall. </p><p></p><p>One bowl was worth more than the other.</p><p></p><p>The only difference was that she could use the daily meal allowance meatballs as silver taels to exchange for the medicinal soup.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just six people each contributing a free monthly bowl of soup, due to this rule, the value had multiplied dozens of times.</p><p></p><p>This was essentially snatching business from the internal Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, but since Shi Chuangmei was doing it so openly, it was clear that no one was managing this, and it was a blind eye to let people earn extra income.</p><p></p><p>Since Fang Yu didn't eat the meatballs, he didn't really care about this.</p><p></p><p>The sixth bowl of medicinal soup was brought over.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately gulped it down.</p><p></p><p>Sensing, guiding the qi, entering the body.</p><p></p><p>Seamless! Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt his body shudder.</p><p></p><p>From head to toe, it was as if the entire body had suddenly been connected like an electrical circuit, forming a slight resonance!</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique was mastered!</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player has learned the Flower-level cultivation technique "Yuanti Stabilizing Technique", experience +50.]</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Experience value has broken through 100, converted to 1 attribute point.]</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player has broken through the shackles and advanced to the Initial Flower Realm, Physique +0.5, Spirit +0.5.]</p><p></p><p>He did it!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He was confident that this first step into the martial arts path had directly set him apart from 99% of the players!</p><p></p><p>No matter what tricks or evil ways the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall had, as long as it could help people enter the martial arts, it was a good hall!</p><p></p><p>He opened the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>【Name: Diao Deyi.】</p><p>【Realm: Initial Flower Realm.】</p><p>【Health: 22/22.】</p><p>【Physique: 2.2.】+【Spirit: 1.7.】+【Skills: Digital Life [Human], Yuanti Stabilizing Technique [Flower/Initial Mastery]+.】</p><p>【Attribute Points: 3.】</p><p>【Experience: 18/100.】</p><p></p><p>A huge improvement! Fang Yu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but take a second look.</p><p></p><p>Then, he suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>Because behind the "Yuanti Stabilizing Technique", there was a "+" sign.</p><p></p><p>Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu clicked on it.</p><p></p><p>【Attribute Points: 3→2.】</p><p>【Yuanti Stabilizing Technique [Initial Mastery]→Yuanti Stabilizing Technique [Slight Mastery].】</p><p></p><p>A warm current swept through his entire body, his bones creaking, and his strength seemed to have increased by another level.</p><p></p><p>Ah? Attribute points, can they be used to improve martial arts? Fang Yu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the detailed description of the cultivation technique again.</p><p></p><p>【Skill Name: Yuanti Stabilizing Technique.】</p><p>【Skill Description: Refine the body with yuan qi, comprehensively enhance defense and attack.】</p><p>【Skill Proficiency: Slight Mastery [0/300].】</p><p></p><p>Enhance defense and attack, but not reflected in Physique? </p><p></p><p>It felt rather vague.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought for a moment, then came to the table on the left side of the hall and slammed his fist down.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The table was destroyed, with wood chips flying everywhere. Fang Yu, however, revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>The soft punch he had before was now full of power! If the table had a health bar, the damage it would have taken would be at least 3 points or more!

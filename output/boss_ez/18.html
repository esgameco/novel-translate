        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"How are the demonic powers classified?"</p><p></p><p>"Cold, hot, withered, flourishing - the four realms. The demonic being we encountered today is a low-level Cold realm demon. Demonic beings are inherently stronger than us humans, so even the lowest-level Cold realm demon is not something we can easily contend with."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up at Li Qianxuan's health bar.</p><p></p><p>"Then what is Lord Li's strength level?"</p><p></p><p>"Flower realm, middle stage." Li Qianxuan did not hide it, and spoke frankly.</p><p></p><p>Flower realm, middle stage, would have around 100 HP, maximum damage over 100 with critical hits, and normal damage around 50 or so?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu roughly had a data template.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, he as an ordinary person is truly the weakest of the weak.</p><p></p><p>After all, he must become a martial artist as soon as possible, or his days will not be easy.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Fang Yu had one more question he wanted to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, you only mentioned the four realms of plants and trees, so I wonder what the 'human' realm is?"</p><p></p><p>"Human realm?" </p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan paused for a moment, then shook his head slightly: "There is no such thing as a 'human' realm. If you insist on saying it, all of our martial arts are within the human realm, all within the human category."</p><p></p><p>What does this mean? Fang Yu wondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since the system has provided 'human' level skills, that should mean there is such a level. </p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan does not know, could it be that the 'human' realm is above the Flower realm? Fang Yu did not think too much about it, and just said:</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, if I want to join the Yuanti Martial Arts Academy, what price must I pay?"</p><p></p><p>"As far as I know, the entry fee for the Yuanti Martial Arts Academy is ten taels of silver, and thereafter a monthly fee of two taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Yu felt his pockets, only to find them empty.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention ten taels of silver, he couldn't even produce a single coin.</p><p></p><p>Given his background, it would be difficult for him to even find a hundred coins.</p><p></p><p>This action made Li Qianxuan chuckle.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you have merit in slaying the demon, so the Underworld Office has awarded you ten taels of silver as a reward. And since you also saved my subordinates and I, I will privately give you another ten taels, so you will have a total of twenty taels, enough for you to enter the academy and cover the first few months' expenses. After that, you'll have to rely on yourself."</p><p></p><p>Having said that, Li Qianxuan got up from the bed, went to the table, picked up a letter that had already been written and a bag of silver, and handed them to Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"This is a recommendation letter I've written for you. You can submit it to Yuan Hongxin, and he should accept you. The twenty taels of silver are also in here, you don't need to go to the hall to collect it."</p><p></p><p>What a smooth arrangement!</p><p></p><p>Did he anticipate that I would definitely agree? Thinking about it again, Fang Yu felt that the other party was just making extra preparations, so that he wouldn't have to write a recommendation letter on the spot later.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan had arranged everything so thoughtfully for him, so how could Fang Yu say anything else? No matter how it was, Li Qianxuan's arrangement made Fang Yu quite grateful.</p><p></p><p>He immediately thanked him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Li!"</p><p></p><p>"No need for such formalities, just focus on your cultivation and come back to assist me when you have made progress."</p><p></p><p>The two did not bring up the reward and repayment that Li Qianxuan had mentioned earlier.</p><p></p><p>Because this arrangement was actually Li Qianxuan's way of repaying him.</p><p></p><p>For Fang Yu, to ask for anything else would be greedy.</p><p></p><p>For Li Qianxuan, he also couldn't give Fang Yu too much.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts cannot be taught.</p><p>Wealth cannot be given too much, lest it becomes a burden.</p><p>As for position and the like, Fang Yu did not seem like the type to be content with the ordinary, so there was no need to mention it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu took the items, and was about to leave, but suddenly remembered something and turned back to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, there's one more thing, do you know what 'spirit' is?"</p><p></p><p>"Spirit? Cultivating one's qi is cultivating one's spirit, I suppose. After practicing martial arts for a long time, your spirit will naturally be full and abundant. Hmm... but that may not be quite right. I don't know, you should ask the Taoist priest or monk in the town, we martial artists don't really care about things like spiritual tranquility and the like."</p><p></p><p>Indeed, we martial artists...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The martial arts person is skilled in exorcising evil spirits through physical means.</p><p></p><p>As for Taoist priests and Buddhist monks... I'll try to find someone to ask about that later.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Fang Yu felt a bit embarrassed to ask.</p><p></p><p>"There's one more thing, Lord Li, how can I reattach my head back onto my own neck?"</p><p></p><p>"Matters of curses are something that Taoist priests and Buddhist monks specialize in. I'm afraid I can't be of much help. How about you find a tailor to sew your head back on? After all, it's just a separation of the body, not actual death, so it should be fine to just sew it back on."</p><p></p><p>Would that work? It sounds a bit unreliable when you hear it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that even Lord Li Qianxuan didn't know, Fang Yu didn't ask any further.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu prepared to take his leave, and Lord Li Qianxuan politely had a servant escort him back by carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know where I live?"</p><p></p><p>"I've looked into some information about you." Lord Li Qianxuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>That's great then! After all, Fang Yu himself didn't even know where his own home was.</p><p></p><p>Following the servant, Fang Yu quickly got into the carriage and left the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Yu left, the steward of Lord Li's residence entered the room.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the silver and letters that had already fallen to the ground, and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The thirty-seventh one?"</p><p></p><p>"The thirty-seventh one. Make a note of it," Lord Li Qianxuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Master, with this much money being spent, when will we see results?" the steward asked, bowing his head.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, there will eventually be heroes emerging from the young. They have caught my eye, and I trust my own judgment. One day, I will have a group of outstanding talents that I can trust by my side," Lord Li Qianxuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that investing in such promising young people was not the first time he had done so.</p><p></p><p>The steward shook his head slightly, took out the list, and wrote down the name Diao De Yi.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, a carriage headed towards Sweet Flower Alley.</p><p></p><p>Inside the carriage, Fang Yu, feeling the real bumps, concluded that he wouldn't ride in a carriage next time.</p><p></p><p>Opening the status panel, he summarized the gains of the day.</p><p></p><p>First, the spiritual attribute was temporarily unclear and could be left unallocated.</p><p></p><p>The physique was the basic HP, only representing physical fitness.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts, on the other hand, were the fundamental source of damage output.</p><p></p><p>In other words, physique was like defense, while martial arts were the attack power.</p><p></p><p>Having just physique alone would make one a mere "blood cow" with a long health bar but no real significance.</p><p></p><p>One must also develop the corresponding martial arts to unleash damage commensurate with the health pool.</p><p></p><p>That's why in the prison, his increased physique didn't translate to higher damage.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, there was an increase, but it was very minimal.</p><p></p><p>"Martial arts are the key!"</p><p></p><p>The martial arts of the Foolish Underworld could not be learned without joining.</p><p></p><p>Other places were even more difficult to find places to train.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall was the most suitable place.</p><p></p><p>"Rest for the night, and tomorrow when the martial arts hall opens, I'll go and find a master to learn from!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had a clear goal.</p><p></p><p>If he learned martial arts, he would have damage output, and with damage output, he could take on jobs, and with the jobs, he could earn money to contribute to the funeral expenses for Old Master Zhou.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his current state, he couldn't even scrape together much money.</p><p></p><p>Character Diao De Yi's home was in Sweet Flower Alley in the town of Tian Yuan.</p><p></p><p>Sweet Flower Alley was a well-known impoverished area in the town, where all kinds of people lived - criminals hiding, the poor residing, and troublemakers taking refuge. The environment could be described as very poor, but at least it was still a place to live. Beyond Sweet Flower Alley, it would be sleeping on the streets.</p><p></p><p>"Phew--"</p><p></p><p>The coachman pulled the reins, and the carriage stopped in front of a dilapidated house.</p><p></p><p>"Are we here?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we're here."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

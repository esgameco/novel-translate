        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What? People from the Foolish Underworld have come?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, stay away, these people are crazy! Don't let their blood stain us."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked ahead and saw a group of people charging towards them, each carrying swords and bows, tall and burly.</p><p></p><p>Among them, one was riding a horse, clearly the leader.</p><p></p><p>[Li Qian Xuan: 100/100]</p><p></p><p>Damn!</p><p></p><p>Three-digit health bar! Looking at the rest of the group, most of them had 30-40 points of health, with three even having 60-70 points - they were clearly no ordinary people. There was only one person who looked younger, with just over 10 points of health, seeming like an outsider.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart raced.</p><p></p><p>Although the highest health was 100 for Li Qian Xuan, the sheer number of them, nearly 30, was daunting.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the young man in white was so afraid of this force!</p><p></p><p>"My lord!"</p><p></p><p>Before Fang Yu could say anything, the young man in white had already knelt down and kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Where's the backbone of a man? Has he completely given up?</p><p></p><p>"Lord Qi Shi, please speak up for me, that Diao De Yi..."</p><p></p><p>The young man was about to continue, but Li Qian Xuan raised a finger to his lips, gesturing him to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>The young man immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>If Fang Yu couldn't see the health bars, he would have thought Li Qian Xuan was the real monster.</p><p></p><p>[Li Bai Gu: 785.2/1000]</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the young man's health, apart from the two hundred points lost when his arms were broken, the rest was just a drizzle.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these people could keep this guy in check, or else Fang Yu would have had to start over.</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan rode his horse past the two of them and approached Tu Gou Dan, who was currently pinned to the ground, his leg pierced by an arrow.</p><p></p><p>[Tu Gou Dan: 2/8]</p><p></p><p>The arrow didn't kill Tu Gou Dan, but it had immobilized him, causing him to let out cries of pain, completely losing the crazed momentum he had earlier.</p><p></p><p>"Stop howling. I saw you just now, rampaging on the street and chasing that person. Do you have any defense?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan sat on his horse, looking down at Tu Gou Dan with a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>"I was just punishing the evil..."</p><p></p><p>Swish!!</p><p></p><p>Before Tu Gou Dan could finish his sentence, a sword flashed across his neck, and his head rolled to the ground.</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't even blink, and the sword had already passed.</p><p></p><p>[Tu Gou Dan: 0/8]</p><p></p><p>Blood splattered everywhere, and the onlookers let out a chorus of startled cries. But the other people from the Foolish Underworld seemed unfazed, simply letting Tu Gou Dan's headless body fall to the ground. Dealing with the corpse was not their responsibility; someone else would handle the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan then rode his horse to stand in front of Fang Yu and the young man in white.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's your turn. You first, and remember, I don't like to hear nonsense, so be concise and clear."</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan's gaze was fixed on Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt his spirits lift. Although he didn't kneel, his backbone had been recognized by someone.</p><p></p><p>"Let me speak, Lord Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"I have two points to make. First, the owner and all the employees of the pharmacy, including Wang Er and the others, were all killed by Li Bai Gu!"</p><p></p><p>"Second, Li Bai Gu is pretending to be a harmless person, but his identity is definitely suspicious!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu took the initiative, directly stating the key points.</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan only slightly furrowed his brow, then asked a question.</p><p></p><p>"You've said it well, but I have a question for you. How could a young man who just had his arms broken manage to kill more than a dozen people at the pharmacy?"</p><p></p><p>"So, he must have been hiding his true strength! Lord Qi, it's like this..."</p><p></p><p>"Enough, make him shut up."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Just as Fang Yu was about to continue, a hand reached out and struck him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He pressed his hand over his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu still wanted to struggle, but the icy sharp blade was already pressed against his neck, and Fang Yu's heart immediately panicked.</p><p></p><p>He looked left and right.</p><p></p><p>【Nong Chao: 15/15.】</p><p>【Nong Han: 31/31.】</p><p></p><p>This Nong Chao was the one with only a dozen or so health points at the bottom of the team he had seen earlier, a boy around thirteen or fourteen years old.</p><p></p><p>The other person was a team member with over thirty health points.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were holding Fang Yu's shoulders, one on each side, preventing him from moving.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly regretted it, wishing he had shouted a few more supplementary details, all because that Li Qianxuan didn't give him a chance and insisted on a concise speech.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's your turn."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Li Qianxuan approached the white-robed youth, the guy was already almost out of tears, his acting skills were excellent, far surpassing a fresh-faced newcomer.</p><p></p><p>Since the person was already kneeling, the white-robed youth had already been frantically kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>When he raised his head again, there were bloodstains on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>After starting with the kowtowing, his emotions seemed to be in place, and he cursed Fang Yu with tears streaming down his face.</p><p></p><p>"Please, Lord Li, stand up for me!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the son of the owner of the medicine shop. On my way home today, the people from the gambling den rushed into the medicine shop, first killing the assistant, then killing my father and mother, and severing my two arms. If it weren't for their internal strife over the assets in my home, allowing me to find a chance to escape, I would have died just as miserably in the medicine shop."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what happened to the other henchmen after the internal strife, but Jiao De was the last one to chase out of the medicine shop!"</p><p></p><p>"My father and mother were also killed by him! Please, Lord Li, stand up for me! Please, the Foolish Underworld, stand up for me!"</p><p></p><p>The white-robed youth wept bitterly, kowtowing twice more.</p><p></p><p>This gritted teeth and passionate performance, if Fang Yu didn't know the truth, he would have been deceived by this guy's performance.</p><p></p><p>No, why do you need this acting skill? You're a freaking big shot with thousands of health points! Bro, don't play dirty tricks! Can't we fight openly and honestly?!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was angry, he had been framed, slandered, and most importantly, it seemed like everyone else had believed it!</p><p></p><p>Swish swish swish—</p><p></p><p>Whether the onlookers around the periphery or the members of the Foolish Underworld, the fierce gazes were all focused on Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>For heaven's sake, I'm just a newbie who just started the game, what can I do? Can I take on ten of them at once??</p><p></p><p>This is bad, this wave is really going to get me killed out of the game! The worst way to exit the game!</p><p></p><p>"Speak up! He's still a child, how can you, the henchmen from the gambling den, bring yourselves to do this!" </p><p></p><p>"Severing two arms, wiping out an entire family, and then chasing the culprit to kill and cover it up! The Black Tiger Gambling Den has gone mad, wanting to dominate with one hand, not even caring about the elders of the Foolish Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant... too arrogant! This is not just beheading on the street, I can't swallow this! Poor little Li's son, suddenly disabled in a day, not to mention losing his family, wuwuwu... I, an old man, can't bear to see a child suffer like this..."</p><p></p><p>No, brother, sister, the situation is not as you think!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu wanted to speak, but found that [Nong Chao]'s body was trembling slightly, and the knife in his hand was pressing deeper into his own neck, breaking the skin and causing fresh blood to ooze out.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of the knife slowly cutting into the flesh was not a pleasant one.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan hadn't given the order yet, don't act recklessly! Fang Yu was panicked in his heart, his gaze shifting, just in time to see the gaze Li Qianxuan cast over.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, he was not a man who believed in one-sided words either, and did not immediately order someone to kill.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu seized the opportunity and quickly shouted, "I'm the one who's been wronged! Lord Li, he's the real culprit, he's the true villain! I can stake my life that he's the one..."</p><p></p><p>Sizzle! Fang Yu's words had barely been half-said when a sharp pain suddenly burst forth from his neck, his voice abruptly cut off. -4!</p><p></p><p>Along with the appearance of a large blood character, Fang Yu's severed head flew out.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle—</p><p></p><p>The blood gushed forth, and Fang Yu's headless corpse also collapsed.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Li Qianxuan slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing that it was [Nong Chao] who had acted, he immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>There will be two more updates today, to be completed before bedtime.</p><p></p><p>This book has 5 updates per day, each with 2,000 words. Welcome to supervise.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Life: 632/632→642/642.】</p><p></p><p>【Attribute Points: 9→8.】</p><p></p><p>With one point added to Physique, Fang Yu immediately felt the fatigue from previous sword practice being replenished by a large amount.</p><p></p><p>His body also became slightly stronger.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately realized the difference between absorbing a large amount of blood from a demonic talent, and increasing Physique to gain more blood.</p><p></p><p>The blood gained from the demonic talent was like being added out of thin air - it only increased the blood volume without any other effects.</p><p></p><p>But increasing Physique is different. It not only increases blood volume, but also increases stamina, endurance, and other invisible innate attributes, thereby improving the overall physical condition - it's a comprehensive upgrade.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms:</p><p></p><p>Physique increases the character's lower limit.</p><p>Demonic talent increases the character's upper limit.</p><p>The two are actually serving different purposes, it's just that they both manifest as increasing blood volume.</p><p></p><p>After increasing Physique, Fang Yu carefully felt the changes.</p><p></p><p>The result was... </p><p>No sensation at all.</p><p></p><p>Then...</p><p></p><p>"Allocate points!"</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 4.2→5.2.】</p><p>【Attribute Points: 8→7.】</p><p></p><p>Still no sensation...</p><p>Continue!</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 5.2→7.2.】</p><p>【Attribute Points: 7→5.】</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged, and his body felt slightly warm.</p><p>Fang Yu was stunned.</p><p>Could this be the so-called sensation?</p><p>But it still seems a bit short of the limit that Yuan Hong Xin mentioned? Allocate more!</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 7.2→9.2.】</p><p>【Attribute Points: 5→3.】</p><p></p><p>Hot! Very hot!</p><p>As the attribute point decreased, the turbulence of his inner qi and blood became intense, and his skin even flushed slightly red.</p><p>However, this sensation soon subsided.</p><p>Just now, he had probably allocated too many attribute points at once, causing an overly exaggerated physical reaction.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Fang Yu hesitated and only allocated one point to Physique.</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 9.2→10.】</p><p>【Life: 692/692→700/700.】</p><p>【Attribute Points: 3→2.】</p><p></p><p>How come it consumed my 0.2 attribute...</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Detected that the player has met the promotion standard, about to break through.】</p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, the player has broken through the shackles and advanced to the Flower Realm Intermediate stage, Physique +1, Spirit +1.】</p><p></p><p>...Alright.</p><p>Although 0.2 attribute points were consumed.</p><p>But the result is still good.</p><p>The realm has successfully broken through.</p><p>And a pit has been dug, which is that in the future, breakthroughs should be attempted when Physique is an integer.</p><p>This way, the decimal points of the attributes won't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>The sensation of this breakthrough was not as strong as the breakthrough from a mortal to the Flower Realm.</p><p>It was like a smooth transition, with the body undergoing a subtle but powerful enhancement.</p><p></p><p>The 10 points in Physique have greatly increased his stamina.</p><p>Previously in battles, a few full-power strikes would leave him panting and unable to recover.</p><p>Causing him to be cautious and unable to go all out.</p><p>Now it's fine, with the increased stamina, he can fight freely and go all-out.</p><p>This also affects another aspect - he can now maintain his damage output at the maximum level.</p><p>Every strike can be delivered with full force, whether it hits or not, his stamina can now withstand such consumption.</p><p>The upper limit of his strength is still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Compared to those Flower Realm Initiate warriors who become exhausted after a few full-power attacks, Fang Yu is now far ahead.</p><p>This is probably the "dimensional strike" that a Flower Realm Intermediate warrior has over a Flower Realm Initiate warrior.</p><p></p><p>After the realm advancement, the changes in his body made Fang Yu realize the importance of Physique.</p><p>It's not just about increasing blood, but a real and substantial enhancement of overall strength.</p><p>Fang Yu is confident that his understanding of the Physique attribute is now leading all players in the game!</p><p>After all, in the game's martial path, who could have gone further than him?</p><p>Savoring the advantages of the Flower Realm Intermediate stage.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu finally realized how lopsided his previous development had been. No matter how much martial arts knowledge he had, if his physical strength was insufficient, he would be drained of energy and left to die. Conversely, if his physique was strong but his martial arts skills were too weak, he would be suppressed and have no ability to fight back. Only by advancing both aspects in tandem could a character develop in a healthy way.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu gained this insight. He opened his attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Diao De Yi]</p><p>[Realm: Mid-Flower Realm]</p><p>[Demonic Bloodline: Blue Demon Blood [Early Scorching Level]]</p><p>[Health: 710/710]</p><p>[Physique: 11] + [Spirit: 2.7] + [Human Skill: Digital Life]</p><p>[Flower Realm Skills: Primal Body Two-Zero Sword [Slight Mastery (6/300)]+, Primal Body Foundation Skill [Mid-Flower Realm (4/2000)]+, Primal Body White Shadow Leg [Initial Comprehension (1/100)+]]</p><p>[Attribute Points: 2]</p><p>[Experience: 60/100]</p><p></p><p>Just looking at the panel, the changes don't seem that significant, but the actual improvements are huge. According to Elder Hongxin, to advance from the Mid-Flower Realm to the High-Flower Realm, Fang Yu needs to continue blindly increasing his physique to the limit, and then focus on martial arts.</p><p></p><p>To advance from the Flower Realm Initiate to the Flower Realm Intermediate, he can only learn 3 Flower Realm Initiate skills or 1 Flower Realm Intermediate skill. To advance from Flower Realm Intermediate to Flower Realm Advanced, he needs 5 Flower Realm Intermediate skills or 2 Flower Realm Advanced skills.</p><p></p><p>Five Intermediate skills seem too far, but two Advanced skills might be easier. Fang Yu spent his 2 attribute points on the [Primal Body Foundation Skill], advancing it to the Flower Realm Intermediate/Initial Comprehension level.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was surprised by this rapid progress. He realized that Flower Realm Advanced was not as simple as he thought. Looking at the attribute panel, the system had automatically divided the skills into new categories.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu clenched his fist, and the sound of bones grinding against each other could be heard. Some white powder-like particles even appeared on his hand. When he swung his fists, the white powder left traces in the air, just like in those martial arts movies with masters scattering powder.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? Added special effects?" Fang Yu chuckled wryly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the setting sun's golden glow fell on his face. He realized it was getting late and the martial arts hall would soon be closing. That meant he had to leave.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked outside, the corners of his mouth turning up slightly. "You three demons, I wonder if you're still waiting for me out there!" </p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist and scattering the white powder, Fang Yu strode out towards the setting sun. But as soon as he entered the main hall, he saw the dejected Lin Wu, who seemed like a walking corpse.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu opened his mouth to say something, then closed it again. "Poor thing..." he thought. "You three demons outside, do you know what you've done? You killed Lin Wu's uncle, forcing this upright and kind-hearted person like me to make a decision that goes against my principles. Although in the end I managed to steal the head through alchemy, that head is definitely on your three demonic heads! Don't worry, Lin Wu, I, Diao De Yi, will avenge your uncle!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt a surge of righteous indignation, as if heroic music was playing in his ears. "Second Sword of the Righteous Path - Furious Slash of the Demonic!"</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

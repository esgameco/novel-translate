        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Fire Sect, 6 people dead."</p><p></p><p>"The Horizontal Sword Gate, 15 people dead."</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Bird Gate, 9 people dead."</p><p></p><p>"The Flower Mixing Gate..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"The Wine Chess Manor, 351 people dead. The entire family wiped out."</p><p></p><p>"The killer: Lian Qingjin from Lian Yun Stronghold!"</p><p></p><p>Lian Feng Huo of Lian Yun Stronghold, after reading this message, looked up at the crowd below.</p><p></p><p>"Thirteen sects."</p><p></p><p>"Six clans."</p><p></p><p>"And a major sect [Flower Fragrance Gate] that was on good terms with the Wine Chess Manor."</p><p></p><p>"All the clans and sects demand an explanation from our Lian Yun Stronghold."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll give them an explanation."</p><p></p><p>"You are the most talented disciples, my family, within the Lian Yun Stronghold."</p><p></p><p>"Now, I have only one request for you."</p><p></p><p>"Find Lian Qingjin, kill her, bring back the Nine Ancient Jade and her head, and return to me."</p><p></p><p>"According to the information, the last place Lian Qingjin was seen was in the Rolling Bone City. You must set out immediately, travel through the night, and not delay."</p><p></p><p>The crowd below responded in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!"</p><p></p><p>Standing at the very front was none other than Lian Qingjin's sister... Lian Xiaoya!</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you have committed a heinous crime!"</p><p></p><p>"This is wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"I will not kill you, just as you spared me that time."</p><p></p><p>"I will correct your misguided path, and guide you back to the righteous way!"</p><p></p><p>Lian Xiaoya seemed to see her sister being imprisoned in a secluded cliff dungeon, her appearance aging day by day until she reached old age and met a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this scene, Lian Xiaoya's face flushed red, her emotions stirred up.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to, imprison her own sister alive until death!</p><p></p><p>"Aside from the pursuit team we send from the Lian Yun Stronghold, other clans have also promised to dispatch their people. When you arrive at the location, you can find their contact persons. The local clans will provide information and manpower to assist you."</p><p></p><p>The Stronghold Master handed a note to the team leader, Lian Xiouxiang.</p><p></p><p>He was said to be the strongest in the Lian Yun Stronghold, and also a believer blessed by the Righteous Deity.</p><p></p><p>Lian Xiaoya admired him greatly.</p><p></p><p>She was full of confidence in this mission.</p><p></p><p>But the other members of the team were restless.</p><p></p><p>"I heard the traitor Lian Qingjin has believed in evil spirits?"</p><p></p><p>"Fallen! Why did she not believe in the Righteous Deity we worship in the Lian Yun Stronghold, but instead believe in the evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>"That's why she must be eliminated."</p><p></p><p>"But if she has truly believed in the spirits, she will not be an ordinary mortal that we can easily defeat. The Wine Chess Manor massacre is proof of that."</p><p></p><p>"With Lord Lian Xiouxiang here, what do we fear of those who believe in evil spirits!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the unease, doubts, and confusion, the hundred-strong team to hunt down Lian Qingjin set out.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Lian Xiouxiang's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>"One person wiped out an entire manor."</p><p></p><p>"Realm Initiate level?"</p><p></p><p>"No... it should be higher."</p><p></p><p>"I heard she has swept away all the secret treasures of the Wine Chess Manor."</p><p></p><p>"She may already be at the Realm Intermediate, or even... the Realm Advanced!"</p><p></p><p>Lian Xiaoya was completely unaware of the leader's concerns.</p><p></p><p>Growing up, this was the first time she had ventured so far from the Lian Yun Stronghold. Like a curious child, she looked around in awe, everything feeling so fresh and new to her.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>While the character Xiao Qin was desperately leveling up in the online game.</p><p></p><p>In the distant Twin Hospitals, a nurse had just gotten off work and returned home.</p><p></p><p>She walked hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Because she was very afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Wife? You're home so early today?" The man in the house spoke, but she ignored him directly.</p><p></p><p>Anxiously, she quickly walked to the bathroom, turned on the light, and stood in front of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>The nurse stared at her reflection in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>【23 hours 01 minutes 55 seconds.】</p><p></p><p>Still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In...</p><p></p><p>Still in! What is this thing? What will happen when the countdown ends? The nurse is very anxious and afraid.</p><p></p><p>An hour ago, she followed behind Dr. Zhang and confronted the medical protesters.</p><p></p><p>Then, she suddenly saw the countdown.</p><p></p><p>At the time, it was [24 hours 02 minutes 15 seconds].</p><p></p><p>She was stunned, thinking her eyes were playing tricks on her.</p><p></p><p>But after rubbing her eyes a few times, the countdown was still there, decreasing second by second.</p><p></p><p>She finally panicked and told Dr. Zhang, but Dr. Zhang was busy arguing with the protesting patient and had no time for her.</p><p></p><p>The nurse could only go find a psychiatrist for help.</p><p></p><p>After a series of tests, the final result was that due to the intense dispute between the doctor and patient, she had experienced hallucinations, and was preliminarily diagnosed with mild mental disorder.</p><p></p><p>Then, she got a slip, took leave early, and went home to rest.</p><p></p><p>"Hallucination... is it really a hallucination?"</p><p></p><p>The nurse was distraught.</p><p></p><p>If she was diagnosed with mental disorder, she might lose this job. Her husband only makes two or three thousand a month, how would they get by without her income from this big hospital?</p><p></p><p>"Honey?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the mirror reflected the figure of a man.</p><p></p><p>That was her husband, pot-bellied, with an ordinary face that made one feel nauseous.</p><p></p><p>Her husband seemed to be chewing on something, and the anxious nurse didn't look closely.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the nurse's pupils suddenly contracted, and her whole body instantly stiffened, as if falling into an icy pit.</p><p></p><p>She saw her husband chewing and swallowing, behaving like an animal, regurgitating a blood-stained human finger! The nurse's body trembled, her eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't be mistaken.</p><p></p><p>As a nurse, she had seen too many patients in the hospital, she knew what a human finger looked like even with her eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, there was a wedding ring on that finger, the same ring they had exchanged.</p><p></p><p>As if the reason her husband couldn't chew it down was because of this.</p><p></p><p>With a "ptui", he spat out the ring, and the "husband" looked up and saw the nurse's reaction in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>He first paused, then slowly revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You... saw it?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the nurse's whole body stiffened, unable to move, tears streaming down her face.</p><p></p><p>It was her husband's face and body, but if there was anything different, it was the finger that usually wore the ring, which had a strong sense of incongruity compared to the other fingers.</p><p></p><p>As if that finger had become thinner and more slender.</p><p></p><p>No! Wait!</p><p></p><p>It changed!</p><p></p><p>The nurse opened her mouth wide, covering her mouth in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>She saw that thin finger, as if filled with muscle, slowly swelling up and blending in with the surrounding fingers, becoming normal again.</p><p></p><p>The nurse looked up in terror at the mirror, at her husband.</p><p></p><p>Her husband had somehow teleported behind her, his mouth gaping open wide, like a bloody maw capable of swallowing the nurse's head in one bite.</p><p></p><p>Terrified, she turned around, only to see her husband's mouth split open, black and cavernous. The nurse let out a shrill scream, rolled her eyes back, and fainted to the floor.</p><p></p><p>【So fragile?】</p><p></p><p>【These humans are so weak.】</p><p></p><p>【Hahaha!】</p><p></p><p>Black words appeared on the husband's belly.</p><p></p><p>All the people on the street, like a self-service buffet, could be eaten however they wanted.</p><p></p><p>These humans had no defense against demons! What a wonderful world! The parchment controlled the fat middle-aged man's body, lifting the nurse's face, ready to bite down.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, it paused.</p><p></p><p>Using the human nose, it sniffed the woman closely.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, it recoiled!</p><p></p><p>【This is... the aura of a spirit?!】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

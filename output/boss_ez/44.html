        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu went through the list of candidates in his mind, feeling that it should be Li Qian Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Fang Yu called out.</p><p></p><p>Qian Gu Xing waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Come again next time."</p><p></p><p>Damn it! I'm not coming back! Following someone out of prison.</p><p></p><p>It was already dark and the light could not be seen.</p><p></p><p>There were people at the door holding lanterns waiting.</p><p></p><p>Taking a closer look, it was indeed Li Qian Xuan.</p><p></p><p>There was also one of his trusted aides beside him.</p><p></p><p>[Li Qian Xuan: 35/100.]</p><p>[Ning You Chun: 63/63.]</p><p></p><p>Compared to yesterday, Li Qian Xuan's health had recovered quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>The bodies of martial artists recover from injuries quite quickly.</p><p></p><p>But I'm even faster than that.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu remembered his own injuries, usually just sleeping for a night and his health would be fully restored. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is the advantage of being a player.</p><p></p><p>As for Ning You Chun, Fang Yu still had some impression of him.</p><p></p><p>He was one of the three elite members, around level 70, in Li Qian Xuan's team when Fang Yu first entered the game.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Ning You Chun was the weakest among the three, and he was taciturn and had no outstanding achievements, so Fang Yu didn't pay much attention to him.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Li Qian Xiu's three elite members:</p><p>Zhang Yu was tragically killed in a battle against the Hidden Light Demon.</p><p>Yue Guang turned into a demon.</p><p>Now the only one left by Li Qian Xuan's side is Ning You Chun.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Qian Xuan probably doesn't know yet that Yue Guang has turned into a demon.</p><p></p><p>Should I tell him? The demons seem to be wary of the backing of the Li family.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Fang Yu gave up on this idea.</p><p></p><p>The demons are wary of the Li family, not Li Qian Xuan himself.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang doesn't seem to care much about Li Qian Xuan, indicating that Li Qian Xuan's weight alone is not enough.</p><p></p><p>And if I rashly reveal this, I might end up getting Yue Guang dealt with.</p><p></p><p>But Yue Guang has some demonic organization behind him, which is lurking in Tian Yuan Town, ready to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>If I point out the demon, I'll become the focus of attention myself.</p><p></p><p>It might be satisfying at the moment.</p><p></p><p>But tomorrow, I'm afraid I'll be torn apart by the other demons.</p><p></p><p>Before figuring out the situation, rashly taking action would not be wise.</p><p></p><p>At least I need to find out to what extent Li Qian Xuan or the Li family can provide protection, and what the situation is.</p><p></p><p>Or I need to obtain enough important information from the demon side to be able to negotiate with the Li family behind Li Qian Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, as a small character, if I provoke those demons, I'll just be abandoned as a pawn.</p><p></p><p>There might even be some dirty deals behind the scenes, pushing me out to be killed by the demons to vent their anger.</p><p></p><p>I've worked hard to develop this character to this stage, even obtaining the demonic bloodline.</p><p></p><p>If I lose this character due to a wrong choice, that would be a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>Just selling off the silver I have in my hands during the day tomorrow, that would be a huge profit. This character is now very valuable.</p><p></p><p>Thinking through this, Fang Yu already knew how to deal with Li Qian Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De Yi, over here," Li Qian Xuan waved to Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, thank you again for rescuing me from prison."</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk as we walk."</p><p></p><p>The three of them started moving, walking out.</p><p></p><p>Li Qian Xuan asked curiously, "The people of the Black Tiger Gang, how dare they lay a hand on you? Haven't you joined the Yuan Ti Martial Arts Academy yet?"</p><p></p><p>That's right, in Li Qian Xuan's impression, as long as an ordinary person enters the martial arts academy, they should have the backing of the academy's identity.</p><p></p><p>Putting aside the small connection between him and Li Qian Xuan, the identity of the martial arts academy alone should have been enough to make the gang give up on Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"In reply to Lord Li, I have already joined the Yuan Ti Martial Arts Academy, but the people of the Black Tiger Gang still dared to barge in, and even wanted to humiliate my sister, so..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I just..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the Black Tiger Gang has been committing evil deeds for a long time. If you kill them, the Foolish Underworld won't do anything to you."</p><p></p><p>But... just the Foolish Underworld?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu roughly understood that Li Qianxuan's status was probably at a certain level.</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Qianxuan was just one of the ten households of the Foolish Underworld.</p><p></p><p>With the background of the Li family, he had a few more privileges than the ordinary ten households, but that was about it.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Foolish Underworld, his influence couldn't reach.</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, in the eyes of the demons, Li Qianxuan was indeed just a minor figure.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was still far superior to Fang Yu, who was a good-for-nothing.</p><p></p><p>"I've looked at the confession, and you say you killed all the members of the Black Tiger Gang, is that true?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Fang Yu asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan didn't say anything, he just looked Fang Yu up and down.</p><p></p><p>His physique hadn't changed much, but his body seemed to have become much more muscular, able to fill out his clothes.</p><p></p><p>"An ordinary person wouldn't be able to kill so many skilled members of the Black Tiger Gang. Have you entered the martial arts path?"</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan's tone was filled with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Because in his mind, Fang Yu had missed the prime age for martial arts training, and it would take at least three to five years for him to achieve any kind of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>"I have."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu extended his hand, clenching his fist, and a creaking sound of bones rubbing against each other could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Just this alone was enough to show that his strength was not ordinary, something an average person couldn't achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad at all!" </p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan laughed and patted Fang Yu on the shoulder.</p><p></p><p>This guy really was full of surprises.</p><p></p><p>"Keep training hard. I originally thought you only had courage, but now I see you also have good talent."</p><p></p><p>"Even though you've missed the best time to start martial arts training, you still have a chance to catch up."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, in about a year, you'll be able to graduate from the martial arts school and join the Foolish Underworld to lend me a hand."</p><p></p><p>Wow, the demons are lurking around you, and you haven't even noticed them. I still want to send you there.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu realized that Li Qianxuan was quite simple-minded, and probably didn't have much ambition.</p><p></p><p>The one who had sent people to follow him before was probably his brother, Li Baizhen.</p><p></p><p>The troublesome one was Li Baizhen.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's getting late today, you should go back and rest early."</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan had brought Fang Yu out of the prison late at night, so he must have just wanted to see Fang Yu's strength.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, Li Qianxuan suddenly thought of something and said to Fang Yu's retreating back.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, come to the Foolish Underworld the day after tomorrow. I've talked to my elder brother about your demonic curse, and he's applied for a de-cursing tool from above. It should arrive the day after tomorrow, and it should be able to help you remove the curse."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's footsteps suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The day after tomorrow, the Foolish Underworld was going to verify his true identity?? Normally, Fang Yu wouldn't be afraid.</p><p></p><p>But tonight he had just fused with some demonic blood, who knows if it would be detected and he'd be killed for being a demon.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat seeped out from his forehead, Fang Yu turned around and bowed, feigning gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Lord Li, for your help! If I can achieve some accomplishments, I will repay your life-saving grace a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Keep training hard, in your current state, you can't be of much help to me yet."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Qianxuan and Ning Youchun left, leaving Fang Yu standing there with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>What should he do? Two days later, he would have to undergo an identity verification by the Foolish Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, he had to go see Yue Guang and participate in the demonic plan.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu couldn't even say which of these two things was more serious.</p><p></p><p>"I just wanted to level up and earn money, grind some gold, generation after generation, reach the pinnacle of life, how did the situation suddenly become so difficult..."</p><p></p><p>"Nevermind, let's go back home and let the character sleep."</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow morning, I'll figure out how to sell the silver and exchange it for cash."</p><p></p><p>"At worst, the character can just die and be reborn, as long as the money is earned, that's the way to go!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was definitely the worst-case scenario.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was thinking about how to break through the predicament, while walking back home.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

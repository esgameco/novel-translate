        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother was stunned himself, but the reactions of the people around him clearly believed it to be true.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother is so strong!"</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Tiger Brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother is the best!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother immediately felt elated.</p><p></p><p>Hmph! It's nothing, just a tiger. If I get extremely angry, I can apparently even kill a tiger.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... I'm feeling it! When I go to the Mandarin Duck Pavilion tonight, I'll request a girl wearing a tiger skin!</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother was just thinking about these pleasant thoughts when he suddenly heard one of his subordinates shout.</p><p></p><p>"One tiger is not enough! I've seen Tiger Brother when he was extremely angry, and he could punch and kill ten bulls with one fist!"</p><p></p><p>Ten, ten bulls? Tiger Brother was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Is that... a bit too much? Before he could figure out how to act mysterious and pass it off, another subordinate spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Ten bulls? That's nothing! The last time Tiger Brother used his full force, when he was extremely enraged and fighting a rival gang, he single-handedly defeated a hundred men!"</p><p></p><p>I have to fight a hundred people?? And win?? </p><p></p><p>I, I, I, I, I don't remember that at all!</p><p></p><p>Have I really been that powerful before?</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother's brain was a bit overloaded.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up! What are you all doing? What are you doing! Tiger Brother has never done such things when extremely angry, it's all lies!"</p><p></p><p>"Only I know the one true time when Tiger Brother's rage reached its peak."</p><p></p><p>"With just a glance, he petrified and impregnated an entire village of people!"</p><p></p><p>What the fuck??</p><p></p><p>This is getting more and more absurd! The worst part is, these subordinates started arguing with each other.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother definitely killed ten bulls, you're saying a single tiger doesn't do him justice!"</p><p></p><p>"Petrifying and impregnating people! That's the true feat of Tiger Brother's ultimate rage!"</p><p></p><p>"I don't care, I don't care! I'm the dorm leader, and I say Tiger Brother has to defeat a hundred people, so that's what he'll do!!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? What are they even saying? Tiger Brother looked back.</p><p></p><p>The subordinates behind him had erupted into a chaotic argument. </p><p></p><p>Seven or eight of them were shouting and yelling at each other.</p><p>The rest all had dumbfounded looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother waved his hand, now was the time to assert his authority as the big brother! Just as he was about to calm down this boastful competition, those seven or eight subordinates turned to face him in unison, their voices trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother, you tell us! What did you do when you were extremely angry?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother: ??? How did the ball end up back in my court?? But Tiger Brother was an experienced veteran.</p><p></p><p>He frowned solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"When I was most extremely angry, I shielded our Blacktiger Gang boss from a blade!"</p><p></p><p>Whooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, those few subordinates instantly fell silent, their eyes wide open in shock.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, someone started clapping.</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant, brilliant~"</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother! Strong!"</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother, you're the best!!"</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother, I'll love you forever!"</p><p></p><p>*Coughs* How embarrassing! You little brats!</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother chuckled sheepishly, then turned to see Diao Ruru's completely bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>His silly grin immediately vanished, replaced by a calm, cold poker face.</p><p></p><p>"So, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Diao Ruru shook her head, confused.</p><p></p><p>"Understand what?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple, just hand over your money! And Wang Er and the others are dead, Diao De One needs to take full responsibility, so summon him back and let me bring him back to the Blacktiger Gang for the boss to deal with."</p><p></p><p>"Deal, deal with? What are you going to do to Diao De One?"</p><p></p><p>"That's naturally..."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother made a slicing motion across his neck: "Wang Er and the others died at the pharmacy, and Diao De One came back alive, do you think the boss will let him off? Go prepare for his funeral."</p><p></p><p>Funeral?! Diao Ruru's body trembled, her face turning deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"No! I won't let you bury Diao De One! Take me instead! Arrest me!"</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother's lips curled into a sinister grin.</p><p></p><p>His greedy gaze, like a hungry ghost pouncing on its prey, longed to devour Diao Ruru alive.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How funny, how funny. If I bring Diao De-one back to the gang, do you think you can still run away?" </p><p></p><p>Diao Ru-ru suddenly looked up in terror.</p><p></p><p>"You, what do you mean?"</p><p></p><p>"It means..." Tiger Brother took off his shirt, revealing his big belly, with an evil look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Tonight, you'll keep me company! If I have fun, I might even let Diao De-one see you one last time before he dies."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tiger Brother finished speaking, Diao Ru-ru hadn't even opened her mouth yet.</p><p></p><p>But the underlings suddenly cried out in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!? "</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother! Tiger Brother! Can you really do this?"</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother, isn't this too unhealthy? We're still kids!"</p><p></p><p>"All evil will eventually be punished by the law! Tiger Brother, it's not too late to turn back!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother: ??? I take you guys to the brothel every day, and you're more excited than me. Now what's with the act?</p><p></p><p>"I know what you little bastards are thinking, don't be impatient! Your big brother Tiger will go first. After I've had my fill, I'll reward this woman to you."</p><p></p><p>The underlings cried out in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!"</p><p>"Wow! We'll get to play too!"</p><p>"This is the best thing that's happened to me in my life! The best! The best!"</p><p>"Tiger Brother is the best! From now on, if Tiger Brother tells us to go east, we won't go west!"</p><p>"Tiger Brother, do you have any other orders? I want to increase my favorability with you!"</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with these people today, all of them suddenly going crazy? How strange.</p><p></p><p>But Tiger Brother didn't think much of it, and just said,</p><p></p><p>"Alright, a few of you go guard the door, the rest can do as you please."</p><p></p><p>"Received!"</p><p>"Understood!"</p><p>"Time for free activities!"</p><p>"I have the highest gaming talent in the dorm, now requesting to lead the team! Old Seven, Old Eight, you two go guard the door, the rest listen to my commands! Start searching the rooms thoroughly!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai actually started giving orders, leaving Tiger Brother stunned.</p><p></p><p>Just as Tiger Brother thought these underlings were joking, they really scattered to search the different rooms.</p><p></p><p>The next moment.</p><p></p><p>Bang!!</p><p></p><p>One of the underlings suddenly smashed a rice jar, directly slamming it to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The rice jar shattered, scattering rice everywhere.</p><p>But the guy just lay on the ground, feeling around in the scattered rice.</p><p></p><p>"Report to Second Brother! I just smashed the jar, and it's full of rice! Nothing else!"</p><p></p><p>Clang!! Over there, another underling flipped over someone's bed.</p><p></p><p>"Report to Second Brother! Nothing good under the bed, just a nest of small spiders."</p><p></p><p>The others also started reporting one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Report to Second Brother! The big box is full of old clothes, tested with a dagger, the defense is very low! As fragile as paper!"</p><p>"Report to Second Brother! Found one coin in the kitchen stove!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as this was said, the others excitedly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Liang Zi, not bad! I'll give your dorm 10 contribution points! You can enjoy the limited breakfast delivery service!"</p><p>"Keep it up, brothers! The cutscene is over, now it's free exploration time, hurry up and find the good stuff!"</p><p></p><p>These underlings' strange tactics completely baffled Tiger Brother, and even his little brother went soft.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to ask what these underlings were doing...</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh--</p><p></p><p>Two dark shadows suddenly flew past him, slamming heavily into the wall!</p><p></p><p>The bodies burst open, spraying a large patch of fresh blood on the wall, then slowly slid down to the floor.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother stared wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>Those two corpses were the ones that Wei Kai, this "Second Brother", had just sent out to guard the door.</p><p></p><p>Dead, they're dead? Killed? Sent out to guard the door just a moment ago, they didn't even have time to cry for help before being killed? Tiger Brother looked back at the door in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a furious roar came from the door.</p><p></p><p>"Black Tiger Gang!! Release my sister!!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother saw who it was.</p><p></p><p>He stared wide-eyed, unable to believe it.</p><p></p><p>Diao... De-one?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

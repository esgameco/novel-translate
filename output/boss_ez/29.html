        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin's voice was hoarse as he stared intently at Fang Yu, as if trying to see through him.</p><p></p><p>"Just cultivate according to the cultivation method diagram."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin furrowed his brows.</p><p></p><p>"Just practice for a while, and you'll reach the pinnacle of perfection?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu nodded.</p><p></p><p>His thick-skinned manner showed no sign of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>How could such a thing be possible! Could there really be someone in this world who is so compatible with the Yuan Body Cultivation Method and has such extraordinary talent?</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin felt an urge stirring within him, his gaze burning as he looked at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>If this were truly the case...</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good! In that case, according to the rules of our martial arts school, you can also select a free martial arts manual. Why don't I help you choose one?"</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Yuan Hongxin's current cheerful demeanor made Fang Yu feel a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"Then... please, Master, help me choose one."</p><p></p><p>As if prepared in advance, Yuan Hongxin took out a secret manual and tossed it in front of Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>On it was written...</p><p></p><p>"The Yuan Body Two-Zero Sword, a beginner-level dual sword technique using long and short swords. The sword techniques are fierce, with both offense and defense. The long sword is the main attack, while the short sword is the main defense. But the offense and defense can be switched at any time, and each sword strike must have a follow-up defensive move to prevent the enemy's counterattack. It emphasizes a stable and comprehensive suppression."</p><p></p><p>Sounds good.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The master is quite kind to give him this for free.</p><p></p><p>And so far, he hasn't mentioned anything about compensating for the broken table, so Fang Yu felt he could get away with it.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the secret manual and stuffing it into his chest, just as he was about to thank the master, he suddenly heard Yuan Hongxin say.</p><p></p><p>"Learn."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Right here, show me what you've learned."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin's bright eyes stared intently at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Ah? Fang Yu was dumbfounded, looking at Shizuimei standing next to the master, who just shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this sword technique is so simple? Just one look and you can learn it? Thinking about it, Fang Yu opened the secret manual and started to study it.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he looked up.</p><p></p><p>"Learned it?" Yuan Hongxin asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"... Is there a problem somewhere?"</p><p></p><p>"Uh... this part."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu demonstrated a stance with his empty hands.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant...</p><p></p><p>Bang!!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin suddenly slammed his palm on the table where the tea was placed.</p><p></p><p>The wooden table shattered into pieces, making a loud noise that startled both Fang Yu and Shizuimei.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the flying wood shards, Yuan Hongxin expressionlessly reached out and grabbed two flying table corners.</p><p></p><p>With a cracking sound, he broke off one, turning it into a long and short table leg, and threw it to Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Use the wood as a sword."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stared with his mouth wide open.</p><p></p><p>10 taels!! </p><p></p><p>Another 10 taels!!</p><p></p><p>He quickly looked at Shizuimei.</p><p></p><p>This can't be counted against me, this is the master breaking the table!!</p><p></p><p>But Shizuimei just glared at him.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" </p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin asked strangely.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, nothing."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hurriedly followed the sword techniques in the manual and took a stance.</p><p></p><p>The [Yuan Body Two-Zero Sword] has 12 opening moves, and the follow-up techniques are even more numerous.</p><p></p><p>Just the opening stances alone, Fang Yu had to ask for guidance for half a day.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour flew by.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin's expression, from the initial excitement and patience, gradually transitioned to calmness, confusion, and finally a gloomy, unsightly look.</p><p></p><p>He had completely seen through it.</p><p></p><p>He had not misjudged.</p><p></p><p>Diao De'yi's talent was simply trash! In half an hour, he couldn't even learn the first opening stance.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yuan Body Two-Zero Sword is very difficult to learn, it could be considered an intermediate to advanced-level technique, with a complete subsequent improvement path.</p><p></p><p>But if it were a truly talented young genius, they should be able to master the first stance in half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The time should have shown some progress by now.</p><p></p><p>How could he be like Diao Deyi, like a block of wood, completely clueless! He lacked many basic martial arts common senses, and still needed to be taught and explained.</p><p></p><p>It's like trying to run before learning to walk, running in a complete mess.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin's face looked unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>This person, actually managed to practice the Yuan Body Foundation Technique from scratch to perfection in a single day? He didn't believe it, he really didn't believe it, but the white powdery bone fragments that fell from the back of Fang Yu's hand proved that the other party had indeed achieved this.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin looked at Fang Yu with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... this guy only has extraordinary talent in the Yuan Body Foundation Technique?</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the history of martial arts, there are indeed such exceptional geniuses, it's just that the probability is extremely small.</p><p></p><p>Most people, either they are geniuses through and through, or they are mediocre all the way.</p><p></p><p>It's extremely rare for someone who was originally a waste material to suddenly have a certain martial art that is extremely compatible, learn it quickly, and then become a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>If this is the case, then Diao Deyi's hands are truly being wasted. A waste of heaven's gifts! Need to think about it, need to think about how to deal with it...</p><p></p><p>As for letting Diao Deyi continue to learn the Yuan Body Two Zero Sword, that's not going to work.</p><p></p><p>With this aptitude, it's impossible to enter the door in three to five years.</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for diligently practicing the [Yuan Body Two Zero Sword], proficiency +1.]</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Master, I'm starting to feel it!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly shouted, but Yuan Hongxin didn't even show any interest in looking at him.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in his position, Yuan Hongxin coldly looked at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, your aptitude is dull, this sword technique may not suit you. If you want to change to another martial art, you can tell me now."</p><p></p><p>"No need, Master, I really found the feeling."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Fang Yu took a starting stance, crooked and unstable, very, very forced to match the posture.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't even last half a second before he deviated from the sword technique's starting stance.</p><p></p><p>"Since you don't want to change, then you can leave. The rules of the martial arts hall are not many, just report for morning practice every day."</p><p></p><p>With that, Yuan Hongxin rubbed his forehead, as if he had a headache, waved his hand, and let Fang Yu leave.</p><p></p><p>This...</p><p></p><p>Why does it feel like the master is no longer enthusiastic?</p><p></p><p>Wasn't he just fine just now?</p><p></p><p>That hand-in-hand guidance felt like the treatment of a direct disciple!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, under the master's guidance, he really understood the sword techniques very quickly, feeling like a sponge suddenly absorbing water frantically.</p><p></p><p>This sense of improvement is so fast, even though the system only increased the proficiency by 1, and he hasn't even mastered the sword technique.</p><p></p><p>But it doesn't affect Fang Yu's huge gains.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu still wanted to continue being guided by Yuan Hongxin, but unfortunately Yuan Hongxin no longer cared about him.</p><p></p><p>Embarrassedly looking at Shi Mei.</p><p></p><p>The latter slightly waved his hand, signaling him to hurry up and leave.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was startled, only then remembering that the master hadn't even mentioned the broken table that needed to be compensated for, feeling that he could get away with it.</p><p></p><p>He quickly retreated and left the hall.</p><p></p><p>Outside the door, Fang Yu let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>In front of Yuan Hongxin, he felt inexplicably pressured.</p><p></p><p>But this harvest this time was not bad.</p><p></p><p>Opening the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>【Name: Diao Deyi.】</p><p></p><p>【Realm: Initial Flower Realm.】</p><p></p><p>【Life: 22/22.】</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 2.2.】+【Spirit: 1.7.】+【Human-level Skill: Digital Life.】</p><p></p><p>【Flower-level Skills: Yuan Body Two Zero Sword [Not Mastered (1/100)]+, Yuan Body Foundation Technique [Flawless (3/600)]+.】</p><p></p><p>【Attribute Points: 0.】</p><p></p><p>【Experience: 19/100.】</p>

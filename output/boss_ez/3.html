        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hey! You're awake!"</p><p></p><p>Someone noticed Fang Yu's condition.</p><p></p><p>"Get up, Diao De-one, are you still pretending to be dead?"</p><p></p><p>Slap! A man with a stubble-covered face and the name "Wang Er" on his head, slapped Fang Yu directly across the face.</p><p></p><p>The searing pain immediately startled Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>The realism!</p><p></p><p>The NPC's expressions and actions! Incredible!</p><p></p><p>This game is definitely going to be a hit! It's going to explode in popularity!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a number appeared above his head.</p><p></p><p>"-1."</p><p></p><p>Wait, wait, wait! This pain, are you telling me I only lost one drop of blood?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, his character only had 7 hit points in total, so losing one-seventh of that seems reasonable for the amount of pain.</p><p></p><p>However, the pain sensation definitely needs to be adjusted.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu lowered his voice: "System, open the settings page."</p><p></p><p>However... there was no response.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Wang Er then pushed him off the table he was lying on.</p><p></p><p>"What are you muttering about, do you have a problem with your father Wang?"</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"-0.5."</p><p></p><p>0.5 blood can also be lost?? Fang Yu was confused, and as his gaze lowered, he saw a hand.</p><p></p><p>A severed hand.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck!?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly used his hands to push himself up from the ground, and his hands were immediately coated in sticky blood.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, in the small room, there were about seven or eight health bars glowing, and one of them showed "Li An: 2/10".</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, it was the person with the severed hand, barely clinging to life.</p><p></p><p>The other people also had 3 or 4 points of remaining health, lying on the ground and moaning.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>What the hell is this, a crime scene?</p><p></p><p>"Don't make such a big fuss."</p><p></p><p>Wang Er walked up to Li An, grabbed his hair, and yanked his head up.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask again, where's the money?"</p><p></p><p>"The money... the money is under that brick... please... please..."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Wang Er slammed Li An's head back down onto the ground! -1!</p><p></p><p>A large number immediately popped up.</p><p></p><p>Li An immediately passed out, and the numbers "-0.1" "-0.1" continued to appear above his head.</p><p></p><p>This is going to kill someone! But Wang Er didn't care, he dug out the brick, and sure enough, there was a bag of silver coins hidden underneath. After a quick assessment, the weight was quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>Wang Er showed a smile, but someone around them shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Wang Er! You can't take that money! That's the money the shopkeeper left for his wife's medical treatment! Without this money, his wife will die!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, if you take this money, how are you any different from a murderer? Even if you're working for the casino, you should still have some conscience!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! The shopkeeper hasn't even refused to pay back the debt, and you just barge in here, beating and smashing everything. Don't you have any respect for the law?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voices around him, Wang Er let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Paying back debts is a matter of course! I don't care how the shopkeeper ended up in debt, if he can't produce the money when it's time to pay, that's his problem! And what are you all? Just earning 10 coins a day, why are you risking your lives?"</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De-one, go beat him up!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Me?"</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense! If you don't beat him up, I'll beat you until your hands and feet are broken! Don't forget, you're working for us! If you don't do your job, I'll have your sister taken to Yanliujing and sold tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Tian next to him also laughed.</p><p></p><p>"So the 'sibling love' you were acting out to pay off the debt was all fake, huh? You don't even have the courage to beat someone up for your sister, and you were talking about being willing to suffer for her."</p><p></p><p>No, don't be so sarcastic, that wasn't me acting, the character took on the pressure of helping his sister themselves, what does it have to do with me, I've never done that before!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Besides, Diao De One is Diao De One, and I am me. Can we be the same?</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly had an idea and quietly walked up to the man.</p><p></p><p>[Peng Xi: 4/9.]</p><p></p><p>Under Peng Xi's fierce gaze, Fang Yu raised his fist and lightly punched him in the chest.</p><p></p><p>"-0.1."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>Peng Xi: ? The light punch had no effect on Peng Xi, who just blankly looked down at Fang Yu's fist.</p><p></p><p>The man behind him, Wang Er, then suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>"What! You don't even have the strength to hit someone! You freeloader! Hit harder for me!"</p><p></p><p>The other three henchmen then burst out laughing, and started punching the shop's staff one by one.</p><p></p><p>"-1."</p><p>"-1." </p><p>"-1."</p><p></p><p>The damage numbers appeared on the other staff members.</p><p></p><p>"Look closely, Diao De One, this is how you use your fists!"</p><p>"You can't even hit hard, what use are you!"</p><p>"Kick them! If your fists are weak, use your feet! Understand? Hit hard! If you don't hit them, we'll hit you!"</p><p></p><p>Of course!</p><p>Fang Yu suddenly realized.</p><p>This must be the new player tutorial arranged by the system.</p><p>Teaching him how to fight, with this wooden dummy and the new player plot, it was a bit uncomfortable.</p><p>But no matter, they're all just NPCs.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, Fang Yu this time punched with full force! Bam! Hitting the staff member in the nose.</p><p></p><p>"-1."</p><p></p><p>The damage number appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Ah! That punch was not bad at all!"</p><p>"Good job! I approve of that punch!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Er and the others cheered.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu also found the feeling, and threw another punch. With the "-1" number appearing, he directly knocked the "wooden dummy" down to [1.9/9] HP.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the unconscious "wooden dummy", he pondered that a couple more punches should be able to kill the person.</p><p>But he hesitated a bit, to have him kill such a lifelike NPC made him feel a bit strange, as if he was really killing a living person. He didn't have the heart to do it.</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, wow, these people were all quite restrained, only beating the others to 1 or 2 HP and then stopping, no one was really trying to kill.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he observed carefully, otherwise he would have foolishly killed the person, who knows what trouble that would have caused.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking about it, the door to the back room of the pharmacy suddenly opened, and a beautiful woman in blue clothing, with a haggard expression, came into view.</p><p></p><p>[Chen Qi Lan: 1/3.]</p><p></p><p>Wow, a character with a max HP of only 3, really fragile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the sorry state of the pharmacy staff, Chen Qi Lan paused, turning deathly pale with fear, and let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!"</p><p></p><p>The pharmacy staff were all startled.</p><p></p><p>"The Mistress!"</p><p>"Mistress, quickly go back inside!"</p><p></p><p>The Mistress? So she must be the boss's wife?</p><p></p><p>The Mistress wanted to flee, but Wang Er had no intention of letting her go.</p><p>The moment he laid eyes on this woman, his gaze was like a hungry tiger, full of desire!</p><p></p><p>Striding over, he grabbed the woman who was trying to turn and run away. -0.5.</p><p></p><p>His large hand left a mark on the woman's arm as he pushed her down onto the table.</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, we're in luck today. I'll go first, then it'll be your turn. Even Diao De One can have a share."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ??? They're taking care of me? Fang Yu pondered that if he put aside his moral scruples, wouldn't they just run wild and commit all sorts of evil deeds here? This is way too wicked! He didn't want to be a bad guy.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

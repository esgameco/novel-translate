        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was feeling smug in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This wave of his had turned the tide and reversed the desperate situation.</p><p></p><p>It had even stirred up the emotions of the crowd, who were practically ready to lift him up to the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Being able to break them out of a certain-death situation, no matter what, the crowd had gained a bit more trust in Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan was even sweating in his palms.</p><p></p><p>He bet correctly.</p><p></p><p>He now could hardly believe that the headless corpse clutching its head was actually a trustworthy person.</p><p></p><p>But in the desperate situation, this person had indeed found them a way out.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>The demon let out an angry roar, and the crowd's barrage of arrows suddenly all missed.</p><p></p><p>But the crowd still didn't know that, and they continued their frantic shooting.</p><p></p><p>"Over there! The demon is moving! He's over there! Listen to my command!!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hurriedly shouted with a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>With the previous case as an example, the crowd also obediently listened to Fang Yu's commands.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a long sword from the ground, like a commander, and wherever his sword pointed, the crowd's barrage of arrows would shoot in that direction.</p><p></p><p>But the strange thing was that after a couple of rounds of arrow barrages, there were no bursts of blood in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao De-one?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was puzzled, "Didn't you say you could see the demon? How come the arrow barrages have missed twice in a row?"</p><p></p><p>"Time lag."</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan's keen perception caught the problem, his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's forehead was also beaded with sweat. Just as Li Qianxuan said, there was a time lag between his commands and the crowd's arrow barrages.</p><p></p><p>The position his long sword pointed to was the location where the demon was a second ago, but by the time the arrow barrage arrived, the demon had already moved, so naturally, it was too late.</p><p></p><p>Anticipation! I need to calculate the right amount of anticipation to command this group's arrow barrages.</p><p></p><p>And the breadth, the arrow barrages would be better if they were more dispersed, expanding the attack range.</p><p></p><p>With this realization, Fang Yu, still clutching his head, changed his thinking and immediately shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Over there! Everyone, spread out your attack arc horizontally to increase the coverage area of the arrow barrage!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh—</p><p></p><p>The arrow barrage covered the area, and several bursts of blood suddenly appeared in front. -11! -10! -10!</p><p></p><p>【Invisible Light Demon: 205/1000.】</p><p></p><p>It must be said that this group from the Foolish Underworld indeed had impressive damage. Each arrow could inflict two-digit damage, no wonder the Invisible Light Demon avoided direct confrontation and resorted to stealth attacks.</p><p></p><p>If they really went head-to-head, this guy might not even be a match for this team.</p><p></p><p>"Hit it!"</p><p>"Great job, Jiao De-one!"</p><p>"Keep it up! Seize the opportunity while he's weakened!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd cheered in victory, their emotions stirred up.</p><p></p><p>Although they couldn't see the health bar, hitting an invisible enemy in succession was still an encouragement.</p><p></p><p>While commanding the crowd to continue raining arrows on the Invisible Light Demon, Fang Yu was calculating in his mind.</p><p></p><p>When the Invisible Light Demon was still wearing Li Bai's human skin, it had lost 500 health from having its head cut off and 200 health from having its arms severed, so when it transformed into a demon, its total health was less than 300.</p><p></p><p>After several confrontations, it had only lost this much health, completely relying on its invisibility ability to maneuver. Facing it head-on, they absolutely couldn't defeat it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if it was in its full 1000/1000 health state, it might indeed be able to defeat this small team in a direct confrontation.</p><p></p><p>But in the vast Tianyuan Town, it definitely wasn't just Li Qianxuan's team, and if the demon caused trouble and got entangled in a fight, it wouldn't be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh—</p><p></p><p>The arrow barrage covered the area again, bringing out a few more bursts of blood. -11! -21! -12! -9!</p><p></p><p>【Invisible Light Demon: ...】</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The Demon: 152/1000.</p><p></p><p>The damage was uneven, with the number 21 standing out. Fang Yu raised his head and slightly adjusted the angle with his hand, glancing back to see that it was a 70 HP follower of Li Qianxuan who had shot it.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang: 75/75.</p><p></p><p>This person's strength was the closest to Li Qianxuan's, but unfortunately, one of the three 60-70 HP followers had died, leaving only two. Otherwise, the odds of victory would have been even greater.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense the gaze of the person who had raised his head, he paused for a moment and nodded slightly in acknowledgment.</p><p></p><p>Lick! This guy needs to be licked too! Looking at his skills, if he could teach me some archery, I could transform into a top-tier professional player, get way ahead of the others, then hand out my business cards and rake in the cash! A one-stop shop for work and boosting services!</p><p></p><p>But first, I have to get through the current crisis.</p><p></p><p>Next to him, Li Qianxuan had not made a move yet, as Fang Yu had instructed.</p><p></p><p>Because... the Demon is approaching! Close-quarters combat is the most troublesome! Taking a deep breath, Fang Yu shouted.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon is approaching quickly, we must cooperate seamlessly without any hesitation! Otherwise, everyone will die here! If I call 'draw swords,' it means the Demon is about to close in, and everyone should attack in the direction of the Demon on my command!"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Fang Yu took a step back, quietly retreating behind Li Qianxuan.</p><p></p><p>This made Li Qianxuan pause.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly flattered, "Lord Li, please protect me."</p><p></p><p>That's right, keeping Li Qianxuan on standby is to have him protect me. Fang Yu understood that his eyes determined the outcome of this battle, so he had to stay alive; otherwise, it would be a complete loss. But it's not that simple for the Demon to get close.</p><p></p><p>Under Fang Yu's command, the barrage of arrows was like precisely guided missiles, tenaciously pursuing the Demon. -9! -8! -11!</p><p></p><p>The Demon didn't know its own HP, but it understood that its injuries were becoming more and more severe and that it couldn't take any more arrow damage.</p><p></p><p>Alas, the barrage of arrows, under Fang Yu's command, relentlessly chased it, forcing it to flee like a rat on the street.</p><p></p><p>How outrageous! It's a Demon! A man-eating Demon! Yet it's being chased and beaten! What has become of it?</p><p></p><p>However, the Illumination Demon's left-right movements, and even its S-shaped diving turns, were all tracked by Fang Yu, who shot it with an arrow. -12!</p><p></p><p>What the hell?! The Illumination Demon was enraged.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's longsword was like it had an aimbot, firmly pointing at its location, clearly tracking every change in position and speed - it was like he had a transparency hack.</p><p></p><p>Impossible! You're cheating! Deciding not to care anymore, the Demon suddenly burst in speed and charged directly towards Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>This sudden burst of speed rendered Fang Yu's commands useless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Demon's massive HP bar [Illumination Demon: 114/1000] rapidly approaching him, Fang Yu screamed in fear.</p><p></p><p>"In front of me! Draw swords!!"</p><p></p><p>Slash, slash, slash, slash, slash - </p><p>All the longswords frantically stabbed towards the direction Fang Yu was facing, including Li Qianxuan's.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, no one noticed the curve on the Demon's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Just as it was about to charge at Fang Yu, it suddenly changed direction! Like a spinning top, it swerved past the group's attacks, its sharp claws slashing across the left side of everyone. -87! -75! -101! -78! -92!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

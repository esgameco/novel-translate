        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The 10 points of experience you lost, I'll take them back from your head, Tiger Brother!"</p><p></p><p>He strode towards Tiger Brother, but saw that Tiger Brother was actually retreating.</p><p></p><p>Wait! The direction he was retreating was... towards the location of Diao Ruru!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's expression changed immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Second Sister! Run towards me!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he said this, Fang Yu rushed towards his second sister.</p><p></p><p>Second Sister was also smart.</p><p></p><p>She immediately realized what Tiger Brother was about to do.</p><p></p><p>Frightened, she let out a scream and hurriedly ran towards Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>But she was still too slow.</p><p></p><p>By the time Fang Yu had covered half the distance, Tiger Brother had already reached Second Sister's side.</p><p></p><p>As Second Sister was backing away in fear, she was suddenly yanked by the hair and had a knife pressed against her neck.</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there, Diao De One! If you take another step, I'll kill your sister!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother sneered as he pressed the knife's edge against Second Sister's pale neck. Second Sister was very thin, so the knife's edge merely grazing her neck left a red mark.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately halted, his expression gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had left the martial arts school, he had not been at full strength.</p><p></p><p>Even when he was fighting those Black Tiger Gang underlings earlier, he had been holding back, afraid of overexerting himself and collapsing on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, those weaklings wouldn't have required him to throw more than one punch to take them down.</p><p></p><p>Now, due to his lack of stamina, he had run too slowly and failed to reach Second Sister in time to support her.</p><p></p><p>He now clearly understood how dangerous it was to be imbalanced in his abilities. His attack power was sufficient, but his endurance was truly lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De One, you've really impressed me."</p><p></p><p>"I thought dealing with a small fry like you, my underlings would be enough, and I wouldn't need to use such methods to force you to submit."</p><p></p><p>"But unexpectedly, in the end, I still had to resort to this tactic. You, you're not bad."</p><p></p><p>With the situation under his control, Tiger Brother began to speak eloquently.</p><p></p><p>Although a pile of corpses lay around, he had grasped Diao De One's lifeline.</p><p></p><p>He was confident that the woman in his hands would make Diao De One obediently comply.</p><p></p><p>"Tiger Brother, are you that lacking in confidence? Afraid to fight me? Alright, I'll give you three moves, and after those three moves, I'll make my move. If you lose even then, you'll let us siblings go. But if I lose, I'll go with you without any resistance."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu tried to reason with him, and his breathing rate began to slow down.</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really think you have a chance to resist with this woman in my hands?"</p><p></p><p>"Diao De One! Don't worry about me! Just run away! I, I'll be fine! He wants me, he won't kill me..."</p><p></p><p>Second Sister's body was trembling, but she forced a stiff smile on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Wrong! I like playing with women, but I never neglect my duties. Otherwise, I wouldn't have risen to this position in the Black Tiger Gang."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother, for once, looked serious as he said to Fang Yu, "Diao De One, now you have two choices."</p><p></p><p>"First, you kill yourself, and I'll let your sister go."</p><p></p><p>"Second, watch your sister be killed by me, and then die by my blade."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu fell silent for a moment, his breathing rate now back to normal, and then looked up and said, "Perhaps I have a third choice. Have you heard of the Foolish Underworld's Ritual of Qian Xuan?"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother was puzzled. Why was Fang Yu bringing this up now?</p><p></p><p>"Even if I've heard of it, so what?"</p><p></p><p>"He and I are well-acquainted. If anything happens to me or my sister today, you'll be in big trouble."</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Foolish Underworld was known to all. </p><p>If you were labeled as a demon, they would come after you no matter what.</p><p>And if you abused your power, although you might be dealt with internally, becoming a victim would render any delayed justice meaningless.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"...I don't remember you having any dealings with those big shots, and besides, I have the Black Tiger Gang behind me!"</p><p></p><p>"How long can the Black Tiger Gang protect you? Once the wind blows over, the knife of the Foolish Underworld will still fall on your head."</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger frowned, deep in thought, then suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>The stealthily advancing Fang Yu hurriedly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"What are you smiling about?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe that a worthless person like you can have dealings with the ten households of the Foolish Underworld. I don't even believe that a small fry like you can get the Foolish Underworld people to take revenge for you. You can't sway me, and I'm willing to bet that your life is worthless, that you're just putting on a show."</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger's thoughts became increasingly clear.</p><p></p><p>"You also need to think it through. Trying to scare me with the Foolish Underworld? If I slash this knife, your sister will be dead, and she won't be able to come back to life, and you'll never see her again in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu fell silent.</p><p></p><p>At this distance, he could rush over and fight with Elder Tiger.</p><p></p><p>But even if he moved quickly, he wouldn't be faster than someone slitting a throat.</p><p></p><p>A single light slash, and his second sister would be dead on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Still haven't decided? Maybe I should help you make the decision here?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll count to 3, and if you don't commit suicide, your sister is dead."</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger's voice rang out like a death knell.</p><p></p><p>"3."</p><p>"2."</p><p>"I'm willing to commit suicide to save my second sister's life," Fang Yu's calm voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao De-yi?! No!" His second sister's eyes widened, tears streaming down her face.</p><p></p><p>"No! No! If you die, I'd rather die myself! I'll go die now, you hurry and escape!"</p><p></p><p>As she said this, she was about to throw herself onto the knife's edge.</p><p></p><p>This startled Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>But Elder Tiger, as if he had anticipated this, suddenly withdrew the knife and kicked Jiao Ru-ru in the knee, causing her to cry out in pain and kneel on the ground, where he then grabbed her hair from behind. -1</p><p></p><p>[Jiao Ru-ru: 3/4]</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger then brought his head close to Jiao Ru-ru's ear.</p><p></p><p>"Don't try any tricks, Elder Tiger has eaten more salt than you've walked paths. There have been plenty of hostages who tried to throw themselves on my knife, but how many have actually died?"</p><p></p><p>Ah, this is what you call professionalism!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked on with newfound respect.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly realized that although Elder Tiger was a scumbag, in terms of professional competence, he had achieved things that other scumbags couldn't. </p><p></p><p>So he was an excellent scumbag, a professional scumbag - he said he wouldn't kill, and he didn't kill! And he protected the hostage so well! Give him a round of applause!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was greatly relieved that his second sister was unharmed. </p><p></p><p>Although it was just a game, his second sister had been good to him, and he didn't want her to die like this.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Elder Tiger looking at him, Fang Yu asked seriously, "Elder Tiger, how do you want me to die?"</p><p></p><p>"It's simple," Elder Tiger replied. "There's a knife on the ground next to you. Pick it up and aim it at your chest..."</p><p></p><p>Before Elder Tiger could finish, Fang Yu had suddenly picked up the knife and slashed it across his own neck.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Fang Yu's voice rolled to the ground as his body swayed and collapsed, dead. -0.5</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger: ...</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger: ???</p><p>Elder Tiger: !!!</p><p></p><p>Elder Tiger was dumbfounded on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This... this, this, this, he just died? This guy is so hardcore? Directly slashing his own neck, he's so ruthless to himself!</p><p></p><p>After the bewilderment came elation.</p><p></p><p>The task was completed! To be honest, in all his time in the Black Tiger Gang, this was the first time Elder Tiger had seen someone commit suicide so decisively and cleanly.</p><p></p><p>But it in no way diminished Elder Tiger's exclamation of "Well done!"

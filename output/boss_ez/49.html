        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin didn't expect this to be the result.</p><p></p><p>When Old Zhou died in the community, she vaguely sensed the traces of a spirit.</p><p></p><p>So when she learned that Old Wang had also suddenly died, she rushed over to investigate.</p><p></p><p>This time, she did find the spirit.</p><p></p><p>But she discovered that thing was too powerful for her to defeat! "The Deathly Stillness Spirit..."</p><p></p><p>"How could this demonic thing appear here?"</p><p></p><p>"In my past life memories, Fang Yu once told me that after the apocalypse came, the neighboring East Gate City was not destroyed by nuclear bombs."</p><p></p><p>"But rather, all the people in the entire city, at the same time, were suddenly turned into a bloody mist and died."</p><p></p><p>"The real reason was that the Deathly Stillness Spirit, which had grown to its full power, wiped out the entire city's population in an instant!"</p><p></p><p>"The entire city, nearly ten million people, were exterminated in a moment, turning it into a dead city."</p><p></p><p>"After receiving the news, they were so frightened that they bombed it with nuclear weapons, sealing and isolating it, forming the ruins of a dead city."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin gnawed on her fingers anxiously, a habit left over from her past life.</p><p></p><p>"How could a spirit of this level appear so early!"</p><p></p><p>"The game has just started, and the apocalypse is at least a full year away!"</p><p></p><p>"Did the Deathly Stillness Spirit already exist in the past life, or has the world line really changed because of my rebirth, triggering the butterfly effect?"</p><p></p><p>"Also, this should be the spirit that caused the neighboring East Gate City to be wiped out overnight, so why did it appear in our Jiangnan City?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin didn't know the answers, she only knew the current situation was very tricky.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, Qi Xiaojin!"</p><p></p><p>"Think about Fang Yu! Think about what he has sacrificed to save you!"</p><p></p><p>"A mere Deathly Stillness Spirit, how can it make you waver like this!"</p><p></p><p>"The days to come are still long, the apocalypse, the struggle between humans and monsters, the destruction of spirits and gods..."</p><p></p><p>Phew--</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin suddenly stopped, took a deep breath, and exhaled heavily.</p><p></p><p>"Jie Jie?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stopped, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Just seeing Fang Yu's adorable appearance softened Qi Xiaojin's heart.</p><p></p><p>Yes.</p><p></p><p>There's no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>I still have time.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu is by my side, he hasn't left at all.</p><p></p><p>Protecting an entire city may be difficult.</p><p></p><p>But guarding one person is much simpler.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine," Qi Xiaojin shook her head slightly, her gaze gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go faster, oh right, shall we have lunch at my place?"</p><p></p><p>Go to Jie Jie's house for lunch?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately shook his head vigorously like a rattle.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had been there before! On the first day he moved in, Fang Yu's initial impression of Jie Jie was that she was beautiful, sweet-voiced, so gentle and cute, practically the dream image of a girl-next-door.</p><p></p><p>He had fantasized about a beautiful scenario that he shouldn't have.</p><p></p><p>When Jie Jie proposed a celebratory meal for the new tenant, with the landlord providing a free meal, Fang Yu immediately took the bait.</p><p></p><p>Until he personally tasted Jie Jie's cooking, blushing and forcing himself to swallow the half-raw fish meat.</p><p></p><p>The charred black pork, the potatoes as hard as stones, the salty dancing eggs on the tongue.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu could still vividly recall the dishes from that day.</p><p></p><p>That night, he went back and vomited three times, had diarrhea all night.</p><p></p><p>Ever since then, whenever Jie Jie said she was treating him to a meal, Fang Yu would pretend not to hear it.</p><p></p><p>This time would be no exception.</p><p></p><p>"That, Jie Jie, I'm in a career development period, I'm busy!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu showed an appeasing smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then next time."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin's eyes were smiling, not pressing Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"He doesn't know yet, how much hardship we've been through together in the apocalypse."</p><p></p><p>"I've also learned a lot of cooking skills because of that."</p><p></p><p>"Next time when you eat the food I make, you'll be in for a shock."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's presence was like a healing medicine, warming Qi Xiaojin's heart.</p><p></p><p>They had arrived at the community, Qi Xiaojin watched Fang Yu get on the elevator, and her gentle expression slowly receded, becoming calm and exuding a cold, aloof aura.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Humans have seven souls and six corporeal souls."</p><p></p><p>"The soul of destiny is outside the cycle, the cycle soul is the beginning."</p><p></p><p>"The cycle, thought, emptiness, heart, pearl, wisdom."</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the power of the young lifeless spirit should be between the [thought level] and the [emptiness level]."</p><p></p><p>"In its complete form, according to the previous life's Fang Yu's conjecture, it has likely already opened the seven souls and is a [six corporeal souls] level monster."</p><p></p><p>"Growth, too fast!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin felt a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>"The lifeless spirit will not dissipate even if the host dies."</p><p></p><p>"There are many types of spirits, and only believers and demons can destroy this kind of spirit."</p><p></p><p>"The lifeless spirit can initially only show the host a 24-hour countdown to death."</p><p></p><p>"As it grows, this countdown will gradually increase."</p><p></p><p>"The lifeless spirit that destroyed East Gate City, how long of a countdown could the hosts in the entire city see? Ten days? Or a month?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin couldn't quite remember.</p><p></p><p>After the apocalypse, death was just a number, and the city's destruction was just another news story. </p><p></p><p>At the time, she had been struggling just to survive, let alone worry about other things.</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought I could be reborn..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin gnawed on her fingers, gradually forming an idea.</p><p></p><p>"My alcohol flower spirit is only at the cycle level."</p><p></p><p>"The cycle, that is the cycle soul. </p><p></p><p>"The cycle soul is like a grinding wheel, tempering the body, refining the spirit, laying the foundation to contain stronger spirits."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I am still far from being a match for the lifeless spirit."</p><p></p><p>"I need time to grow!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin turned and walked down the hallway towards the security room.</p><p></p><p>"It has been confirmed that the two hosts of the lifeless spirit are both at Twin Babies Hospital."</p><p></p><p>"The dispute between Mr. Wang's family and the hospital over his death won't be resolved anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>"For now, the countdown should still be on the two hosts. Before it spreads to Mr. Wang's family members, I must drive out the entire Wang family and perform the separation."</p><p></p><p>"Additionally, I need to hire people to seal the entrances and exits, and anyone who has entered Twin Babies Hospital is not allowed to enter the community."</p><p></p><p>"The community's security is unreliable. I must hire a private security team to be responsible for the community's security and strictly enforce my orders."</p><p></p><p>The lifeless spirit cannot be killed now. </p><p></p><p>Once the lifeless spirit grows to a certain stage, anyone who has ever come into contact with its hosts will be infected.</p><p></p><p>That is, on the first night Mr. Zhou died, the entire community had already been infected and become backup hosts.</p><p></p><p>The only difference is when the lifeless spirit will mature enough to activate these backup hosts.</p><p></p><p>"Seize every moment, become stronger!"</p><p></p><p>After instructing the security guards and temporarily setting up a cordon, Qi Xiaojin immediately called a private security company, using her financial power to finalize an agreement. </p><p></p><p>Tomorrow, people will come to negotiate the contract.</p><p></p><p>Back home, lying on the bed and preparing to put on the game helmet to enter the game, Qi Xiaojin suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>"This life, barring any accidents, Fang Yu should still be born in Tianyuan Town."</p><p></p><p>"Three months later, Tianyuan Town will be destroyed by demons, leaving no trace."</p><p></p><p>"Should I go there for a visit?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin frowned, thinking, then shook her head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Inappropriate, the flapping of a butterfly's wings will cause huge changes."</p><p></p><p>"The demon's massacre of the city is both a crisis and an opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"In the previous life, Fang Yu was able to fight his way out of that environment and become so powerful."</p><p></p><p>"This opportunity, I should not interfere with it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Fang Yu, Qi Xiaojin's somewhat excited mood calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"Without a doubt, Fang Yu will also become a powerful believer this time."</p><p></p><p>"And I, having entered the game earlier this life, have already gained this ability."</p><p></p><p>"Soon, we will fight side by side as in the previous life!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the previous life, people called her and Fang Yu, the two believers, "divine lovers".</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin's ears started to flush slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Enter the game! Become stronger!"</p><p></p><p>Putting on the helmet.</p><p></p><p>The game begins!...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

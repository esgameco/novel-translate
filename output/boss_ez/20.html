        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu ladled out two bowls of congee and brought them to the table, then said, "Sit down and let me tell you slowly."</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, I followed Wang Er and the others, and we encountered a demon at the medicine shop."</p><p></p><p>"Wang Er and the others were all killed by the demon, and I was also cursed by the demon, turning me into this current state."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I managed to escape at the last moment and encountered the team led by Lord Qi Qianxuan of the Yudifu (Foolish Realm Palace)."</p><p></p><p>"He saved my life and also killed the demon, so I was able to come back alive."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister opened her eyes, half-believing and half-doubting.</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?"</p><p></p><p>"You can go ask the people from the Yudifu. Moreover, how could a demon enter the Yudifu and come out alive, right?"</p><p></p><p>This... made sense? The Second Sister believed a little more.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Second Sister's expression, Fang Yu dropped the act and revealed the truth.</p><p></p><p>He slapped down a letter.</p><p></p><p>It was addressed to the "Headmaster of the Yuantiwuguan (Primordial Body Martial Arts Hall)", written by Qi Qianxuan.</p><p></p><p>"Because I helped expose the demon, Lord Qi has recommended me to go to the martial arts hall to train. This is the recommendation letter he wrote for me."</p><p></p><p>Ah...</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister was stunned.</p><p></p><p>She lost her self-confidence.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that I was mistaken?</p><p></p><p>Just as she was thinking about it, Fang Yu slapped down a small bag, opened it, and revealed twenty taels of silver inside.</p><p></p><p>"Silver, silver?!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>She had forgotten how long it had been since she had seen silver.</p><p></p><p>As a textile workshop worker, her daily wage was a few copper coins. It would take a thousand copper coins to make one tael of silver, but with the family's situation, sometimes they didn't even have enough to eat, how could they have saved up any money.</p><p></p><p>After the eldest brother went missing, the situation had become even worse. The little congee Fang Yu cooked was all the remaining provisions in the household.</p><p></p><p>If she hadn't thought Fang Yu was a demon at the time, she wouldn't have been so calm about him wasting the last of their food.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty taels... twenty taels... Where did you get this from?"</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister's hands were trembling, her breathing rapid, gently caressing the silver.</p><p></p><p>But she soon regained control and looked up at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"This was also a reward from Lord Qi Qianxuan. The martial arts hall requires money for training, this is the tuition fee. I feel that Lord Qi values me greatly! Second Sister, we're going to have a good life from now on!"</p><p></p><p>How... eloquent...</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister became even more doubtful.</p><p></p><p>It felt both real and unreal.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fang Yu played his trump card, tearing off the tattered black cloth around his neck.</p><p></p><p>His severed head then rolled onto the table.</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister's eyes widened, and she opened her mouth to scream, but immediately covered her mouth, only retreating a few steps with a terrified expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by this?"</p><p></p><p>"...This is how I look after being cursed by the demon."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu silently cradled his head with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"After being cursed by the demon, it cut off my head. Although I didn't die, my head couldn't be reattached, so I ended up like this."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister carefully looked at the stump of Fang Yu's neck.</p><p></p><p>The wound had scarred over, with pulsing flesh, but... he was still alive.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit like the rumors about demons, but his behavior and actions were completely human, and he had even been to the Yudifu without incident.</p><p></p><p>"So... are you really Xiao Yi?"</p><p></p><p>"The one and only."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu smiled while holding his head.</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister's eyes immediately reddened.</p><p></p><p>She had believed nine-tenths of it.</p><p></p><p>She rushed into Fang Yu's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, you've been cursed by the demon and turned into this, and I still doubted you..."</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, it's all in the past now."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu comforted the Second Sister for a while, and she finally calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Good, the family hurdle should be cleared.</p><p></p><p>It was not in vain that I racked my brains last night.</p><p></p><p>Last night, after the Second Sister fainted, Fang Yu had carried her to the bed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After that, he also went into the room to find a bed to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Then he discovered that when the character is sleeping, if he doesn't exit the game, his perspective remains in a black screen state.</p><p></p><p>But he can hear the faint whistling sound of the wind in the room.</p><p></p><p>The wind sound changes from loud to soft, representing the character's sleep quality from light sleep to deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>It was during this period that he came up with his self-authentication method.</p><p></p><p>There's no other choice. If he doesn't explain it clearly to the Second Sister, and she takes him as a demon and attacks him, and the news spreads out, that would be very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>In Tianyuan Town, it's not just the Yudifu faction that exists, if other people have any ideas and treat him as a demon to eliminate, then the problem would be huge.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fangyu now only has a health bar but no combat power.</p><p></p><p>"First learn martial arts, be able to protect myself, and then talk about other things."</p><p></p><p>Fangyu put his head back on his neck, tied the broken black cloth, and tightened it with a knot.</p><p></p><p>This way, he can fix his head on his neck without having to hold it with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, let me do it."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>She went back to the room and then brought out a gray linen cloth strip that seemed to be torn off.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Fangyu's piece that looked like a floor rag, this gray linen at least could be worn out.</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister first untied Fangyu's rag, then wrapped the linen strip around him layer by layer, and finally tied an inconspicuous knot.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it has a decorative feel, but it doesn't look too out of place.</p><p></p><p>"Second Sister, this cloth is..."</p><p></p><p>Fangyu had checked the house when he got up early to make breakfast, it was so poor that even the mice would disdain it, there wasn't even a strand of hair.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary family, this quality of linen cloth strip might just be a casual piece of clothing.</p><p></p><p>But for their family, it was a high-quality clothing that was only worn once a year during the New Year.</p><p></p><p>"It's from the clothes I wear when working at the cloth workshop... I tore off a part of it, it won't affect it."</p><p></p><p>The clothes she wore when working part-time at the cloth workshop were already the best fabric she could bring out from her entire wardrobe.</p><p></p><p>And even if she said that, if your clothes were tattered when you went to work at the workshop, it would definitely have an impact, right?</p><p></p><p>Fangyu felt a bit moved in his heart, he didn't expect to be cared for by an NPC in this game, it felt a bit strange.</p><p></p><p>He took out 5 taels from the bag and pushed them in front of the Second Sister.</p><p></p><p>"Second Sister, take this money first, use it to buy some reserve food for the family, add some furniture and stuff. Also buy a few clothes for yourself, just spend it as you see fit."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister suddenly widened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No! You need to keep this money to go to the martial arts school to learn."</p><p></p><p>Although the Second Sister had never eaten pork, she had seen pigs run.</p><p></p><p>What is a martial arts school? It's a money-devouring place! Learning martial arts requires money, herbal medicines require money, meat dishes require money, interpersonal relationships require money.</p><p></p><p>Once you enter the martial arts school, there is no place where money is not needed.</p><p></p><p>Twenty taels may seem like a lot, but when Fangyu really enters the martial arts school, it won't be enough at all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he gives up the idea of the martial arts school and keeps this money, it would be enough to start a small business, and their life would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister looked at Fangyu.</p><p></p><p>She hopes her brother can live a better life.</p><p></p><p>If there's no opportunity, so be it, but now the opportunity is right in front of him, how can she hold him back because of her own desire for a peaceful life.</p><p></p><p>"Second Sister, you don't understand. I have a recommendation letter, I have connections, how much money do I need to spend to enter the martial arts school? Take this five taels, the family also needs this money to improve their living conditions."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, without caring about the Second Sister's reaction, he left the five taels of silver, took the letter and the other fifteen taels of silver, and left the house.</p><p></p><p>"It's about the right time, the martial arts school should be open for business. I'll go there first to enroll and be accepted as a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Afraid that the Second Sister would continue to hesitate, Fangyu had already run off, leaving the Second Sister with a puzzled expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>It took a while for the Second Sister to come back to her senses.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the direction Fangyu left, then at the silver on the table, and felt a warm feeling in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Since the disappearance of the eldest brother, this is the first time she has felt a sense of security.</p><p></p><p>That mischievous little brother, now seems to have become unusually heroic, able to support a family.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu walked in front, and Fang Yu followed behind.</p><p></p><p>Although Shi Chengmei had always said that the Yuanti Martial Arts Academy was very strict in recruiting disciples and had a small number of disciples, in reality, when Fang Yu took a quick glance around, he found that there were quite a lot of people.</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was filled with people, with varying levels of strength, some powerful and some weak.</p><p></p><p>They wore similar-style clothes, with an "Yuan" character embroidered on the chest. It seemed to be the identity mark of the martial arts academy, but it felt more like a school uniform.</p><p></p><p>Compared to them, Fang Yu's ordinary short outfit stood out and seemed out of place.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu was evaluating them, these people were also secretly observing Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Is he the new disciple the master brought today?"</p><p></p><p>"It should be him, he hasn't even changed his clothes."</p><p></p><p>"Another one who got in through the back door."</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many bowls of medicinal soup he drank?"</p><p></p><p>"I bet fifty bowls, these spoiled brats who got in through connections love to splash money around."</p><p></p><p>"Look! He's going to the ox post area."</p><p></p><p>"His qi and blood are unstable, his steps are unsteady, it's clear he hasn't even reached the threshold of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"These spoiled brats, instead of being good young masters, they insist on coming here to suffer, I don't know what they're thinking."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anymore, the good show is about to start. Do you remember the last one who got in through the back door? He punched the ox post and ended up breaking his own hand, haha!"</p><p></p><p>"As for Lin Guanzi, even after his injury has healed, he's still struggling with his qi. His entire qi and blood have been depleted by the pursuit of women, he has no energy to cultivate martial arts. On the day he joined the academy, he drank thirty bowls of medicinal soup but still couldn't even enter the door, truly a waste."</p><p></p><p>"So you think this new disciple can do any better? He's just the second Lin Guanzi."</p><p></p><p>"Wait! Quick, look! He's going to... the challenge ox post!"</p><p></p><p>"No way! Is he really going to use up his challenge opportunity on the first day of joining?"</p><p></p><p>"What a waste! A huge waste! He should conserve his energy and wait to practice for a few months before challenging the ox post, he could at least get two taels of silver. But now he's challenging it, two taels is already a lot!"</p><p></p><p>"He's overestimating himself!"</p><p></p><p>"Hey, there's going to be a good show!"</p><p></p><p>Many people around stopped their training and looked towards Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't pay any attention to them.</p><p></p><p>According to what Lin Wu said, the wooden posts in this area were called "ox posts", and they were more suitable for new disciples.</p><p></p><p>The ox posts were set up in a special way, they were movable wooden posts connected to a rail-like structure on the ground, with markings on the side.</p><p></p><p>The posts were fixed in the initial position, with two ox horn-like decorations on the top, hence the name "ox post".</p><p></p><p>When the challenger punched the post, the force would push the tightly locked post backwards, and the distance it moved would indicate the power of the punch.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu reached out and felt the ox post, it was heavy and solid. This weight would require a lot of strength to punch and not let the post slide out.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be nervous, a normal person's full-force punch on the ox post can usually push it about 1 mark, which we call 1 ox force."</p><p></p><p>"If one has reached the threshold of the martial dao, they should be able to reach around 1.5 or 1.8 marks, basically not exceeding 2 ox forces."</p><p></p><p>"Through cultivation, one can gradually increase their strength and push the post further."</p><p></p><p>"This is a kind of incentive mechanism in the academy, allowing some disciples who are not wealthy but have talent to at least afford the second month's living expenses."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu explained the principle of the ox post, and Fang Yu had already prepared himself, standing in front of the ox post.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu stopped his explanation and asked, "Are you sure you want to use up this challenge opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't say anything, he was concentrating.</p><p></p><p>Then, he raised his fist high.</p><p></p><p>The power of this punch would determine how many taels of silver he could get! He must give it his all!!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers around them secretly stretched their necks.</p><p></p><p>"That new disciple is really going to challenge the wooden post!"</p><p></p><p>"He's about to punch!"</p><p></p><p>"Place your bets! Guess how many ox forces he can achieve!"</p><p></p><p>"I bet 1 ox force! For someone who hasn't reached the martial dao threshold, this is already the limit."</p><p></p><p>"I bet 1.5 ox forces, since he dares to challenge the ox post, he should have some ability, but not much."</p><p></p><p>"That's too high, the previous record for new disciples was only 1.8 ox forces, if he can even touch the edge, it would be good, let alone 1.5."</p><p></p><p>"I bet 0 ox forces, the ox post won't move at all!"</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha haha—"</p><p></p><p>The crowd immediately burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Fang Yu's fist heavily struck the ox post.</p><p></p><p>Bang!!</p><p></p><p>An unusual explosive sound suddenly drowned out the surrounding noise.</p><p></p><p>Wuwuwu—</p><p></p><p>The ox post, hit by this powerful force, let out a harsh scraping sound as it slid along the track on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The tremendous impact force brought by Fang Yu's punch easily pushed the ox post past the 1 mark distance, continuing to slide towards the 2 mark.</p><p></p><p>The laughter of the crowd abruptly stopped, their eyes widening.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh—</p><p></p><p>It surpassed the 2 mark.</p><p></p><p>"He broke 2 ox forces?!"</p><p></p><p>"2 ox forces, he's already reached the martial dao threshold!"</p><p></p><p>"It's still sliding forward! This new disciple has such great strength!"</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible! He's about to break 3 ox forces!"</p><p></p><p>"He broke it!!"</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>The sound immediately drew more people to look in this direction.</p><p></p><p>1 mark, 2 marks, 3 marks! 3 ox forces! And the ox post was still sliding forward! 4 ox, it passed the 4 ox mark!</p><p></p><p>Until it slowly came to a stop near the 5 ox force mark.</p><p></p><p>The final result... 4.7 ox forces!!</p><p></p><p>The venue fell into complete silence.</p><p></p><p>After a long while...</p><p></p><p>Hiss—</p><p></p><p>Someone sucked in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"A monster newcomer!"</p><p></p><p>"Is this really a new disciple? Not some senior brother pretending to mess with us?"</p><p></p><p>"4.7 ox-power? When I first entered the martial arts hall, I could only unleash 2 ox-power after passing the martial arts threshold."</p><p></p><p>"Who doesn't start that way? When we first broke through the martial arts threshold, most of us could only unleash 2-3 ox-power. Later, after I broke through the 'Primordial Body Stabilizing Technique', I had 4 ox-power, but... this newcomer has such strength right from the start!"</p><p></p><p>"Where did the master pick up this treasure? Did he pull some strings to recruit him?"</p><p></p><p>"4 taels of silver and 700 coins! 4 taels of silver and 700 coins!! I'm so jealous!!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I wonder why I didn't have this kind of strength back then, this is 4 taels of silver after all!"</p><p></p><p>Some were enviously exclaiming, others were green with envy.</p><p></p><p>But without exception, they all acknowledged Fang Yu's strength.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone's imagination was running wild.</p><p></p><p>Some even overturned the idea that Fang Yu had come in through the back door.</p><p></p><p>"He must have been specially recruited! The master must have discovered this precious jade and specially recruited him!"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he finished the assessment so quickly, it's completely because the master has an discerning eye and saw the extraordinary qualities of the new disciple at a glance!"</p><p></p><p>A rumor about a monster newcomer who had 4 ox-power right from the start quickly spread.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts training ground at the Ox Stake was soon surrounded by a circle of people, all coming to watch the excitement, or to make connections.</p><p></p><p>Such a newcomer was not often seen.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu didn't care about them, he was excited the moment he saw the results.</p><p></p><p>"4.7 ox! 4 taels and 700 coins!! 4 taels and 700 coins!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu next to him was even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Fang Yu's shout, he finally came to his senses.</p><p></p><p>This new disciple brother is really a monster!</p><p></p><p>He took out a notebook from his pocket, opened it, and recorded Fang Yu's results.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out 4 taels and 700 coins, and handed them to Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"So direct?"</p><p></p><p>"You can guess why Sister Mei asked me to bring you over. I'm responsible for this."</p><p></p><p>So Lin Wu gave the money so readily.</p><p></p><p>He was a part-time record keeper and reward distributor at the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>On the back of the notebook, Lin Wu also gave Fang Yu an 'A' grade assessment of his potential as a new disciple.</p><p></p><p>The ratings of the other people on this page were all B or C grade, only Fang Yu was an A grade.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu looked at Fang Yu again, feeling that Fang Yu's future achievements in the martial arts hall would not be low.</p><p></p><p>As for Fang Yu, who had received the money, he was glowing with joy.</p><p></p><p>This 4 taels, plus the 1 tael he had on hand, plus the 5 taels from his second sister, should be enough to pay off the debt for destroying the table in the martial arts hall...</p><p></p><p>Hopefully his second sister hasn't spent the money yet.</p><p></p><p>It's really true that a penny can defeat a mighty man.</p><p></p><p>Before joining the martial arts hall, Fang Yu was full of heroic spirit.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was so poor that he just wanted to frantically earn money.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother Lin, are there any other benefits for new disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu pointed to the ox stake.</p><p></p><p>"New disciples within the first six months, if they can push the ox stake to the maximum 10 mark, will be rewarded with 10 taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>Swoosh—</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's gaze immediately fixed on the ox stake, full of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>10 taels of silver! This ox stake, I'm going to conquer it! Even Jesus can't stop me!</p><p></p><p>But for now he wasn't in a hurry. After that one punch, Fang Yu clearly felt that he hadn't fully unleashed his potential. </p><p></p><p>Things like his posture, the adjustment of his body strength, the rhythm of his force release, hadn't reached the most perfect point yet.</p><p></p><p>He needed to practice more first, get familiar with his strengthened body, and then go for the 10 ox-power! Fang Yu was just thinking about this when he suddenly looked up and found the area was crowded with people.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, newcomer, what's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard, his name is Diao Deyi! Our new disciple brother!"</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, impressive! 4.7 ox-power in one punch! He has some of my old style!"</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, give us another punch!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple brother Diao, let me try you out!"</p><p></p><p>These people were quite friendly and familiar.</p><p></p><p>They cheerfully greeted Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>The last one even shamelessly jumped over, and punched the restored ox stake.</p><p></p><p>Bang! One punch, the ox stake slid out to the 9 mark.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up at the guy blankly.</p><p></p><p>【Silver Essence: 45/45.】</p><p></p><p>45 health points?</p><p></p><p>Are you sure you're not here to cause trouble?</p><p></p><p>Is this how you treat your junior brother? With your health, you're punching the ox stake? The ox stake is going to be smashed by you!  Go punch the tiger stake next door!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu also understood a bit more. Next door there was also a tiger stake, which required 1 tiger-power.</p><p></p><p>That was the wooden stake area for these senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, excuse me!"</p><p></p><p>This Silver Essence senior brother was actually quite proud, smiling and accepting the cheers of the audience, without any shame!</p><p></p><p>Winning against a just-entered disciple brother, aren't you ashamed!</p><p></p><p>"Again! Who else wants to challenge Diao Deyi! Place your bets, place your bets."</p><p></p><p>The training ground was unusually lively today.</p><p></p><p>The enthusiasm for punching the ox stake was high, and it was all because of Fang Yu's appearance.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since they had seen a new disciple brother with such potential, truly a rising star, the new wave pushing out the old. The future was promising! Quickly, before Fang Yu grew stronger, they should make connections and build relationships. Otherwise, in the future they might not even have the chance to meet him.</p><p></p><p>This was the martial arts hall's future star, high above the common people!</p><p></p><p>"Let me try as well!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Wu, carried away by the atmosphere, also wanted to take a punch.</p><p></p><p>Bang! One punch, the ox stake slid to the 7 ox mark.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

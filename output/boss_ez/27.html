        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu realized something.</p><p></p><p>Under similar blood conditions, the people of the Fool's Underworld seemed to be stronger than the people of the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>Like Lin Wu, who had over 30 blood but could only unleash 7 ox-like force.</p><p></p><p>If he were in Xian Qianxuan's team, he would have been killed by the demons long ago, not even qualified to join the team.</p><p></p><p>As for Fang Yu himself, he had thrown over a dozen punches, each one with full force, and had gradually mastered the most suitable punching posture.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that he was a bit exhausted.</p><p></p><p>So now whenever others called him to punch, he would just wave his hand, refusing to do it, sitting down to rest and recover his strength.</p><p></p><p>His physique couldn't keep up.</p><p></p><p>This stamina, he was afraid that halfway through a fight, he would simply run out of energy.</p><p></p><p>Something was wrong, very wrong.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu consulted Lin Wu beside him.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite normal," Lin Wu said.</p><p></p><p>"For a punch like yours with full force, it's actually quite difficult to pull off in actual combat. Because it requires preparatory movements, and the opponent also needs to give you that opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, in my daily sparring, my upper limit can reach 7 ox-like force, but in actual combat it's only around 3-5 ox-force."</p><p></p><p>"The significance of accumulating martial arts and combat experience is to give us more opportunities to find the chance to unleash a full-powered strike."</p><p></p><p>"As for you getting exhausted after a dozen punches, in actual combat you won't even have the chance to do that many, so your stamina should generally be enough."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we also need to cultivate our qi and blood every day, so our physical fitness and physique are constantly improving."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu understood.</p><p></p><p>Combat is not like hitting a wooden post.</p><p></p><p>The enemy will dodge, evade, and block.</p><p></p><p>There won't be that many opportunities for full-powered punches.</p><p></p><p>So the stamina is sufficient, and the damage will also fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, improving one's physique can increase stamina, allowing for a few more full-powered punches.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at the system prompt records.</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Player diligently practices "Primal Body Stabilization Technique", proficiency +1.]</p><p>[System prompt: Player diligently practices "Primal Body Stabilization Technique", proficiency +1.]</p><p>[System prompt: Player diligently practices "Primal Body Stabilization Technique", proficiency +1, experience +1.]</p><p></p><p>Just three prompts.</p><p></p><p>After throwing over a dozen punches and almost collapsing from exhaustion, it only triggered three prompts.</p><p></p><p>A total of proficiency +3, experience +1.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the "Primal Body Stabilization Technique", there's no need to guide the qi anymore.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it's about mobilizing one's own qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>The initial qi guidance was just to stimulate the entire body's qi and blood, triggering a certain physical transformation.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, by mobilizing the qi and blood, engaging in large-scale movements, and exhausting the physical strength, one can incidentally cultivate the "Primal Body Stabilization Technique" and increase its proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Opened the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Diao Deyi]</p><p>[Realm: Initial Flower Realm]</p><p>[Health: 22/22]</p><p>[Physique: 2.2] + [Spirit: 1.7] + [Skills: Digital Life [Human], Primal Body Stabilization Technique [Flower/Slight Mastery (3/300)]+]</p><p>[Attribute Points: 2]</p><p>[Experience: 19/100]</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Yu finally understood the lament of those players on the forum.</p><p></p><p>The experience growth is truly slow.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Spirit attribute, he had researched online, and most people said it was...useless.</p><p></p><p>Some speculated that Spirit might represent aptitude, martial arts comprehension, and cultivation efficiency.</p><p></p><p>But in reality, after some people allocated points to it, they concluded that it had no effect at all.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit attribute is like a waste attribute, having no impact on the character.</p><p></p><p>Far less practical and reliable than directly adding 10 points to Health.</p><p></p><p>At least in the early stage of the game, this seems to be the case.</p><p></p><p>The general conclusion is that the Spirit attribute is yet to be developed.</p><p></p><p>Translating it simply means: the future is promising.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the remaining 2 attribute points on the panel.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought for a moment and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>All 2 attribute points will be allocated to the "Primal Body Stabilization Technique"!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He realized that if he relied solely on diligent practice, mastering the "Primal Essence Cultivation Technique" would be an endless struggle.</p><p></p><p>But as a player, the biggest advantage is that martial arts can be directly upgraded by clicking.</p><p></p><p>The difference between 20 HP and 30 HP in physique attributes doesn't feel that significant.</p><p></p><p>The only benefit is probably the increase in stamina capacity.</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the power of others' one-punch nine-ox strikes, these extra twenty or thirty HP are just the difference of taking one more hit.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing is that he desperately needs money right now!</p><p></p><p>And to get money, the quickest way is to upgrade the ox-splitting skill to level 10! Therefore... All in! Deep blue, add points!!</p><p></p><p>[Attribute points: 2 → 0.]</p><p></p><p>[Primal Essence Cultivation Technique [Slight Mastery] → Primal Essence Cultivation Technique [Gradually Improving].]</p><p></p><p>[Primal Essence Cultivation Technique [Gradually Improving] → Primal Essence Cultivation Technique [Reaching Perfection].]</p><p></p><p>Boom! His aura shook throughout his body.</p><p></p><p>His bones creaked softly, as if the bone density had become even denser.</p><p></p><p>Strength.</p><p></p><p>Strength was surging up!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu sneered fiercely and pushed aside Lin Wu, who was about to hit the ox-splitting log again.</p><p></p><p>"Let me do it!"</p><p></p><p>The sudden burst of great strength made Lin Wu stagger back a few steps, almost falling over.</p><p></p><p>Turning back and seeing that it was Fang Yu who had moved, he couldn't help but look astonished.</p><p></p><p>How did his strength suddenly increase so much? The onlooking crowd, seeing Fang Yu's return, started to scream and cheer excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Wow! The infamous Diaode is back!"</p><p></p><p>"Hit it, hit it! Hurry up and throw a punch! We've been waiting for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, the super newcomer Diaode is attacking again!"</p><p></p><p>"Diaode, punch!!"</p><p></p><p>Even though it was just ordinary ox-splitting, Fang Yu's previous strikes didn't differ much, all around 4 oxen.</p><p></p><p>But the observing seniors still loved to watch, and the atmosphere was very lively.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu tilted his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Since that's the case, I won't pretend anymore.</p><p></p><p>I'll show my hand.</p><p></p><p>This punch from Diaode will let you all witness what a true Super Saiyan can do!" This punch..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu raised his fist.</p><p></p><p>"Is called..."</p><p></p><p>Aiming at the ox-splitting log.</p><p></p><p>"Devastation!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! The air waves exploded from the ox-splitting log, frantically sliding and emitting a piercing wail! The cheers of the entire crowd reached a climax, with the sound waves getting higher and higher!...</p><p></p><p>1 minute ago.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Diaode is practicing on the ox-splitting field in front."</p><p></p><p>Shi Cangmei led the way.</p><p></p><p>She really didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>Just by putting Diaode in there, how did the entire ox-splitting crowd gather together?</p><p></p><p>"Cangmei, are you sure Diaode has learned the Primal Essence Cultivation Technique and crossed the martial arts threshold?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I can assure you it's true! I witnessed it with my own eyes."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that I misjudged?</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a glance.</p><p></p><p>But based on his assessment, Diaode's aptitude wasn't that good.</p><p></p><p>And his age was already quite advanced, starting martial arts at 16 years old, when the "yellow flowers have already wilted," there's no precedent of someone at this age starting martial arts and still achieving great success.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, what? It's that even in Lian Li's letter, he only pointed out Fang Yu's boldness, and had a negative attitude towards Diaode's martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>That kind of person, you're telling me he crossed the martial arts threshold in a single day?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Diaode's aptitude is not actually poor? A late bloomer? That shouldn't be the case.</p><p></p><p>As the headmaster of the martial arts school, Yuan Hongxin's judgment of people is quite accurate.</p><p></p><p>When it comes to aptitude, he has very high requirements, so taking in disciples has always been difficult, and the number of people in the school has never increased much.</p><p></p><p>Those he determined to have no growth potential have never proven him wrong before.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... that Diaode will become the first person he misjudged?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter ends)</p>

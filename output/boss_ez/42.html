        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>This is the truth of life! Big Brother Tiger had never seen anyone lose their head and still not die.</p><p></p><p>So Big Brother Tiger took Second Sister and strode towards the corpse of Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>"You see, it's all taken care of now!"</p><p></p><p>He said as he walked, full of pride like a victor.</p><p></p><p>"When I, Big Brother Tiger, take action, there's nothing I can't handle."</p><p></p><p>He enjoyed the fruits of victory as if completing a routine task.</p><p></p><p>"If one is human, they have weaknesses. I don't need to be stronger than others, I just need to be stronger than their weaknesses!"</p><p></p><p>"Look, Jiao Deyi, this is the fate of those who go against me..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, after walking ten steps, Big Brother Tiger abruptly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>There was a slight difference from the usual atmosphere of victory.</p><p></p><p>So he stopped and pondered.</p><p></p><p>And then he looked sideways!</p><p></p><p>Yes! What he was looking at was not the headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>But the one beside it... Jiao Ruru!</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger realized that something was missing in this moment.</p><p></p><p>It was the heart-wrenching cries of a grieving family member, the agonizing screams, the intense and almost suffocating curses.</p><p></p><p>But this Jiao Ruru, unlike the previous 'hostages', did not have the expected intense reaction to witnessing the 'family member's' death.</p><p></p><p>Apart from nervousness and worry, she even seemed... excited? A sense of unease crept into Big Brother Tiger's heart, and he hastily looked towards the corpse.</p><p></p><p>The headless corpse, motionless, without any flaws.</p><p></p><p>There was a large pool of blood on the ground, and blood was even spurting out from the severed neck of the corpse.</p><p></p><p>The corpse, it was truly dead.</p><p></p><p>But the family member's reaction was not up to par!</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense Big Brother Tiger's gaze, Second Sister hurriedly made muffled sounds, excitedly shouting something.</p><p></p><p>But emotionally, Big Brother Tiger could no longer feel the authenticity.</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger was a man who only believed in his own instincts.</p><p></p><p>So he reached back, gripping the knife.</p><p></p><p>Aiming at the corpse of Fang Yu in front of him, he threw it with force!!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh—</p><p></p><p>The long knife pierced through the air.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm mmm mmm?!!" Jiao Ruru's eyes widened, her body trembling, resisting fiercely.</p><p></p><p>This reaction was right! Big Brother Tiger's mouth curled into a sinister smile as he grabbed Jiao Ruru's neck tightly, staring intently at the headless corpse in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!!</p><p></p><p>The knife precisely pierced the chest of the headless corpse, sinking three inches in! -13!</p><p></p><p>[Jiao Deyi: 8.5/22.]</p><p></p><p>What Big Brother Tiger couldn't see were the vivid critical damage numbers floating out from the headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>The knife entered the chest.</p><p></p><p>But the corpse did not move.</p><p></p><p>Only the hostage in his hand, her emotions were intense and genuine.</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger, the corners of his mouth curled upwards.</p><p></p><p>This headless corpse should be dead now, right?</p><p></p><p>Holding the hostage, he continued forward, approaching the headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>He sneered, roughly shoving Jiao Ruru aside, tightly gripping the knife in the headless corpse's chest and forcefully pushing it down! Sizzle!!</p><p></p><p>The blade sank deeper into the body, protruding from the back and embedding into the ground. -5!</p><p></p><p>[Jiao Deyi: 2.5/22.]</p><p></p><p>Blood from the chest gushed out like a hot spring, staining the ground.</p><p></p><p>"The heart has been completely pierced through."</p><p></p><p>"This time, you should be dead for sure!"</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger's face contorted with savagery. -0.5.</p><p></p><p>The torn wound continued to inflict damage.</p><p></p><p>[Jiao Deyi: 2/22.]</p><p></p><p>"Mmm mmm mmm!!!"</p><p></p><p>Second Sister wailed bitterly, tears streaming down her face.</p><p></p><p>"See, doesn't this feel right?"</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger released his grip, looking at Second Sister, his mood elated.</p><p></p><p>"If one is human, they have weaknesses. I don't need to be stronger than others, I just need to be stronger than their weaknesses!"</p><p></p><p>This was how Big Brother Tiger had been thriving in the Black Tiger Gang. As long as he didn't cross any moral boundaries, there was nothing he couldn't do by targeting people's weaknesses! -0.5.</p><p></p><p>[Jiao Deyi: 1.5/22.]</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger stepped forward, about to approach Second Sister.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Jiao Deyi, I'll take good care of your sister. I'll play with her enough and then send her to the brothel to earn money for me, that's the long-term plan..."</p><p></p><p>Big Brother Tiger's endless chatter suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The entire moment froze as if he had been electrocuted, and he slowly widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Because just now, he thought he heard... the corpse, speaking. -0.5.</p><p></p><p>[Jiao Deyi: 0.5/22.]</p><p></p><p>As if realizing something, Big Brother Tiger quickly turned around to look at the headless corpse.</p><p></p><p>Only to see the supposedly dead Fang Yu, whose severed head was calmly observing Big Brother Tiger, as if looking at... a corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Deep Blue... Add point!"</p><p></p><p>[Attribute Point: 1→0.]</p><p>[Constitution: 2.2→3.2.]</p><p>[Life: 0.5/22→10.5/32.]</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A warm flow swept through his entire body.</p><p>Strength surged up.</p><p></p><p>"You?!" <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>In the moment Big Brother Tiger recoiled in terror.</p><p></p><p>Slap!!</p><p></p><p>A large hand, like a vise, firmly gripped the back of his retreating neck!</p><p></p><p>"Jiao, Jiao Deyi?!!"</p><p></p><p>The Fang Yu with the knife in his chest slowly rose.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's me."</p><p></p><p>A calm voice, as if there were no ripples. It came from the severed head on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Headless, yet still alive? Pierced through the heart, yet able to rise again! As if realizing something, Tiger Brother cried out in shock.</p><p></p><p>"You are a demon..."</p><p></p><p>Bang!!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's fist the size of a sandbag had already smashed into his cheek! As if struck by a ton of iron, the terrifying impact force directly shattered his facial bones, broke his nose, and burst his left eyeball.</p><p></p><p>The sunken fist print sank deep into half his face, extinguishing his consciousness in an instant. -25!! [Yang Hu: 0/25.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Yang Hu], gained 8 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Congratulations, player has diligently practiced [Elemental Body Stabilization], proficiency +1.]</p><p></p><p>Blood spurted out, splashing all over Fang Yu's face.</p><p></p><p>One punch, dead! </p><p></p><p>This is... my full-force strike! Throwing away Tiger Brother's corpse, Fang Yu swiped and pulled out the knife on his chest, panting heavily. -1.</p><p></p><p>[Diao De Yi: 9.5/32.]</p><p></p><p>Although he lost another 1 point of blood, at least the bleeding had stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm mmm mmm?!!!"</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the Second Sister, seeing the resurrected Fang Yu, was almost trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>She ran over and pressed her face against Fang Yu's chest.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Although it hurt quite a bit, as a digitized body, as long as he didn't lose blood, he would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu only now noticed that the Second Sister's hands were also bound, no wonder she couldn't remove the rag in her mouth before speaking.</p><p></p><p>Using the knife edge, he cut the ropes, and the Second Sister immediately started frantically feeling all over Fang Yu's body.</p><p></p><p>"I really am fine."</p><p></p><p>"Mmm mmm mmm!" The Second Sister glared, as if scolding him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pointed to his mouth.</p><p></p><p>She finally realized, and quickly removed the rag from her mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De Yi, are you crazy, are you crazy! Big Brother is already on the verge of life and death, and now you want me to lose you too, right!"</p><p></p><p>"You crazy person! Crazy!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how scared I was of you... so scared of you..."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, she started crying again, burying her face in his chest.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on here?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came from the doorway.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, his pupils suddenly contracted, his body stiffened, and his entire bloodstream seemed to freeze into ice in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Because, a man dressed as a Fool of the Underworld had entered the room.</p><p></p><p>And the name displayed above his head was...</p><p></p><p>[Yue Guang: 605/605.]</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Fang Yu's heart raced, his hands and feet turned icy cold, as if he had fallen into an icy pit.</p><p></p><p>Just out of the wolf's den, and into the tiger's mouth, huh.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang seemed to have noticed the severed head on the ground at a glance.</p><p></p><p>And... the knife wound in the chest.</p><p></p><p>His eyes fixed intently on Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Thud! Thud! He strode over.</p><p></p><p>With every step, Fang Yu's heart pounded with fear!</p><p></p><p>Like a cat with its fur on end, he desperately wanted to turn around and run! But Fang Yu suppressed this impulse.</p><p></p><p>Because, he couldn't escape.</p><p></p><p>Faced with such a huge power gap, he had no chance of escaping! But when Yue Guang walked up to him and frowned, stopping in front of him, Fang Yu suddenly felt that the other party didn't seem to have the intent to kill.</p><p></p><p>"Fool, the great lord of the Underworld, the situation is not as you think, Diao De Yi is..."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister desperately tried to explain something, but suddenly her vision blurred.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, a large hand almost covered her entire field of vision, as if ready to crush her head at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister opened her mouth wide in shock, at a loss for words, momentarily speechless.</p><p></p><p>But the owner of that large hand didn't even bother to look at her, his hand flashing with a blue light, and the Second Sister directly passed out and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang, however, kept his gaze fixed on the wound in Fang Yu's chest, where the heart representing humanity had a knife-shaped hole, but... the heart was still beating strongly.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang's gaze moved up, finally resting on Fang Yu's face.</p><p></p><p>He slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Why didn't you get rid of her?"</p><p></p><p>Her? Fang Yu was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>His brain only thought for less than half a second, and immediately understood the other party's meaning.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang was referring to the Second Sister.</p><p></p><p>But what's the situation now? Why would I need to get rid of the Second Sister?</p><p></p><p>Why is Yue Guang treating me this way?</p><p></p><p>His heart pounding, Fang Yu thought for a moment, then said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"She's still useful."</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang picked up Fang Yu's severed head and placed it back on his body.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at the knife wound piercing Fang Yu's heart, then glanced up at him.</p><p></p><p>"You were too careless."</p><p></p><p>"Since you've already sacrificed a comrade to take on a high position, don't act rashly again, and watch your mouth! Eat fewer people!"</p><p></p><p>"Also, during the gathering back then, why don't I have any impression of you? Why did Frost Sequence Demon send you to carry out the plan instead of coming herself? What are you to her?"</p><p></p><p>Frost Sequence Demon? Gathering?</p><p></p><p>High position?</p><p></p><p>Does that mean... he thinks I'm a demonic comrade? Killed another demon, took on a high position, and infiltrated human society? (End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Damn!! You really have issues!! How could Fang Yu dare to stay any longer? He almost didn't even think and just turned around and ran! The main entrance was right in front of him, so Fang Yu took a running start and jumped over the threshold.</p><p></p><p>Just at that moment, a roar like that of a wild beast suddenly came from behind.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hadn't even reacted to what was happening...</p><p></p><p>Whooshâ€”</p><p></p><p>A bloody severed head flew past him.</p><p></p><p>[Zhao Tian: 0/0.]</p><p></p><p>That was... Zhao Tian's head.</p><p></p><p>His face still had an expression of shock and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Fang Yu's pupils constricted, and his heart was pounding.</p><p></p><p>As soon as his feet hit the ground, he looked back and couldn't help but take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Only to see that the blood bar displayed in the room had already dropped by seven or eight segments.</p><p></p><p>Among the four-man team that was supposed to be holding down the white-robed youth, Youmu, his upper body had been thrown onto the large table in the middle of the room, his intestines and organs spilled all over the table, the floor and walls covered in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>And that white-robed youth was now stepping on Wang Er's head, biting into the jugular vein of the shopkeeper's wife. As if sensing some gaze, he tilted his head slightly to look at Fang Yu at the doorway.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his mouth curving up slightly, it was a standard crooked smile of the Dragon King!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the white-robed youth bit through the wife's neck, spraying blood all over his face.</p><p></p><p>"Help, help..."</p><p></p><p>Wang Er's trembling voice had just come out...</p><p></p><p>Bang!!</p><p></p><p>His head was crushed by the white-robed youth's foot. -111!</p><p></p><p>The exaggerated damage numbers popped up from Wang Er's blood bar, directly causing it to disappear, and also making Fang Yu's soul shudder.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't dare to stay for even half a second, almost turning around and running!</p><p></p><p>"Saliran!! Help! Murder! Murder!!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu ran while shouting at the top of his lungs.</p><p></p><p>Luckily, the outside of the pharmacy was the main street, with a few people on the street, but not many.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't dare to stop for even half a second, running and shouting, but strangely, the white-robed youth in the pharmacy still hadn't come chasing after him.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fang Yu remembered the white-robed youth's killing of the mother and Wang Er, as well as the instantly depleted blood bars, and immediately realized.</p><p></p><p>He wants to eliminate all witnesses! </p><p>No one in the pharmacy can be left alive! He's still cleaning up the living people in the pharmacy!</p><p></p><p>But why? Why would he do this? What is he trying to hide? Fang Yu was still thinking about it when suddenly a figure flashed by next to him, shouting in an even louder voice.</p><p></p><p>"Murder!! Diao De-one is murdering!! Diao De-one is murdering!!!"</p><p></p><p>What the hell?! Who?! The villain reporting the crime first??</p><p></p><p>Turning his head to look, it was actually that white-robed youth with his arms severed, covered in blood! Fuck! Your frame-up makes no sense at all! I'm the good guy!!</p><p></p><p>"Saliran! Saliran!! Li Bai Gu is murdering!!"</p><p></p><p>"Murder!! Diao De-one is murdering!! Diao De-one is murdering!!!"</p><p></p><p>What are you doing!! Ouch!!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was so anxious that he was about to reveal his chicken feet.</p><p></p><p>A youth with his arms severed, constantly bleeding, was running in front of him shouting that he had committed murder, and anyone who saw this would think it was me chasing after him!</p><p></p><p>Freak! You're playing it so twisted! After killing people, you even try to frame me? Might as well just kill me with a knife! Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>He doesn't dare to kill me? Or he doesn't dare to kill me in public, what does that mean? It means this guy has something to fear! </p><p></p><p>I'm not running anymore! I'm going back to the crime scene!</p><p></p><p>As long as I can prove my innocence, then this guy is doomed, right? Thinking of this, Fang Yu suddenly slammed on the brakes and turned around, running back towards the pharmacy. This maneuver made the fleeing white-robed youth pause for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But the next instant, he immediately started chasing after Fang Yu again.</p><p></p><p>"Murder! Diao De-one is murdering!"</p><p></p><p>"You keep shouting! You keep shouting! If you shout again, I'll tell..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You, Diao De-yi, are so bad! But you can't get any better! You are just so evil!" The young man in white clothes continued to shout that Diao De-yi had committed murder.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu also didn't care, and joined in the shouting, seeing who had the loudest voice.</p><p></p><p>The two "murder!" cries overlapped, and all the people on the street gathered around.</p><p></p><p>"Damn! What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that someone was murdered. In broad daylight, this Diao De-yi killed over ten people in the medicine shop, leaving only the shop owner's son to escape!"</p><p></p><p>"That's so cruel?!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes! I heard that Diao De-yi just joined the Black Tiger Casino yesterday, and today he committed such a big crime. If he's not arrested and executed, how can we live our lives in the future?"</p><p></p><p>"He's so ruthless! Doesn't anyone do anything about it?"</p><p></p><p>"We're just waiting for the constables to come arrest him."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the discussion, Fang Yu had already been labeled as the criminal.</p><p></p><p>This is not scientific at all!</p><p></p><p>I'm the victim here!</p><p></p><p>The direction of this is wrong!</p><p></p><p>Although that guy chasing him with a severed hand did look like a victim, the facts are not as you think!</p><p></p><p>"You're mistaken! He's the murderer! He's the killer!!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu ran towards the crowd to explain, frightening them and causing them to scream in terror.</p><p></p><p>"Don't come near us!!"</p><p></p><p>"Murder! Diao De-yi is going to kill someone!!"</p><p></p><p>"Run!!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd in front scattered, except for a man wearing a wide-brimmed hat who remained standing, silently watching Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Great! Someone still believes me!</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking this, the man suddenly started muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>"Why should I be afraid?"</p><p></p><p>"He's a homicidal maniac!"</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter, I will intervene."</p><p></p><p>What solo performance are you putting on here...</p><p></p><p>And "I will intervene" - isn't that internet slang? Are you a player? Looking at the man's health bar:</p><p></p><p>[Puppy Egg: 8/8.]</p><p></p><p>No, you only have 8 HP, what are you pretending to be? Fang Yu looked at the health bar again, and suddenly the man started flailing around, wildly swinging a notched vegetable knife, slashing at the empty air.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his flailing, he glanced sideways at Fang Yu and said calmly, "This strike is called Knife Twenty-Three. Can you withstand it?"</p><p></p><p>What deep-fried ice? Dude, get a grip, we're just in a game, not a mental asylum! You're just going on and on without stopping, aren't you? Fang Yu was fed up, how could there be such strange people. He turned and continued running towards the medicine shop, but that guy still chased after him.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you running! All evil will be punished by the law!"</p><p></p><p>Damn, the evil is behind you, go slash the guy behind you! But the young man in white also followed, tearfully and passionately shouting,</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor!! If you can execute Diao De-yi, to avenge my parents, I will serve you for the rest of my life!"</p><p></p><p>Pouring oil on the fire! Fang Yu quickly glanced back and found... this Puppy Egg actually hesitated after seeing the young man's appearance. </p><p></p><p>He! Actually! Hesitated! Could it be that you're not interested in me because I'm not a girl? You're really both worthy of death and unworthy of death!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was gritting his teeth in anger when suddenly a whooshing sound came from in front.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, something brushed past him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p></p><p>The Puppy Egg's agonized scream immediately rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What scoundrel dares commit violence in broad daylight! The Underworld Office is on the case! Everyone step back ten paces!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

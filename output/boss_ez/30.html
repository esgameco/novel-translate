        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>And furthermore...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's gaze focused on the advanced skill.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he gain the [Primal Body 20 Sword], but it was also... something that could be leveled up! The problem was that Fang Yu hadn't learned the [Primal Body 20 Sword] yet, wait, the display showed it as [Not Mastered].</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>For a new martial art, one first needs to practice it until the proficiency level increases by 1, allowing the skill name to appear on the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>But even then, it wouldn't be considered as having learned it.</p><p></p><p>One needs to allocate attribute points to truly master and grasp the skill!</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it! That's more like it!"</p><p></p><p>"I knew that Primal Body 20 Sword was so difficult to learn and practice, it would really take me step-by-step to reach the entry level, and it would probably take several months to get started, right?"</p><p></p><p>"No no no, even learning a single stance takes half a day, so the entry-level time would probably start from a year."</p><p></p><p>"Poor NPCs don't have this player panel, they can only practice it to death."</p><p></p><p>"But we players, just a point and it's done!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the advantage of being a player!"</p><p></p><p>Enlightenment flashed through Fang Yu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Through various actions, increase experience points, and obtain attribute points.</p><p>Through proficiency, unlock skills.</p><p>Finally, through attribute points, level up the skills, and completely master the skills.</p><p></p><p>This is the path for players to grow stronger in this game.</p><p></p><p>Experience points, experience points, experience points! Fang Yu now desperately needs experience points.</p><p></p><p>As long as the experience points reach the cap, he can obtain attribute points, put a point in the sword technique, and he'll directly take off!</p><p></p><p>No no no... his physique is also a bit weak, can't keep up with the version.</p><p></p><p>Now it's an all-out punch, and it can drain his stamina, the physique attribute must be leveled up a bit.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Fang Yu was filled with motivation.</p><p></p><p>Continue to practice martial arts, accumulate experience points! He went to the training ground and was immediately surrounded by his senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi is back!"</p><p></p><p>"Yo yo yo, isn't this the Diao Deyi with the strength of ten bulls? It feels like you've grown stronger again!"</p><p></p><p>"What reward did the master give you? Come on, let the senior brothers take a look too."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't hide anything, and immediately asked someone to bring two wooden swords for a demonstration.</p><p></p><p>The result was that someone threw two long iron swords, the sharpened kind.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at that person.</p><p></p><p>[Silver Silk: 45/45.]</p><p></p><p>Silver Silk shrugged.</p><p></p><p>"Couldn't find any short swords. Do you want to go to the storeroom and look for some yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Forget it, the long swords will do, after all, it's just sword practice.</p><p></p><p>"Don't dilly-dally, come on, let's see one!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah, that's right!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was eagerly anticipating, and Fang Yu directly took a stance, then stood still.</p><p></p><p>"That's it?" The crowd was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>The crowd: ??? What exactly did you learn???</p><p></p><p>After watching Fang Yu practice for a while, still just going through those few stances, the crowd lost interest and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The excitement is temporary, but practicing is long-term.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lin Wu came back from somewhere.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fang Yu, he was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you still wearing this outfit?"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Didn't Sister Mei take you to get the robes of our sect? Come, I'll take you there."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu followed Lin Wu, and they soon arrived at the storeroom.</p><p></p><p>The storeroom was dimly lit. A large counter divided the room.</p><p></p><p>The two of them stood in front of the counter.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle! Uncle!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu called out to the inside.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at Lin Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Is he your relative?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, of course." Lin Wu nodded matter-of-factly, then continued to call out, "Uncle! Uncle!"</p><p></p><p>Wow, you're the real insider here! Ge Qianxuan sent me in with just a letter, and there was no other connection, using the tiger's skin can only be done once, too much will expose the truth.</p><p></p><p>But here, there's a real insider.</p><p></p><p>Hiding it so deeply, does he have a whole family here?</p><p></p><p>Just as he was thinking about it, heavy footsteps came from inside.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The flickering candlelight slowly approached the storeroom. Fang Yu casually looked towards the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, his body suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>[Lin Wotian: 100/1200.]</p><p></p><p>A monster of a thousand wounds! A demon? Or a temple sweeper monk??? Wait a minute!</p><p></p><p>His remaining health, how is it so low? I, I have a bold idea!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>"Who, who is shouting so loudly?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Wotian was hunched over, his body appearing around sixty or seventy years old, looking like a frail old man, and even a bit hard of hearing.</p><p></p><p>"Forgot again? It's me! Lin Wu, your nephew!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu shouted loudly, and Lin Wotian slowly responded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh... nephew, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>"A new disciple!" Lin Wu pointed at Fang Yu: "For the initiation, the robe!"</p><p></p><p>While shouting, he also made a motion of putting on clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, a new disciple..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wotian held the candle and slowly went to search, stopping in front of a large cabinet and rummaging through it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had a puzzled expression and lowered his voice.</p><p></p><p>"Your second uncle..."</p><p></p><p>"He's hard of hearing and a bit forgetful," Lin Wu replied in a normal volume.</p><p></p><p>Pretending! He's definitely pretending! </p><p></p><p>1200 health, if he's a temple sweeper monk, how terrifying must his strength be!</p><p></p><p>Absolutely a demon! A severely wounded demon with only 100 health left, my greatsword is already thirsty for blood! "Aha, found it..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wotian, still hunched over, walked towards them holding a set of robes.</p><p></p><p>Halfway there, he suddenly started coughing.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough cough!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the coughing...</p><p></p><p>'-1'.</p><p></p><p>A damage value popped up above Lin Wotian's head.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>[Lin Wotian: 99/1200.]</p><p></p><p>Wounded within the wounded? This is not a free experience gift package??</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was already thinking that his full-force strike would be 10 ox-power, which should translate to around 10 points of damage.</p><p></p><p>To kill this old guy, he would need the full force of ten punches...</p><p></p><p>But with his current physique, consecutive strikes would be a problem.</p><p></p><p>His physical condition is limiting his growth! Fortunately, this old demon is hiding in the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, so he probably hasn't been discovered by others yet.</p><p></p><p>No rush, let's play with him a bit! Just as he was thinking this, the nearby Lin Wu suddenly sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Second uncle's illness has worsened again."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Is it an illness? Can people even get sick? Fang Yu suddenly became hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Your second uncle... what's going on with him?"</p><p></p><p>"An old ailment. He used to be able to treat it with medicine. But now with his age, the condition has become more severe, sigh..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu sighed again.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Judging from this, this person is really your second uncle after all!</p><p></p><p>You should have said so earlier.</p><p></p><p>I was just about to try and hack this guy to death! Fang Yu now realized the terrifying nature of demons.</p><p></p><p>Demons disguised as humans, before exposing their true nature, others would have no idea of the truth.</p><p></p><p>At this stage, this demon is in a Schr√∂dinger's cat state.</p><p></p><p>You just ask whether to kill or not.</p><p></p><p>Kill?</p><p></p><p>Okay, the head falls, and killing a close person with your own hands, the psychological shadow will haunt you for a lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Don't kill?</p><p></p><p>Okay, the demon strikes, and devours your whole family, completely defenseless.</p><p></p><p>Just like now, Fang Yu, who could see the health bar, was completely confused.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Lin Wu's words, his second uncle became this way due to illness and injury.</p><p></p><p>That means this Lin Wotian is actually a temple sweeper monk, a true senior.</p><p></p><p>How should one treat a senior? That must be...</p><p></p><p>Old man, give me some gold coins! Find an opportunity to become his disciple, and walk the path of a dragon-style overlord guided by a high-level expert!

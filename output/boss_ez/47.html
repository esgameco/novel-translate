        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for a fortuitous coincidence, and getting this information, I wouldn't even have been able to detect that the demons had infiltrated to this extent."</p><p></p><p>"Master... I don't understand, why are the demons putting in so much effort? What are they trying to do?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but... no matter what they want to do, we must help them with all our might!"</p><p></p><p>Wu the strategist suddenly widened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"We... help the demons?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Why?"</p><p></p><p>Yuwen Ji looked at Wu the strategist and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Wu the strategist, when the water is clear, there are no fish. Chaos is the only opportunity for our faction to rise up. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Wu the strategist immediately understood.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the big families above had suppressed the entire Tianyuan Town, and the cake below had been completely swept away by the major factions.</p><p></p><p>If no one stirred up trouble, the Black Tiger Faction would never be able to expand its territory in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But this move undoubtedly carries great risk.</p><p></p><p>One misstep, and they would be standing against all the forces in Tianyuan Town.</p><p></p><p>After all, that would be helping the demons!</p><p></p><p>"I know what you're thinking, but a real man who wants to accomplish something can't be constrained by such trivial matters!"</p><p></p><p>"If this succeeds, the demons will cause chaos, the major factions will fall, and the small factions will rise. Wouldn't we also be doing a great deed?"</p><p></p><p>To be able to describe colluding with the demons in such a lofty manner.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're so resolute!"</p><p></p><p>Wu the strategist gave a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"So when will the demons take action, and how will we help the demons succeed? Why not directly approach the demons and offer our allegiance?"</p><p></p><p>"The opposition between humans and demons is not so easily trusted. Moreover, we are to stir the pot, not to act openly. Even the fact that we are helping the demons must be done in a way that is unknown to both the demons and others."</p><p></p><p>"What does the master mean?"</p><p></p><p>"Play dumb, and accomplish great things!"</p><p></p><p>Wu the strategist: !!!</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're so brilliant and resolute!"</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!"</p><p></p><p>Yuwen Ji laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Everything is ready, only waiting for the right moment.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely confident that Jiao Ruru would surely discover that Jiao Deyi is a demon.</p><p></p><p>In that case, she will ally with us and become our spy.</p><p></p><p>Everything will proceed as planned.</p><p></p><p>Tianyuan Town will eventually fall into my grasp!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In reality.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He took off the helmet, feeling energetic.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, while playing the game, his physical body was just like sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, after this all-nighter operation, he would have been exhausted.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought about how the game characters used to need to sleep and rest.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has become a warrior, he can stay up all night and still be energetic.</p><p></p><p>He immediately realized this was an exploitable point.</p><p></p><p>He can completely control his character to train martial arts tirelessly, while other players' characters are lacking in energy and need to sleep to recover.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more feasible it seemed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll crush you all!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what a 'liver emperor' is?"</p><p></p><p>"You guys only play the game 12 hours a day."</p><p></p><p>"I'm online 24 hours, training martial arts non-stop, you scared yet?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt proud, feeling more and more like a professional gamer.</p><p></p><p>I'm back! Everyone's back!</p><p></p><p>Back when he played a game and worked hard, he would grind materials for days on end to sell for money.</p><p></p><p>Although he ended up losing a few tens of thousands in the end, that spirit of perseverance has now taken over his soul! Life has hope again, and Fang Yu is simply bursting with motivation, eager to return to the game immediately.</p><p></p><p>No</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No need to rush for now.</p><p></p><p>Start the fire, cook the noodles.</p><p></p><p>Put the instant noodles in the pot.</p><p></p><p>While waiting for the noodles, Fang Yu started browsing the forums.</p><p></p><p>As the current top-ranked game, the discussion heat around the game is unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>And as the game progresses, it's no longer just the kind of useless information like on the first day.</p><p></p><p>Some players have already started to summarize their experiences in a regular manner, posting some simple strategy guides.</p><p></p><p>"Shocking! Offense-Defense Conversion, Directly Hitting the Core of the Game's Combat System!"</p><p></p><p>A post that kept getting upvoted caught Fang Yu's attention.</p><p></p><p>After clicking in, he found it was full of valuable content.</p><p></p><p>"Asking about the combat in the Immortal Game, it involves two situations - offense and defense."</p><p></p><p>"Attacking involves physique, attack posture, attack intensity, skill bonuses, etc. There is a large fluctuation range in the upper and lower limits of power."</p><p></p><p>"This is a simulation of real-life combat. In reality, we don't always attack with full force. We can get distracted, our punches can be slow, and this feedback is reflected in the game as the power of each punch fluctuating up and down."</p><p></p><p>"Since the game doesn't have damage values, it's a completely realistic scenario, so we can only judge the damage based on the physical feedback, the wounds and injuries inflicted on the enemy."</p><p></p><p>"In simple terms, if a punch knocks the person down, that's high damage."</p><p></p><p>"If a punch hits the opponent's forehead, that's a critical hit."</p><p></p><p>The rest was a long, manual-like explanation that gave Fang Yu a headache.</p><p></p><p>Skimming through the defense section, Fang Yu suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"...Then there's defense, which is divided into body endurance and defensive blocking."</p><p></p><p>"When facing an attack, if we make a clear block, we can effectively reduce the attack damage."</p><p></p><p>"For example, if the enemy throws a punch, we raise our hand and use our palm to block the fist, that's an effective block."</p><p></p><p>"A wrong example would be if the enemy's fist is coming, we use our own fist to meet it, which should be judged by the system as a clash of attacks, and both sides would take full damage."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought back to the previous battles with Tiger Bro's group.</p><p></p><p>Both of these situations had occurred, but the result was always the same.</p><p></p><p>It was always '-0' damage.</p><p></p><p>So in this aspect, this post seemed to have analyzed it incorrectly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling that the post lacked authority due to the errors, Fang Yu started skimming through it carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Then he found that while this post was analyzing the Immortal Game, it was actually applying formulas from other games to dissect and interpret it.</p><p></p><p>Exiting the post, he looked at other strategy guides.</p><p></p><p>He found that to varying degrees, others were also trying to fit templates from other games onto this new game.</p><p></p><p>Although some parts matched up, most of the time it was off the mark.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt that their understanding of the game was still too shallow.</p><p></p><p>He was better off than these "gold medal professional players" at this point.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's interest in the technical posts diminished significantly, and he glanced at the random gossip posts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a post caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Doctor! Is there a doctor who can save me?!"</p><p></p><p>Clicking in, he saw...</p><p></p><p>"Brothers, is there anyone from Lianyun Stronghold here? I need a doctor, please help me online!!"</p><p></p><p>"Here's what happened. I'm from Lianyun Stronghold, and the Stronghold Master issued a long-term task to hunt down 'Lian Qingjin' and a daily task to rob merchants."</p><p></p><p>"I followed the main group to rob a merchant, and then got shot by the merchant's guards with several arrows, and my blood was gushing out."</p><p></p><p>"After returning to Lianyun Stronghold, the doctor there bandaged me up and just left me."</p><p></p><p>"It's been a day, and my injuries haven't shown any signs of improvement at all."</p><p></p><p>"Is there a doctor nearby who can come and save me? Urgent help needed in the jianghu!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

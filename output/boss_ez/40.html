            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So his solution was also very simple.</p><p></p><p>That was to solve it from right to left.</p><p></p><p>A punch aimed at the guy who jumped up from the right side.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Given the huge difference in physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's movements were more agile, his reactions faster.</p><p></p><p>The fist directly hit the man's face. -8!</p><p></p><p>[Yu Yongdi: 0/8.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Yu Yongdi] player, gained 10 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>The health bar was directly depleted.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu didn't pause for even half a second, his legs fixed, his upper body rotating clockwise with a violent force, dragging the corpse of this person and slamming it towards the person on the left.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The guy on the right didn't expect Fang Yu, after killing his brother above, to still attack with undiminished force, grabbing his brother's corpse and slamming it at him.</p><p></p><p>In bewilderment, he only felt like he was hit by a fast-moving truck, his body becoming light.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he was slammed against the wall next to the wooden door, together with his brother's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Vision went black, automatically exited the game. -7!</p><p></p><p>[Ke Bingcheng: 0/7.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Ke Bingcheng] player, gained 10 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>Due to Fang Yu's powerful punch on the spot, his upper body was in a side-facing position, facing the oncoming large patch of rice grains.</p><p></p><p>Rustling.</p><p></p><p>The rice grains, which were just for distraction, fell to the ground after landing on Fang Yu's clothes.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, someone hugged Fang Yu around the waist, as if trying to throw him out.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, with a huge difference in strength and physique, no matter how hard the other party tried, Fang Yu didn't budge an inch.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a figure swooshed through from under Fang Yu's crotch, and truly smoothly escaped to the outside, disappearing into the crowd of onlookers.</p><p></p><p>There were also people who seized the opportunity, their hands slapping onto Fang Yu's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Like jumping goats, they used the force to leap over Fang Yu's head.</p><p></p><p>"I said getting the flower-level skill [Buoyancy] would be useful... Ouch!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The person's voice abruptly stopped, as if the rebound was too high and his head hit the door frame, falling to the ground in pain and screaming.</p><p></p><p>These three people's actions were almost simultaneous, and Fang Yu had just killed two people, with no new strength generated, so he could only watch them slide tackle, jump like mountain goats, and perform the hugging and slamming act.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his fist, the two corpses fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu elbowed the person who tried to hug and slam him, heavily striking his back. -8!</p><p></p><p>A muffled groan, and the person softly collapsed, motionless.</p><p></p><p>[Wang Huannian: 0/8.]</p><p></p><p>[System prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Wang Huannian] player, gained 10 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>The person rolling on the ground and screaming in pain saw this scene, and no longer cared about the pain, quickly using his hands and feet to flee outside.</p><p></p><p>"Help! Help! Help!" </p><p></p><p>He saw the crowd of civilians gathered outside the door, and shouted while fleeing.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, he suddenly stumbled and fell face-first.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, he found that his right foot had been grabbed by Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Facing the terrified player, Fang Yu grinned ferociously and quickly dragged the person back into the room, leaving the bewildered neighbors behind.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the player's chaotic screaming and the five-finger claw marks left on the ground as he was dragged back into the room, the person was pulled back inside.</p><p></p><p>In less than a second, a muffled sound was heard, and the room fell silent, with no more sounds coming out.</p><p></p><p>Someone quietly peeked inside, and saw several motionless corpses lying in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Dead, they're dead!"</p><p></p><p>"What's there to be afraid of? It's the people from the Black Tiger Gang first."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The hand is moving! We can testify for poor Diao De-one!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the unfortunate Diao De-one, it must be that his sister has already been taken by the Black Tiger Gang... Otherwise, with Diao De-one's usual behavior, he wouldn't suddenly fly into a rage and kill someone."</p><p></p><p>"Did you see the expression on Diao De-one's face when he dragged the person back into the room? Calm, extremely calm. Beneath that calmness, there must be such immense grief and anger for this 16-year-old youth to have done such a thing."</p><p></p><p>"Crazy! The world has gone too crazy... Ah..."</p><p></p><p>Outside, the clueless bystanders were still empathizing with Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Inside the room, Fang Yu had already stepped over the corpse he had just killed and was walking towards the Tiger Boss.</p><p></p><p>【Yang Ri-yi: 0/8.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Yang Ri-yi], gained 10 experience points.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Experience points exceeded 100, converted to 1 attribute point.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Infighting among the human race, resentment gathers into a killing aura, enveloping the body.】</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's footsteps suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>He felt that there was something extra on his body, wrapping around him, faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>Visually, there was no change to his body, but in his senses, he felt something extra.</p><p></p><p>This should be the killing aura that the system was referring to.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart shuddered, knowing that he had killed too much tonight.</p><p></p><p>But with so many experience points in front of him, his conscience wouldn't allow him to not take them.</p><p></p><p>As for the killing aura, he could only take it one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>According to the system's explanation, it should naturally dissipate over time, and as long as he doesn't get targeted by demons during this period, it should be fine.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Fang Yu isn't afraid of demons or the killing aura, it's just that the temptation is too great.</p><p></p><p>Opened the data panel.</p><p></p><p>【Name: Diao De-one.】</p><p></p><p>【Realm: Initial Flower Realm.】</p><p></p><p>【Health: 22/22.】</p><p></p><p>【Physique: 2.2.】+【Spirit: 1.7.】+【Human-level Skill: Digital Life.】</p><p></p><p>【Flower-level Skills: Elemental Body Two-Zero Sword [Novice (4/100)]+, Elemental Body Stabilization Technique [Mastered (3/600)]+.】</p><p></p><p>【Attribute Points: 1.】</p><p></p><p>【Experience Points: 1/100.】</p><p></p><p>After the battle, Fang Yu didn't even lose any blood, only his physical strength was severely depleted, his breathing heavy, and his steps unsteady.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Weak! The members of the Black Tiger Gang are too weak!</p><p></p><p>The gap between martial artists and street thugs is really too large!</p><p></p><p>Even if these thugs have undergone some training and their health has been increased to the teens, without learning any martial arts and breaking through the realm of ordinary people, their strength has not changed significantly, only having enough suppressive power compared to ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu recalled the first day when he was on a mission with Wang Er and the others, their attacks only dealt single-digit health damage, equivalent to the punches and kicks of ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>With the same health, whether one has learned martial arts or not directly determines whether it's one against ten or one against one.</p><p></p><p>Although one person escaped, the remaining members of the Black Tiger Gang in the room have been thoroughly cleaned up.</p><p></p><p>Raising his head, there were only three people left in the room.</p><p></p><p>【Yang Hu: 25/25.】</p><p></p><p>【Wei Kai: 1/8.】</p><p></p><p>【Diao Ru-ru: 4/4.】</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Fang Yu had returned alive, the Tiger Boss, who was dragging Wei Kai, suddenly frowned and raised a fist, as if venting his anger, and heavily struck the dying Wei Kai's face.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A heavy sound. -1.</p><p></p><p>【Wei Kai: 0/8.】</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai's health bar was depleted, his eyes rolled back, and he died directly.</p><p></p><p>The blood splattered on the Tiger Boss's face, but he didn't even wipe it off, just standing up and coldly staring at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu stared with wide eyes, suddenly frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>What a waste! That was a player's head! What are you killing for? What benefit do you get from it? And he was your little brother, wouldn't it be more delicious to use him as a meat shield and let me kill him?

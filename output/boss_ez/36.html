        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ever since her eldest brother went missing, this was the first time she felt so happy.</p><p></p><p>During the days when her eldest brother was missing, she was filled with worry almost every day.</p><p></p><p>As soon as she opened her eyes, it was about the family's meals and various expenses.</p><p></p><p>Money, money, money, money, money.</p><p></p><p>Without her eldest brother, the burden of living fell entirely on her shoulders.</p><p></p><p>Her third younger brother, Jiao Deyi, though he went out to find work, his health was poor and he couldn't do manual labor. He couldn't even find short-term jobs.</p><p></p><p>He often went out the whole day, came back hungry, without earning a single penny, and waited for her to cook.</p><p></p><p>During those days, Jiao Ruru almost couldn't carry on, and had thought of ending it all several times.</p><p></p><p>But then, that day, people from the Black Tiger Gang came, bringing her eldest brother's gambling debt documents.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ruru's vision blacked out at that moment - the huge gambling debt was the final straw that broke the camel's back.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ruru was on the verge of a breakdown, and even thought of selling herself to the casino, to find a way out for Jiao Deyi, to end it all.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, Jiao Deyi was willing to join the Black Tiger Casino as a free laborer to pay off the debt, and he stopped her from selling herself.</p><p></p><p>It was Jiao Deyi's actions that day that made Jiao Ruru decide to live on.</p><p></p><p>Even if life was so difficult.</p><p></p><p>But who would have thought, after that day, it was a turning point for the brother and sister.</p><p></p><p>Now, not only did Jiao Ruru have 5 taels of silver in hand, her brother Jiao Deyi had also made connections in the Fool's Palace.</p><p></p><p>With this, Jiao Ruru walked with a light and lively step, as if she had regained the youthful vigor that a girl of her age should have.</p><p></p><p>"1 tael of silver to buy food, first the bedsheets, new clothes, Jiao Deyi's shoes are also broken, need to buy a pair..."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ruru counted the money on her fingers.</p><p></p><p>"1 tael of silver to use as a reward, post notices, to get help in finding her eldest brother."</p><p></p><p>Alive or dead, she must find him.</p><p></p><p>Before, she didn't have the means, but now that she has money, Jiao Ruru still holds hope that her eldest brother is alive.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining 3 taels of silver, to save up, for Jiao Deyi to get married!"</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, young ladies are quite precious, and Jiao Deyi likes to spend money carelessly, he definitely won't save up for a wife, so I have to take care of it."</p><p></p><p>"Now that Jiao Deyi has connections in the Fool's Palace, let him find a job as a sweeper or something, work diligently for a few years, then marry a wife, so our Jiao family will have an heir."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ruru calculated her plans, feeling content and satisfied.</p><p></p><p>She had never had a moment like this, with such beautiful hopes and aspirations for the future.</p><p></p><p>"And then after Jiao Deyi gets married, I... I can also find someone..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about herself, Jiao Ruru's face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>But upon further reflection on suitable or liked people, she found a blank.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the person she interacted with the most was her brother Jiao Deyi.</p><p></p><p>Busy with daily life, struggling to make ends meet, when would she have time to think about romance.</p><p></p><p>The redness in her cheeks slowly faded, it seems the matter of marriage is still very far away for her.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the fabric shop.</p><p></p><p>"Auntie Hong, let me take a look at this blue-green fabric."</p><p>"Also try the black one."</p><p>"Blue? Won't it be too bright?"</p><p>"Pink? Ah, it's not for me to buy for myself, hehe, it's not because I have a scholar I like, it's not what you're thinking!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ruru talked a lot, her happiness and joy almost overflowing.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the growing number of bags in her hands also indicated one thing.</p><p></p><p>She had money today.</p><p></p><p>From the fabric shop, to the tailor shop, to the rice shop, to the roadside shoemaker...</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ruru's money was spent a little over the top, an extra 300 coins.</p><p></p><p>But those expenses were necessary.</p><p></p><p>Like the bedsheets, the broom... when the family didn't have the means, they could use alternatives, but now that they had the means, naturally they should upgrade to better ones, to make life more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They were mostly daily necessities, essential items.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi will definitely understand my..."</p><p></p><p>Diao Ruru felt a little guilty.</p><p></p><p>Hopping and skipping, she strolled around the streets she usually went to, carrying home big and small bags.</p><p></p><p>Looking at today's spoils, Diao Ruru was filled with a sense of happiness. She was so immersed in this happiness that she didn't notice the shopkeepers' gazes towards her had changed.</p><p></p><p>Some people who were not usually seen on this street appeared here today.</p><p></p><p>So when she was humming a tune that was not quite a song, happily washing the new dishes with clean water at home, </p><p></p><p>she didn't realize that her wonderful day would end so suddenly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous loud noise suddenly resounded! Echoing throughout the entire house.</p><p></p><p>The old wooden door that had guarded the old wooden house for so many years,</p><p></p><p>broke into several pieces in this loud noise, falling to the ground, trampled upon by people.</p><p></p><p>More than ten people burst in, rushing into her home.</p><p></p><p>Clang.</p><p></p><p>The stunned Diao Ruru, the plate in her hand, fell to the ground, shattering into pieces.</p><p></p><p>And this time was the dusk when the sun was about to set.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?!"</p><p></p><p>"What are we doing?"</p><p></p><p>The leader grinned.</p><p></p><p>He strode to the chair, sat down, propped his feet up on the old dining table of the Diao family, and looked at Diao Ruru with a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Ruru, you really have the guts."</p><p></p><p>"You have money, but instead of thinking about returning it to our Black Tiger Gang, you're out there spending it on things."</p><p></p><p>The man's smile gradually became sinister, his tone unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that all the money you used is our Black Tiger Gang's money!"</p><p></p><p>"Your money is our money!"</p><p></p><p>"Without our permission, who allowed you to use that money!"</p><p></p><p>Diao Ruru was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This, this is the logic of a bandit.</p><p></p><p>Her eyes immediately reddened.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is our own money! It's the money Diao Deyi gave me!"</p><p></p><p>The man couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi gave you the money? Do you know that Diao Deyi is our casino's dog?"</p><p></p><p>"Where does he have money? His money is the casino's money, the Black Tiger Gang's money!"</p><p></p><p>"You've appropriated the money that should have belonged to us, do you know that our boss is very angry now?"</p><p></p><p>"When the boss gets angry, do you know what will happen?"</p><p></p><p>The boss looked at the silent, gritted-teeth Diao Ruru.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his mouth couldn't help but curve upwards in a self-satisfied manner.</p><p></p><p>Dealing with this kind of little girl, Boss Tiger is at ease.</p><p></p><p>It's just that she needs to be disciplined.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the dozen or so subordinates behind him.</p><p></p><p>"You guys? You know what the boss will do when he's angry, right? Tell her! Tell her loudly!"</p><p></p><p>One of the subordinates immediately raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Wei Kai has become more clever? Boss Tiger was a little surprised by the subordinate who raised his hand.</p><p></p><p>This subordinate has been very low-key in the past, but unexpectedly today he also wants to show off.</p><p></p><p>Boss Tiger glanced at Diao Ruru out of the corner of his eye, appraising her figure, and roughly knew why Wei Kai had become enlightened.</p><p></p><p>No problem, give him a chance to show off.</p><p></p><p>After all, I'm the one who wants to play with this woman, I won't give it to him, let him taste the bitterness of love.</p><p></p><p>Young people, they just need to be tempered.</p><p></p><p>"Wei Kai, you tell, what will the boss do when he's angry?"</p><p></p><p>The called-out Wei Kai was very excited, stepped out of the line, and shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>"When the boss is extremely furious, he can kill a tiger with a single slide tackle!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

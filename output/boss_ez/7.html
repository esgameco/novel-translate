        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Nong Chao clenched his fists, his eyes reddening, as if harboring a deep grudge and hatred, and he spat viciously at the corpse of Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan remained silent, only whispering a few words to a trusted aide beside him.</p><p></p><p>The person nodded and left, going into the medicine shop.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he came back and reported something to Li Qianxuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan's actions did not draw anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked by Nong Chao's beheading act, but despite the sudden incident, it was met with cheers from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Well done in killing him!"</p><p>"He deserved it!"</p><p>"How can we tolerate these lawless ruffians under the vast sky?"</p><p></p><p>Li Baigu even banged his head on the ground, shouting, "Father! Mother! Your son has avenged you!!"</p><p></p><p>In the moment his head hit the ground, Li Baigu's gaze briefly glanced at Fang Yu's headless corpse, and a faint, cold smile unconsciously appeared on the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The smile had just begun to bloom when a cold voice suddenly rang out beside his ear like a ghostly apparition.</p><p></p><p>"You seem... rather pleased, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Baigu felt as if all the blood in his body had suddenly frozen.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he composed his expression and looked up at the person beside him, forcing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, I'm not pleased, I'm excited! Excited to have avenged my parents! And this is all thanks to Lord Li's help!"</p><p></p><p>"Help? Was it to help you eliminate a threat, or to help you take revenge?"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Baigu could speak, Li Qianxuan raised his hand to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't speak, your heart rate is very fast now. Are you preparing to tell me some lies?"</p><p></p><p>Li Baigu was startled, only then realizing that Li Qianxuan had placed a finger on his chest to measure his pulse rate.</p><p></p><p>"Don't avoid it. I'm interrogating you now, and if you move even a little, your heart will have a hole in it. I mean what I say." After a pause, Li Qianxuan asked, "I want to ask you, you're only fifteen or sixteen years old, you've just experienced the deaths of your parents and the shop's apprentice, and with your blood loss from your arms, you've been fleeing for so long, yet I see you now seem... still very energetic? Not out of breath or tired, is this the physique of a normal fifteen or sixteen-year-old?"</p><p></p><p>Li Baigu's expression changed slightly, and he immediately put on an exhausted and panting demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, I don't know why I can still be so energetic, maybe it's because of my determination to avenge my parents. Now that you mention it, I... I seem to be about to..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Baigu was about to close his eyes to feign unconsciousness...</p><p></p><p>Shing!!</p><p></p><p>A finger suddenly pierced through his chest.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, if Fang Yu were present, he would surely have seen a glowing red number: -44!</p><p></p><p>But this was not the end, as Li Baigu still wanted to continue his act, but as soon as he opened his mouth...</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>A sharp sword slashed, directly severing his head. -500!! If Fang Yu were present, the damage number this time would be so exaggerated!</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed from the neck, and the headless corpse collapsed to the ground, adding to the pile.</p><p></p><p>The crowd, who had just been cheering, were now stunned into silence at this sight.</p><p></p><p>After a pause of one or two seconds, the silence erupted into a thunderous uproar!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!!! They killed him!!"</p><p>"The people from Yudifu have gone mad and killed the shopkeeper's son again! They're all crazy!!"</p><p>"Run! Run for your lives!!"</p><p></p><p>The onlookers scattered in panic, only the members of Yudifu stood dumbfounded, but they immediately moved to guard Li Qianxuan.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, what is the meaning of this...?"</p><p></p><p>"Shh!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan looked at Li Baigu's corpse, slowly speaking.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Well hidden, and impersonated excellently."</p><p></p><p>"The human emotions, expressions, and speech - you've imitated them to perfection. That act of kowtowing and tearfully pleading for revenge for your parents, even I was moved by it."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>"You overlooked one thing." <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div> "We humans, when we kill, we never tear the person in half and expose their intestines!"</p><p></p><p>"The corpse at the pharmacy exposed you."</p><p></p><p>"You... monster in human skin!!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Qi Qianxuan swung his sword towards the headless corpse of Li Baugu! Qi Qianxuan's sword was very fast, perhaps the fastest among all present! But he was not fast enough for the inhuman monster! Boom!! Almost the moment Qi Qianxuan struck, the headless corpse of Li Baugu exploded in a shower of flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>A dark shadow, amid the bursting flesh and blood, charged towards the startled Nong Chao and Nong Han.</p><p></p><p>In just a fleeting moment, two heads went flying.</p><p></p><p>The headless bodies of Nong Chao and Nong Han collapsed directly.</p><p></p><p>Instant kill! A kill without any resistance!</p><p></p><p>"Formation!!" </p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan shouted urgently.</p><p></p><p>The bewildered crowd finally snapped out of it, surrounding Qi Qianxuan in a defensive formation of three circles within and three without.</p><p></p><p>"A monster! It is truly a monster!" Someone's wrist was trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill, kill, kill! Father! Mother! Your child finally has a chance to avenge you by killing this monster!!" Someone was emotionally charged.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Qi Qianxuan's team, though each individually strong, were not a solid, unified force.</p><p></p><p>"Dispel all distractions! Everyone, listen to my command, fire the arrows!!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan roared, and a dense volley of arrows rained down towards the direction he pointed.</p><p></p><p>Three or five arrows successfully hit the monster, but many more were evaded.</p><p></p><p>One of the trusted aides immediately spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"It's not fast!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan shook his head slightly: "No, it's not fast because it's injured!"</p><p></p><p>The monster had disguised itself as human, donning human skin, but its body was still that of a monster.</p><p></p><p>First the hand was severed, then the head - even a monster should have sustained grave injuries from that!</p><p>The dark shadow monster charged towards them, unleashing a beastly roar and howl.</p><p></p><p>Some were stunned, some distracted by fear, but fortunately their formation could cover the left and right flanks.</p><p>The nearby team members immediately took on the pressure.</p><p></p><p>The dark shadow charged, the team moved as a single entity, all drawing their swords towards the direction of the monster's attack.</p><p></p><p>Sword after sword after sword! The monster monster would inevitably meet the blades from any angle it attacked.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A loud impact was heard, three or five people were knocked back, but the monster's body also burst with blood, having sustained attacks from the others, and it retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Arrows!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan roared, and the well-trained team immediately drew their bows.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh whoosh - </p><p>The dense volley of arrows almost tracked the monster's trajectory, hitting it several more times.</p><p></p><p>"It's even more severely injured now!" the trusted aide exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't let your guard down!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Qianxuan's eyes were fixed intently on the direction the monster had fled, when suddenly he stiffened.</p><p></p><p>For in the reflection of the sunlight, the dark shadow of the monster had... disappeared!</p><p></p><p>"It's gone?!"</p><p></p><p>"Where's the monster?"</p><p></p><p>"Did it escape??"</p><p></p><p>The others also noticed this phenomenon, whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Qi Qianxuan felt a chill rising from his heart.</p><p></p><p>He faintly heard a rushing, piercing sound approaching his ear.</p><p></p><p>Almost instinctively, he suddenly raised his sword and shifted to the side to block.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the astonished expressions of his aides...</p><p></p><p>Clang!!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why wouldn't I be here? This is the only cafeteria in the martial arts school. Also, what are you going to do to my meatballs?"</p><p></p><p>"No, nothing."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>He had a strange feeling that if he had slapped down just now, something bad might have happened.</p><p></p><p>"Forget to tell that fatty. I'll go talk to him later, your meatballs for the next two months are ours, next time you can only get the basic food allowance. Don't look at me like that, I'm only eating your share for the first ten days, the rest is for others."</p><p></p><p>The "fatty" that Shi Zhuangmei mentioned seemed to be the chubby chef who was distributing the food.</p><p></p><p>Watching Shi Zhuangmei swallow the meatball in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Ling ling ling! The resonance of the tinkling sound reappeared. Dense blood bars popped up on Shi Zhuangmei's body and quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Then Fang Yu discovered...</p><p></p><p>【Shi Zhuangmei: 151/151.】</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"You... became stronger?"</p><p></p><p>"Eh? How did you know? Hehe! This is the effect of the Yuanxin meatballs! Let me tell you first, a deal is a deal, there's no room for regret."</p><p></p><p>Eat your fill, eat yourself to death! With all the piercing demons all over her body, Fang Yu didn't know how she could still live after they came out! Although the resonance of the piercing demons added 1 point of blood volume for Shi Zhuangmei, Fang Yu still didn't dare let this thing enter his own body.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei also swallowed another meatball, and after the tinkling sound resonance, it became calm, and the blood bar did not change.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping away the remaining food like a whirlwind, she gulped down the soup in one go.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>She just left without a word, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu thought about it and also quickly finished eating his food.</p><p></p><p>As a result, after finishing, he was still hungry! Could it be because I didn't eat anything in reality?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu logged off, cooked a bowl of instant noodles, and ate it.</p><p></p><p>Then he went back to the game.</p><p></p><p>His character was still at the dining table, but his face was lying on the table, as if he had fallen asleep.</p><p></p><p>Sitting up straight, the feeling of being full in reality had completely disappeared in the game.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the character still feels hungry.</p><p></p><p>The little bit of food in the cafeteria is not enough to fill the stomach.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Shi Zhuangmei ate so fast, without feeling full at all.</p><p></p><p>But in fact, the amount provided by the cafeteria is already the normal food portion for an adult.</p><p></p><p>The problem is that after the physique becomes stronger, the demand for food also increases.</p><p></p><p>When Fang Yu tried to ask the fatty for extra meals, he was surprisingly charged a high price, so Fang Yu decisively turned around and left. He went back to the training ground to continue practicing the sword.</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has diligently practiced [Yuan Body Two Zero Sword], proficiency +1.】</p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has diligently practiced [Yuan Body Two Zero Sword], experience value +1.】</p><p></p><p>After practicing for one or two hours, he was hungry again, causing his training efficiency to slow down.</p><p>Plus, he felt his physical strength was severely depleted, so he simply stopped working.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shi Zhuangmei came over.</p><p>Seeing Fang Yu stop training, she was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Not practicing anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Not practicing anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Then where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>"Go home, eat."</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei rarely showed a shallow smile.</p><p></p><p>"You must not have eaten enough at noon, right? Now that you are a martial artist, your qi and blood drive the strength of your whole body, and the consumption is extremely large. Therefore, the demand for food has also increased greatly. You can prepare some tonics to eat when you go back, the cafeteria's portion is not enough."</p><p></p><p>"Also, your training intensity today has exceeded the standard. Remember to buy some ointment to apply on your body when you go back. With such high-intensity training, your body will be greatly damaged. If you don't take care of it and apply medicine in time, you won't even be able to come to the martial arts school tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>This seems to be Shi Zhuangmei's experience.</p><p>The other senior brothers had also mentioned this before.</p><p>Fang Yu didn't take it seriously before, after all, going to the pharmacy would cost a lot of money, and he couldn't bear to spend it.</p><p>But judging from Shi Zhuangmei's words, this money can't be saved.</p><p></p><p>"Practicing martial arts is an expensive thing, if you want to practice well, you must keep up with medicine and tonics. The food supplement provided by the martial arts school is only the most basic, you also need to buy more nourishing foods, every month..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Eating big fish and meat is necessary to keep up with the consumption of martial arts training. </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was depressed. It seems that money is needed everywhere.</p><p></p><p>He must find a way to make some silver.</p><p></p><p>After humbly asking Shi Chengmei for some recipes for medicinal supplements and tonics, Fang Yu left the martial arts hall. By this time, it was already afternoon, not too far from dusk.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he left the martial arts hall, Fang Yu was extremely hungry.</p><p></p><p>He randomly found a roadside stall and bought a bowl of noodles for 5 coins. </p><p></p><p>One bowl, two bowls, three bowls... he ended up finishing 5 bowls of noodles, which made him feel a bit better.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this becoming a big eater?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the noodle shop owner look at him with the eyes of a fortune god, Fang Yu paid the bill dejectedly and planned to go home first.</p><p></p><p>The first stop was the pharmacy.</p><p></p><p>Reciting the prescriptions that Shi Chengmei had mentioned, the pharmacy assistant handled it skillfully.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi Ba Medicinal Soup, which nourishes the foundation and cultivates the essence, your Yuanxin Martial Arts Hall often has people coming to get this medicine, we're already used to it."</p><p></p><p>"There's also the Ointment Grass Mushroom, which relieves muscle fatigue, another common prescription of yours. And this other one you gave me..."</p><p></p><p>Okay...</p><p></p><p>Listening to the storekeeper rattle off the familiar prescriptions, Fang Yu understood.</p><p></p><p>It seems everyone follows the principle of proximity, directly getting the prescriptions filled at the nearest pharmacy to the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the storekeeper's tone, these prescriptions are quite common, and anyone practicing martial arts would know about them, so they are not valuable.</p><p></p><p>The truly valuable things are the medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>"The total is 3 taels of silver. The medicinal soup, you can brew it yourself, it'll last you 15 days. The other medicines are also a 15-day supply, you can use them first. If you run out, come back and buy more from me."</p><p></p><p>At the end, the storekeeper cautiously leaned in and whispered, "I also have more effective prescriptions, if you want to buy them, I can sell them to you at a discounted price."</p><p></p><p>Damn! Not buying them, you're so greedy!</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu left the pharmacy carrying a bag of medicinal ingredients, his heart was bleeding.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts hall only provides a monthly food supplement of 2 taels, yet this pharmacy just directly charged him 3 taels, which is half a month's worth.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, Fang Yu headed to his next destination - the vegetable market.</p><p></p><p>Food supplements, in essence, are just food replenishment, nothing special.</p><p></p><p>Just buy good fish and meat.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was counting his money on his fingers when he saw two little kids running and giggling past him.</p><p></p><p>"We caught the demon! We caught the demon!"</p><p>"Cut off its head! Cut off its head! I want to see the beheading show!"</p><p></p><p>Demon?! Fang Yu was startled.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards where the kids were running, he saw a crowd gathered, slowly moving forward, as if watching some spectacle.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>The aura of human heads!</p><p></p><p>You executioner, release that demon, let me do it!! Fang Yu felt he might need to play the role of an executioner.</p><p></p><p>He quickly rushed to the front, squeezing into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the crowd, the people from the Yudi Prefecture were escorting a large prison cart.</p><p></p><p>Inside were five prisoners, probably the so-called "demons".</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was very interested, and took a closer look.</p><p></p><p>【Zhang Ada: 3.2/7.】</p><p>【Jie Jue: 4.1/7.】</p><p>【Long Hui Jin: 3.8/6.】</p><p>【Yuan Dong Zui: 2.5/5.】</p><p>【Wen Kehan: 3.7/8.】</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Not one of them looks like a demon!</p><p></p><p>Damn it! I got excited for nothing!</p><p></p><p>You guys are really incompetent, you must have arrested the wrong people!</p><p></p><p>Looking closer, Fang Yu recognized a familiar face among the Yudi Prefecture escort team - Yue Guang, the deputy captain of the Li Qianxuan squad.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu called out "Brother Yue", waving at him.</p><p></p><p>But Yue Guang didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up, and only then did he notice Yue Guang's health bar.</p><p></p><p>【Yue Guang: 555/555.】</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

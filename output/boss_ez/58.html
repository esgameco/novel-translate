        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I didn't even know what these cultivation techniques were for.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hurriedly asked without shame.</p><p></p><p>If you don't ask, you won't know, but once you ask, you'll be shocked.</p><p></p><p>These four cultivation techniques are all about brute force output.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it's about gathering all of one's qi and blood, mobilizing the flesh and blood, and unleashing a full-powered strike.</p><p></p><p>Only the fourth technique, the [Void Stillness Finger], is a bit special. It requires... emptying the mind.</p><p></p><p>In simple terms, it's about not thinking about anything, mechanically using the Void Stillness Finger, letting the body remember and form muscle memory, and then emptying the mind to unleash maximum power.</p><p></p><p>It's like... it's like...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked at Yuan Hongxin with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you think I'm really stupid?"</p><p></p><p>"No, not at all."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin shrugged, his expression unchanged.</p><p></p><p>"Then why are all the techniques you recommended just brute force without using the brain?"</p><p></p><p>"Well... I'm teaching according to your aptitude. These martial arts must suit you perfectly!"</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt that the label of having poor aptitude and only being suitable for simple martial arts would be hard to shake off for the time being.</p><p></p><p>But in all honesty, these martial arts you all practice are so difficult to learn. It's only natural that I can't master them! Before graduating, I even often failed my university courses!</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, your stuff is even harder than calculus.</p><p></p><p>And besides, now that I have attribute points, it's as if I have heavenly talent, right?</p><p></p><p>Let me show off and learn a martial art in one second, shocking my master.</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Fang Yu said, "Master, what is the most powerful martial art in our school?"</p><p></p><p>"The Primal Foundation Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was confused.</p><p></p><p>The most powerful martial art in your school is the one you just taught me as an entry-level technique? What kind of ancient benevolent business owner are you??</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fang Yu's reaction, Yuan Hongxin knew he had misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>This was a secret only known to the core disciples of the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>However, since Jiao Deyi's actions today had earned Yuan Hongxin's trust, he might as well tell him.</p><p></p><p>"The Primal Foundation Technique you're learning now is not the complete version. The true Primal Foundation Technique has five parts."</p><p></p><p>"The Primal Foundation Technique is the Hand Armor Technique."</p><p>"The Primal Two-Zero Sword is the Sword Bone Technique."</p><p>"The Primal White Shadow Leg is the Leg Armor Technique."</p><p>"The Primal Heart Guard Bone is the Heart Armor Technique."</p><p>"The Primal Hammer Head is the Head Armor Technique."</p><p></p><p>"When the five techniques are combined and practiced together, that is the complete Primal Foundation Technique."</p><p></p><p>"When our ancestor created this martial art, it was for the purpose of..."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p></p><p>"I can't tell you the details. If one day you become the successor of our school, I will consider telling you the true purpose behind the establishment of our martial arts school."</p><p></p><p>The first thing that came to Fang Yu's mind was the [Burrowing Demon] meatballs in the cafeteria! Because he had been living too comfortably in the Primal Martial Arts School, he had even forgotten that the Burrowing Demons, such unusual beings, existed within the school, which meant something.</p><p></p><p>The Primal Martial Arts School was hiding some secret.</p><p>Something to do with demons and monsters.</p><p>Even Lin Wotian's demonic clone was enough to prove this point.</p><p></p><p>But as for the specifics of what they were doing or planning to do, Fang Yu had no idea.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he had no strength or self-defense ability, so he naturally didn't dare to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>Now, however, he could consider investigating this secretly? With so many senior brothers having Burrowing Demons hidden inside them, a single punch could... gush out blood and give experience points... No, no, they are my sworn brothers and beloved friends! How could I bring myself to do that?</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Money.</p><p></p><p>Ah no, I need to secretly investigate the truth, and then decide what to do.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De-yi, although you have already learned two of the martial arts of the true Yuan Body Stabilizing Technique. But to be honest, with your aptitude, you will never be able to learn the other few martial arts in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>"So I suggest you don't aim too high..."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hong-xin's words were not even finished yet, when Fang Yu directly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I want the Yuan Body White Shadow Kick!"</p><p></p><p>"...You won't be able to learn it."</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want the Yuan Body White Shadow Kick!"</p><p></p><p>"...I can give you the secret manual, but as for personally teaching you, I'll notify you of the time to come over tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>This is a mistake.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hong-xin repeated this sentence in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This is a mistake! Teaching Diao De-yi the Yuan Body White Shadow Kick, with his poor aptitude, he will never be able to learn it in his lifetime! He took out the secret manual and handed it to Diao De-yi, and Diao De-yi was quite happy about it.</p><p></p><p>But in Yuan Hong-xin's eyes, this was a waste of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De-yi, it's still not too late, change to a simpler martial art, I guarantee you can practice it to a small success in your lifetime."</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest effort Yuan Hong-xin could make.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was a renowned master, he couldn't turn a fool into a genius.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I like this one, I'll stick with it!"</p><p></p><p>As he said that, Fang Yu immediately started practicing.</p><p></p><p>The posture was crooked, the brain was stupid, making Yuan Hong-xin's blood pressure rise.</p><p></p><p>"So stupid, so stupid! The foot needs to be raised to this height to complete a basic posture."</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?? It's not kicking, not kicking, this is to make your blood circulation flow, unblock the meridians, and relax the tendons and bones, it's a preparatory action, not an attack action, are you even looking at the secret manual?"</p><p></p><p>He said he would teach him tomorrow, but his mouth couldn't help but start firing machine guns.</p><p></p><p>Too amateurish! Utterly amateurish! Not only amateurish in leg techniques, but amateurish in the entire martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If others knew that Diao De-yi was from our school, they would all laugh their heads off, who practices martial arts like this.</p><p></p><p>The foundation in martial arts is so poor, it's even worse than those idle playboys.</p><p></p><p>The only thing worth praising is his attitude towards practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Diligent and earnest in practice. Even if the posture is crooked to the extreme, at least he is practicing with sincerity.</p><p></p><p>And the reason why Fang Yu insisted on practicing step by step is also very simple.</p><p></p><p>Mastery level!</p><p></p><p>Without the system's prompts for mastery level, this martial art will not appear on the system panel.</p><p></p><p>Not on the panel, the attribute points can't be allocated, naturally unable to enter and improve.</p><p></p><p>So the starting point must be to practice to a certain degree first, increase the mastery level by 1 point, light up this martial art on the panel, and then he can start the player's unique operations.</p><p></p><p>He practiced for an hour.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that under the guidance of the master, his understanding of the Yuan Body White Shadow Kick is getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>When he finally completed a set of actions in a standard and complete manner...</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for diligently practicing [Yuan Body White Shadow Kick], Mastery Level +1.]</p><p></p><p>The prompt finally appeared!! Fang Yu was excited.</p><p></p><p>Open the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>[Name: Diao De-yi.]</p><p></p><p>[Realm: Initial Flower Realm.]</p><p></p><p>[Demon Blood Lineage: Blue Demon Blood [Initial Scorching Level].]</p><p></p><p>[Life: 632/632.]</p><p></p><p>[Physique: 3.2.] + [Spirit: 1.7.] + [Human-level Skill: Digital Life.]</p><p></p><p>[Flower-level Skills: Yuan Body Two Zero Sword [Slight Mastery (6/300)]+, Yuan Body Stabilizing Technique [Flower Realm Mid-level (4/2000)]+, Yuan Body White Shadow Kick [Unlearned (1/100)+].]</p><p></p><p>[Attribute Points: 10.]</p><p></p><p>[Experience: 60/100.]</p><p></p><p>Deep blue, allocate points!

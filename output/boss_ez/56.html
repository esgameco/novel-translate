        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's body trembled.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he arrived in time.</p><p></p><p>If he had been a second slower, the Elixir would have snatched the person's head!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was very satisfied with the punch he had just delivered.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the Sweeping Monk would also be very satisfied with that punch.</p><p></p><p>Because that punch could be considered a painless death.</p><p></p><p>In just one second, it allowed Lin Wotian to connect with Heaven, with immeasurable merit.</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for killing [Lin Wotian], you have gained 500 experience points.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Detected that [Lin Wotian] was human, the [Demonic Blood] bloodline talent was triggered.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Detected that [Lin Wotian]'s realm was higher than the player's, obtaining 50% of his maximum life value.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player, your maximum life value has increased by 600 points.】</p><p></p><p>600 health... 600 health!! Damn!</p><p></p><p>I got it! I really got it! The happiness came too suddenly, and Fang Yu was a bit at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the total of only 32 life points suddenly soar to 632, he felt like he was about to be happily dazed, filled with a strong sense of security! What demons? I'm the demon! How much health did those three brothers at the door have again? 300 health? 500 health?</p><p></p><p>Come over and get beaten up!!</p><p></p><p>Diao Deyi applied to lead the team!</p><p></p><p>Diao Deyi wanted to slay demons and exterminate evil! The first sword to slay demons, to slay his own people first! Sweeping Monk, you can rest assured and go, I will protect your Lin family descendants in the future!</p><p></p><p>Just as Fang Yu was getting excited...</p><p></p><p>The system prompt sound rang out again.</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for killing [Demonic Clone Lin Wotian], you have gained 500 experience points.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: In the unseen, the Bitter Crossing Demon has a thread of causality with you.】</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's movements froze.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ? Fang Yu: ??? System, when I put out question marks, I hope it's not that I have a problem, but that you have a problem!</p><p></p><p>Demonic Clone Lin Wotian? Bitter Crossing Demon? What does this mean? What does this mean?</p><p></p><p>This Lin Wotian is human, and then he's also a demon? What is this? Human and demon in one? Human and demon coexisting? Is he a freak?? Fang Yu was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>But the benefits of the experience points were real and tangible.</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Experience points have exceeded 100, and have been converted into 10 attribute points.】</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment.</p><p></p><p>At the instant Fang Yu killed Lin Wotian.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of miles away, on the Bitter Suffering Mountain, a slight fluctuation appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Bitter Suffering Mountain was in the shape of a basin, and in the center stood a Thousand-Zhang Stone Buddha that was several times taller than the mountain itself!</p><p></p><p>The Buddha statue, towering into the clouds, when viewed from the foot of the mountain to the top, was like facing a divine Buddha, solemn and sacred.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a tiny stone pebble detached from the Thousand-Zhang Stone Buddha.</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud.</p><p></p><p>The pebble rolled down the great Buddha, like a seed, disappearing into the ground without a trace.</p><p></p><p>The Stone Buddha then slowly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Rumble—</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Zhang Colossal Buddha, with just the action of opening its eyes, shook the heavens and the earth like thunderous roars, startling the birds in the surrounding forests to take flight.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, another clone fruit has fallen?" a black bird circled around the edge of the giant Buddha.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm..."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Zhang Colossal Buddha instantly reviewed the entire life of the clone Lin Wotian.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, your clone has reached the ultimate realm, unbreakable."</p><p></p><p>"From the initial [Demon], to becoming a complete [Human]."</p><p></p><p>"Human and demon indistinguishable, human and demon coexisting."</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch, you are only one step away from becoming [Divine]."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand-Zhang Colossal Buddha nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The massive movement shook the mountains and the earth.</p><p></p><p>It looked up at the sky, its expression complex.</p><p></p><p>There was longing, there was hatred, which finally turned into calmness.</p><p></p><p>It slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I lack... merit."</p><p></p><p>The black bird was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Patriarch going to tear open that [Heaven]?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"...How much time do we have left?" Stone Buddha spoke.</p><p></p><p>"One year." </p><p></p><p>One year! The Black Bird's emotions fluctuated. </p><p></p><p>It looked towards the Bitter Sorrow Mountain. Every flower, every blade of grass.</p><p></p><p>Every tree, every wood. </p><p></p><p>All were demons.</p><p></p><p>Demons covering the entire mountain!</p><p></p><p>Densely packed demons!</p><p></p><p>So it opened its mouth.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor has commanded!"</p><p></p><p>"After one year!"</p><p></p><p>"Rend the Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>"Enter the World!"</p><p></p><p>The resounding voice echoed across the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, rumbling, rumbling!! The mountain shook.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the mountain, all the pebbles automatically rolled and moved the great mountain.</p><p></p><p>The roots of the flowers and grasses burrowed out of the soil, swaying in the wind in response.</p><p></p><p>The lake water in the mountain leapt out of the lake surface, spraying out a rainbow.</p><p></p><p>The entire Bitter Sorrow Mountain came alive.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the town of Tianyuan, at the Red Heart Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin walked very quickly, with great urgency.</p><p></p><p>The old man Lin in the warehouse was in poor health, and Yuan Hongxin had always known this.</p><p></p><p>But that illness was incurable.</p><p></p><p>The Lin family may have had some influence, but Yuan Hongxin also had his own channels.</p><p></p><p>To cure Old Man Lin's illness, he had put in a lot of effort, front and back.</p><p></p><p>But...it was incurable.</p><p></p><p>The illness was like life itself, resisting living, the body's functions unable to stop the deterioration.</p><p></p><p>From the initial treatment to the later life-saving efforts, Yuan Hongxin had worked hard.</p><p></p><p>But just like the Lin family's efforts, it was all in vain.</p><p></p><p>Today, after Lin Wu came rushing in to report, Yuan Hongxin knew it was time to see Old Man Lin off on his final journey.</p><p></p><p>Old age and infirmity, tormented by illness, sometimes living is a form of punishment.</p><p></p><p>"Master! Master, you have to save my Second Uncle, it's all my fault! It's all my fault that Second Uncle..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu was still rambling on, but Yuan Hongxin had already stepped into the warehouse with large strides.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the warehouse, Yuan Hongxin paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>He saw a young man standing in the warehouse, and next to him was a corpse.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, Yuan Hongxin recognized the corpse - it was Old Man Lin.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he was unable to see him off on his final journey.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin sighed inwardly, then calmly looked at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>He could probably guess what had happened.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle!! "</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu had already rushed over, kneeling in front of Lin Wozhen's corpse and weeping bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Deyi, tell me, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"To the Master, the late Senior Lin could not bear the pain and torment of the elixir corroding his body, and asked me to strike and kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle!!"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu cried even more bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin sighed, was silent for a while, then asked,</p><p></p><p>"Did Old Man Lin pass away peacefully?"</p><p></p><p>"With one palm strike."</p><p></p><p>"...Good."</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Yuan Hongxin said, "Jiao Deyi, you struck Old Man Lin without my permission, which is overstepping. I will punish you by suspending your meal allowance from the hall for three months. Do you acknowledge this?"</p><p></p><p>Who cares about your food...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu clasped his fists and said, "Your disciple knows he was wrong!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, now I order you to wait in the main hall, and do not leave without my command."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>This punishment was just a formality, a mere gesture.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Lin's death was already determined from the time he was secretly fed the elixir, and he wouldn't have lived much longer even without it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's palm strike had actually given Old Man Lin a painless release.</p><p></p><p>After Old Man Lin's death, his position, the warehouse keys, and some of his belongings all needed to be sorted out and arranged.</p><p></p><p>This time, Yuan Hongxin would personally handle it, as a way to make up for not being able to see Old Man Lin one last time.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, he returned to the main hall.</p><p></p><p>He found Jiao Deyi practicing his sword in the hall.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the top of the snow-capped mountain, there was an estate.</p><p></p><p>It was called the Wine and Chess Manor.</p><p></p><p>The wine was a fiery liquor.</p><p>The chess was a deadly game.</p><p></p><p>Drinking the wine, exhaling fire, tempering the chess pieces, forging weapons.</p><p></p><p>The people in the manor diligently practiced martial arts, all for one purpose.</p><p></p><p>The annual Wine and Chess Tournament.</p><p></p><p>Nearby heroes and champions would flock here, also vying for a share.</p><p></p><p>One carriage after another crossed the snowy path, leaving a chaotic and colorful trail.</p><p></p><p>"The disciples of the Horizontal Sword Gate have arrived!"</p><p>"The disciples of the Azure Bird Gate have arrived!"</p><p>"The disciples of the Interlaced Flower Gate have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong, the young master of the Wine and Chess Manor, was not skilled in martial arts, but enjoyed the lively atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Sitting at the entrance, whenever someone entered the manor to participate in the tournament, he would shout to liven up the occasion.</p><p></p><p>"This year's turnout is more enthusiastic than previous years."</p><p>"It's no wonder, the sealing of the Wine and Chess Ancient Tomb is about to be lifted. Whoever can take the top prize will have the chance to enter the tomb."</p><p></p><p>Even as the young master of the Wine and Chess Manor, Ye Hunhong had never had the qualifications to step into the Wine and Chess Ancient Tomb. </p><p>It was a rule set by his ancestors that could not be transgressed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a fast-moving carriage approached from the distance.</p><p>But there was no flag or insignia on the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"A wandering martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong curiously stretched his neck, and the carriage abruptly stopped, kicking up a large cloud of snow that sprayed all over him.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough cough! What kind of driving skills does this carriage driver have... Ughâ€”"</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong suddenly drew in a sharp breath.</p><p>What a beautiful woman!</p><p></p><p>From the carriage stepped out a cold and elegant woman, who tossed ten taels of bloodstained silver to the carriage driver.</p><p>The driver humbly accepted the silver and turned the carriage around, driving back down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Normally, when disciples from other sects arrived, they would leave their drivers waiting.</p><p>After all, going up and down the snowy mountain without a carriage would be very inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>On any other day, Ye Hunhong would have noticed this subtle irregularity.</p><p>But at the moment, he was captivated by the woman.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, are you also here to participate in the Wine and Chess Tournament?"</p><p>Ye Hunhong enthusiastically approached her.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin merely gave him a cold glance and continued walking into the manor.</p><p></p><p>Rejected, Ye Hunhong awkwardly smiled and stopped at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Not until Qi Xiaojin had disappeared from sight inside the manor did Ye Hunhong avert his gaze.</p><p>He sat down on a rocking chair at the entrance, becoming somewhat distracted.</p><p></p><p>"A beautiful and virtuous lady, a worthy companion for a gentleman."</p><p>"That miss seems to have a cold temperament. Perhaps she would like some ice flower ornaments?"</p><p>"Our Wine and Chess Manor has a hot spring on the great snow peak. If I were to tell her about that place, maybe she would have a better impression of me?"</p><p>"The tournament lasts for three days. I must not be hasty. As the books say, advance gradually."</p><p></p><p>The commotion inside the manor seemed to have become more intense.</p><p>The sounds could be heard from the sparring grounds all the way to the entrance.</p><p>Looks like some formidable fighters have taken the stage today?</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong had little interest in martial arts, so naturally he was not invested in the tournament either, but he enjoyed the lively atmosphere.</p><p>In previous years, it was usually after the sparring stage of the tournament that he became most active.</p><p></p><p>"There's still some time before sunset. When the first day's tournament ends, I'll go look for that miss again..."</p><p>Ye Hunhong stood up, beginning to think about what opening lines he should use when meeting the woman.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I'm attracted to your beauty... Ptui ptui ptui ptui!"</p><p>"Miss, your fingers have calluses, are you skilled in the sword?"</p><p>"This line is not bad. I can use it..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Hunhong was thinking this, a loud shout rang out from inside.</p><p>"Kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong was unfazed.</p><p>Every year during the tournament, there would be a few sects that liked to issue challenges, shouting louder and louder.</p><p>Ye Hunhong was not worried, as someone inside would handle it.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the shouting soon died down.</p><p>Ye Hunhong continued to lounge at the entrance, pondering how to win the lady's heart.</p><p></p><p>Then he noticed another carriage arriving at the manor.</p><p>He identified the flag.</p><p>"The disciples of the Nine Flames Sect have arrived!"</p><p>Ye Hunhong called out perfunctorily.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After getting off the carriage, there were about five or six people. The one leading the group was someone that Ye Hunhong recognized.</p><p></p><p>"Zhuo Qi, you've come again this year."</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Last year I lost half a move to you at the Alcohol Chess Manor, this year I must reclaim my ground."</p><p></p><p>After the initial greetings, Zhuo Qi led his group into the manor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong didn't pay much attention to it at first.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a heart-wrenching scream suddenly came from inside.</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong was startled and quickly got up.</p><p></p><p>Looking into the manor, he saw that of the Nine Fire Gang, only three people remained, covered in wounds, frantically rushing out with looks of terror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"Run... run quickly!! There's a female devil! Brother Zhuo he's already..."</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!!</p><p></p><p>Three azure rays of light flashed by.</p><p></p><p>The three people running this way suddenly had their backs burst open with blood, and they collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The blood slowly seeped out, staining the ground red.</p><p></p><p>Thud.</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong fell to the ground, looking towards the front.</p><p></p><p>He saw the woman he had briefly met earlier coldly retract her right hand and turn to walk back into the manor.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't a walk, but faster than running, her lightness skill clearly exceptional.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, wait!"</p><p></p><p>Not knowing where the courage came from, Ye Hunhong chased after her.</p><p></p><p>Entering the manor, Ye Hunhong was immediately horrified, his eyes wide open.</p><p></p><p>Inside the manor, there were bodies strewn everywhere! The bodies extended all the way to the arena of the martial arts competition, their numbers reaching a peak there.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of sects, countless experts, all lay dead at the edges of the arena.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Alcohol Chess Manor had also been wiped out, not a single survivor.</p><p></p><p>The scorched black marks all around told of the fierce battle that had taken place.</p><p></p><p>But the victor was only one person - that mysterious woman unstained by blood!</p><p></p><p>"Red'er..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a weak voice came from directly in front.</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong focused his gaze and saw his father, the master of the Alcohol Chess Manor, severely wounded and kneeling while embracing a corpse.</p><p></p><p>His mother's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Ye Hunhong's mind went blank, as if he had fallen into a nightmare.</p><p></p><p>Then, the devil spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Hunhong?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Hunhong stared blankly at the woman.</p><p></p><p>He saw the woman standing behind his father, grasping his father's head with her hand.</p><p></p><p>Without saying a word, she made a single motion.</p><p></p><p>Bang!!</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, his father's head was crushed and exploded open by her grip.</p><p></p><p>The red blood and white brain matter sprayed high up, yet did not touch even the edge of the woman's clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p>"Ahhh..."</p><p>"Ahhhhhhh!!"</p><p></p><p>His head splitting in pain, he knelt on the ground, clutching his head and wailing.</p><p></p><p>He felt the world spinning around him.</p><p>He felt a power about to surge out from within his body.</p><p>He recalled the memories from his childhood.</p><p></p><p>"Red'er, this is the key [Red Candle Heart] that our Alcohol Chess Manor has preserved for generations, which can open the true [Ancient Alcohol Chess Tomb]."</p><p></p><p>"The Red Candle Heart must be nourished by a human soul to endure."</p><p></p><p>"This is our honor, and also the blessing of the Spiritual Lord."</p><p></p><p>The Red Candle Heart, that's right, the power of the Red Candle Heart!</p><p></p><p>As if hearing Ye Hunhong's call, that power began to surge frantically, filling his entire body.</p><p></p><p>"Power, the power is surging..."</p><p></p><p>Bang! Ye Hunhong's head suddenly exploded open by itself.</p><p></p><p>What emerged was a bright red key. Standing upright on the headless corpse, it spoke in a mechanical voice.</p><p></p><p>"Charging 100% complete, Spiritual Servant No. 7531, ready to serve. Please enter the authorization password."</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin, as if having anticipated this, calmly said,</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Lord is about to return, and the opportunity of others can be seized."</p><p></p><p>"Password correct, now opening the true Ancient Alcohol Chess Tomb."</p><p></p><p>Rumble, the entire manor shook, and after a while, it finally settled down.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because of Diao De-yi's mastery of the sword technique, he was familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't it just the Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword? He learned it? He actually learned it! Yuan Hong-xin couldn't believe it, it was astonishing!</p><p></p><p>The reason was that just a day ago, this Diao De-yi couldn't even get the first move of the sword technique right! But in just one day, not only did Diao De-yi return, he had also practiced it so skillfully that it was second nature to him. It wasn't just a small accomplishment, but at least he had grasped the basics.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that I had misjudged him again? Was this guy a sword technique genius?? "Diao De-yi..."</p><p></p><p>"Master! I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu heard the voice, sheathed his sword, and checked the system record.</p><p></p><p>Wow, just a 2-point increase in quantity and 1 point of experience value.</p><p></p><p>[Flower-level skill: Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword [Initial Mastery (6/100)]]</p><p>[Experience value: 60/100.]</p><p></p><p>Boring, boring. With 11 attribute points in hand, Fang Yu had no patience for this slow-paced practice.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it's still necessary to...</p><p></p><p>Deep blue, add points! [Attribute points: 11 → 10.]</p><p></p><p>[Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword [Initial Mastery] → Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword [Slight Mastery].]</p><p></p><p>The understanding of the sword techniques instantly flooded his mind.</p><p></p><p>His body was as if it had practiced the sword techniques countless times, every move and form etched in his memory.</p><p></p><p>Slight Mastery!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the master spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The sword technique you just practiced, was it the Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"... Perform it from the beginning for me to see."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"What 'huh'? Just do it."</p><p></p><p>"Okay..."</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had only seen the middle part of the sword technique demonstration.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hong-xin couldn't believe his eyes. Based on his assessment of Diao De-yi's martial arts aptitude yesterday, Diao De-yi should have been a trash talent, only proficient in one specialized skill, the Yuan Ti Gu Ben Gong.</p><p></p><p>But after just one day, he could even pick up the Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword? He had already shown no talent on the first day!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hong-xin was very skeptical, very skeptical! Then, he saw Fang Yu start to perform the sword dance.</p><p></p><p>The sword movements were very fast, but after a complete set, Yuan Hong-xin was shocked again!</p><p></p><p>Because if the first time he saw Fang Yu's Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword, it gave him the feeling of [Initial Mastery].</p><p></p><p>Then this time, the feeling was [Slight Mastery]!</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques don't lie.</p><p></p><p>That fluency, the understanding of the techniques, the natural body coordination, couldn't be faked.</p><p></p><p>This was the [Slight Mastery] of the Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword!</p><p></p><p>From [Initial Mastery] to [Slight Mastery] in just one round.</p><p></p><p>This progress directly shocked Yuan Hong-xin.</p><p></p><p>"You, are you really Diao De-yi?"</p><p></p><p>He even suspected that Diao De-yi was possessed by a demon!</p><p></p><p>But this half-joking remark from Yuan Hong-xin made Fang Yu a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I am who I am, how could there be a fake?"</p><p></p><p>That was true.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from practicing the sword techniques quickly, there was no other difference.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, perform the sword technique for me one more time."</p><p></p><p>"...Master, you're just teasing me."</p><p></p><p>"I told you to practice, so practice."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had no choice but to practice again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Fang Yu practiced while Yuan Hong-xin guided him.</p><p></p><p>Then, Yuan Hong-xin confirmed it.</p><p></p><p>Diao De-yi, was still Diao De-yi.</p><p></p><p>The [Slight Mastery] of the Yuan Ti Liang Ling Sword was real.</p><p></p><p>But the talent, was still that foolish talent.</p><p></p><p>The understanding of the entire sword technique, the entire entirety, was stuck at the [Slight Mastery] stage, without the slightest bit of expanded thinking.</p><p></p><p>Dull-witted!</p><p></p><p>No...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hopeless! You are just so dull! Absolutely not a genius, beyond help!" </p><p></p><p>"No need to practice anymore, sit down, let me tell you something... Oh right, where did you get this double-edged sword?"</p><p></p><p>"Sister Mei gave it to me. When she was helping to clean up the storage room, she found these two swords. Seeing me standing here, knowing that I can use the double-edged sword, she left it for me."</p><p></p><p>These two swords, one long and one short, were of average quality, but they would suffice for self-defense.</p><p></p><p>"Diaode, although your talent is dull, you did well with the matter of Master Lin."</p><p></p><p>"It's better that Master Lin passed away quickly, suffering less. I'm at peace with it."</p><p></p><p>"My punishment of you is just due to the sect rules, not from my heart. You understand, right?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yuan Hongxin say this much, how could Fangyu not understand.</p><p></p><p>He nodded like garlic.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fangyu so obedient, Yuan Hongxin found him much more agreeable.</p><p></p><p>His talent may be a bit lacking, but he was able to learn the Yuanti Fixation Skill and the Yuanti Two-Zero Sword just fine, learning one skill after the other.</p><p></p><p>Although it took him a day to learn the Yuanti Two-Zero Sword, it was still astonishingly impressive. Pity, though... he has no ceiling.</p><p></p><p>This lifetime is probably all he'll get. That peanut brain wanting to fathom the mysteries behind the Yuanti Two-Zero Sword and reach the pinnacle, it's unlikely to happen in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But no matter, it's just one more bowl of rice.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin was quite good to his own disciples, especially the ones he acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>"Diaode, don't feel wronged. For every punishment, there is a reward."</p><p></p><p>"You have merit in reducing Master Lin's suffering, I will certainly reward you."</p><p></p><p>"Now you have three choices."</p><p></p><p>"One, I can give you a cultivation manual and guide you through it until you master it."</p><p></p><p>This was giving special attention to Diaode, who had such dull talent. Yuan Hongxin making this promise required some mental preparation and courage on his part.</p><p></p><p>"Two, a bottle of Yuanni. Applying Yuanni to your body, combined with daily martial arts training, can enhance your physique."</p><p></p><p>"Three, a recommendation letter to the Yudi Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Fangyu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"A recommendation letter?"</p><p></p><p>Could this be compared to the other two rewards? Heaven and earth, really? Who would want that?</p><p></p><p>Huh? Wait, if I enter the Yudi Underworld, I can become a righteous killer and freely kill people... that doesn't sound too bad.</p><p></p><p>But with my current strength, I should be able to directly apply and get hired by the Yudi Underworld, right? </p><p></p><p>Thinking about how trash teammates like Li Qianxuan could get hired, and now I'm a monster with over 600 HP, getting into the Yudi Underworld should be a piece of cake.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin thought Fangyu wanted the recommendation letter, so he explained further.</p><p></p><p>"That's right! It's a recommendation letter. I know you were recommended by Li Qianxuan to come here. The purpose of coming here was to refine your martial arts, and then apply to the Yudi Underworld, pass the assessment, and join under his banner."</p><p></p><p>"But sometimes, things don't have to be so complicated."</p><p></p><p>"I have some connections in the Yudi Underworld. With your current strength, plus the recommendation letter, you have a 90% chance of passing the assessment smoothly."</p><p></p><p>"You choose whichever you want."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Yuan Hongxin fell silent and started sipping his tea.</p><p></p><p>Heavens! How did my ultimate goal become becoming Li Qianxuan's subordinate? That's way too unambitious!</p><p></p><p>Eliminating the sole wrong answer of the recommendation letter, Fangyu had to choose between the remaining two.</p><p></p><p>Yuanni, to enhance physique.</p><p></p><p>But honestly, I already have over 600 HP, do I still need to enhance my physique?</p><p></p><p>Indeed, cultivation manuals are the eternal and unchanging way.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I choose... the cultivation manual!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! I have [Tiger Strength Technique], [Southern Barbarian Fist], [Great Stele Imprint], and also this [Tranquil Finger]. Which one do you want?"</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Blood gushed out from their bodies, as flesh and body separated.</p><p></p><p>On the left side of the group, the blood bars of five people disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>Flesh exploded around the people.</p><p></p><p>Severed limbs flew everywhere, and flesh was scattered all over the ground, all of this happening in a fleeting moment.</p><p></p><p>Rushing out over a hundred meters away, stopping and turning around, the Ominous Demon let out a hideous low laugh.</p><p></p><p>Without giving the rest a chance to react, it charged towards the remaining half of the living again! "What?!"</p><p></p><p>"We've been tricked!!"</p><p></p><p>"Ah Wei—"</p><p></p><p>"No!!"</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!!"</p><p></p><p>The incident happened so suddenly, catching everyone completely off guard.</p><p></p><p>After reacting, more than half on the left side had already died, their cries of agony echoing all around, while the demonic creature was rushing towards them like a harbinger of death.</p><p></p><p>Grave crisis pressed in, in this moment, Fang Yu's mind was exceptionally clear, he took a deep breath and suddenly shouted in a loud voice! "Everyone shut up!! The demon is coming to kill us!!"</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu's volume overpowered the others, he also grabbed Li Qianxuan's arm.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li, this time it will definitely target me first."</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan reacted quickly and kept his composure, asking, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>"Wuhu psychology! Last time it was a feint, so this time it must be for real!"</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan fell silent for half a second, then immediately made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"...Okay! I trust you!"</p><p></p><p>The words had just left his mouth when the demon was already approaching.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hurriedly pointed his sword at the target.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, listen to my command - draw your swords!!"</p><p></p><p>Almost as soon as Fang Yu spoke, Li Qianxuan suddenly made a 180-degree turn, his eyes fixed intently on Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was instantly perplexed, but his attention was still on the demonic creature in front.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the others had all drawn their swords towards the front, but the demon leapt up! </p><p></p><p>Evading all the attacks, it plunged straight towards Fang Yu's position!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, time seemed to slow down.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's facial expression changed slowly, violently, his pupils following the demon's jumping height upwards, his mouth slightly open, shocked and stunned.</p><p></p><p>And in the reflection of his pupils, Li Qianxuan, as if receiving feedback from Fang Yu's micro-expressions, suddenly struck out with his sword!</p><p></p><p>"Roar!!"</p><p></p><p>Hum!!</p><p></p><p>The demon's roar and Li Qianxuan's sword strike almost sounded at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Time flow returned to normal at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu only felt a flash of sword light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>A collision-like explosion sounded. -89! -111!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, two bright red critical hit numbers suddenly popped up in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh swoosh swoosh—</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a large patch of fresh blood was suddenly sprayed all over Fang Yu's face.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu watched the blood bar above the "Ominous Demon: 3/1000" with wide eyes, as it was blown back two or three meters and fell to the ground, while beside him, Li Qianxuan collapsed to the ground, with a gaping claw-like wound on his chest, vomiting blood from his mouth, with '-0.1' '-0.1' continuous damage indicators on his head, passing out.</p><p></p><p>What happened? Fang Yu was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Li!? "</p><p></p><p>"The demon has injured Lord Li!"</p><p></p><p>"Look at the blood on the ground! The demon is also severely injured, over there!"</p><p></p><p>The words of the others immediately brought Fang Yu back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Shit! This is not the time to be dazed, we need to grab the kill! They're going to snatch the kill!</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Yu didn't know what level this demon was, with a thousand health, it must be a big boss! Can this kill be let go of?? "Damn it! Get away from that demon! Let me handle it!!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu shouted loudly, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>The indignant team members had already rushed towards the point where the blood bar fell.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! My big experience gift pack...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu hadn't even finished regretting when he suddenly heard...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A fierce, beastly roar erupted from ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!! -215! -172! -188!"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, three heads in front flew out.</p><p></p><p>The rest were frightened and retreated. It was then that Fangyu focused his eyes and saw that the luminous demon had revealed its true form, which was visible to everyone.</p><p></p><p>It was a monster with a head that almost occupied its entire body. </p><p></p><p>It was somewhat like an owl, but with a huge head, a gaping bloody maw, and a ferocious appearance. </p><p></p><p>Its fur was very dense, covering its entire body like feathers, with no distinction between hands and feet, only four sharp claws, two severed feet, and a severed tail wound, standing like a human.</p><p></p><p>This was the true form of the luminous demon? Its feathers reflected glimmers of light in the sunlight, blending into the environment as if ready to merge with it at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The most peculiar thing was that the luminous demon's body was emitting wispy red steam, and a "-0.1", "-0.1" blood loss prompt was constantly appearing on its head.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were like white cataracts, without pupils or focus, only howling madly around, as if it had fallen into a state of frenzy.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, its blood had dropped to only 1.5.</p><p></p><p>[Luminous Demon: 1.5/1000]</p><p></p><p>"Shoot arrows!!" </p><p></p><p>Yue Guang, seeing the demon was still so fierce, immediately drew his bow and shouted.</p><p></p><p>The remaining people followed suit.</p><p></p><p>However, they didn't expect that as soon as Yue Guang's arrow flew towards the luminous demon, it was directly grabbed and broken by its sharp claws.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the arrows flew over, only to be caught by the luminous demon, which then swung them back with its hand!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!!"</p><p>"No good!"</p><p>"-198! -211! -179!"</p><p></p><p>Cries and exclamations rang out, and three people were directly pierced by the arrows and killed.</p><p></p><p>The remaining people could only barely dodge, too frightened to dare move.</p><p></p><p>The people looked at the luminous demon in disbelief. After revealing its true form, its strength had simply skyrocketed, and they were no match for it at all!</p><p></p><p>Only in Fangyu's eyes, the demon's blood had already dropped to 0.5.</p><p></p><p>[Luminous Demon: 0.5/1000]</p><p></p><p>"How could it... become so strong?!"</p><p>"So this wasn't the demon's limit before!"</p><p>"Is this the demon's true power? Was it just toying with us before?"</p><p></p><p>The people stared dumbfoundedly at the powerful luminous demon, feeling that the demon was like an insurmountable mountain, leaving them breathless.</p><p></p><p>Thud! At this moment, the luminous demon took a step towards them. This one step immediately startled the crowd into sudden awakening.</p><p></p><p>"Flee! We must flee!"</p><p>"We cannot contend with this demon. Its current strength is beyond our ability to handle!"</p><p>"We can only flee. As many as can escape, take Lord Li with us!"</p><p></p><p>Before, they could still use bows and arrows to consume it from a distance, but now even the arrows had no effect.</p><p></p><p>Faced with this overwhelming power, the crowd quickly picked up the unconscious Li Qianyuan and fled.</p><p></p><p>But as the crowd fled backwards, there was one person who went against the flow, crossing paths with the fleeing crowd.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he walked towards the luminous demon, as if with each step, his aura grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang suddenly turned back, his face changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi?!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yue Guang's shout, the crowd turned back to look, and their faces all changed.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, stop! Have you gone mad?!"</p><p>"Run! Run with us, Diao Deyi!"</p><p>"What is he trying to do?!"</p><p>"Seeking death! You're seeking death, Diao Deyi!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voices behind him, Fangyu laughed loudly, gripping the sharp sword tightly and walking forward resolutely.</p><p></p><p>You all don't understand... you don't understand at all!!</p><p></p><p>Others fear me, I'm greedy! Others suffer small losses, I make big gains! Others liquidate, I go all in!!</p><p></p><p>I declare that this place is now... Diao Deyi Square!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There was just some straw on the ground, a night pot, and a few broken ceramic bowls - that's all that was left.</p><p></p><p>The walls were completely solid, with no windows, and the iron door was locked tight, making escape seem impossible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he should be able to leave this wretched place in about an hour.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu persisted for ten minutes - three minutes exploring the prison environment, five minutes studying the attribute panel, and the remaining two minutes just staring blankly.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he didn't even use up the remaining 2 attribute points, mainly because he couldn't figure out what to do with the spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the pile of straw, Fang Yu chose...</p><p></p><p>"Log out of the game."</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: When a player logs out of the game, the character will still exist in the game. Please try to log out in a safe location.】</p><p></p><p>What's this about? Fang Yu scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>A single-person prison, this should be the safest place to log out, right?</p><p></p><p>He confirmed logging out of the game.</p><p></p><p>Blinking his eyes, the familiar ceiling came into view.</p><p></p><p>He was back in reality.</p><p></p><p>Removing the game helmet and carefully placing it aside, Fang Yu checked the time.</p><p></p><p>It was 10:45 pm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu paused.</p><p></p><p>The time consumption... was the same as in the game?</p><p></p><p>So this game has a 1:1 time ratio between the game and reality? </p><p></p><p>Then I have a huge advantage! I can be a full-time professional gamer!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu got excited.</p><p></p><p>Although he had previously lost a lot of money trying to be a professional gamer and had to go work on a construction site to make up for the losses, that doesn't stop him from calling himself a professional gamer. His goal is to earn money by playing games, after all.</p><p></p><p>But for now, his character is still in jail, so he's not in a rush to log back in.</p><p></p><p>This time he logged out to check the game forums and find out more about the spiritual attribute.</p><p></p><p>Opening the game forum, he was surprised to find it was extremely active, with new posts appearing every second.</p><p></p><p>The players' enthusiasm was unprecedented, their desire to post was extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>Glancing through, aside from the excited praise for the game's immersive realism, there were more complaints about the game's difficulty.</p><p></p><p>One post even detailed the player's death process and the death penalty.</p><p></p><p>"My character's name is Wu Jiu Lang, 17 years old. He lives in the northeast corner of the big courtyard in Kunming Alley, Daqing City, unmarried. He works at the pig slaughterhouse on East Street, working from sunrise to sunset, with a healthy work schedule. Today was the first time I became him, and I'm a bit embarrassed to say this, but... I BOKE'd! Because my character's sister-in-law is very good-looking! I won't hide it, I confessed my love to her, and then I was beaten to death by my big brother and his brothers."</p><p></p><p>"After death, I couldn't log in for 1 hour. When I logged in again, I found that my character was no longer Wu Jiu Lang, but the mentally disabled son of a prostitute in the Red Light District of Daqing City, who could only make unintelligible sounds. All the previous character's information was reset, as if I had started a new character, but I was lucky to be reborn in the same city, so I went back to the northeast courtyard, only to find Wu Jiu Lang's body - my own body!"</p><p></p><p>"It feels really strange. I've only died once so far, so I'm not sure if the login cooldown after death is fixed at 1 hour, or if it gets longer each time. I hope later players can test it out. I'm now hiding under my sister-in-law's bed, posting this on the forum before logging back in. I don't have much more to say, but I hope everyone else can also find their dream sister-in-law in the game!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>This guy is a bit twisted.</p><p></p><p>People's sexual preferences are their own business, but still...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Please have some self-respect! But the information about this guy's death is quite useful.</p><p></p><p>It seems that after a character dies, it's a complete end, and everything starts over from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>This is not good at all, the death penalty is quite severe. Other people are now like blank slates, they may feel that it doesn't matter how they die, but this guy just killed a powerful demon and received a reward, he can't just die easily.</p><p></p><p>However, the heavy death penalty also has its advantages, which is that ordinary players will be timid and cautious about everything, and will need help from others.</p><p></p><p>And that's when the great professional players need to come out and lend a hand! Opportunities! Chances! It's all a blue ocean!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's eyes lit up, feeling that he could definitely make a huge fortune in this game.</p><p></p><p>He exited the post and continued searching the forum for useful information.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Community, Unit 1, Room 101.</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin was also wearing a game helmet, immersed in the game.</p><p></p><p>In the game.</p><p></p><p>Lianyun Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>A woman stood by the window, looking at the pouring rain outside, her thoughts scattered.</p><p></p><p>"Has he returned?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, even after rebirth, the body most suitable for me in this game is still this one."</p><p></p><p>"Lianyun Stronghold, the starting point of everything, the place where the dream begins..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just that this time, I entered the game earlier! I've left enough time for cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Knock knock knock.</p><p></p><p>The sound of knocking came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>A woman pushed the door open and entered.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, the divination ritual is about to begin."</p><p></p><p>That was her game character's sister, her head slightly lowered, and even though Qi Xiaojin couldn't see her expression, she knew that the ugly look of seven parts jealousy and three parts curse would never change.</p><p></p><p>But she was no longer the same as in the past! Qi Xiaojin's mouth curled up, and she strode out of the room.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we're going to divine!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The divination ritual.</p><p></p><p>"Divination complete."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingjin, Talent Grade C-!"</p><p></p><p>The entire venue was in an uproar, with whispers and murmurs. The genius that had been praised for so long in the stronghold actually had such a low level.</p><p></p><p>Facing the pointing and whispering 'clansmen', Qi Xiaojin turned and left.</p><p></p><p>As she passed by her sister, she saw the barely concealed astonishment and glee on her sister's face, the smugly delighted expression almost bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>Since her body had already been divined and her spiritual attributes unlocked, there was no need to stay here any longer.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingya, Talent Grade A+!"</p><p></p><p>The exclamation came from behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Grade A+? Me?!"</p><p></p><p>Ecstasy erupted, and her sister was embraced and engulfed by the crowd, while Qi Xiaojin walked away from the crowd, heading towards the back mountain of Lianyun Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Sister..."</p><p></p><p>Her sister looked at Qi Xiaojin's retreating back with hesitation, but thinking of the years when Qi Xiaojin had been pressing down on her, a twisted sense of satisfaction spread throughout her body.</p><p></p><p>Not enough... not enough! Sister! Just making you flee in disgrace is not enough! How can I be satisfied? I need more... I need to humiliate you even more! Take back all the dignity I've lost!!...</p><p></p><p>On the back mountain of Lianyun Stronghold, on a moss-covered circular stone platform, Qi Xiaojin suddenly bit her finger, using her blood as ink to draw a series of lines.</p><p></p><p>When she finished, a blood-colored gourd pattern had been imprinted on the moss-covered round stone.</p><p></p><p>"With the blood of the Lin family as sustenance! With the soul of the seven spirits and six souls as the contract, I, Lin Qingjin, wish to offer my body as a sacrifice, and bow to the Alcohol Flower as the master!"</p><p></p><p>"The blood has fallen, the contract is complete!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

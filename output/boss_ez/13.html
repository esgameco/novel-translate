        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Qi Xiaojin seemed to still be Qi Xiaojin, yet there was also a change about her.</p><p></p><p>"Sister!?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Lian Xiaoyu, the sister of the character, appeared behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, this is the forbidden ground of the Lian family stronghold, how could you be here..."</p><p></p><p>Under the moonlight, Qi Xiaojin turned back, tilting her head, her cold gaze calmly looking at Lian Xiaoyu.</p><p></p><p>"Lian Xiaoyu, do you know what a spirit is? A spirit is a divine servant. In simple terms, it is the dog of the gods. And I, I am now the dog of the dog! Of course, you can also call me... a believer."</p><p></p><p>Lian Xiaoyu's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you... what have you worshipped! What are you doing..."</p><p></p><p>"Go, drunken bug!"</p><p></p><p>Three azure lights flashed like hidden projectiles from Qi Xiaojin's hand.</p><p></p><p>In the instant they left her hand, they disappeared, and the next moment they suddenly appeared on Lian Xiaoyu's chest.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang! Lian Xiaoyu's chest burst open in three bloody flowers, and she collapsed to the ground, blood flowing everywhere! She stared wide-eyed, unable to believe that her sister would actually strike to kill her! And the hand was so ruthless and deadly!</p><p></p><p>Thud! Thud! Thud! Qi Xiaojin's cold footsteps crossed over Lian Xiaoyu on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You won't die, the thing inside you prevents me from killing you now. But this is only temporary, the next time we meet, you will become a complete corpse."</p><p></p><p>The icy voice, as if from a stranger, faded away with the sister's footsteps, and Lian Xiaoyu's vision also sank into darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Sis... ter..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>A large fire broke out in the chieftain's house of the Lian Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>After the people put out the fire, they discovered that the chieftain's room had been robbed.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Ancient Jade! Someone stole my Nine Ancient Jade!!"</p><p></p><p>The chieftain was furious, and they had not yet discovered that a young woman named 'Lian Qingjin' had gone missing from the Lian Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>A speeding carriage, crossing the muddy mountain road, descended along the road of the Lian Stronghold.</p><p></p><p>"Next step, the Ancient Tomb of Jiu Qi!"</p><p></p><p>"I must hurry, even faster! Before everything happens, I must become strong enough to prevent all tragedies!"</p><p></p><p>"This is my responsibility, the responsibility I must bear as a person of two lifetimes!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin gripped the Nine Ancient Jade, and the wisps of black aura around her were channeled through the jade, absorbed into her body, nourishing and strengthening her soul.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of red light appeared on her body, emitting wisps of red steam!</p><p></p><p>Qi Xiaojin's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Humans have seven souls and six corporeal souls, with the command soul as the head and the wisdom soul as the end, and the wheel soul as the beginning."</p><p></p><p>"To open the seven souls, shatter the six corporeal souls, break through the human level, and become... a Immortal!"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't I right, Drunken Flower Immortal? Being your dog is only temporary, if you bark again, I'll crush the Nine Ancient Jade, and no one will have a good time!"</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, the red light dimmed and returned to calmness.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Tomb of Jiu Qi, the journey is long, Qi Xiaojin slowly closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Log out of the game."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After logging out of the game, Qi Xiaojin took a deep breath, rubbed her brow, and reviewed what she had done in the game, feeling that there was no flaw, then went to the kitchen and poured herself a cup of hot water.</p><p></p><p>While drinking the water, she looked out the window.</p><p></p><p>The night scenery is so beautiful tonight...</p><p></p><p>Just as Qi Xiaojin thought this, something flashed from outside and disappeared below.</p><p></p><p>Boom!! Immediately afterwards, the sound of a heavy body crashing to the ground outside rang out, and the shredded flesh and blood splattered all over her window.</p><p></p><p>The blood dripped down the window, and Qi Xiaojin was completely frozen in place.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't remember anything happening in the neighborhood at this time in her previous life.</p><p></p><p>"It's changed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Has the world line changed?" "But I didn't do anything at all?"</p><p></p><p>She opened the window, looked up at the outside, and couldn't help but take a deep breath, covering her mouth in surprise.</p><p></p><p>It was the body of an elderly person, Zhou Daye's body!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>One minute ago.</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Community, Building 1, 19th Floor, Room 1905.</p><p></p><p>Lying in front of the window, Fang Yu, who was searching forum posts on the computer, yawned.</p><p></p><p>"So, this game is not just about killing monsters, like hunting or blacksmithing, or even just aimlessly running around until you're exhausted, you can also gain experience points?"</p><p></p><p>"There are many ways to gain experience points, but the efficiency varies. And after reaching 100 points, they can all be converted into attribute points."</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few people on the forum who have already obtained attribute points, mostly from various chance encounters. Like falling off a cliff and eating a hundred-year-old snake bile, helping a destitute old man on the street and mysteriously receiving a martial arts legacy, or awakening hidden potential when facing death, all kinds of bizarre things have happened."</p><p></p><p>"But those are just individual cases. The orthodox way to obtain attribute points is still through martial arts training and blacksmithing..."</p><p></p><p>Just as Fang Yu was analyzing this, a dark shadow suddenly flashed past the window.</p><p></p><p>Before Fang Yu could react...</p><p></p><p>Boom!! A strange, heavy thud echoed through the entire Qingshui Community.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stuck his head out of the window, looking down, but it was pitch black and he couldn't see anything clearly, only vaguely seeing a group of small dark spots gradually lighting up and going out to check the situation.</p><p></p><p>The next moment...</p><p></p><p>"Aaaaah!!" </p><p></p><p>An ear-piercing scream came from below.</p><p></p><p>Something had happened! Fang Yu's expression changed, and he hurriedly left the room, rushing to frantically press the elevator button.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, there were many people just as eager as him to go downstairs and see what happened, the elevator was now on the 15th floor and stopping at each floor.</p><p></p><p>Waiting for the elevator would be too slow.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt a sense of unease for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Just now, when the incident happened, he didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>But now, recalling the sound of the heavy object hitting the ground, it was like the sound of a meatball slamming onto the floor...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't dare to think about it further, he just felt afraid.</p><p></p><p>The elevator was too slow, so he decided to take the stairs.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't expect to encounter people on the stairs as well.</p><p></p><p>It was even an acquaintance, Old Man Wang.</p><p></p><p>This Old Man Wang was already quite old, but he was actually taking the stairs to see the commotion, not using the elevator. Fang Yu didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Wang smiled and said, "Little Fang, are you also going downstairs to see the excitement?"</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Wang, what exactly happened downstairs? That scream sounded like something bad happened."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either, but I heard someone jumped off the building and committed suicide!"</p><p></p><p>"That can't be..."</p><p></p><p>Although he said that, Fang Yu had already half-believed it.</p><p></p><p>Because that "boom" sound of something hitting the ground was really unsettling.</p><p></p><p>The further down the stairs he went, the more people there were in the stairwell, crowded like in a vegetable market.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was stuck there for more than ten minutes before finally reaching the first floor with the crowd.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he arrived, he noticed Qi Xiaoqin standing at the entrance.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly lowered his head, pretending not to see her.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Yu! Over here, over here!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

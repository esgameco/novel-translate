        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Were the two bodies just now thrown over by Diao De'er? Wasn't Diao De'er a scrawny good-for-nothing? How could he suddenly become so strong? It couldn't have been Diao De'er!</p><p></p><p>This guy must be putting on an act!</p><p></p><p>He must have done something I didn't see.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all standing around for? Go get him! Kill Diao De'er!"</p><p></p><p>This capture order came from the Black Decree.</p><p></p><p>It means, dead or alive, just bring him back.</p><p></p><p>Big Tiger didn't know why the higher-ups of the Black Tiger Gang suddenly took an interest in Diao De'er.</p><p></p><p>Anyway, he was just following orders to capture someone, and Diao Ruru was an unexpected harvest, just a side thing.</p><p></p><p>He still knew the difference between primary and secondary.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De'er, don't mind me! Run quickly!!"</p><p></p><p>Diao Ruru saw Diao De'er come back and screamed in a shrill voice.</p><p></p><p>But Diao De'er, as if he didn't hear, instead strode into the house!</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother's subordinates quickly surrounded Diao De'er.</p><p></p><p>"At that moment, the atmosphere between the two sides was tense, and the battle was about to break out."</p><p></p><p>"Boom! Boom! Loud thunder outside! Diao De'er's momentum was like a soaring eagle!"</p><p></p><p>"A thunderous roar in the sky, Diao De'er made a dazzling appearance..."</p><p></p><p>The people present were all stunned, looking towards the source of the sound.</p><p></p><p>Only to see Wei Kai standing on a chair, speaking in a storytelling manner.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? Keep going?"</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, you've interrupted the plot."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, they were just getting into the fight."</p><p></p><p>"The AI is not good, rushing all at once, that Diao De'er will definitely be easily defeated by four legs."</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother looked, well, Wei Kai and the others were just waving their fists, while the other subordinates were loyally trying to fight Diao De'er to the death.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all doing? Your brothers have been killed by him, don't you feel anything? Go fight him, kill Diao De'er! Avenge your brothers!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Brothers?</p><p></p><p>He looked at the two corpses on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, they'll just be good fellows, they can just die, and I'll take them flying later!</p><p></p><p>Tap, tap, tap! Seeing Wei Kai's sluggishness, Tiger Brother strode up to him.</p><p></p><p>"What? Doesn't my words work anymore? Don't you understand to go fight Diao De'er?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai looked up at Tiger Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Skip."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"Skip the dialogue."</p><p></p><p>"You f*****..."</p><p></p><p>Slap! Tiger Brother slapped Wei Kai directly on the face.</p><p></p><p>The pain from the cheek reached the nerves in his brain, and Wei Kai was knocked to the ground by the slap.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck?! It hurts!!!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai was dazed, almost crying.</p><p></p><p>How come the pain perception in this new game is so high?</p><p></p><p>"System! Adjust the pain perception..."</p><p></p><p>Slap!!</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother came over and slapped him on the face again.</p><p></p><p>"Are you awake now? It's not even night yet, what are you dreaming about!"</p><p></p><p>Both cheeks were in excruciating pain, and his face was swollen.</p><p></p><p>Wei Kai was already crying profusely.</p><p></p><p>The roommates around him, however, burst out laughing, not yet realizing the seriousness of the problem.</p><p></p><p>"Haha! Second brother got hit!"</p><p>"Wuwuwu, cry, cry, so fragile~hahaha!"</p><p>"More hits! More hits! Tiger Brother, I support you!"</p><p></p><p>Tiger Brother was yelling fiercely, and the few subordinates surrounding Fang Yu also looked at each other, not knowing what to do.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was even more dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He heard the neighbors' discussions and thought there was going to be a big incident inside.</p><p></p><p>Fierce and imposing</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He rushed in, but... why did they start fighting each other??</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was puzzled, and took the opportunity to secretly peek at the system message log.</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Hou Shu] player, gained 10 experience points.】</p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Ren Leru] player, gained 10 experience points.】</p><p>【System Prompt: Frequent killing of players within a short period will accumulate the hidden value [Sha Qi]. [Sha Qi] will dissipate slowly over time.】</p><p>【Sha Qi: The special energy accumulated from mutual destruction among the same kind. It is a great tonic for demons and monsters. They love to eat humans with [Sha Qi] the most, as these humans have great attraction to them.】</p><p></p><p>Fuck!? What the hell did I just see? 10 experience points??</p><p></p><p>What the fuck is 10 experience points??</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu simply couldn't believe his eyes.</p><p></p><p>10 experience points, what a concept? Previously, he had almost killed himself trying to kill that stalking woman, and all he got was 10 experience points.</p><p></p><p>But now, just randomly killing two useless guard players, he directly got 20 experience points credited?? </p><p></p><p>Are players really that valuable?? As for the later part about [Sha Qi], Fang Yu automatically ignored it.</p><p></p><p>Sha Qi or no Sha Qi, I only see the experience points! Forget about killing NPCs, I'm going to kill players! I'm at war with all the players in the server!!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart was getting excited.</p><p></p><p>Practicing martial arts to the point of exhaustion, he could only get 3-4 points of experience per day.</p><p></p><p>But with a flick of the hand, he could kill the weakling players and get 10 points! And the more he kills, the more he gets!</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just stepping on the left foot with the right foot and taking off right where you are? He glanced at the experience value on the attribute panel.</p><p></p><p>【Experience Value: 51/100.】</p><p></p><p>Wow, I'm directly awesome!</p><p></p><p>Surged to 51 points!</p><p></p><p>Alright, alright! There's something to work with here!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu wished his skills could distinguish players from non-players instead of just seeing health bars.</p><p></p><p>I, Diao De Yi, from today on, will officially specialize in the hidden profession of a player hunter across the entire server! Fuck killing demons, demons are so hard to kill.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at Yue Guang's small demon with over 500 HP, I'm already scared to make a move, let alone the others.</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute! Yue Guang...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly had a thought, and a scene of the player he killed increasing their maximum health flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Could it be... not that the demon Yue Guang is special,</p><p></p><p>but rather... those players in the prison cart, there's something wrong with them?? Assuming the players in the prison cart have killed other players and are tainted with [Sha Qi], that's why Yue Guang's health increased after killing them.</p><p></p><p>That means the players have a problem, otherwise it would be the demon Yue Guang that has a problem.</p><p></p><p>Whatever! Tonight, Fang Yu is going to hunt to his heart's content!</p><p></p><p>"Black Tiger Gang! Let go of that little brother! If you have the guts, come at me!!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu shouted loudly, directly confusing the others.</p><p></p><p>Diao Ruru didn't know whether Fang Yu was here to rescue her or to rescue Tiger Brother's subordinate, her brain was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>The others were also dazed, not reacting in time.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Fang Yu went up and launched a shameless sneak attack.</p><p></p><p>Bam bam, two punches, and he killed one person. -5! -7!</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Juan Junzhe], gained 2 experience points.】</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Not a player!</p><p></p><p>The experience points shrank so much! If they're not players, can they just fuck off, I only want to kill players!</p><p></p><p>Now, it's PVP battlefield time!! -7! -6!</p><p></p><p>Boom boom, two punches!</p><p></p><p>The little brother besieging Fang Yu fell again.</p><p></p><p>His health bar was depleted and he died.</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has killed [Pu Yuankai], gained 2 experience points.】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

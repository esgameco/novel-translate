        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Police Station.</p><p></p><p>"Name."</p><p></p><p>"Fang Yu."</p><p></p><p>"Age."</p><p></p><p>"21."</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come in?"</p><p></p><p>"I got into a fight with someone."</p><p></p><p>"Why did you fight?"</p><p></p><p>"He took my spot!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was angry.</p><p></p><p>He had ordered the spot from a scalper a few days ago, wanting to be the first to grab the game helmet for the groundbreaking game "Seek the Demon" released by Blue Sea Group.</p><p></p><p>On the day of the release, the scalper had already secured the spot, but then told him it was gone - someone had bought it at a high price!</p><p></p><p>How could he accept that?? </p><p></p><p>"Just for a game helmet, is it worth it?"</p><p></p><p>"It is! Very much so! I rely on gaming to make a living, if I can't get the game helmet, I'll be screwed!"</p><p></p><p>"Watch your tone."</p><p></p><p>Officer Jing tapped the desk.</p><p></p><p>"Subjectively, you were the one who used force. Objectively, you did strike first. But the other party has forgiven you..."</p><p></p><p>"Forgiven me??" Fang Yu slammed the table and stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Don't get so worked up, he not only forgave you, but also agreed to compensate you with a 'Seek the Demon' game helmet."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu sat back down.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? The game helmet is quite expensive, you know."</p><p></p><p>Officer Jing: ??? I actually prefer your just now defiant attitude, you can go back to that.</p><p></p><p>"So how is it now, are you reconciled?"</p><p></p><p>"Since he's giving me the game helmet... Then I forgive him, and he forgives me, we're all good."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, sign here and you can go."</p><p></p><p>Walking out the police station door, Fang Yu was already holding a square box containing a game helmet worth 10,000 yuan. </p><p></p><p>To think, he had only spent 1,000 yuan to get the scalper to secure the spot.</p><p></p><p>Calculating it all, he had saved a good amount of money.</p><p></p><p>Humming a little tune, Fang Yu rode off on his electric scooter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Not long after Fang Yu left, a young man in a suit came out of the police station.</p><p></p><p>Going to a corner, the suited youth took out a sheepskin parchment from his pocket.</p><p></p><p>Lines of black text appeared on the parchment.</p><p></p><p>[I have successfully bought the game helmet with a lucky gift pack.]</p><p></p><p>[This is the first and crucial step to becoming the future game's arrival in reality, and reality becoming the post-apocalypse, where I can protect myself.]</p><p></p><p>[I must enter the game as soon as possible, sparing no effort to enhance my game character's strength.]</p><p></p><p>[The apocalypse is approaching!]</p><p></p><p>[Time is running out!]</p><p></p><p>"Phew--"</p><p></p><p>The suited youth let out a long breath. </p><p></p><p>He had verified the authenticity of the sheepskin parchment, and it was trustworthy.</p><p></p><p>"The game arriving in reality, the end of the world... Order collapsing, a new king born, why can't I be that king?"</p><p></p><p>Opening the car door, he sat inside, contacting an intermediary to sell his property.</p><p></p><p>Currency will soon be worthless.</p><p></p><p>The game will be the main battlefield of the future! However, he did not notice the lines of bloody text quietly appearing on the sheepskin parchment in his pocket.</p><p></p><p>[Yes, hurry and enter the game.]</p><p></p><p>[The moment you enter the game, your body will belong to me!]</p><p></p><p>[Hahaha... Hahaha hahaha!!]</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Little Yu, you bought so much food today?"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, Little Yu, did you make big money? You're even willing to buy seafood!"</p><p></p><p>When returning to the residential area, Fang Yu ran into two old gentlemen.</p><p></p><p>Carrying several large bags, Fang Yu grinned and shook his finger.</p><p></p><p>"NO~NO~NO~! Uncle Zhou, Uncle Wang, I'm preparing to enter closed-door cultivation mode!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, going to play games again? Last time you lost tens of thousands, and had to work at my son's construction site to make up for the hole."</p><p></p><p>"Hey! Don't slander me! Back then I lacked experience, and the game I chose had issues. This time is different, this game is absolutely hot, absolutely able to make me money! Wait till I make big money, I'll treat you all to a big feast."</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha haha, alright alright."</p><p></p><p>The two old gentlemen didn't pay much mind.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had lived here for three years, from college to graduation, they knew him well.</p><p></p><p>He had ambition, but his actual abilities didn't seem that impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Little Jin asked you to come collect the rent today..."</p><p></p><p>Before Uncle Zhou could finish, Fang Yu had already dashed inside, not knowing if he heard the voice or not.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Zhou shook his head, not bothered.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Next to Old Wang, a series of numbers suddenly appeared on the top of his head.</p><p></p><p>【19 hours 15 minutes 22 seconds.】</p><p></p><p>What is this? Am I seeing things? Zhou Daye rubbed his eyes, but the numbers were still precisely counting down second by second.</p><p></p><p>He instinctively looked up.</p><p></p><p>Only to see above his own head, displaying - 【3 hours 2 minutes 51 seconds.】</p><p></p><p>Zhou Daye abruptly stood up from the chair, his heart racing, with a sense of inexplicable panic.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Qingshui Community was an old apartment building that had been renovated for rental. </p><p></p><p>Since it was next to Wangjiang University, the number of tenants had always been considerable, mostly students and fresh graduates.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had lived there for three years, and the rent had never increased. Unfortunately, his earning ability was limited, and even with part-time jobs, he could only barely afford the rent, sometimes even falling behind by a few months. If it weren't for the understanding landlord and the good neighborhood relations, he would have ended up on the streets long ago.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu lived in Room 1905 of Building 1. As the elevator door opened, he hurried to his room with a large bag.</p><p></p><p>He unlocked the door.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh -</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure rushed into his arms, the fragrant scent making him completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>Looking down,</p><p></p><p>"Jin, Sister Jin?"</p><p></p><p>Sister Jin was the landlord's daughter, responsible for collecting rent in this building. She was around the same age as Fang Yu, but he still addressed her as "Sister Jin".</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Sister Jin's face had tear marks, as if she had been crying.</p><p></p><p>With reddened eyes, she stared at him inexplicably, then suddenly buried her head in his chest.</p><p></p><p>This really startled Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jin... what's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>In good conscience! His relationship with Sister Jin was purely that of a landlord and tenant.</p><p></p><p>Although they occasionally interacted, all conversations were limited to rent-related issues. He couldn't remember when their relationship had become so close. The last time they talked, it was about his overdue rent, and Sister Jin had even threatened to evict him.</p><p></p><p>How did it suddenly turn like this?</p><p></p><p>What is this situation?</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Sister Jin soon calmed down.</p><p></p><p>"...Nothing, I just saw a cockroach in your room and got scared."</p><p></p><p>Sister Jin gently pushed Fang Yu away, wiping her tears and speaking softly.</p><p></p><p>This soothing voice almost made Fang Yu pee his pants.</p><p></p><p>Something's not right! This is extremely not right! Sister Jin was the embodiment of toughness!</p><p></p><p>Even when Fang Yu owed her ten months' rent, she had never spoken to him in such a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she's planning to kill me??</p><p></p><p>Gulp.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu swallowed his saliva.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Jin, about the rent..."</p><p></p><p>"No rush! You can stay as long as you want!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Sister Jin was saying this, she noticed the game helmet packaging in Fang Yu's hand and her expression changed.</p><p></p><p>"You're still going to play the game?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? Uh... This is the game helmet I just bought today. It's very popular, and I'm sure I can make a lot of money in it! Once I make the money, I'll pay the rent on time every month!" Fang Yu promised while patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>But Sister Jin seemed to have a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"Going in is also... also good..."</p><p></p><p>She paused, then said, "You go ahead, I'll come find you later."</p><p></p><p>Come find me later? </p><p></p><p>What for?</p><p></p><p>I still can't pay the rent right now!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu outwardly agreed, but as soon as Sister Jin left, he immediately locked the door!</p><p></p><p>He could delay it for as long as possible, maybe tonight when the game server opened, he could earn the rent money! Fang Yu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside the hallway, Sister Jin walked faster and faster, unconsciously biting her fingers.</p><p></p><p>This had become a habit of hers after the apocalypse descended.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back... back to five years ago, when the game had just launched before the apocalypse!"</p><p></p><p>"How could this be? Is it related to the spring-winter cicada that Fang Yu gave me?"</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, since I'm back, I must change the tragic events that happened!"</p><p></p><p>"One year later, the game will descend upon reality and usher in the apocalypse era!"</p><p></p><p>"Fang Yu, this time, I won't let you die in front of me!"</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely save you! Absolutely!"</p><p></p><p>Five years had faded many memories.</p><p></p><p>But the major events, she remembered them clearly!</p><p></p><p>"Enter the game, seize the opportunity, and then protect Fang Yu, protect the people around me!"</p><p></p><p>"In the past, I couldn't enter the game in time."</p><p></p><p>"This time, I will take a different path!"</p><p></p><p>... </p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

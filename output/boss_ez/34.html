        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【Destruction Progress: 0/6.】</p><p></p><p>【Original Sin: 0/5.】 </p><p></p><p>【Wen Kehan: 0/8.】</p><p></p><p>+6.</p><p></p><p>+5. </p><p></p><p>+8.</p><p></p><p>【Yue Guang: 588/588.】</p><p></p><p>It's just as expected...</p><p></p><p>A chill rose in Fang Yu's heart.</p><p></p><p>This monster is different! It hunts players and can actually seize the maximum health of players and make it its own! An evolving monster?? </p><p></p><p>A player-hunting boss?</p><p></p><p>The more Fang Yu pondered, the more uneasy he felt.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he felt like someone was watching him.</p><p></p><p>He looked up and his eyes met Yue Guang's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes locked.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang's mouth slowly curled into a slight arc, hinting at something.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>He turned and fled, disappearing into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>But the gaze behind him felt like a malignant growth, firmly locked onto him.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he was far away from the vegetable market that the feeling dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu panted heavily.</p><p></p><p>He felt something was off - Yue Guang's gaze was like a hunter locking onto its prey! Could it be... that he can detect who the players are? A monster that specifically hunts players, even in the early stages of the game? This is no joke.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Fang Yu felt a sense of panic.</p><p></p><p>He looked back a few more times to make sure no one was following, then hurried away.</p><p></p><p>Tian Yuan Town was vast, with four or five large vegetable markets and numerous small roadside stalls.</p><p></p><p>The roadside goods, while lacking guarantees, were cheaper and allowed for bargaining. </p><p>Occasionally, one could even find some wild goods or even lucky finds.</p><p></p><p>However, this time Fang Yu's shopping trip only yielded the usual meat and vegetables.</p><p></p><p>His mind was still preoccupied with the beheading incident at the vegetable market.</p><p></p><p>Yue Guang loomed over him like a large boulder, giving him a sense of inexplicable urgency.</p><p></p><p>"Does Yue Guang's health have an upper limit?"</p><p>"His health is only around 500 now, but if I leave him be, how terrifying will it be next time we meet?"</p><p>"Of course, I don't have the ability to do anything about it. It's just that guy seems to know of my existence..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suddenly broke out of his thoughts and stopped walking.</p><p></p><p>As if sensing something.</p><p></p><p>He quickly turned around to look behind him.</p><p></p><p>The street was not crowded, as it was near the impoverished Tianhua Alley.</p><p></p><p>Most of the passersby on the street had poor constitutions.</p><p></p><p>【Zhan Yiliu: 6/6.】</p><p>【Bu Jingshan: 25/25.】</p><p>【Sun Fenghua: 7/7.】</p><p>【Bao Qiuchun: 6/6.】</p><p>【Ban Yue'kang: 8/8.】</p><p>【Lai Wenhan: 7/7.】</p><p>【Zhi Wenshan: 31/31.】</p><p>【...】</p><p></p><p>Among these single-digit health passersby, two people's health bars stood out.</p><p></p><p>One was a man named Zhi Wenshan, lingering in front of a stall selling writing brushes, ink, and paper, his gaze occasionally glancing in Fang Yu's direction.</p><p></p><p>The other was a woman named Bu Jingshan, feeling the fabric at a dress stall, hidden among the crowd of shoppers, more discreet.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pretended not to notice them.</p><p></p><p>He turned and continued towards Tianhua Alley.</p><p></p><p>Carrying his bags, he quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu started moving, the two behind him immediately left their stalls and followed, keeping their distance.</p><p></p><p>Their tracking skills were not particularly advanced, but they were more than enough to handle an ordinary person like Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that their health bars in the high twenties and thirties gave them away.</p><p></p><p>At first, the two sides were walking and stopping intermittently, maintaining their distance. Gradually, Zhi Wenshan and Bu Jingshan's distance from Fang Yu began to close.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The disconnection was still within sight.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as if the timing was right, Fang Yu seized the opportunity and suddenly changed direction.</p><p></p><p>He quickly walked from the main road towards the nearby alley.</p><p></p><p>In just a few seconds, his figure was barely visible.</p><p></p><p>The one closest to Fang Yu was Bu Jingshan.</p><p></p><p>She panicked, and without waiting for her companions to catch up, she hurriedly chased after him.</p><p></p><p>The unregulated impoverished area was characterized by chaotic buildings and winding roads.</p><p></p><p>Main roads connected to small roads, small roads connected to alleys, and alleys led back to main roads.</p><p></p><p>While it was a complex network, only the locals in this area could navigate it clearly.</p><p></p><p>If Fang Yu's figure was lost from sight, finding him again would be very difficult.</p><p></p><p>Anxious, Bu Jingshan quickened her pace, keeping a close eye on Fang Yu's back.</p><p></p><p>Unaware if the target was intentionally or unintentionally leading her on, after following him through several turns, Bu Jingshan was completely disoriented, not knowing her own location, only able to see the target's figure in the distance.</p><p></p><p>At least the mission had not failed yet.</p><p></p><p>Just as she thought this, the target suddenly accelerated, turning into a narrow alley and disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Bu Jingshan's heart raced as she ran towards the alley, reaching the corner...</p><p></p><p>A dark shadow suddenly struck towards her face! It came so fast and suddenly, perfectly timed to catch her in the blind spot of the turn, leaving her no time to react.</p><p></p><p>She only felt a gust of fierce punches coming at her...</p><p></p><p>In the next moment.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying, monstrous force directly exploded in her face.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>Her right eye instantly lost vision, her nose bridge was crooked, and her facial bones were sunken. Excruciating pain shot through her nerves to her brain. -17!! The impact of the monstrous force lifted her body, her toes leaving the ground as she was thrown backwards.</p><p></p><p>Her back slammed against the wall! -1!</p><p></p><p>Falling from the wall, she half-knelt on the ground, her right eye blinded, the remaining left eye's vision blurred, everything within half a meter pitch black.</p><p></p><p>The blood from her nose and mouth sprayed onto the ground, but it did not hinder her from drawing her sword and slashing around like a madwoman.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh!! Come on!!!"</p><p></p><p>The sword flashed heavily, but did not strike anyone.</p><p></p><p>Yet she dared not stop, only swinging her sword! Swinging it! Swinging it again! Preventing anyone from getting close!</p><p></p><p>As if slowing down for even a second would mean instant death.</p><p></p><p>The fear of death made her unable to stop her movements.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet environment, aside from the sound of her sword swinging, there was only the sound of her heavy panting.</p><p></p><p>No! Wait!</p><p></p><p>There was another sound! This sound was... chewing?</p><p></p><p>Someone was eating something! Right in front of me, nearby! Outside my limited field of vision!</p><p></p><p>With her right eye blinded and her injured left eye's vision restricted, her hearing was still so keen! In... that direction!!</p><p></p><p>Bu Jingshan suddenly thrust her sword! Charging forward!</p><p></p><p>"Die!!"</p><p></p><p>Bu Jingshan shouted fiercely, but only stabbed the air.</p><p></p><p>Realizing the enemy had evaded her, Bu Jingshan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment...</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The familiar monstrous force struck her forehead again. -4!</p><p></p><p>But this time, the power was not as terrifying, only knocking her to the ground.</p><p></p><p>As if the enemy was holding back.</p><p></p><p>The strong will to survive made Bu Jingshan immediately understand this.</p><p></p><p>"Circling me..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! The enemy's next punch had already landed on her face. -4!</p><p></p><p>[Bu Jingshan: 0/25.]</p><p></p><p>Her health bar depleted, Bu Jingshan became a corpse.</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Congratulations, player, for killing [Bu Jingshan], you have gained 10 experience points.]</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu tightened his bloodied fist, panting heavily.</p><p></p><p>Looking around to confirm no one was there, he quickly left the area.</p><p></p><p>Ten minutes later, Zhen Wenshan found his companion in the maze-like alleys, but only discovered Bu Jingshan's face mutilated with blood.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Woke up.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

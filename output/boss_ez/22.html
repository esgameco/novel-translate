        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people queuing behind couldn't see the details.</p><p></p><p>They only saw that Fang Yu gave something, and then Shi Mei went in.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, she came out again, and this time she brought Fang Yu with her into the martial arts hall.</p><p></p><p>The long queue immediately erupted in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! Why? Why can he go in for the assessment directly?"</p><p></p><p>"Cutting in line! This is a serious case of cutting in line! The Yuanti Martial Arts Hall is unfair!!"</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Who is that guy?"</p><p></p><p>"Cheating! Where's the GM, someone is cheating!!"</p><p></p><p>"You're a player too?! Damn it, buddy! Let's team up and go into the martial arts hall together!"</p><p></p><p>"Take me with you, take me with you."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, there are so many players in the queue inside the martial arts hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course! Who would still be a blacksmith or weaver after playing the game? Everyone is training martial arts to get stronger. This is the trend!"</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of noobs, didn't you hear the game introduction? You're supposed to hide your identity! I need to draw a line between you and me, the newbies!"</p><p></p><p>"Why do we need to hide our identities? Is there a reason?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but you just have to hide it! Hide it, hide it!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Qianxuan's recommendation letter turned out to be more useful than Fang Yu had expected.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, he found that it was quite large.</p><p></p><p>From the archery dummies to the training wooden posts, the venue was spacious and well-organized, with a full range of equipment.</p><p></p><p>Some people were practicing against each other, their fists colliding fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Others were striking the wooden posts, their techniques flowing smoothly, inspiring admiration.</p><p></p><p>Following Shi Mei, Fang Yu finally arrived at a grand hall and saw the head of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall, Yuan Hongxin.</p><p></p><p>He was a middle-aged man in his forties, wearing a gray cloth robe with the character "Yuan" embroidered in the center.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair like the head of the household, he slowly sipped his tea and glanced at the contents of the letter.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, the person is here."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Shi Mei was about to leave, but Yuan Hongxin called her back.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Mei, we're not accepting any new disciples today. Go and disperse the people at the entrance."</p><p></p><p>Shi Mei was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>It had just started, and they were already not accepting new disciples? Shi Mei glanced at Fang Yu, feeling that the matter was likely related to him.</p><p></p><p>Obeying the order, she left.</p><p></p><p>The hall was left with only Yuan Hongxin and Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu took a look at Yuan Hongxin's health bar.</p><p></p><p>【Yuan Hongxin: 350/350】</p><p></p><p>Such a high health value! Even stronger than Li Qianxuan!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly adopted a humble posture.</p><p></p><p>"I've read the letter, and since you are a person recommended by the Li family, I will accept you."</p><p></p><p>"The rules remain the same: a tuition fee of 10 taels, and a monthly basic living expense of 2 taels afterward."</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts hall will provide a secret medicinal soup every month."</p><p></p><p>"If you want more, you'll need to pay extra."</p><p></p><p>"As for learning martial arts, the first manual is free, and each subsequent one costs 5 taels of silver."</p><p></p><p>"Any questions?"</p><p></p><p>Yes, this is really heartless! Fang Yu had thought he was quite wealthy, but coming to the martial arts hall had already peeled off a layer of his skin.</p><p></p><p>But on the surface, he immediately performed the master-disciple ritual.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Diao Deyi is willing to enter the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall."</p><p></p><p>Paying the money, offering tea, the ceremony was complete.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had officially become a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin tossed a booklet to Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, this is the 'Yuanti Fundamental Technique,' the core martial art of our Yuanti Martial Arts Hall. It's the free martial arts manual included in the tuition fee. Study it first, and come talk to me when you've made progress."</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Yuan Hongxin didn't have high hopes for Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Starting martial arts at the age of 16 was too late.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Fang Yu took the 'Yuanti Fundamental Technique' and seemed to have trouble understanding it even after half a day.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shi Mei came in with the secret medicinal soup.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Mei, you stay and teach him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin gave the order and left, truly acting like a hands-off boss.</p><p></p><p>However, Shi Mei...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You're quite patient."</p><p></p><p>"Where don't you understand?" Fang Yu pointed to the "Primordial Body Cultivation Technique".</p><p></p><p>"I can't feel the qi it's talking about." Fang Yu flipped through the "Primordial Body Cultivation Technique".</p><p></p><p>Unlike other games where he could just flip through or learn a skill book with a single tap, this was different.</p><p></p><p>So he could only look at it word by word.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the "Primordial Body Cultivation Technique" combined text and images, with abundant visual information and little text, so it was quick to read.</p><p></p><p>The most important step was to absorb the qi around him and refine his body.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't sense it.</p><p></p><p>"It's because your aptitude is too poor," Shi Chuangmei said bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"Then what do I do?"</p><p></p><p>"Drink the medicinal soup."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't hesitate and gulped it down.</p><p></p><p>The secret medicinal soup tasted strange, like rotten mashed potatoes.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as it went down, he immediately felt a warm sensation in his body.</p><p></p><p>[System Prompt: Player has consumed [Primordial Family Soup], Experience +10.]</p><p></p><p>Wow! Such a good thing? This is great!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's eyes lit up instantly. Previously, he only got 300 experience points for killing a demon, but this thing gave him 10 points just for drinking it? Drinking thirty cups would be equivalent to killing a demon? Sensing Fang Yu's distraction, Shi Chuangmei spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Close your eyes, sense, and guide the qi."</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei seemed to have done this before, the information was concise and direct.</p><p></p><p>"The medicinal effect of the soup is short-lived, it evaporates quickly. If you don't seize that time, the medicine will be wasted."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu quickly calmed his mood, closed his eyes, and tried to sense the qi.</p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged on the ground, held his breath for a while, then opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I still can't feel the qi."</p><p></p><p>"Then keep drinking the soup."</p><p></p><p>"Isn't it one bowl per month?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei rarely smiled, but the shallow smile looked quite nice.</p><p></p><p>"The master didn't say he wouldn't refill your cup."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu perked up.</p><p></p><p>"That's great, then bring me another bowl... no, a hundred bowls!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Chuangmei spread out her hands.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu paused.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Pay up."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ??? A black question mark appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Refills cost money?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes. The second bowl is 1 tael, the third is 2 taels, the fourth is 4 taels, and so on. The record resets to zero at the start of the next month."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>Are you racking up sales performance here? Fang Yu felt a little reluctant as he touched the 5 taels of silver in his pocket.</p><p></p><p>After all, the players on the forum were willing to risk their brains for just ten coppers when becoming someone's disciple.</p><p></p><p>The 10 taels of silver he had were like a few drops in the bucket if he went to sell them in the city.</p><p></p><p>Spending it on this... wouldn't it be a waste?</p><p></p><p>The main thing was, he was afraid that if he went all in, he could only drink two bowls of soup at most.</p><p></p><p>If he finished drinking and still couldn't enter the door, he'd have to wait for the free soup next month, wouldn't that be a waste of effort and money?</p><p></p><p>But after thinking it over, he felt he couldn't bear to part with it.</p><p></p><p>A real man, no more hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Others fear my greed, others fear my all-in!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, drinking the soup can also increase experience points, isn't that much easier than working hard outside to earn experience points? Not a loss!</p><p></p><p>Slap! Fang Yu slapped 3 taels on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Two bowls! Let's do it together!"</p><p></p><p>Last night's state wasn't good, so I made up for it today with an update.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

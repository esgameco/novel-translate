        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Recalling the previous scene where Fang Yu did not hesitate to self-harm in order to save her, the Second Sister suddenly felt a sense of guilt.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that I was really mistaken??</p><p></p><p>"You... are you really Diao Deyi?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, the real one!"</p><p></p><p>"... I, I believe you half! Two days later, I'll go to the Yudi Underworld with you, and if the Yudi Underworld determines that you are not a demon, then... then..."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister blushed and said in a low voice, "Then I'll apologize to you! At that time, you can make an unconditional request from me as an apology gift."</p><p></p><p>All the money Diao Ruru had was given to her by Fang Yu, and she was penniless herself.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to apologize, the best she could come up with was just an empty promise.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a deal!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm sure I can prove my identity. But before that, Second Sister, can you tell me about our past?"</p><p></p><p>"I only remember you and the Big Brother now, I don't remember anything else. I even forgot the Big Brother's name, this unfamiliarity really scares me..."</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister hurriedly said, "Don't be afraid, I remember! I'll tell you everything... wait!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Second Sister seemed to have remembered something, and quickly ran back into the room.</p><p></p><p>When she came out again, she had a letter in her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Here, take it." She blushed, as if she was ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"You'll know after you read it... I'll compensate you! I now believe that you are Diao Deyi. I'll tell you about our childhood, and help you regain your memories!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu took the letter and read it.</p><p></p><p>It said:</p><p></p><p>"Diao Ruru, the following words, I need you to think about them yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever thought about why Diao Deyi has become so powerful, able to kill more than ten of our Black Tiger Gang?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever thought about whether the legend of Diao Deyi being able to survive beheading is true."</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever thought about Diao Deyi's abnormal behavior, which is completely different from his usual self?"</p><p></p><p>"I think you already have the answer in your heart."</p><p></p><p>"Your brother Diao Deyi is already dead!"</p><p></p><p>"The Diao Deyi now is just a demon!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't expose it, don't panic."</p><p></p><p>"I used more than a dozen lives to force him to reveal his power, just to let you see his true face."</p><p></p><p>"Now, listen to me."</p><p></p><p>"Pretend to know nothing, and then regularly report Diao Deyi's whereabouts, behavior, and everything to our Black Tiger Gang."</p><p></p><p>"When the time is right, I will let you personally kill this demon, to avenge your brother."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, don't report this to the Yudi Underworld, there's a mole!"</p><p></p><p>At the end, there was a title and a name.</p><p></p><p>Black Tiger Gang Leader - Yuwen Ji.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ??? The Black Tiger Gang? Isn't that Tiger Bro's gang?</p><p></p><p>He's crazily causing trouble himself, and now he suspects I'm a demon? What's going on?</p><p></p><p>Wait a minute! Could it be...</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly flashed through Fang Yu's mind.</p><p></p><p>It is known that Yue Guang's Demon Alliance is aware of my existence and considers me an iron brother.</p><p></p><p>And the Black Tiger Gang, in trying to probe me and confirm that I am a demon, chose not to report to the Yudi Underworld, but instead to have the person closest to me act as a mole and report on my movements.</p><p></p><p>In other words, their target is not actually me.</p><p></p><p>But the person I am about to contact.</p><p></p><p>Wow! Fang Yu slapped his thigh.</p><p></p><p>I figured it out!</p><p></p><p>The Black Tiger Gang has information about demons! That's the only way this letter makes sense!</p><p></p><p>The Black Tiger Gang wants to use me to catch a big fish!</p><p></p><p>"Second Sister, this letter is..."</p><p></p><p>"After you were taken away by the Yudi Underworld, someone suddenly threw it in through the window and said only one sentence, 'Burn it after reading.'"</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister told him without any concealment.</p><p></p><p>Needless to say, she has joined in believing the content of the letter, and has determined that I am a demon.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, this letter would not have ended up in my hands.</p><p></p><p>But unfortunately, the Second Sister has been persuaded and converted by me, and instead revealed the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Black Tiger Gang!</p><p></p><p>It's hidden so deep! Fang Yu originally thought the Black Tiger Gang was a small, insignificant gang, but now it seems it's not that simple. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Fang Yu was lost in thought until he looked at his obedient Second Sister waiting by his side, then he reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go inside and talk."</p><p></p><p>He casually blocked the door so it wouldn't be wide open, and Fang Yu went inside with his Second Sister.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of the disappearance of the eldest brother.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he almost thought he had permanently lost his younger brother.</p><p></p><p>That night, the Second Sister said a lot.</p><p></p><p>While talking, she also took a needle and thread, helping Fang Yu sew his head back onto his neck, stitch by stitch.</p><p></p><p>Although it looked a bit strange, at least he no longer had to rely on cloth strips to hold it in place.</p><p></p><p>He tried moving around a bit.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't tell if it was just his imagination, but Fang Yu vaguely felt the severed neck was slowly reconnecting with his head.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu didn't know the reason, but if he had to say what was different, it was that the cloth strips had been replaced by needle and thread.</p><p></p><p>And then there was... the addition of a demonic bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt that the demonic bloodline must be playing a role.</p><p></p><p>Putting down the needle and thread, the Second Sister continued to tell stories about their childhood.</p><p></p><p>She talked until dawn before finally stopping.</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister yawned and smiled at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to hear more, I can talk for three days and three nights."</p><p></p><p>"I want to hear it! I want to know everything about our family!"</p><p></p><p>"You're so sweet-talking!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Sister's face was smiling as she greeted him and went to sleep first.</p><p></p><p>After pulling an all-nighter, she couldn't hold out any longer.</p><p></p><p>And that night, Fang Yu gained something that probably 99% of players in the entire game didn't have.</p><p></p><p>That is... the character's memories.</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>After an intensive overnight review, Fang Yu had filled in this gap!</p><p></p><p>Now, who dares to say that Diao De Yi is bad? Diao De Yi is the best! The true identity can be proven! With memories complete, who can defeat Diao De Yi!</p><p></p><p>Whoever fights Diao De Yi is the bad one, and they'll be knocked out with one shot when the headphones come off!</p><p></p><p>After an all-nighter, Fang Yu still felt energetic and not too fatigued.</p><p></p><p>As expected of a martial arts practitioner, his physique is excellent.</p><p></p><p>He first went outside to find someone to fix the door, then Fang Yu went out, ready to report to the martial arts school.</p><p></p><p>The day's plan starts in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Train martial arts, gain experience, kill and absorb life values... oh right, there's also selling family property to make money! The first pot of gold is right in front of him!</p><p></p><p>But just as he walked out the door, he suddenly went back in.</p><p></p><p>"No, I haven't had breakfast yet!"</p><p></p><p>A person is made of iron, food is made of steel, going hungry is a big problem. </p><p></p><p>Not being diligent about eating, there's something wrong with his brain! In the game he really didn't have any feelings, but in reality, he hadn't eaten anything for a whole night.</p><p></p><p>Three meals a day must be guaranteed, the body is the real capital!</p><p></p><p>He went back to the room and lay down.</p><p></p><p>"Log out."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Black Tiger Gang's headquarters.</p><p></p><p>Wuwen Ji, who had just climbed off the mother tiger, quietly put on his clothes and went out the door.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he opened the door, the strategist Wu was already waiting outside.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the letter has been sent out."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"Master, I don't understand. We sent Yang Tiger over to stir up trouble, and with his love for women, he must have angered Diao Ruru. In this situation, how could she still be willing to cooperate with us?"</p><p></p><p>Wuwen Ji closed the door, then gave Wu a sidelong glance.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think a woman's resentment over losing her virginity is greater, or her hatred over her brother's death?"</p><p></p><p>Wu thought for a moment and said, "Both hatreds are deeply rooted."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, both hatreds are deeply rooted. But she has no power, the only revenge she can take is for her brother's death. To avenge and kill that demon, she must rely on our strength. Do you understand now? She has nowhere else to go."</p><p></p><p>Wu suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"Master, brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant? I'm not brilliant, the demon is brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

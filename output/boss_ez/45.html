        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night was already deep.</p><p></p><p>On the street, it was pitch black.</p><p></p><p>Only one house still had the candlelight shining.</p><p></p><p>As the night wind blew, the flickering light cast a long shadow of a woman.</p><p></p><p>She sat at the table, sometimes worrying anxiously, sometimes wiping away tears and weeping.</p><p></p><p>The night was long, and she kept waiting.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, footsteps were heard outside.</p><p></p><p>In the quiet street, they were so clear.</p><p></p><p>Thud—</p><p></p><p>Thud—</p><p></p><p>Thud—</p><p></p><p>The footsteps, from far to near, finally appeared at the doorstep.</p><p></p><p>The woman abruptly stood up, her emotions in turmoil and excitement, rushing over and throwing herself into that person's embrace.</p><p></p><p>"Diao De-yi! Thank goodness! You're alright!"</p><p></p><p>"How could I not be alright? I have people looking out for me up there!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu laughed heartily, patting his elder sister's back.</p><p></p><p>Being cared for so intensely, Fang Yu felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows how the Yudi Bureau will handle this, you did kill someone, after all!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the previous incident, the elder sister's face still turned pale.</p><p></p><p>Although the body at home had been taken away by the Yudi Bureau, </p><p></p><p>there was still a large amount of dark red, viscous blood left on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The bloody smell in the air also lingered, not dissipating for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Their house only had one window, and it faced another person's wall.</p><p></p><p>Only at a very specific time in the early morning could a bit of sunlight filter in through the height difference of the buildings.</p><p></p><p>So the ventilation in the house was very poor, and unless something unexpected happened, this bloody smell would not go away for three to five days.</p><p></p><p>There was also the broken wooden door at the entrance, the smashed rice jar... even the new clothes they had bought were trampled on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The house was in a mess, making the elder sister quite distressed.</p><p></p><p>Although they had cleaned it up simply, without seeing Fang Yu, she couldn't even sleep, let alone properly tidy up the house.</p><p></p><p>Now that Diao De-yi had returned, she could finally organize things properly.</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're back. Diao De-yi, first go and fix the wooden door, block it up. Then I'll go sweep the floor, and you can clean up the coagulated blood on the ground... We'll tidy up the house together."</p><p></p><p>Diao De-yi was fine, so the elder sister started giving orders.</p><p></p><p>But Fang Yu quickly stopped her.</p><p></p><p>"Elder sister, let's stay at an inn tonight. Tomorrow, we'll find another house to live in. We have money now, we don't need to live here anymore."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Fang Yu finished speaking, the elder sister slapped her hand away, her eyes wide open in a shocked expression, as if she couldn't believe what she had heard.</p><p></p><p>Even that expression was a thousand times more shocked than when she had seen Fang Yu kill someone before.</p><p></p><p>"You, you said what? You want to move out?" The elder sister's voice was trembling.</p><p></p><p>"It's us, we'll move out together."</p><p></p><p>This time, the elder sister heard it clearly.</p><p></p><p>She stared blankly at Fang Yu, feeling her thoughts in a mess. She closed her eyes, pondering for a while, before finally opening them and looking directly at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>Her lips moved.</p><p></p><p>The elder sister asked a question that Fang Yu didn't expect.</p><p></p><p>"You... who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"I'm Diao De-yi."</p><p></p><p>"Diao De-yi would never say such things, Diao De-yi would die in this house!" The elder sister's voice suddenly rose, sharp and piercing! Tears welled up in her eyes as she stepped back.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's heart sank, vaguely sensing that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"I only suspected it at first..."</p><p></p><p>"You have too many abnormalities. After you returned from the Yudi Bureau the first time, I felt that your aura was completely different."</p><p></p><p>"But I didn't dare to say it, I was afraid that the truth would be too much for me to bear..."</p><p></p><p>"But why... why did you say that sentence!"</p><p></p><p>"The original Diao De-yi..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He will never leave this house, this house is everything to Diao Deyi! Why are you using his body to say such things! You... demon!!"</p><p></p><p>The second sister cried out and shouted hoarsely. </p><p></p><p>She had still harbored a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>But now, that hope was completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>Because her brother absolutely would not say the words about moving out of this home. That was like denying Diao Deyi's entire life! "Demon, demon? Second sister, you must be mistaken. If we don't move, we'll just stay here."</p><p></p><p>"Don't pretend, I can't keep pretending either. Big brother is missing, his life or death is uncertain. You've turned into a demon..."</p><p></p><p>The second sister's tears fell like pearls, endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"How did it come to this, how did this home become this way...I don't want to live anymore, just kill me, demon."</p><p></p><p>"Second sister, why would I kill you? I really am Diao Deyi!"</p><p></p><p>The second sister bitterly laughed.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, if you really are Diao Deyi, then tell me, what did we do at the door six years ago?"</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Because he didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, Fang Yu admitted.</p><p></p><p>"I don't remember."</p><p></p><p>"Don't remember? What a thing to say 'don't remember'...Six years ago, big brother was caught stealing cakes and beaten so badly he was bedridden and couldn't recover. We two were starving and dying at the door. In the end, it was heavenly grace, drinking rainwater, that allowed us to endure. At that time, you swore an oath to the heavens that you would definitely make a lot of money in the future, and never let us starve again."</p><p></p><p>"And do you know why Diao Deyi was determined to stay in this home? Because our parents died because of this house, staying in this house to protect our parents' final legacy, this was the deadly oath we three swore at our parents' grave."</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi said, unless he died, he would never leave this home, even if he had the chance to get married and have children in the future, he would definitely never leave this home!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the past, the second sister's tears flowed unceasingly. </p><p></p><p>Memories are the carrier of a person.</p><p></p><p>Without memories, a person is just a walking corpse.</p><p></p><p>"You don't remember, but I remember very clearly. But you shouldn't have forgotten! The terrifying experience of nearly starving to death in this home. The memory of the deadly oath we swore at the grave...These things could never be forgotten in a lifetime. You say you don't remember, then there can only be one explanation."</p><p></p><p>"That is, you are a demon! So you don't know anything about Diao Deyi, don't know anything about me..."</p><p></p><p>"How could I be so stupid, to believe you are Diao Deyi, I should have said it earlier, should have been killed by you already."</p><p></p><p>"They're all dead, I don't want to live either, just kill me."</p><p></p><p>The second sister opened her arms and closed her eyes, waiting to die.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Kill you, what the hell?</p><p></p><p>Randomly killing you, what's the point?</p><p></p><p>If I killed you, your measly 4 points of maximum health wouldn't even be enough to fill my teeth!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's brain raced, and finally he said.</p><p></p><p>"Second sister, I really don't remember. Have you forgotten what I told you, that my head was cut by a demon and I received a demon's curse?"</p><p></p><p>"Ever since my head split, I've forgotten everything from the past, but I still remember my family! Remember you!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm really not a demon, have you ever seen a demon that could enter the Fool's Underworld and come out alive?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen a demon that would kill other demons?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you ever seen a demon that would fight desperately for a human? I risked my life to save you, and you still don't believe me."</p><p></p><p>These words made the second sister waver.</p><p></p><p>She opened her eyes, her expression hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Also, second sister, if you don't believe me, Lord Qian Xuan said that in two days, someone from the Fool's Underworld will come to lift the demon's curse on me."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, let them prove that I really am Diao Deyi!"</p><p></p><p>My identity is rock solid! I'm the best! I can prove it!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

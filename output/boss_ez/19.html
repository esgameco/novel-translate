        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The standard wooden house, but it had fallen into disrepair over the years.</p><p></p><p>The night wind blew, causing the wooden door and windows to creak and groan.</p><p></p><p>The groom had already driven the horses away, and Fang Yu, who was standing at the doorway of the house, felt his mood inexplicably becoming a bit tense.</p><p></p><p>According to the character introduction, his elder brother had gone missing, and there was only his younger sister left at home.</p><p></p><p>He didn't quite know how to face this younger sister.</p><p></p><p>Logically, she was a family member, but she was completely unfamiliar, and he had no memories of her.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Fang Yu calmed himself and pushed the door open.</p><p></p><p>Creak.</p><p></p><p>The wooden door opened, and the inside was pitch-black, not even seeing any health bars displayed.</p><p></p><p>Was there no one inside?</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>As he closed the door behind him, a health bar suddenly appeared on the back of the door.</p><p></p><p>Someone was hiding behind the door?!</p><p></p><p>Before Fang Yu could see what the name on the health bar was, the dark figure suddenly let out a shrill scream and swung something towards his 'head'.</p><p></p><p>Boom!!</p><p></p><p>The object struck the back of his 'head', breaking into two pieces as it fell to the ground. But since Fang Yu's head was hanging from his waist, it only hit the wound on his neck. -0.2!</p><p></p><p>"Ouch!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's cry of pain and the damage number appeared almost simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>[Diao Deyi: 11.3/17.]</p><p></p><p>"Xiao One?!" </p><p></p><p>The attacker covered her mouth in surprise, seemingly recognizing the intruder's voice.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu rubbed the bowl-sized scar on his neck, feeling a little bit of blood seeping out.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! Who is it?!"</p><p></p><p>He looked up.</p><p></p><p>[Diao Ruru: 4/4.]</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>Surnamed Diao?</p><p></p><p>"Sis, sister?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu asked uncertainly.</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The dark figure seemed to stiffen.</p><p></p><p>Pitter-patter.</p><p></p><p>With the health bar above her, the dark figure quickly ran to the table, feeling around on the floor, then stood up again.</p><p></p><p>Scratch, scratch, two sounds, and she lit a small candle the size of a thumb.</p><p></p><p>With the room illuminated, Fang Yu could see the woman's appearance.</p><p></p><p>She was a very thin girl, almost sickly, with sunken cheeks. Her face had hardly any flesh on it.</p><p></p><p>But upon closer inspection, it was simply that she was so thin that her features were not properly supported, making her appear deformed and ugly.</p><p></p><p>In reality, her facial features were not bad, even above average.</p><p></p><p>Although the sister was skin and bones, with a somewhat sickly appearance, the concern and excitement in her eyes was unmistakable.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao One? Is it really you? Thank goodness! You're alright!"</p><p></p><p>"This morning when Wang Er and the others took you away, I was so worried. </p><p></p><p>"I waited all day, and when night fell and you still hadn't come back, I couldn't stay awake any longer. In my dreams, I kept seeing nightmares of you helping the casino do evil deeds and getting your head chopped off."</p><p></p><p>"I thought... I thought... you were like big brother..." </p><p></p><p>The sister wiped away her tears as she excitedly approached Fang Yu with the candle.</p><p></p><p>The candlelight illuminated Fang Yu, and he quickly took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" the sister paused, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing, nothing." </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's sister's words had reminded him of something. He acted as if he had placed something on his own head, then pressed down on his 'head' with both hands as he stepped into the candlelight.</p><p></p><p>"I'm back now, I went to work with Wang Er today and encountered the Foolish Underworld..."</p><p></p><p>Before Fang Yu could finish, the sister had thrown herself into his embrace.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu could feel the sister's body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anymore..."</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you're back..."</p><p></p><p>"Big brother has been missing for several days, he's probably already..."</p><p></p><p>"From now on, it's just the two of us siblings left to rely on each other."</p><p></p><p>This intense emotion left Fang Yu somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was an only child, without the care of siblings.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, reflecting on it, the feeling... wasn't too bad.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu extended his hands to gently pat his second sister's back.</p><p></p><p>After just a couple pats, he suddenly heard his second sister call out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, you weren't hurt, were you? That piece of wood earlier..."</p><p></p><p>Wood? </p><p></p><p>What wood? Fang Yu was puzzled, when a cold little hand lightly touched his cheek.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's vision suddenly spun downwards - his unanchored head had been pushed down by his second sister! Thud.</p><p></p><p>A dull sound reverberated in the candlelit room, and also in his second sister's heart.</p><p></p><p>His second sister's body suddenly stiffened as if shocked.</p><p></p><p>Her pupils dilated uncontrollably, her breathing became rapid, her chest heaving.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, her mind went blank.</p><p></p><p>Her world seemed to have collapsed.</p><p></p><p>She could hardly believe what was before her eyes, and refused to accept the reality.</p><p></p><p>"Little One's head... fell off..."</p><p></p><p>"No... it's a dream... a nightmare!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm still dreaming, I haven't woken up... I haven't woken up!!"</p><p></p><p>His second sister's body trembled, her legs powerless, she collapsed onto the floor in a split-legged position, just facing the head on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Under her gaze... the fallen head blinked at her and opened and closed its mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Second sister, wait! I can explain..."</p><p></p><p>His second sister could no longer hear the voice.</p><p></p><p>She was overwhelmed by an indescribable terror, her whole body bristling.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Ahhh!!! Ahhhhh!!!"</p><p></p><p>Amid the screams, his second sister's eyes rolled back and she fainted, collapsing to the floor.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: "...Heavens! I didn't mean to do it!"...</p><p></p><p>The next morning, the morning sun peeked through the gaps between the houses in Sweet Flower Alley, shining into Fang Yu's home at the bedside.</p><p></p><p>His second sister slowly awoke, her body still feeling fatigued and heavy.</p><p></p><p>As her consciousness cleared, she recalled the dream from yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Her younger brother Jiao De One had returned home, but his head had fallen off.</p><p></p><p>"What a terrible dream..."</p><p></p><p>"At least it was just a dream."</p><p></p><p>His second sister pushed herself up, walking out of her small room, and immediately saw Jiao De One adding firewood to the pit.</p><p></p><p>"Little One?!"</p><p></p><p>His second sister paused in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"When did you get back?"</p><p></p><p>She stared intently at Jiao De One.</p><p></p><p>The usually unconcerned Jiao De One today had a black cloth wrapped around his neck.</p><p></p><p>It looked a bit like the white band worn by women, but it seemed out of place.</p><p></p><p>"..." His second sister's body trembled as she tightly closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had realized it was not... a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Second sister, you're awake? I'm boiling porridge for you, eat your breakfast, I have important things to do today."</p><p></p><p>Little One's voice was still so pleasant to hear.</p><p></p><p>His second sister gave Fang Yu a desolate smile, as if she had lost all hope in life.</p><p></p><p>After living in Heavenly Circle Town for so many years, anyone would have heard the legends about demons.</p><p></p><p>The legends say demons are tremendously powerful.</p><p></p><p>The legends say demons devour human flesh and bones.</p><p></p><p>The legends say demons can don human skin and take their place! If a person is killed, they will die.</p><p></p><p>If the head falls off, they cannot possibly live.</p><p></p><p>Unless, he is a demon.</p><p></p><p>A demon, who can survive decapitation! Accomplish what humans cannot! His second sister closed her eyes and opened her arms.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and kill me, I won't resist."</p><p></p><p>"Little One was killed by you, Big Brother is missing and likely dead, what's the point of me living alone?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill me, so I can join them."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, his second sister seemed to have aged decades, as if she had lived a full life and had no more hope for the future.</p><p></p><p>Then, she heard a sound.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

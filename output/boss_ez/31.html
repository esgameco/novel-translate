        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The clothes were handed over, and Fang Yu took them, only to find that Lin Wotian's hands were trembling.</p><p></p><p>This is a serious illness.</p><p></p><p>Don't worry! Old master, I will inherit your martial arts! You can rest in peace!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was secretly planning how to create an opportunity for Lin Wotian to teach him a few martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't just threaten him by saying, "Lin Wotian, you wouldn't want your nephew to get into trouble, would you?"</p><p></p><p>He had to be gentle about it. What if the Dust-Sweeping Monk suddenly unleashed his full power and killed him in a flash? Slowly, slowly, a continuous stream. This Dust-Sweeping Monk hasn't even died yet.</p><p></p><p>"Nephew... about that... what... what grave, have you found one yet?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Wotian and Lin Wu were having a casual conversation, but the content was quite extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu's eyes immediately turned red.</p><p></p><p>"No, the family said... they'll find another doctor for you to see."</p><p></p><p>"It's incurable... incurable... cough... cough cough cough!!"</p><p></p><p>The injury resurfaced again.</p><p></p><p>This is not good, at this rate, the Dust-Sweeping Monk will depart this world in just a few days.</p><p></p><p>Your ultimate technique, where is it? Do you want to pass it on to an outstanding successor first? Like me, the one standing in front of you! Fang Yu was secretly anxious, giving the Dust-Sweeping Monk meaningful glances, but unfortunately, no one paid attention to him.</p><p></p><p>"Second Uncle!?"</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing... nothing else, I'll go back and lie down."</p><p></p><p>"... Okay, you go and rest."</p><p></p><p>Lin Wu walked out, and found Fang Yu standing still.</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu stretched his neck, looking inside.</p><p></p><p>"Your second uncle... has he been in the warehouse all the time?"</p><p></p><p>"Mostly, but he hasn't been managing things for a long time. Another shifu is responsible for the daily management, and he's not on duty today."</p><p></p><p>"Oh..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu withdrew his gaze.</p><p></p><p>There's no opportunity at all, the Dust-Sweeping Monk doesn't talk to me.</p><p></p><p>Doesn't he realize how outstanding I am standing here?</p><p></p><p>Hmm... I need to whisper something in Lin Wu's ear.</p><p></p><p>Holding the clothes, he followed Lin Wu out.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pretended to casually say, "Ah~ That set of swordplay, it feels like you've become much more proficient, it shouldn't be long before you've mastered it, just a few days."</p><p></p><p>"That fast?! Diao Deyi, your martial arts talent is maxed out!"</p><p></p><p>That's right, that's right! Your idea is very good, go and tell your second uncle quickly, Diao Deyi's talent is invincible!</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, not enough!" Fang Yu said dissatisfiedly, "The master has underestimated my comprehension. This little bit of martial arts is not enough for me to learn. I want stronger martial arts! More powerful techniques!"</p><p></p><p>"You're still the best, I'm so stupid, it takes me a few months to barely master the martial arts the master taught me." Lin Wu sighed.</p><p></p><p>This emotional state is not right.</p><p></p><p>Why are you bringing the topic back to yourself? Think more about your second uncle, your second uncle!</p><p>"By the way..." Fang Yu drawled, "I'm quite envious of you, having a second uncle. I haven't even seen my parents, as long as I can remember, I've only been relying on my big brother and second sister. And now my big brother has also gone missing... Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>"There's such a thing? What's your big brother's name? I'll help you look into it."</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...</p><p></p><p>The key point is to investigate my big brother's whereabouts, right? I don't even know what he looks like, how would I know his name. </p><p></p><p>The important thing is the family element in that sentence! The family element!</p><p>"Why aren't you saying anything? Diao Deyi? Don't be afraid, my family in Tianyuan Town still has some influence, finding someone shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>How did this topic get deeper.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu pretended to be in deep sorrow: "No... the disappearance of my big brother is very suspicious. I don't want to implicate anyone else, I'll investigate it myself!"</p><p></p><p>"It's really no trouble, I'm not afraid of being implicated..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't say anymore! As fellow disciples, just don't help me!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fang Yu's expression, Lin Wu naturally didn't continue.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He said.</p><p></p><p>However, he secretly noted this matter in his heart, planning to go back and ask his family members for some resources to help Diao De to investigate and take a look.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, Fang Yu found a few more topics, but none of them were related to Uncle Lin Wu. This silly goose thought Fang Yu was concerned about him, and was quite moved, almost becoming his sworn brother.</p><p></p><p>Scram! You low EQ silly goose, I don't want to become your brother.</p><p></p><p>Back at the martial arts training ground, he continued to practice the sword and grind experience points.</p><p></p><p>The morning passed in a flash.【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has diligently practiced [Yuan Ti Liang Zero Sword], proficiency +1.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has diligently practiced [Yuan Ti Liang Zero Sword], proficiency +1.】</p><p></p><p>【System Prompt: Congratulations, player has diligently practiced [Yuan Ti Liang Zero Sword], experience +1.】</p><p></p><p>A total increase of 2 points in proficiency and 1 point in experience.</p><p></p><p>The summary is... torture! This martial arts training method, not only is the efficiency low, but it's also particularly torturous.</p><p></p><p>Enjoying the days of one-click martial arts skill advancement, gaining 300 experience points per strike, suddenly returning to this sluggish life where it takes half a day to gain just a little bit of experience, Fang Yu felt the gap was quite large.</p><p></p><p>It was lunchtime.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu went to the cafeteria.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, he saw a senior brother sitting closest to the door, with numerous small health bars constantly appearing on his body.</p><p></p><p>【Piercing Demon: 0.1/0.1.】</p><p>【Piercing Demon: 0.1/0.1.】</p><p>【Piercing Demon: 0.1/0.1.】</p><p>【Piercing Demon: 0.1/0.1.】</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu's bold idea surfaced again.</p><p></p><p>Don't tempt me! I really can't resist it, I'll just directly 'Audacious demon, I want you to assist me in cultivation!'</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu suppressed the urge to punch that senior brother, and silently entered the cafeteria.</p><p></p><p>It was similar to an ordinary inn or restaurant, with dozens of tables and chairs neatly arranged in the room.</p><p></p><p>The space inside was quite large, but there weren't many people.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Yu noticed...</p><p></p><p>Glancing around, he hardly saw anyone else with Piercing Demons appearing on their bodies, which quickly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>They must have eaten the meat balls.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, he didn't know what their situation was.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt a bit strange, and went to queue up for his meal.</p><p></p><p>That's when he noticed.</p><p></p><p>Some people's meals didn't have any meat balls at all.</p><p></p><p>Some people, after getting their meals, simply stored the meat balls separately for safekeeping.</p><p></p><p>There were very few who directly ate the meat balls in the cafeteria.</p><p></p><p>When it was Fang Yu's turn, he directly showed his identity token.</p><p></p><p>After putting on the sect's clothes, he had found it inside.</p><p></p><p>"Name."</p><p>"Diao De."</p><p></p><p>Clap.</p><p></p><p>One rice, two meats, one vegetable and one soup, that's it.</p><p>The meat ball was one of them.</p><p></p><p>【Piercing Demon: 0.1/0.1.】</p><p></p><p>Huh? Sister Mei didn't directly take it away? Fang Yu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? After getting your meal, just leave quickly! Don't get in the way!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu glanced at the fat chef serving the food, but didn't say anything, and quietly walked away.</p><p></p><p>Finding a corner spot, Fang Yu looked at the wriggling meat lump in the food tray, and his bold idea surfaced again.</p><p></p><p>Glancing left and right, he raised his chopsticks and forcefully stabbed into the meat ball.</p><p></p><p>But there was no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing the chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Fang Yu looked at his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Slowly extending it, aiming at the meat ball, pressing down with force like the Five Finger Mountain! Slap! His hand was suddenly grabbed in midair and firmly fixed, unable to move at all!</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked up.</p><p></p><p>【Shi Chuang Mei: 150/150.】</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, screams came from the crowd in front.</p><p></p><p>The level of their investment was such that even his master's arrival went unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin had initially wanted to loudly reprimand these slack disciples.</p><p></p><p>But when his gaze passed over the crowd and fell upon Diao De, his pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>"...Destroy heaven and earth!!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!!! An explosive sound, the shockwave bursting open!</p><p></p><p>The wooden post frantically slid forward! One ox, two ox, three ox, four ox, five ox, six ox, seven ox, eight ox...nine ox!!</p><p></p><p>Not enough! It didn't stop!</p><p></p><p>The wooden post, still sliding forward!! Amidst the cheers of countless people.</p><p></p><p>In the witness of countless people.</p><p></p><p>The wooden post directly slid all the way to the end! Bang!!! A heavy sound.</p><p></p><p>Directly colliding with the end bell! Stopping at the mark labeled 10 notches.</p><p></p><p>Ten ox...of force!!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin, following the trajectory of the wooden post's movement, looked back.</p><p></p><p>There, a spirited young man stood.</p><p></p><p>"Diao...De...one!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin couldn't believe it.</p><p></p><p>Truly couldn't believe it!</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't just witnessed it with his own eyes, he would have thought it was another senior disciple striking the post for someone else!</p><p></p><p>A single punch, erupting from 0 ox all the way to the endpoint of 10 ox of force!</p><p></p><p>This was something only the disciples of the neighboring Tiger Post could accomplish! Ten ox of force = one tiger of force! But at this moment, this wooden post result came from a young man who had just joined the martial arts hall not even a full day ago!</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin, his body trembling.</p><p></p><p>This is...what a perfect...vessel! "Fuck!! Ten ox of force!!"</p><p></p><p>"Our Yuan Body Martial Arts Hall has produced a genius! An unparalleled genius!!"</p><p></p><p>"Just entering the martial path, and already possessing 10 ox of force, who are you? Who is this Diao De?! If you get rich and noble, don't forget me!!"</p><p></p><p>"Diao De!!"</p><p></p><p>The cheers of the onlooking crowd were almost deafening, nearly drowning out everything.</p><p></p><p>So no one noticed that Yuan Hongxin, who had just been standing beside them, had already left.</p><p></p><p>"Bring Diao De back to the main hall, I have something to ask him!"</p><p></p><p>This was the order Yuan Hongxin left for Shi Zangmei.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Being high-profile requires paying a price.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu felt like his entire arm no longer belonged to him, completely drained of strength.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the money was in hand.</p><p></p><p>10 taels of silver! Adding to the previous money, a total of 14 taels 700 coins! Once again getting a large sum of money, Fang Yu couldn't help but feel his mood elated.</p><p></p><p>Second sister, our family has money now!</p><p></p><p>The only problem was that the punch just now, using too much force, his body actually couldn't quite withstand it.</p><p></p><p>It felt like his entire body was protesting, buzzing and aching terribly.</p><p></p><p>Previously at 4 ox of force, his 2 points of physique could still support him unleashing over a dozen full-power punches.</p><p></p><p>Now a single 10 ox of force punch had directly drained all his physical strength, comparable to a One-Punch Man version that gets incapacitated after a single punch.</p><p></p><p>"I should have known to add 1 point to physique, and do a balanced build..."</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, normally he wouldn't be using full power, so his stamina should still be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>It's just that for the next attribute point, he'll definitely have to put it into physique.</p><p></p><p>He had exerted a great effort to squeeze out from the senior brothers' adulation.</p><p></p><p>Only to be met by Shi Zangmei.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mei?"</p><p></p><p>"I saw it. That punch just now."</p><p></p><p>Shi Zangmei looked at Fang Yu with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>Originally thinking he was just an ordinary junior brother.</p><p></p><p>Turns out, he was the trump card.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm Diao De."</p><p></p><p>"...Nevermind, the master is looking for you, come with me."</p><p></p><p>It's finally here!</p><p></p><p>The 10 taels of silver table compensation!</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing I've already earned the money, otherwise I wouldn't know how to face the master now.</p><p></p><p>Striding behind Shi Zangmei, Fang Yu kept his back straight.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"We have money!"</p><p></p><p>The others saw that Fang Yu was about to leave and hurriedly tried to stop him.</p><p></p><p>Frightened by a single command from Shi Chongmei, they all scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>The awe that Master had accumulated over the years was not just talk - no one dared to defy him.</p><p></p><p>Following Shi Chongmei, Fang Yu was actually brought back to the hall where he had previously taken on an apprenticeship.</p><p></p><p>That stingy master, Yuan Hongxin, was again sitting and sipping tea, reading a letter.</p><p></p><p>This familiar scene made Fang Yu momentarily feel like he had been rolled back on the server.</p><p></p><p>Until...</p><p></p><p>"Diao Deyi, come in."</p><p></p><p>Okay, this part didn't happen when he took on the apprenticeship before.</p><p></p><p>After paying respects, Fang Yu looked up to see Yuan Hongxin had put down the letter.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the contents of the letter, he vaguely saw the name Liqian Xuan.</p><p></p><p>So this was really the same letter as before? Why was Yuan Hongxin reading it twice? Was he bored? "Diao Deyi, have you started practicing the martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin asked, already knowing the answer.</p><p></p><p>"Yes. I have learned the [Yuan Body Stabilizing Technique]."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin stood up and walked around Fang Yu in a circle.</p><p></p><p>One circle, two circles, three circles...</p><p></p><p>His expression changed from initial doubt to surprise, confusion, and finally shock.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Yuan Hongxin grabbed Fang Yu's hands.</p><p></p><p>On the backs of Fang Yu's hands, there were white bony structures covering them.</p><p></p><p>The coverage area was not large, about half the back of the hand, but it was extremely hard, like an exoskeleton.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was startled.</p><p></p><p>What the hell is this?!</p><p></p><p>He had just felt his body weak and his hands numb, but he didn't expect these strange things to grow out.</p><p></p><p>But Yuan Hongxin was intoxicated by this, as if admiring a perfect creation of heaven and earth! "The bone solidification is so pure and white!"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin murmured to himself, then suddenly looked sharply at Fang Yu.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what level have you reached in the Yuan Body Stabilizing Technique?"</p><p></p><p>"Level? The fourth layer? Furnace-like purity?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Furnace-like purity! Indeed, furnace-like purity!" </p><p></p><p>Yuan Hongxin was in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The Yuan Body Stabilizing Technique was the foundational and core martial art of the Yuan Body Sect.</p><p></p><p>But those who could reach the furnace-like purity level were few and far between.</p><p></p><p>Someone like Fang Yu, who had cultivated the purest white bone, was practically one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>No, there was none.</p><p></p><p>Even Yuan Hongxin himself only had a half-gray, half-red bone armor.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple.</p><p></p><p>After reaching the [Gradual Improvement] stage in the Yuan Body Stabilizing Technique, there would be a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>This bottleneck tested one's mental purity.</p><p></p><p>If the mental purity was not pure, the bones would be stained with various colors.</p><p></p><p>Once the white bones were stained, it would be extremely difficult to continue cultivating this technique.</p><p></p><p>And to break through to the furnace-like purity, it was even more difficult, almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>Even Yuan Hongxin had used many tricks to cultivate this technique to the furnace-like purity level and produce the most important white bone gauntlet of the bone armor.</p><p></p><p>The Yuan Body was a very complex martial art.</p><p></p><p>So complex that the previous generations had even divided the techniques, to complete the learning of the techniques.</p><p></p><p>Each technique corresponded to a part of the body, forming an external bone armor.</p><p></p><p>Finally, by operating multiple techniques together, they could complete the full-body coverage of the bone armor.</p><p></p><p>Only then would it be considered a success, and the subsequent step would be to just improve the strength of the bone armor.</p><p></p><p>But this early stage of cultivating the individual parts of the bone armor was the most difficult.</p><p></p><p>It was also the weakest and most vulnerable stage of cultivating this set of techniques.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the most difficult to cultivate were the heart armor, hand armor, and head armor.</p><p></p><p>They were closely related to mental purity, and one misstep would make this martial art unattainable, leaving flaws in the bone armor formation.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, such a difficult martial art, Diao Deyi, who had only started learning martial arts at the age of sixteen, should not have been able to break through to the furnace-like purity level.</p><p></p><p>But the fact was...</p><p></p><p>Diao Deyi had learned it.</p><p></p><p>And he had cultivated the purest white bone! The highest quality bone armor gauntlet! (End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cries of street vendors and the sounds of conversation were incessant.</p><p></p><p>Tianyuan Town was larger than Fang Yu had imagined, and the population was also more than he had expected.</p><p></p><p>Though called a town, it was more like a city.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by walls on all sides, with two gates open and two closed, each guarded by rotating personnel.</p><p></p><p>The entire town operated in an orderly fashion.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu kept a low profile, securing his envelope, and walked briskly on the street, blending into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a commotion sounded up ahead.</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu was not initially interested, but...</p><p></p><p>"...Who are you? I'm setting up my stall here, and I just gained 1 experience point, and you come to cause trouble? Do you want to die?"</p><p></p><p>Hm? A player?? Fang Yu glanced in that direction.</p><p></p><p>It was a woman, setting up a stall and selling things like large white cabbages.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she had just completed a transaction and gained some experience, but was now surrounded by five burly men.</p><p></p><p>There were a few young people around, eager to try and play the hero.</p><p></p><p>What? I'm also a young person?</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu had a large sum of money, how could he possibly get involved in trouble.</p><p></p><p>He had just never seen players in the game before, so he was just watching the commotion.</p><p></p><p>"You old hag, you're new here, aren't you? This spot belongs to our Black Tiger Gang, you have to pay protection fees if you want to set up your stall here. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Ptui! I'll set up my stall wherever I want, and if you keep interfering with my leveling and gaining experience, I'll kill you all!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ???Are players this brave these days?</p><p>Or is she strong? Fang Yu glanced at her health bar.</p><p></p><p>[Liang Jinjin: 5/5.]</p><p></p><p>Fang Yu: ...She's a weakling? Why is she so arrogant? Isn't she afraid of dying? Slap!!</p><p></p><p>As Fang Yu was thinking this, the woman was slapped hard.</p><p>A big "-1" popped up, and she cried out in pain, wailing and thrashing on the ground. She was then kicked a few times, "-1" "-1" as she curled up on the ground, no longer daring to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Was she always this brave?</p><p></p><p>In the crowd of onlookers, someone finally couldn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>"Stop! In broad daylight, under the heavens..."</p><p>Boom! The young man who jumped out was knocked down.</p><p></p><p>"Bullying is too much! Five against one, what kind of skill is that...Ah! I was just saying! Don't hit, don't hit! I'll have to restart if I die! Ow, ow, ow!"</p><p></p><p>Another person who didn't believe it jumped out, only to be beaten by the thugs as well.</p><p></p><p>Serves them right, Fang Yu thought inwardly.</p><p>He used to hang out with these kinds of thugs, and Wang Er's group were really ruthless, not your average small-time thugs, they were vicious.</p><p></p><p>A few more people jumped out to help, and from their slogans, they seemed to be players as well.</p><p>It was truly players helping players.</p><p></p><p>But they were all beaten down and piled up, with three of them killed on the spot by the ruthless kicking of the five thugs.</p><p></p><p>This level of cruelty was even more extreme than Wang Er's group.</p><p>At least Wang Er's group didn't dare to casually kill people, they would at most just break a limb or two.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui! With this level of strength, you also try to play the hero!"</p><p>"Remember, the one beating you is Qi Yeye of the Black Tiger Gang, got it?"</p><p>"Hand over anything valuable you have on you, you bunch of paupers! Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>The thugs left triumphantly, and the onlookers pointed and whispered.</p><p>The few players who survived also left in shame.</p><p></p><p>The commotion was quickly over, and the street returned to normal.</p><p>Judging from the gritted teeth of those players, they were most likely going to post on the forums to rally people and get their revenge.</p><p></p><p>But from this, Fang Yu saw...an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Yes, a business opportunity.</p><p>Players were in a miserable state now, easily bullied by NPCs, and the huge gap in strength left them powerless to fight back.</p><p></p><p>At this time... if a high-level player came out and claimed they could help the players take revenge, eliminate those NPCs, wouldn't that be a goldmine, a chance to make a fortune? Fang Yu's heart raced with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The premise for all of this was that he would first need to become strong enough.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei opened the doors of the martial arts hall. Outside, there was already a long line of people.</p><p></p><p>This did not surprise Shi Zhuangmei.</p><p></p><p>Because these three days every month were the days when the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall recruited disciples.</p><p></p><p>The Yuanti Martial Arts Hall was a renowned large martial arts hall in the entire Tianyuan Town.</p><p></p><p>Those who came to study here out of admiration were endless.</p><p></p><p>But Shi Zhuangmei did not think anyone in the line would be able to catch the master's eye.</p><p></p><p>The master's standards for accepting disciples were always very high.</p><p></p><p>So while the number of disciples in other martial arts halls was steadily increasing and they were branching out all over Tianyuan Town, only their Yuanti Martial Arts Hall showed no signs of expansion, silently cultivating their own little plot of land.</p><p></p><p>Some people thought their hall was easy to bully, and were driven away.</p><p></p><p>Some people wanted to get close to their hall, but were turned away when they tried to send gifts.</p><p></p><p>The master was not only stubborn, but this was also the style of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>The master did not recruit disciples frequently, unlike other martial arts halls that were open for recruitment all day every day, but that did not mean they did not accept anyone.</p><p></p><p>They just had relatively strict requirements for aptitude, and sometimes the master's mood on a given day would also be a factor.</p><p></p><p>"You can come in for the assessment now."</p><p></p><p>Those who wanted to enter the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall began to enter in an orderly fashion for the assessment, about ten people at a time. </p><p></p><p>The assessment time was uncertain, sometimes fast, sometimes slow.</p><p></p><p>Closing the door, Shi Zhuangmei sat down in a chair at the entrance, waiting for the assessment inside to finish before letting the next batch in.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shi Zhuangmei noticed a bit of commotion in the long line.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? Don't push!"</p><p>"Excuse me, excuse me."</p><p>"First come, first served. Are you trying to cut in line?"</p><p>"Excuse me, excuse me."</p><p>"You little brat, who allowed you to go in front of me?"</p><p>"Excuse me, excuse me."</p><p>"You better really be excusing yourself, or the people of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall will deal with you! Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The small commotion spread from the back of the line all the way to the front.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei looked over there curiously.</p><p></p><p>She found that it was a young man, who was pushing his way through the people in front of him, as if trying to cut in line, and was now already near the front of the line.</p><p></p><p>"Another one looking to get himself beaten up?"</p><p>"Pretending to excuse himself but actually cutting in line, this trick is too old, others have used it before, and the outcome... hehe!"</p><p></p><p>Some in the crowd were gleefully watching the situation, others were observing quietly.</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei had now stood up.</p><p></p><p>She had already determined that the young man was indeed cutting in line.</p><p></p><p>Here, cutting in line was against the rules of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall. </p><p></p><p>Anyone who did not follow this rule was showing disrespect to the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall.</p><p></p><p>Such a person, forget about joining the hall, they would be lucky to not get beaten up.</p><p></p><p>Here, the rules of the Yuanti Martial Arts Hall took precedence over everything.</p><p></p><p>She waited calmly from her elevated position.</p><p></p><p>She was waiting for the moment when that young man reached the very front of the line and completed his act of cutting in, before she would step in to punish him.</p><p></p><p>He was getting closer, very close.</p><p></p><p>The young man was already among the top ten in the line, still pushing people aside to move forward.</p><p></p><p>Eight, seven, six... three, two, one... huh?</p><p></p><p>Shi Zhuangmei was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>Exclamations of surprise and bewilderment also came from the long line behind.</p><p></p><p>Because that young man, who in their eyes was purely cutting in line, had actually broken away from the line and was striding towards the entrance where Shi Zhuangmei stood.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." Shi Zhuangmei said, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Here." </p><p></p><p>Fang Yu directly handed her the recommendation letter.</p><p></p><p>"Li Qianxuan... a recommendation letter from the Li family..."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

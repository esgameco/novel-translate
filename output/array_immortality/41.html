        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Master Luo was a first-rank array master and refused Elder Yan's request. </p><p></p><p>Elder Yan could only settle for second best and find some array masters who had not yet attained a rank but had studied the way of arrays for many years, asking them to take Moke as their disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, some directly refused, some made excuses, and some agreed but made outrageous demands. If agreed to, Moke would be treated as a mere tool and puppet for life with no freedom, which was no different from selling himself.</p><p></p><p>Elder Yan went around for many days without success. He returned to his residence, sat alone, and sighed deeply. In a few days he would have to leave, with little time remaining. If he could not find a suitable master, it might delay Moke's progress in cultivating array arts.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, Elder Yan seemed to make up his mind. He sealed Moke's test papers separately and put them in his qiankun bag.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Elder Yan left Tongxian City and headed southeast.</p><p></p><p>To the southeast of Tongxian City was a secluded and beautiful mountain peak with exquisite scenery. In the mountains sat a courtyard residence without a plaque or gate, only a small mountain path leading inside.</p><p></p><p>Elder Yan stood at the foot of the mountain. After a long while, he heard a withered voice in his ear:</p><p></p><p>"Please enter."</p><p></p><p>The voice seemed to be by his ear yet also echoed in his consciousness. </p><p></p><p>Elder Yan's expression became even more humble. He straightened his Daoist robe, patted his qiankun bag, and resolutely stepped up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Moke planned to drop out of Tongxian School.</p><p></p><p>Moke was originally just an outer disciple, with only a simple relationship of paying spirit stones to cultivate. There was some affection but not much.</p><p></p><p>Especially since Elder Yan was leaving and the outer sect would no longer teach array arts, there was no point in Moke staying.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual roots predetermined that his spiritual power would not be very strong and his cultivation speed slow.</p><p></p><p>As for the other subjects the sect taught like body refinement, pill refinement, artifact forging, talisman scripting etc., they were of little use to Moke - learning them was pointless but abandoning them was a pity.</p><p></p><p>What Moke wanted to learn and had prospects for was only array arts.</p><p></p><p>But in the outer sect, apart from Elder Yan, Moke didn't think anyone else could teach him array arts.</p><p></p><p>Da Hu and the others also planned to drop out, but not because of the instructor. It was simply because their families were too poor to afford the sect's tuition and various new fees.</p><p></p><p>According to Moke's understanding, the old Sect Master would retire in a few months and no longer manage the sect's affairs. Currently, Elder Qian called the shots, in other words, the Qian family.</p><p></p><p>The Qian family planned to reform the sect with various means, but the core point was to collect more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was pill refinement, artifact forging, or talisman scripting, previously only the basics were taught. Now profound levels would be taught, but at additional spirit stone costs.</p><p></p><p>Even the inheritance of cultivation methods previously required a "transmission fee", with Elder Qian using the excuse "the sect's inheritance is hard-won, so transmission is not free."</p><p></p><p>After the Qian family's reforms, disciples from wealthy clans could learn better inheritances by paying more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But for outer sect disciples from the lower classes, especially wandering cultivators, they basically couldn't learn anything while still having to pay more spirit stones as tuition.</p><p></p><p>These wandering cultivator disciples had no choice but to drop out.</p><p></p><p>In this way, through reforms, the Tongxian Sect used disciples' family wealth as the standard to gradually eliminate its poorer wandering cultivator disciples, who could no longer cultivate at the sect and had to seek their fortunes elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Moke told his parents of his plan to drop out. Moke Shan didn't quite agree but knew there was no way, as this wasn't just Moke's issue but that of all the lower class wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Liuru Hua didn't mind - she knew Moke cultivated diligently and had his own plans. Since he decided to drop out, it must mean he couldn't learn anything more at the sect, so she didn't say much.</p><p></p><p>Their restaurant business was good, so even if her son did nothing at home, she could support him.</p><p></p><p>And so Moke, at the third level of Qi Condensation, dropped out of Tongxian Sect.</p><p></p><p>Moke simply went through the withdrawal procedures at the sect and received a refund of half a year's tuition fees - around 50-60 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After dropping out, the biggest problem was cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Moke Shan promised to ask around as a spirit-hunting master about suitable cultivation methods for Moke, but it would cost...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Some time passed.</p><p></p><p>Another issue was the array formations. </p><p></p><p>Without guidance from a sect, Mohua could only learn on his own, or find an array master to take him as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, Mohua also knew that it was very difficult for a rogue cultivator to be accepted as a disciple by an array master. Not every array master was as open-minded and willing to teach as Strict Instructor.</p><p></p><p>Mohua wanted to take some time to visit Strict Instructor and thank him for his meticulous guidance over this period. But he didn't know where Strict Instructor lived. Just as he was thinking of asking Manager Mo, Strict Instructor found him.</p><p></p><p>After not seeing him for a few days, Strict Instructor looked somewhat weary, as if he had been busy with something.</p><p></p><p>Mohua respectfully greeted Strict Instructor, who nodded and then asked, "Do you still want to learn array formations?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor gave Mohua an approving look and said, "Follow me."</p><p></p><p>Mohua followed Strict Instructor to a mountain peak southeast of Tonxian City.</p><p></p><p>Mohua remembered Big Tiger and the others mentioning that someone had bought this mountain peak to live in seclusion and cultivation, prohibiting the coming and going of cultivators.</p><p></p><p>There were no demonic beasts in these mountains, nor any precious spirit herbs, let alone spirit mines. The only advantage was the beautiful scenery and quiet environment.</p><p></p><p>With many rogue cultivators in Tonxian City busy with their own affairs, no one would linger to admire the mountain scenery, so cultivators rarely came here.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor brought Mohua to the foot of the mountain and said, "There is a reclusive elder living on this mountain whom I happened to meet by chance. Normally I would not disturb him, but I will be leaving in a few days, so I'm bringing you to meet him."</p><p></p><p>"Does this elder know array formations?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor nodded, "Yes, this elder's attainments in array formations are extremely high."</p><p></p><p>"Is he a first-rank array master?" Mohua asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure of his exact rank, but at least first-rank."</p><p></p><p>Mohua felt solemn respect.</p><p></p><p>A first-rank array master was already incredible. If higher than first-rank, Mohua didn't even dare imagine it.</p><p></p><p>But Mohua also wondered in his heart, what array formations above first-rank were like...</p><p></p><p>Were they really as rumored, with the power to steal from the laws of creation and alter heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"Why does this elder live in such a remote place? Because he dislikes noise?" Mohua asked again.</p><p></p><p>"The elder has a simple nature and dislikes mundane affairs, so he doesn't wish to be disturbed. This mountain peak is also rarely visited by others."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor looked at Mohua and said, "You've already guessed why I brought you here, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded, "Is it so this elder can accept me as his disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor nodded, "You guessed correctly. There is not much more I can teach you, so I hope the elder can provide some guidance."</p><p></p><p>"You have already taught me a lot," Mohua said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"What I can teach you is far less than this elder."</p><p></p><p>"But..."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor shook his head, "You're still young and don't quite understand. The more experience you gain, the more you'll realize the profundity of array formations, far beyond what a mere Qi Condensation or Foundation Establishment cultivator can comprehend. You have an extraordinary spiritual sense and good comprehension ability. You are also very diligent - an excellent seedling for learning array formations. So you must cherish this rare gift and not waste your talent."</p><p></p><p>"Today I'm bringing you to pay a visit in the hope that you can become this elder's disciple. His nature is simple and he is unwilling to take students, so even just becoming a nominal disciple would be good. Even if you only learn a little, it will still allow you to go further on the path of array formations."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor pointed ahead, where a mountain path wound its way up to the mountainside shrouded in mist, with a simple yet mysterious gate nestled within the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor instructed, "Go up the mountain yourself. Maintain an attitude of respect. Answer the elder's questions honestly. If he accepts you as a disciple, it will be your good fortune. If not, don't be discouraged - it just means your fortune has not arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded seriously, then couldn't help glancing at Strict Instructor.</p><p></p><p>"Instructor..."</p><p></p><p>"Go on," Strict Instructor said with a wave of his hand, saying no more.</p><p></p><p>Mohua hesitated for a moment, but eventually took determined small steps, his back receding as he headed up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Master Yan stared at Moku's exam paper, pondering for a moment before grading it with the highest mark "A". </p><p></p><p>He then graded the array formations of the other disciples. After a while, he seemed to recall something and took out the previous exam papers, upgrading all the "B" grades of the other disciples to "A".</p><p></p><p>With this, Moku was no longer the only one who received an "A" grade.</p><p></p><p>After finishing grading, Master Yan sat at his desk deep in thought for a long time, muttering to himself:</p><p></p><p>"It seems I cannot stay at the Tongxian Sect any longer..."</p><p></p><p>When the graded formation exams were handed out, Moku saw the "A" mark on his paper and nodded slightly, but he also wondered if the other qi refining disciples could truly draw the Water-Stilling Formation...</p><p></p><p>This was a six-line array formation after all.</p><p></p><p>Moku inquired and heard that some other disciples had also received "A" grades. He was surprised, but also felt:</p><p></p><p>"There are always higher levels, one cannot be complacent with one's current array skills!"</p><p></p><p>However, what Moku did not know was that his "A" and the others' "A" were quite different.</p><p></p><p>His "A" was a true "A", while the others' "A" grades were inflated by Master Yan...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Moku planned to continue cultivating at the Tongxian Sect, studying array formations, and eventually choose an martial art to practice. But half a month later, he heard an extremely preposterous thing:</p><p></p><p>"Master Yan is leaving the Tongxian Sect, and from now on the outer sect will no longer teach array formations..."</p><p></p><p>Moku stood dazed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>No more array formations to study...</p><p></p><p>Moku went to find Master Yan. Master Yan looked at him with a complex expression but did not say much, only asking Moku to return first and come find him again in a few days.</p><p></p><p>After Moku left, Master Yan went to see Manager Mo.</p><p></p><p>"Any news on the matter I asked you about?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo handed Master Yan a letter, "The person you're looking for is no longer in Tongxian City. Here is a lead, but I can't guarantee if it's real or not."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you."</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo hesitated, but still said: "So you really plan to leave the Tongxian Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just the Tongxian Sect, I will also leave Tongxian City."</p><p></p><p>"Will you ever come back?"</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say," Master Yan gave a wry smile, "As you said, let's go with the flow."</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo had words of persuasion on the tip of his tongue, but thought better of it, knowing he couldn't dissuade him.</p><p></p><p>"What about that kid Moku? What are your plans for him?" Manager Mo said, "With you gone, there'll be no one at the Tongxian Sect who can teach him, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I have my own plans. That kid's talent for array formations..."</p><p></p><p>Is quite formidable...</p><p></p><p>Master Yan thought to himself, but did not voice it out loud, only saying: "...is not bad. It would be a pity if he couldn't study array formations anymore. He is my disciple after all, I will figure something out for him later."</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo nodded, looking at his martial brother, unsure if they would ever meet again after this parting. So many words left unsaid, he did not know where to start.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators with long lifespans, partings were even more drawn out.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they simply raised their tea in a toast, at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"Take care!"</p><p></p><p>"Take care!"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan nodded, and under Manager Mo's gaze, left the Youan Pavilion, disappearing into the bustling streets.</p><p></p><p>Since he could no longer teach array formations at the outer sect, there was no point in staying at the Tongxian Sect. Moreover, the matter of the Spirit Pivot Array Diagram weighed on his mind - he would not give up on it.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving Tongxian City, Master Yan had one final task - to find an array master to take Moku as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>He prepared some fine wine and tea as gifts, and knocked on the grand doors of a large residence on North Street.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the grandest residences in the city, magnificent and luxuriously decorated.</p><p></p><p>The owner was one of the only two first-rank array masters in Tongxian City, surnamed Luo, respectfully addressed as Master Luo by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan presented the tea gifts and explained his purpose for coming.</p><p></p><p>Master Luo was quite familiar with Master Yan, and asked doubtfully: "For this boy to have such talent that you, Old Brother Yan, would personally come to vouch for him?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan took out the Brilliant Fire Formation that Moku had drawn when he was at the third level of qi refinement and showed it to Master Luo, "This is the array he drew at that level."</p><p></p><p>He did not take out the Water-Stilling Formation with its five and a half array lines that Moku had drawn, not wanting to be too boastful.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, being able to draw a three-line array formation at the third level of qi refinement was already considered outstanding talent.</p><p></p><p>Master Luo's eyes lit up as he nodded, "Indeed impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Master Luo examined the Brilliant Fire Formation diagram carefully.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel, being careful not to reproduce any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>Someone asked: "I wonder which family's son he is? The Qians? The Ans or the Chens?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan was silent for a moment, then said: "He's not from any family, just a wandering cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Master Luo didn't say anything more, the interest in his eyes fading considerably. </p><p></p><p>Master Yan probed: "Does the master have any reservations?"</p><p></p><p>"A wandering cultivator, not easy to teach..." Master Luo said.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo..."</p><p></p><p>Master Luo waved his hand, saying: "Old brother Yan, I understand what you're saying, but taking in a wandering cultivator as an apprentice, do you know how troublesome that is?"</p><p></p><p>"This child Moku is young, but obedient, sensible, diligent and hardworking. His talent for array formations is extremely high. With a little guidance from Brother Luo, his future prospects in array formations will be limitless," Master Yan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"That's not the issue," Master Luo sighed and said: "Putting aside this child's aptitude, can he even afford the customary gifts when taking a master?"</p><p></p><p>Master Luo stood up and slowly paced around. "It's not that I'm greedy for these gifts, but taking an apprentice has long-established rules. I've accepted so many disciples, and the gifts from each were considerable. If he can't afford them, or gives less, how can I explain that to the others? Even if they don't say it, they'll surely resent the perceived favoritism and uneven treatment."</p><p></p><p>"Not just the master-taking gifts, studying array formations requires spirit stones for ink, paper, brushes and inkstones. Can a wandering cultivator's finances support that?"</p><p></p><p>"And even if he does eventually become an array master in the future, he only has two paths: rely on a clan, or a sect. If not, his cultivation and array studies will be extremely difficult. And if he does rely on others, it's akin to selling himself - losing his name, origins and parents, with no autonomy. How could he still see me as his master then?"</p><p></p><p>"So whether taking him as an apprentice or disciple, there's no benefit for me at all." </p><p></p><p>Master Luo finished speaking and drank some tea.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan also fell silent, understanding Master Luo's points and unable to refute them. He had only thought that given Moku's exceptional talent, Master Luo would at least consider it. But now it seemed he had oversimplified things.</p><p></p><p>There were indeed good reasons why wandering cultivators rarely became array masters...</p><p></p><p>Master Yan looked crestfallen.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Master Luo also sighed, his tone softening: "If he had any family or clan background, even just a branch, I could take him in. But a wandering cultivator is too much trouble, I don't have the energy for that..."</p><p></p><p>"It's too difficult for a wandering cultivator to become an array master!" Master Luo lamented.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan wanted to advocate further, saying: "This child Moku's talent for array formations is truly unmatched..."  He started to take out the "Stilling Water Array" that Moku had drawn with five partial array lines.</p><p></p><p>But halfway through, Master Luo said: "Even if he could draw three array lines in the Qi Condensation third realm, or four or five lines, I still wouldn't accept him."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan's hand stopped, and he could only put the array formation away again helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo, is there really no way?"</p><p></p><p>"Old brother Yan, you can come here anytime to discuss and chat, but on this matter there is no room for negotiation."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo..." Master Yan had no more words, only sighing: "Just don't regret it in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Many cultivators have said that to me before, but I, Luo, have never regretted it until now!"</p><p></p><p>The two fell silent, and Master Luo saw Master Yan out with tea.</p><p></p><p>After Yan left, Master Luo sat in the room as a disciple poured him tea. The disciple asked softly: "Master, if he could truly draw the Bright Fire Array in the third Qi Condensation realm, that talent would be astounding."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Master Luo picked up the tea and took a sip. "But what good is high talent? Cultivation isn't just about talent. How many geniuses eventually faded into obscurity? Spirit stones, inheritance, family status - these are all crucial. Without them, talent is just a rootless plant that will inevitably wither."</p><p></p><p>"But Master, if you gave some guidance, he would at least be grateful..."</p><p></p><p>Master Luo shook his head. "You oversimplify people's hearts. Wandering cultivators from impoverished backgrounds often have extreme mentalities. One misstep and they can harbor resentments. There are too many cases of repaying kindness with enmity. Why would I willingly step into that mess?"</p><p></p><p>"Master speaks rightly. But such talent is still a pity to waste."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is a pity," Master Luo put down his cup with a sigh. "But that is fate, some things cannot be forced."</p>

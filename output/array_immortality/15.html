        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Sects open outer doors to recruit disciples and impart cultivation knowledge and skills. Disciples who join a sect need to pay tuition fees. </p><p></p><p>Different level sects require different tuition fees - the higher the level of the sect, the more expensive the fees.</p><p></p><p>The Tongshen Sect was only a first-grade sect in the cultivation world, but in Tongshen City where there were only first-grade sects, it was the largest. The annual tuition was one hundred spirit stones, not including various other miscellaneous fees.</p><p></p><p>One hundred spirit stones was not too expensive, but it was definitely not cheap either, roughly equal to the annual income of an ordinary qi cultivation practitioner, provided they did not suffer any injuries or have any major expenses requiring large sums of spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>If there was illness or disaster, or situations requiring spending spirit stones to resolve, it was possible to have no income for the entire year.</p><p></p><p>They felt happy during the New Year, but after the festivities, the burden of the cultivation life seemed to weigh down again.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan placed a storage bag on the table, feeling a bit guilty, "I borrowed some spirit stones from a few brothers. Together with what I had saved before, it's over eighty stones..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua comforted him, "Tomorrow I'll go find the manager of the restaurant and ask him to advance me some spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan was about to say something when he noticed Muo Hua eavesdropping by the door crack.</p><p></p><p>"Hua'er!"</p><p></p><p>Caught, Muo Hua could only smile sheepishly and run over to sit beside her mother.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua pinched Muo Hua's ear affectionately and chided, "At such a young age, already eavesdropping!"</p><p></p><p>"Dad, Mom, are we still short on spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan said, "We're a bit short, but yesterday your Uncle Ji said he would lend me some and repeatedly told me to let you study well at the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Ji?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your Uncle Ji said you're smart and kept praising you," said Liu Ruhua, patting Muo Hua's head.</p><p></p><p>"But Uncle Ji's family doesn't have an abundance of spirit stones either, right?" Muo Hua asked.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan sighed lightly, "I'll pay him back after the New Year. These days, who has an abundance of spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>"I do!" Muo Hua giggled.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan and Liu Ruhua were stunned.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua trotted back to the room and returned holding a storage bag. She opened it to reveal fifty spirit stones glimmering and sparkling beautifully inside. But the expected scene of her parents being moved to tears and praising her did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan's expression was grave, and Liu Ruhua's brows were slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua asked nervously, "What's wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan asked as calmly as he could, "Hua'er, who gave you these spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>"No one gave them to me, I earned them myself!"</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan was stunned, "Earned them...yourself?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua's frown eased slightly as she pulled Muo Hua into her embrace, "Then tell Mother how you earned them."</p><p></p><p>"I drew formation diagrams for the Youyuan Vegetarian Stall. Just the simplest ones, and I could earn one spirit stone for each diagram I drew."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan and Liu Ruhua looked at each other, recalling that during the New Year period, Muo Hua had mostly stayed indoors and didn't go out to play much, only going out briefly before returning. It turned out she had been drawing formation diagrams to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>They looked at the spirit stones in the bag again. One diagram for one stone, with nearly fifty stones in the bag, meaning she must have drawn at least fifty diagrams...</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua couldn't help but hug Muo Hua tighter.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan started to speak a few times but didn't know what to say. Finally, he just reached out and gently patted Muo Hua's head.</p><p></p><p>"These spirit stones were earned through your hard work. You keep them and use them for your cultivation or to buy some snacks. As for the Tongshen Sect's tuition, Dad will find a way to take care of it."</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua knew her father was reluctant to use these spirit stones, so she said slyly, "Then you and Mom can keep these spirit stones for me first. I'm just a kid and can't use so many. Plus they might get stolen or robbed."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan and Liu Ruhua looked at each other speechlessly, unable to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Liu Ruhua said, "Alright, we'll keep them for you first."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!" Muo Hua nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, it's getting late. You need to go to the sect tomorrow, so go sleep early."</p><p></p><p>"Mm, good night Dad and Mom!"</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua got up to return to her room, but then turned back and added, "Dad, Mom, you should use them if you need to. Don't save them for me."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan and his wife could only laugh wryly.</p><p></p><p>Watching Muo Hua return to her room and close the door, Muo Shan finally sighed and said with a bitter smile, "As a father, I'm not as good as my child."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua comforted him, "Don't say that. Hua'er understands how to consider her parents - that's a good thing. We should be happy that she can earn spirit stones through her own abilities. It's just that..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Liuruhui looked down at the spirit stones in front of her, then raised her head to look at her husband with concern. "He's so young, can he really earn spirit stones by drawing formation arrays for others? And earn so many..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go check it out tomorrow," Mozhan said, his gaze gradually becoming sharper. </p><p></p><p>The next day, Mohua got up on time. After cultivating for a while, he went with his mother Liuruhui to the outer sect of the Tonxian Sect to pay the tuition and register for admission. </p><p></p><p>Mozhan had left early, as Liuruhui said he would go into the inner mountain with some demon hunters today, so he needed to prepare early.</p><p></p><p>At the outer sect gate, Liuruhui paid the tuition and completed Mohua's admission. She couldn't help but look at Mohua a few more times. Once he entered the Tonxian Sect to cultivate, unless it was a holiday when the sect was off, she wouldn't be able to see her son on normal days.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhui reminded Mohua to cultivate diligently, get along well with his fellow disciples, eat well, dress warmly, and not bully others. Then she left reluctantly. </p><p></p><p>Mohua waved at the gate until his mother's figure disappeared at the turn before turning around himself. However, he didn't enter the sect but went to the Youyuan Vegetarian Restaurant on North Street first. He got materials for twenty Bright Fire Formation arrays from the fat manager, agreeing to hand them in no later than half a month later.</p><p></p><p>The sect had a one-day break every early, middle, and late month. Mohua planned to sneak out during those breaks to trade with the fat manager.</p><p></p><p>For the twenty sets of materials, the fat manager only charged a deposit of ten spirit stones, considering his pleasant previous cooperation with Mohua's...elder brother and the increasing quality of the formation arrays handed in. Seeing Mohua's status, the deposit remained the same.</p><p></p><p>After the satisfactory negotiation with the fat manager, Mohua left the restaurant contentedly. However, he didn't notice a burly man quietly watching him from outside.</p><p></p><p>After Mohua left, the man entered the restaurant. The ringing of the bell caught the fat manager's attention. He looked up to see a plainly dressed but handsome man with sharp brows and starry eyes giving him an inspecting gaze filled with imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>The fat manager could tell at a glance that this man was a demon hunter, a real one who had seen blood! And his attitude wasn't friendly, looking at the manager like a beast awaiting slaughter.</p><p></p><p>The manager thought his cultivation wasn't inferior to this man's, but he couldn't say for sure about actual combat ability. After all, demon hunters constantly risked their lives fighting demons, while he had been sitting behind the counter for who knows how long without touching a sword, his fighting skills long rusty.</p><p></p><p>After weighing it up, the manager adopted a respectful attitude and carefully asked, "What formation array does this Daoist friend need?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man was Mozhan. He unfolded a crumpled piece of paper with a copied formation array that had some mistakes and smudges from corrections.</p><p></p><p>"What formation is this?"</p><p></p><p>The manager glanced at it. "The Bright Fire Formation."</p><p></p><p>"You accept this kind of formation?"</p><p></p><p>The man's tone made the manager uncomfortable. Normally he wouldn't entertain such rudeness, but he felt one should treat customers with courtesy.</p><p></p><p>"Of course we accept it. This is a commonly used formation, even ordinary cultivating families need it, so the demand is high."</p><p></p><p>Mozhan asked, "Was that kid who just left also drawing formations for you?"</p><p></p><p>"We can't disclose such things about our customers. Protecting client privacy is a principle of our business," the manager said.</p><p></p><p>Mozhan's gaze turned sharp like a blade, making the manager's back tingle. After a moment's thought, he realized cultivators shouldn't be too rigid about principles which could be flexibly observed.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that kid, but his elder brother."</p><p></p><p>Mozhan frowned. "Elder brother?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, how could a kid that young draw formation arrays? He's just running errands for his elder brother, who draws the actual arrays."</p><p></p><p>"Did he say that himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course," the manager replied. "Otherwise, why would we do business with a child?"</p><p></p><p>He eyed Mozhan warily. "But I absolutely cannot tell you that child's name or address."</p><p></p><p>Mozhan gave the manager a cold look. As if I, the father, wouldn't know my own son's name and address better than you.</p><p></p><p>However, knowing Mohua wasn't being exploited, Mozhan's attitude softened. He cupped his fist to the manager. "My apologies for the disturbance." </p><p></p><p>Relieved, the manager nodded slightly with a hint of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>As Mozhan's back disappeared through the door, the manager finally exhaled deeply and muttered discontentedly, "He could've at least bought something..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

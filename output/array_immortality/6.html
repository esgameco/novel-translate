        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Moku was thinking for a while inside the house, waiting until Moshan and Liu Ruhua finished talking. He then changed into casual clothes, pretending he knew nothing, and walked out of the house cheerfully. </p><p></p><p>The family of three was eating, and Moshan had already eaten. Moku kept pestering him to share interesting stories about hunting demons.</p><p></p><p>Moshan selectively told some stories, like a one-eyed wolf, a two-headed tiger, a three-legged wild boar. </p><p></p><p>One team killed an adult demon beast but failed to collect the demon pill. They only took some worthless fur and later realized the demon pill had been taken by others. The team leader regretted it so much that he coughed up blood and fainted.</p><p></p><p>Someone else caught an ancient bloodline demonic beast and directly sold it to a major sect for a high price, living without worries about food and clothing from then on. But one day, he disappeared completely...</p><p></p><p>Moku listened with relish, knowing these stories must contain bloodshed, danger and cruelty that his father deliberately omitted.  </p><p></p><p>Parents always hope their children can have a simple and happy childhood without knowing the cruel realities.</p><p></p><p>After the stories, three little heads poked out from outside the door, their dark eyes looking into the house. Seeing Moshan and Liu Ruhua at home, they stood in a row and greeted together: "Uncle Moku, Auntie Liu!"</p><p></p><p>The three kids were surnamed Meng and lived on the same street, their families also making a living by hunting demons.  </p><p></p><p>The Meng elders were acquainted with Moshan and lived nearby, so Moku had played with them since childhood. Their names, in order of birth, were Meng Dafu, Meng Shuangfu, and Meng Xiaofu.</p><p></p><p>The strongest demonic beasts near Tongxian City were tiger species. Naming the kids with the word "fu" (tiger) hoped they would grow up as powerful and mighty as tigers.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the three kids looked like little tigers with their fierce appearances.  </p><p></p><p>Moku was the youngest and sickly at birth. Seeing his delicate features like a porcelain doll, Moshan took a "hua" (painting) from his wife Liu Ruhua's name and named him Moku.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three kids, Liu Ruhua gave each a steamed bun. Though saying no, they couldn't help reaching out and stuffing the buns into their mouths, mumbling "Thank you Auntie Liu!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua's cooking skills were the best on this street, making the three kids envy Moku.</p><p></p><p>Moshan waved, "Go play together, but come back for lunch!"  </p><p></p><p>Moku and the three kids nodded and dashed out.</p><p></p><p>Among the three Meng kids, Dafu was honest, Shuangfu clever, and Xiaofu a chatterbox. All older than Moku, they usually led him in playing.</p><p></p><p>The three, especially Xiaofu, chattered non-stop about dragon dances, fireworks, crowded places, dancing girls...but talked so much they didn't know where to play.</p><p></p><p>Finally they decided to go everywhere adults picked and kids wanted!</p><p></p><p>With the New Year approaching, disciples from sects were on vacation, cultivators making a living outside returned home, making Tongxian City much livelier with denser crowds on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Some qi-cultivators showed off martial arts, sword dances and spear plays. Spiritual cultivators cast flashy but useless spells, amazing the children.</p><p></p><p>Those skilled in machinery made little toys that could run with a bit of spiritual power, like wooden rabbits, dogs, cats and more, dazzling everyone.</p><p></p><p>Dafu, Shuangfu and Xiaofu played excitedly, finding everything novel and exciting, shouting wows. Moku played while observing ways to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed all money-making activities were already taken, and Moku currently lacked the ability for the remaining options.</p><p></p><p>Watching the hardworking performers and hawkers, Moku felt making a living was indeed not easy.</p><p></p><p>Noticing Moku's low spirits, Shuangfu asked, "Moku, do you have something on your mind?"</p><p></p><p>Dafu immediately said, "Did someone bully you? I'll beat them up!"  </p><p></p><p>Xiaofu nodded repeatedly, "Beat them up! Beat them up!"</p><p></p><p>The Meng elders had taught them since young...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel into English:</p><p></p><p>Three children took care of the sickly and frail Moke Hua. Whenever Liu Ruhua cooked something delicious, she would intentionally leave a portion for the three children. </p><p></p><p>The three children were grateful and had a strong sense of righteousness. Whenever someone tried to bully Moke Hua, they would roll up their sleeves without hesitation and rush in to fight the bullies.</p><p></p><p>Moke Hua was recognized as the most intelligent among the scattered cultivators in the neighborhood. Sometimes when the tutors assigned coursework that the children didn't understand, they would come ask Moke Hua. So the few children had a very good relationship.</p><p></p><p>Seeing they looked eager to fight someone, Moke Hua couldn't help feeling amused and said, "No one is bullying me. I'm just thinking about how I can earn some spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Earning spirit stones...</p><p></p><p>The three kids Da Hu, Xiao Hu, and Shuang Hu also became worried, as they didn't know much about it either.</p><p></p><p>They could help with fighting, but had no way to help earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>A thought occurred to Moke Hua, and he asked, "Do you know how array masters earn spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world was vast and boundless. Every day Moke Hua only cultivated and drew array patterns, so the things he was exposed to were limited. He only knew that becoming an array master meant not worrying about food and clothing, but he really didn't know how ordinary array masters, especially low-level apprentices, earned spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The three kids often played around everywhere, so maybe they knew some things Moke Hua didn't.</p><p></p><p>Da Hu thought for a moment, then shook his head and said, "The grading examination for array masters is very difficult. There's not a single first-grade array master in our neighborhood, so I'm not really clear on it..."</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention our neighborhood, there aren't many array masters in the entire Tonxian City. Even fewer have truly passed the grading to become first-grade array masters," said Xiao Hu, shaking his head in wonder. "An uncle from my Meng family's extended relatives studies array patterns day and night, but he failed the grading exam for twenty years and still hasn't become a first-grade array master..."</p><p></p><p>"You misunderstood. Uncle Meng is just an array apprentice. He wanted to take an array master as his mentor to learn array patterns, but when others tested him with questions, he couldn't answer them, so no one accepted him as a disciple," said Shuang Hu, pursing his lips. Then he counted off on his fingers, "Apprentice, ordinary array master, first-grade array master... Uncle Meng wasn't going for grading, only those with some reputation as array masters can go for grading. He's still a million miles away from grading!"</p><p></p><p>Moke Hua asked curiously, "Then how does he make a living?"</p><p></p><p>"I heard he helps merchant companies draw some simple array patterns, and then earns spirit stones. He uses those spirit stones to buy brushes and ink, and then practices array patterns again. When he can't find a master to accept him, he goes back to helping merchant companies draw arrays..."</p><p></p><p>"Merchant companies, huh..."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I heard that even if you can't get graded and become a first-grade array master, as long as you're an ordinary array master helping merchant companies draw arrays, you can still earn quite a few spirit stones and not worry about food and clothing."</p><p></p><p>Shuang Hu said, then asked Moke Hua, "Moke Hua, do you want to become an array master?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah," Moke Hua didn't hide it. "My physical constitution is too weak. I'm afraid I can't become a monster hunter. If a demon beast swipes at me, I might lose half my life. So I need to find a way to make a living. But it's still too early to talk about this now. Let me first see if I can earn some spirit stones. If I can earn some, I'll treat you all to pastries!"</p><p></p><p>The three kids immediately cheered up upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Great, great!"</p><p></p><p>"You're so smart, you'll definitely be able to earn spirit stones and become an array master in the future!"</p><p></p><p>"Pastries, pastries!"</p><p></p><p>For children from ordinary cultivator families, even common street pastries were rarely eaten.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around for a while more, except for not seeing the flirtatious little girls, they had seen everything else. As noon approached, they contentedly went home for lunch.</p><p></p><p>After eating, Moke Hua told his parents he was going out to play. Then he went alone to North Street in Tonxian City.  </p><p></p><p>North Street in Tonxian City was prosperous, while South Street was lively.</p><p></p><p>South Street had many stores and stalls run by small vendors, while North Street had many merchant companies selling all kinds of spirit charms, pills, and artifacts - more formal and higher quality goods, but also more expensive.</p><p></p><p>However, Moke Hua didn't come to buy anything since he didn't have any spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>Moke Hua walked from one end of the street to the other, looking over all the merchant companies. Then he found one that had array patterns hung outside, but had the shabbiest and most dilapidated storefront, with the slowest business, and went inside.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

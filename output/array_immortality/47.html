        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Mohua's meditation technique became quite proficient. After entering meditation, the speed at which his spiritual sense recovered was more than twice as fast as before. Originally, after painting an array, he needed to rest for half an hour, but now he only needed the time to drink two or three cups of tea.</p><p></p><p>However, continuing to comprehend the meditation technique, he almost felt no further improvement.</p><p></p><p>This was probably what Master Zhuang meant - entering meditation requires heart and nature. Over a period of time, if one's heart and nature did not change much, the effect of meditation would not increase either. It required perseverance over many years for the effects of meditation to gradually improve.</p><p></p><p>It was a skill that took time grinding away, not something that could be rushed in a short period.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the meditation technique, Mohua could paint more arrays every day, and the speed of his spiritual sense's growth also increased somewhat.</p><p></p><p>For nearly a month after that, Mohua spent most of his time following Master Zhuang to study array techniques.  </p><p></p><p>Sometimes when Master Zhuang felt lazy, he would give Mohua a few days off.</p><p></p><p>Mohua took the opportunity to go to the Youyuan Vegetarian Restaurant and found Manager Mo. He said he would be following the master to learn array techniques and would no longer have time to paint arrays for the restaurant.</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo was not surprised, only glancing at Mohua and saying, "Weren't those arrays painted by your elder brother?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua scratched his head and laughed awkwardly.  </p><p></p><p>Manager Mo sighed and said to Mohua: "In all my years, I've never seen a child as talented as you. No matter what, study well."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Manager Mo!"</p><p></p><p>Mo paused for a moment, feeling a bit embarrassed, but still said quietly: "In the future, if, ahem...I mean if there's anything you need help with, you'll help me out if you can, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Manager Mo. With our friendship, these things are easy to say." Mohua patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>Mo laughed, saying "You don't lack confidence." But his expression clearly brightened considerably.</p><p></p><p>Mohua thought for a moment, then asked: "Do you know where Instructor Yan went, Manager Mo?"</p><p></p><p>Mo fell silent, then sighed. "That's his private matter related to the sect. I can't tell you. When you grow up in the future, if you still want to know, I'll tell you then."</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded silently.</p><p></p><p>With the three of them - Da Hu and the others - having withdrawn from the sect, they had more free time.</p><p></p><p>When they had nothing to do, they would come find Mohua to play. Sometimes when the restaurant was too busy, they would help out, then eat a piping hot bowl of beef noodles, and Liu Ruhua would even let them take some other food home.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally when Moshan was home, he would guide them in some martial arts and cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation methods for cultivators are divided into two main categories: magic arts and martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Those who cultivate spiritually cultivate magic arts, while those who cultivate physically cultivate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Martial arts methods activate the body's latent potential through spiritual power, allowing the physical body to unleash tremendous force, as well as imbuing it with the attributes of the spiritual power itself for close-quarters combat with enemies.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Fierce Flame Fist that Moshan excelled at - when executing moves, the fist techniques were swift and fierce, with red fire-type spiritual power swirling around the fists, packing quite a punch.</p><p></p><p>Da Hu and the others followed Moshan in body cultivation, their fists dancing vigorously. Mohua watched enviously.  </p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Mohua did not have the talent for body cultivation, unable to learn any of these martial arts methods. Even if he wanted to learn some offensive techniques in the future, he would likely have to take the spiritual cultivation path and learn some magic arts.</p><p></p><p>Magic arts involve using one's spiritual sense to control spiritual power and condense it into spells for long-range attacks without needing close combat.</p><p></p><p>Da Hu and the others studied very diligently. They had almost reached the sixth level of Qi Condensation, and at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, they would enter the Great Black Mountain to become monster hunters.</p><p></p><p>The Great Black Mountain was treacherous, filled with ferocious demonic beasts. If their skills were not refined enough, hunting demons there could mean a life-or-death struggle. So they dared not slack off at all.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant's business was also getting better day by day. As operating time grew longer, they built a good reputation, to the point that some wealthy cultivators from North Street would make the special trip across the entire Immortal City from north to south just to come eat.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Eating a plate of beef and drinking a pot of wine brew. </p><p></p><p>In the entire Tongxian City, this was the only place where one could eat meat by spending just two spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>And in the entire Greater Blackmountain Province, this was the only eatery that served such delicious demonic beast beef.</p><p></p><p>The eatery's business was booming, so Liuruhuan hired two aunties to help as she couldn't handle it alone. The two women were in difficult circumstances, with their husbands disabled from demon hunting and unable to make a living. </p><p></p><p>The lower-class cultivators worked very diligently. The two aunties and Jiang Yun managed the eatery in an orderly fashion.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yun helped out diligently at the eatery. Her life gradually became more comfortable, her husband's health improved to the point he could do simple physical labor, and she became less shy and reserved than before.</p><p></p><p>To thank the Mo couple, Jiang Yun spent time making various pastries as gifts, having learned the skills from her mother.  </p><p></p><p>Her family used to run a pastry shop when she was young, but after going through hardships and losing their assets, they had to close the shop. However, the pastry-making skills were passed down.</p><p></p><p>The ingredients Jiang Yun used were very simple, but the pastries tasted delicious. Liuruhuan asked her to make more to sell at the eatery so she could earn some spirit stones to support her family.</p><p></p><p>In her free time, Liuruhuan also learned to make pastries from Jiang Yun. Some of the pastries Mo Hua gave to the old Daoist were learned from Jiang Yun.</p><p></p><p>Besides that, Jiang Yun also knew how to roast pine nuts.  </p><p></p><p>There were various pine trees outside Tongxian City with abundant pine nuts, but since they couldn't fill one's stomach, no one wanted them.</p><p></p><p>When Jiang Yun went to the mountains to gather wild vegetables, she would bring some pine nuts back and roast them in a wok. The roasted pine nuts were fragrant and crispy. Placed at the eatery, customers would either have them with wine or tea, both delicious options.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the one who loved pine nuts the most was the old Daoist.</p><p></p><p>Once when Mo Hua brought pastries for the old Daoist, she also grabbed a handful of pine nuts for him.  </p><p></p><p>The old Daoist cracked the pine nuts while playing a game of Five Elements Chess with Mo Hua. Listening to the crisp sounds of cracking and smelling the special aroma, the old Daoist seemed very relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Before the chess game finished, the old Daoist had already finished all the pine nuts.  </p><p></p><p>The old Daoist's chess skills, which were not high to begin with, clearly declined further. Although expressionless, Mo Hua could sense a hint of disappointment on his face.</p><p></p><p>As Mo Hua was leaving, she said to the old Daoist: "Grandpa Dao, next time I come, I'll bring more pine nuts for you."</p><p></p><p>The old Daoist nodded.</p><p></p><p>As Mo Hua left, the usually reticent old Daoist reminded her: "Be careful on the road."</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether he was concerned about Mo Hua or the pine nuts.</p><p></p><p>After that, Mo Hua's life gradually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad households in Tongxian City, there was joy and sorrow, sweetness and bitterness. The cultivators all strived to live their lives. Mo Hua was one small light among them, diligently cultivating and studying talisman formations.</p><p></p><p>More than a month passed in this way.  </p><p></p><p>As always, Mo Hua studied talisman formations under Master Zhuang, researching diagrams, practicing drawing formations, and meditating to restore her spiritual sense each day. Her days were as calm as a still pond, without a ripple.</p><p></p><p>However, Mo Hua's spiritual sense and foundations in talisman formations gradually became more stable, and her understanding of formation principles deepened. After studying the formations within the Six Paths Talisman Strokes a few times and practicing them, she could basically master them.</p><p></p><p>On this clear morning, with bright sunshine and fresh mountain winds, Mo Hua went to Master Zhuang's as usual to learn about talisman formations. However, she saw a few unfamiliar cultivators she had never met before standing outside the door.</p><p></p><p>(Thank you for the tip from EndingVoid~)</p><p></p><p>(New characters are being introduced again~)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The group strolled for a while, when Little Tiger suddenly asked, "Where should we go next?" </p><p></p><p>Mo Hua patted the storage bag on his body, "Let's go to North Street first!"</p><p></p><p>When they arrived in front of the Youyuan Zhai on North Street, Mo Hua stepped up onto the front steps, but turned to see his three little friends standing still, not moving. He couldn't help but ask, "Aren't you all coming in?"</p><p></p><p>The three little friends shook their heads in unison:</p><p>"I get dizzy just looking at formation diagrams..."</p><p>"Me too..."</p><p>"I'm destined to never understand formations in this life, I'm not going in either..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua could only say, "Then you all wait here, I'll be out in a bit."</p><p></p><p>The three little friends all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua went inside, and the bell on the eave rang. The clerk, following the sound, saw Mo Hua standing tall with his storage bag slung over his shoulder, and couldn't help but laugh, "It's you again. What, did your elder brother finish painting all the formation diagrams?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua nodded, "Yes."</p><p></p><p>The clerk perked up, "Oh? It's only been five days, that's pretty fast," he said, motioning to Mo Hua, "Let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua took the formation diagrams out of his storage bag and placed them on the counter on tiptoe.</p><p></p><p>The clerk picked up the diagrams, looked them over, and furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua felt a little anxious, "Did I draw them incorrectly?"</p><p></p><p>The clerk pondered for a moment, "Well, they're correct, but this level doesn't seem like the work of an experienced hand. A few are passable, but these few..."</p><p></p><p>The clerk flipped out a few diagrams - Mo Hua saw they were the first few he had drawn.</p><p></p><p>"These few are quite lacking. The brushwork is very clumsy, disjointed, like they were pieced together bit by bit. Are you sure your brother is learning formations from a formation master? This level is quite a bit lower..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua felt a little embarrassed - it was his first time drawing them, and he had already put in his full effort to draw them to this level.</p><p></p><p>"So can these formation diagrams be used?"</p><p></p><p>The clerk tapped his fingers on the counter as he carefully looked them over, and said:</p><p></p><p>"Although the brushwork is lacking, there's nothing fundamentally wrong with the formation diagrams themselves. They can still be used...it's just that the brushwork is poor."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua breathed a sigh of relief, "That's good then."  He added, "Maybe it's because my brother was drawing this formation for the first time, so he wasn't too familiar with it. That's why the beginning was a bit clumsy. But you see, the later diagrams are much better, right?"</p><p></p><p>The clerk looked at the later formation diagrams and slowly nodded, "That's true, these later ones are indeed better. At least they're standard."</p><p></p><p>"Right?" Mo Hua assured him. "Rest assured, my...brother will definitely get better and better at drawing them!"</p><p></p><p>The clerk was amused by Mo Hua's confidence in his brother. "Alright, I'll accept this batch for your sake. But next time, the formation diagrams have to at least reach the level of these later ones. Don't try to pass off those practice diagrams as the real thing."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua nodded repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The clerk put away the diagrams and placed a few spirit stones on the counter.</p><p></p><p>"Eight successful, two failed, so two spirit stones will be deducted as the deposit. The payment is six spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"If your brother wants to keep drawing, the deposit is still ten spirit stones. He already has the blueprint for the Ming Huo Formation Diagram, so I'll just give him ten more sheets of paper and ink here."</p><p></p><p>The clerk handed Mo Hua another storage bag filled with paper and ink.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua put away the paper and ink supplies, then picked up the six spirit stones, unable to contain his excitement.</p><p></p><p>In five days he had earned six spirit stones - that was already comparable to the income of a mid-to-late stage Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua's mother, Liu Ruhua, worked as a kitchen helper at a restaurant, earning only one spirit stone per day. His father, Mo Shan the demon hunter, earned more but his income was unstable. Sometimes he could earn quite a bit, but if he didn't hunt any valuable demons, his earnings would be even lower.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua thanked the clerk, then exited Youyuan Zhai. The three little friends outside were looking at him with eager eyes.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua patted his storage bag and waved his little hand, "Come on, I'll treat you all to some snacks!"</p><p></p><p>The three - Big Tiger and the others - all let out delighted "Wows" and crowded around Mo Hua as they headed to a pastry shop on the street.</p><p></p><p>There were many pastry shops in Tongshen City. The expensive pastries used precious ingredients that Mo Hua and his friends couldn't afford, so they found a street-side shop called...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Wang's Pastry Shop" was also a shop opened by a cultivator in the Qi Refining stage. The shop front was quite simple, and although the ingredients used couldn't be considered premium, they were very affordable. </p><p></p><p>During holidays and festivals, ordinary cultivators would often buy pastries there to satisfy their children's cravings.</p><p></p><p>Wang's Pastry Shop was famous for its Five-Colored Cakes, which were steamed from a mixture of five different colored spirit grains from the cultivation world. They were fragrant, sweet, soft and glutinous. One Five-Colored Cake only cost two shards of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Lower-level cultivators had very low incomes, with many earning less than one whole spirit stone per day. So they could only use shards of spirit stones. One whole spirit stone was divided into ten shards, with ten shards equaling one stone.</p><p></p><p>Shards of spirit stones were not accepted by the Dao Court or sect families, only circulating among lower-level cultivators. Only impoverished Qi Refining cultivators would use these shards worth just a few portions.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua spent two spirit stones to buy ten Five-Colored Cakes. Since he was a child buying a large amount, the shopkeeper kindly gave him two extra cakes.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua took two for himself and planned to save the remaining four to share with his parents when he got home.</p><p></p><p>The four boys each held a piping hot, fragrant and sweet cake as they walked and ate. Xiao Hu's mouth was too hot to close properly, but he kept talking:</p><p></p><p>"These cakes are so delicious. When I earn spirit stones in the future, I'll eat them every day!"</p><p></p><p>Shuang Hu said, "Then you might as well take a female cultivator who can make pastries as your Dao partner, so you can eat them daily."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hu had a revelation, "Ah yes, why didn't I think of that!" But then he became conflicted, "But I already have someone I like, one can't be fickle..."</p><p></p><p>Shuang Hu's eyes widened, "Who do you like?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hu said, "The little girl selling tofu on West Street. I called dibs first, you can't steal her from me!"</p><p></p><p>Shuang Hu scoffed and waved his hand, "Don't worry, her temper is terrible, I wouldn't fight you for her..."</p><p></p><p>As Shuang Hu and Xiao Hu chatted, Da Hu focused on eating his cakes, quickly finishing both in no time and even licking his fingers clean.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua gave him the remaining one of his two cakes.</p><p></p><p>Da Hu smiled shyly but still accepted and ate the cake.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly Shuang Hu asked, "Mo Hua, did you really help that Zhai guy draw formation arrays?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hu's mouth gaped open, "You can even draw formation arrays for others now?"</p><p></p><p>Shuang Hu glared at him, "Otherwise, where do you think the spirit stones for these cakes came from?"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Hu froze while holding the cake, "These cakes were bought with the spirit stones you earned drawing arrays? Incredible, Mo Hua, could you really become a top-grade Array Master in the future?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua said, "It's too early to say that now. Becoming an Array Master is no simple feat. Just keep this between us, don't tell anyone else. When I earn more spirit stones, I'll treat you all to more cakes."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing "cakes", the three quickly nodded. Xiao Hu even vowed, "If I blab about this, I'll never eat desserts again in my life!"</p><p></p><p>After Mo Hua and the others wandered the streets looking at strange and novel items for a while, evening fell and they each returned home.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua gave the remaining cakes to Liu Ruhua. She steamed them in a pot to reheat them before putting them in Mo Hua's bowl. Mo Hua firmly refused at first, but after much back and forth, he ended up eating two while Mo Shan and Liu Ruhua each tasted one.</p><p></p><p>The cakes Liu Ruhua steamed were piping hot and fragrant again. As Mo Hua ate them, he felt they tasted even better than at noon, so he couldn't help asking, "Mother, do you know how to steam pastries?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua smiled, "What's so difficult about that? There's no dish too complicated for me to cook. It's just that many foods require special furnaces forged by Refiners, along with particular formation arrays. We don't have the means for that at home."</p><p></p><p>"Are those furnaces very expensive?"</p><p></p><p>"Furnaces have to be forged by Refiners, so naturally they aren't cheap. But even more expensive are the formation arrays - it's no easy feat to hire an Array Master to draw arrays, especially large ones like for furnaces. So unless you're opening a restaurant, no one would spend that much just to get a furnace..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua nodded, realizing formation arrays had even broader applications in cultivation than he had thought. He didn't know what kind of array was used on cooking furnaces.</p><p></p><p>He made a mental note to study that when he had the chance later.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

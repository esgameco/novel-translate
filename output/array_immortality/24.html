        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>When Moku went to find the fat manager again, he was told that the market situation had changed. </p><p></p><p>The bright fire array and earth fortification array formulas were no longer being accepted by Youan Zhai.</p><p></p><p>Moku looked puzzled and skeptically said, "The bright fire array is used for illumination, the earth fortification array for building houses. Unless no one lives in Tongxian City anymore, how could there be no demand for them?"</p><p></p><p>The fat manager inwardly blamed Moku, as this kid being so smart was not necessarily a good thing - he was not easy to fool. He gave up making excuses, as the more excuses he made, the harder it would be to explain consistently. He waved his hand dismissively:</p><p></p><p>"How would I know? That's just the market situation now, there's nothing I can do about it!"</p><p></p><p>Moku was speechless. He had only saved up half the spirit stones needed to learn the martial arts skills. He could only ask, "Then what array formulas are you accepting?"</p><p></p><p>The fat manager coughed and took out an array diagram with the words 'Metal and Stone Array Diagram' written on the cover.</p><p></p><p>"We're accepting the metal and stone array now, which also contains four array lines, not much different from the earth fortification array."</p><p></p><p>Moku looked at the diagram and asked, "Manager, what is the metal and stone array used for?"</p><p></p><p>The manager said, "It's a bit like the earth fortification array, both used for reinforcing cave dwellings or residences for cultivators, strengthening doors, windows and walls. The difference is one reinforces earth and wood, while the other reinforces metal and stone."</p><p></p><p>Moku frowned slightly, "If its function is similar to the earth fortification array, and no one uses the earth fortification array, then people use the metal and stone array?"</p><p></p><p>The fat manager glared at Moku and said stubbornly, "That's just the market situation, don't ask so many questions, kid!"</p><p></p><p>"So this array also costs three spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>It should have been originally...</p><p></p><p>The fat manager felt a tinge of regret, but still raised the price:</p><p></p><p>"Logically it should also be three spirit stones, but it's a bit scarce recently, so the price has gone up. Drawing one costs four spirit stones now, but we're not accepting many, only five copies every half month."</p><p></p><p>It's scarce, yet he doesn't allow drawing more?</p><p></p><p>Moku felt the fat manager was a bit strange, but this was Youan Zhai's business, so he didn't want to pry too much. As long as he could earn spirit stones, that was fine.</p><p></p><p>If he could successfully draw all of them, he could earn twenty spirit stones every half month, which was quite lucrative.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, deal!"</p><p></p><p>The fat manager breathed a sigh of relief and immediately took out a storage bag from under the counter, as if he had prepared it in advance, and handed it to Moku.</p><p></p><p>Moku accepted the bag, checked that it contained the 'Metal and Stone Array Diagram' and five sheets of paper and ink. He bid farewell to the fat manager.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to reach the door, the fat manager couldn't help but call out to him:</p><p></p><p>"Moku."</p><p></p><p>Moku turned around. The fat manager hesitated, then asked, "Do you think this array is difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Moku thought about it. Since it was also four array lines with similarities to the earth fortification array, it wasn't particularly difficult. He said, "It's alright."</p><p></p><p>Moku took a few steps, then turned back to add, "My brother should be able to draw it."</p><p></p><p>"Oh," the fat manager looked at him with a complex expression and nodded, "Draw it well."</p><p></p><p>"Oh right," the fat manager called out to Moku again, "My surname is Mo, like 'Mo shengqi' meaning don't get angry. Just call me Manager Mo."</p><p></p><p>Moku nodded, "Okay, Manager Mo, I'll remember that."</p><p></p><p>Moku returned to Tongxian Gate and studied the metal and stone array whenever he had time. Since it was similar to the earth fortification array, and he had previously asked Master Yan about how to draw the earth fortification array, understanding this one wasn't too difficult.</p><p></p><p>One day before the array class, Master Yan had the previously graded array assignments handed back. Moku's array diagram only received a "B" grade.</p><p></p><p>Moku looked left and right, then compared it against the sect's 'Detailed Array Explanations', but couldn't find any mistakes. Why did he only get a "B"?</p><p></p><p>Moku was quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The disciple sitting next to him saw the "B" on Moku's diagram and exclaimed, "Wow, you only got a B, Moku."</p><p></p><p>Moku glanced at the "C" on that disciple's diagram without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>That disciple hurriedly covered his "C" grade with his hand, laughed awkwardly, and then curiously asked, "How come you only got a B?"</p><p></p><p>Moku was also puzzled, "I didn't draw anything wrong, I don't know why it's only a B."</p><p></p><p>"You didn't draw it wrong, but the teacher..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"How could you possibly only give me a B grade?" </p><p></p><p>Mohua showed him the array diagram, "Can you see what's wrong with it?"</p><p></p><p>That disciple said defiantly: "If I could see what's wrong, I wouldn't have just gotten a 'C' grade!"</p><p></p><p>The other disciples sitting around also craned their necks to look at Mohua's array diagram, and then said one after another:</p><p></p><p>"It looks fine to me, I don't see any mistakes."</p><p></p><p>"Mohua, did you offend the instructor or something?"</p><p></p><p>"Watch out, the instructor might punish you."  </p><p></p><p>"Instructor Yan doesn't seem like that kind of person though..."</p><p></p><p>Before they could finish speaking, Instructor Yan walked into the cultivation room. The group of disciples hurriedly retracted their necks and sat quietly like quails, not daring to breathe loudly.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan taught the class as usual. After class, he said:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the Way is like rowing a boat against the current - if you don't advance, you'll retreat. The Way of Arrays is the same. You must not slack off and waste your own time and talents."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Instructor Yan sternly scanned the room, finally looking at Mohua and saying: "Mohua, come with me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Mohua respectfully stood up and followed Instructor Yan out of the cultivation room.  </p><p></p><p>Seeing Instructor Yan leave, the disciples in the room huddled their heads together again:</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, Mohua is done for."</p><p></p><p>"The instructor said someone was slacking off, was he talking about Mohua?"</p><p></p><p>"But I slack off too, why didn't the instructor call me out?"</p><p></p><p>"You can't compare to Mohua. His array drawings are so good, the instructor really values him."</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing the instructor doesn't value me, I really don't want him to value me..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua followed behind Instructor Yan, leaving the cultivation room, passing by the Elixir Room and Artifact Forging Room, and finally exiting Tongxuan Peak.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Instructor Yan didn't say a word. Occasionally when other disciples, instructors or sect elders greeted him, he would either nod or return the salute.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan led Mohua all the way to his residence on Tongming Peak. </p><p></p><p>Tongming Peak was where the sect leader, elders, instructors and inner sect disciples lived and cultivated. This was Mohua's first time there - the environment was indeed much more serene and beautiful. Many courtyards had planted spirit flowers and grasses of various colors, and some spirit beasts like peafowl leisurely strolled around.</p><p></p><p>Only on Tongming Peak could these peafowl roam so freely. If they were on Tongxuan Peak, they definitely wouldn't see the sun the next day.</p><p></p><p>Mohua recalled the charred chicken leg that Shuanghu had given him.</p><p></p><p>There were array formations set up outside Instructor Yan's residence, with a small Bagua mirror on the door - this was likely arranged by Instructor Yan himself, as the doors to the other courtyards and residences didn't have them.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan traced a few patterns on the Bagua mirror with his fingers. A flash of light shone and the door opened.</p><p></p><p>After entering, Instructor Yan sat down at the desk and directly asked Mohua:</p><p></p><p>"Do you want to become an Array Master?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua humbly said: "This disciple has limited talents, I'm afraid I can't become an Array Master."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan frowned: "Wanting it is one thing, having the talent for it is another. Don't just look at the results and lose sight of your original intention. All living things under heaven will eventually die - does that mean they shouldn't live at all?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mohua solemnly replied: "This disciple wants to become an Array Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Why do you want that?"</p><p></p><p>"The path of cultivation is difficult, but mastering arrays can provide a way to make a living."</p><p></p><p>"And?"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators seek the Heavenly Way to become immortal. Understanding the Way of Arrays can also lead to comprehending the Heavenly Way."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan frowned: "The Heavenly Way is distant and difficult to perceive. Cultivators may spend their entire lives without glimpsing even a corner of it."</p><p></p><p>Mohua said: "As the instructor says, attaining the Way lies in Heaven, but seeking the Way depends on people. Since cultivators pursue the Heavenly Way, then whether or not they ultimately attain it, they must not lose the heart to seek it."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan was silent for a moment, then nodded slightly. "From now on, come to me here every day after class. You can go back today."</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Mohua didn't understand the reason, but still bowed and took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Watching Mohua depart, Instructor Yan exhaled deeply after a long while:</p><p></p><p>"He's a good seedling."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

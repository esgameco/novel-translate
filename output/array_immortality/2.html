        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Ever since Moku could remember, this stele appeared in his sea of consciousness, along with some vague memories. </p><p></p><p>In those memories, Moku lived a brief life in another world without spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>In that life, Moku's family was ordinary, but he studied hard and did well, getting into university to study art and calligraphy which he enjoyed researching. </p><p></p><p>After graduating, he joined a big company as a designer, working long hours of overtime. He died from overwork in his 20s.</p><p></p><p>As a student he studied, after graduating he worked, spending his whole life in anxiety and stress. </p><p></p><p>When he came to, he realized he had lived a muddled life and died so suddenly.</p><p></p><p>In those final moments, the experiences of his life flashed before his eyes like a panorama.</p><p></p><p>In that life, he had never done anything truly valuable: not being filial to his parents, not pursuing his ideals, having no dreams, no love, never seeing the scenery of the vast world...</p><p></p><p>These memories were hazy, and sometimes Moku couldn't tell if they were real or not.</p><p></p><p>Like Zhuang Zhou's butterfly dream, he didn't know if he was the one who dreamed of being a butterfly, or the butterfly dreaming of being Zhuang Zhou.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, Moku stopped agonizing over it.</p><p></p><p>The past is the past. Now he is only 10 years old, living in the cultivation world as a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>A cultivator who can comprehend the Heavenly Dao, roam the nine provinces, pluck the sun and moon with one hand, and bury the stars with the other!</p><p></p><p>Or he could be a cultivator who spends his whole life refining qi, unable to fly or use martial arts, only knowing a few simple spells, eking out a humble living...</p><p></p><p>Without this stele, Moku estimated he would likely be the latter humble cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The stele hovered in Moku's sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Vast and ancient, strangely broken, the body of the stele seemed empty yet contained an immense and profound aura drifting about. At times it was still as the void, possessing nothing...</p><p></p><p>On the empty surface of the stele, one could draw formation patterns. Each time Moku drew a formation, his spiritual consciousness would increase.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad cultivation paths, formations are supreme!</p><p></p><p>Formations are the most difficult branch to study. The most important thing for learning formations is spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Formations are composed of formation lines, patterns drawn by ancient cultivators after bitter comprehension of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The lines of formations resemble ancient writing yet simple paintings, containing boundless profundities.</p><p></p><p>When drawing formations, one's sea of consciousness connects to the mysteries of the Dao, consuming vast amounts of spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>If a cultivator lacks sufficient spiritual consciousness, they cannot draw formations, otherwise their consciousness may be depleted, even shattering their sea of consciousness and losing their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>To become a formation master requires constantly learning all kinds of formation patterns and tirelessly practicing drawing them.</p><p></p><p>So formations are difficult to learn and practice. Formation masters easily die from spiritual consciousness depletion from forcibly drawing formations.</p><p></p><p>When Moku drew on the stele, it consumed his spiritual consciousness. But when he erased the completed formation, that consciousness instantly returned, replenishing him.</p><p></p><p>From being to non-being, then non-being to being, an analogy for the profundities of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, each formation Moku drew slightly increased his spiritual consciousness, though tiny, it was indeed increasing.</p><p></p><p>As far as Moku knew, there were no cultivation methods for spiritual consciousness in the cultivation world. Increasing it mostly relied on breaking through realms.</p><p></p><p>So even a tiny increase was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>As long as he kept drawing on the stele, Moku could improve his formations while constantly strengthening his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>With powerful spiritual consciousness, Moku could learn more, higher-level, and stronger formations.</p><p></p><p>One day, he could use this to become a powerful formation master.</p><p></p><p>Formation masters are highly esteemed. Even an ordinary, unranked formation master can earn a considerable spirit stone income drawing formations for others.</p><p></p><p>Once a formation master capable of drawing profound formations, he would have the means to continue cultivating rather than remain a mere qi refiner his whole life.</p><p></p><p>Moku silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But becoming a formation master is equally difficult...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Importance.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>Array formations are difficult to learn, and being an array master is an arduous role.</p><p></p><p>Among the cultivation paths set by the Dao Court, the qualifications for becoming an array master are the strictest, even most stringent. </p><p></p><p>Array formations are composed of array patterns. Basic array formations only contain one array pattern. With each additional pattern, the formation ascends one rank and its efficacy increases, but the required spiritual awareness also increases greatly.</p><p></p><p>Being able to draw one to five array patterns qualifies one as an array apprentice.</p><p></p><p>Drawing six to eight patterns allows one to be called an array master, but this kind of array master is merely ordinary, not among the ranks recognized by the Dao Court.</p><p></p><p>Only by drawing nine array patterns and passing the Dao Court's qualification assessment can one become a true first-rank array master.</p><p></p><p>For a Qi Refining cultivator, becoming a first-rank array master is almost like ascending to heaven in one step.  </p><p></p><p>First-rank array masters are essentially esteemed guests of major clans and sects. Even Foundation Establishment cultivators dare not easily offend them. Even without doing anything, they receive a monthly spirit stone allowance from the Dao Court's Celestial Pivot Hall, and countless young beautiful female cultivators will flock to become their companions.</p><p></p><p>Besides the extremely difficult assessment, each province also has a quota for first-rank array masters. Becoming one depends on both effort and destiny.</p><p></p><p>If unlucky, and the province's quota is filled, even with first-rank array master attainments, one cannot get the qualification and can only wait for the next assessment.  </p><p></p><p>Some array masters waste their entire lives taking the assessments over and over.</p><p></p><p>Countless lower-realm cultivators exhaust themselves studying ancient texts until their hair turns white, yet never achieve their lifelong wish of becoming first-rank array masters.</p><p></p><p>The so-called quotas imposed by the Dao Court are usually just excuses predetermined by major clans and sects. They need the first-rank array master title to add luster to their direct lineage disciples, making them stand out as peerless geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Those lower-realm cultivators who pour out their hearts' blood trying to become first-rank array masters are but insignificant dust beneath their feet.</p><p></p><p>It was now night. Mo Hua lay in his disciple quarters, his spiritual awareness submerging into his consciousness sea, incessantly drawing array formations on the Dao Stele.</p><p></p><p>The formation Mo Hua drew was called the Dual Element Array, containing two array patterns, one of the basic formations.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Hua had never successfully drawn this formation before.  </p><p></p><p>Early Qi Refining disciples generally could only learn formations with one array pattern due to insufficient spiritual awareness. Among the outer disciples of Tongxuan Gate, very few could fully grasp even a single pattern.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Hua had long since mastered single patterns, drawing them with ease.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua wanted to learn more difficult formations, so every night he practiced the Dual Element Array with its two patterns on the Dao Stele.</p><p></p><p>After dozens of nights of repeated practice and perseverance, Mo Hua finally succeeded.</p><p></p><p>For array masters studying formations, each pattern is a threshold. Drawing one more pattern means climbing another step.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua being able to draw two patterns meant his spiritual awareness and array attainments were far beyond his peers.</p><p></p><p>Among the early Qi Refining outer disciples of Tongxuan Gate, his array skill should be unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua breathed a sigh of relief. When the morning cock crowed, his spiritual awareness left the consciousness sea and he opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Despite drawing arrays all night, Mo Hua's spiritual awareness remained clear, not feeling fatigued at all, as if he had just had a peaceful sleep.</p><p></p><p>He opened the window, the morning sunlight shining on his fair, pale face.  </p><p></p><p>Outside, the rising sun unveiled a vast expanse of glorious clouds.</p><p></p><p>The ten-year-old Mo Hua took a deep breath, his gaze resolute as he looked at the horizon.</p><p></p><p>As long as he kept practicing arrays and tempering his spiritual awareness, one day he would definitely become a first-rank array master.</p><p></p><p>Then, like the dawn, he would take a major step forward on the path of seeking immortality.</p><p></p><p>No longer just Qi Refining for life!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

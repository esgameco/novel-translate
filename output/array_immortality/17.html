        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor said, "The breathing exercises previously taught by our sect are similar to cultivation methods, which can also cultivate spiritual power. However, they are relatively rudimentary and only suitable for cultivators below the third level of Qi refinement. After the third level of Qi refinement, one must choose a proper cultivation method to learn. Of course, one can continue using the breathing exercises, but the cultivation will be much slower..."</p><p></p><p>"This is the catalog of cultivation methods provided for outer sect disciples. The catalog lists the names of the methods, suitable spiritual roots, required spirit stones, rare items needed to break through bottlenecks, as well as the effects of the methods. You can take a look yourselves first."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor handed out the catalog, and every disciple, including Moxihua, received a copy. </p><p></p><p>The catalog was thin, only around ten pages, but it densely recorded about a few dozen cultivation methods and related matters.</p><p></p><p>"You can ask me if you have any questions," said Strict Instructor.</p><p></p><p>The disciples remained quiet for a moment, then a disciple raised his hand and asked, "Master, do cultivation methods also have attributes and grades like spiritual roots?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor glanced at that disciple indifferently and said, "You've reached the third level of Qi refinement yet still asking such a simple question. It seems you haven't been listening attentively to Senior Instructor Zhou's lessons. Go copy the 'Beginner's Guide to Cultivation' once, and hand it to me in three days."</p><p></p><p>That disciple was struck dumb for a moment, then could only lower his head and say, "Yes." But he regretted it immensely in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He had been careless, forgetting that it was not Senior Instructor Zhou teaching the class now, and had asked whatever came to mind...</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor surveyed the disciples and said gravely, "Senior Instructor Zhou is old and has a good temper, so he doesn't strictly discipline you all. You may not have been listening attentively in his classes. But choosing a cultivation method is of utmost importance, so I will explain it again to you all. Listen carefully and don't find it tedious."</p><p></p><p>The disciples all sat upright, giving their full attention.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators' spiritual roots have both attributes and grades, and cultivation methods are classified similarly."</p><p></p><p>"The attributes of spiritual roots are mainly the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. Some have single elements, some have mixed elements, and some have the complete five minor elements or five major elements. Apart from the five elements, there are also some special spiritual roots derived from the transformation of the five elements, such as ice, thunder, wind, and yin-yang spiritual roots. These spiritual roots are quite rare and not commonly encountered."  </p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, spiritual roots are graded from low to high into nine levels: lower lower, lower middle, lower upper, middle lower...all the way up to upper upper grade. There is a significant gap between each grade. The higher the spiritual root grade, the better the cultivator's aptitude, and the higher the limit of spiritual power their spiritual sea can contain."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation methods are also classified by attribute and into nine grades, similar to spiritual roots. When choosing a method, you should match it to your spiritual root - select a method of the same attribute as your spiritual root; and ideally, a method of the same grade as your spiritual root."</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator's spiritual root attribute determines the qualities of their spiritual power. The rarer the attribute, the more special the cultivator's spiritual power. The spiritual root grade determines the cultivator's aptitude for the path - the higher the grade, the greater the cultivator's innate talent."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"So are rarer spiritual roots always better?" a disciple asked timidly.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. For disciples from major sects or clans with inherited legacies, it is good. But for ordinary cultivators, the rarer the spiritual root, the fewer cultivation methods they can choose from. Some may not even find a suitable method to learn, which is not ideal," Strict Instructor explained.</p><p></p><p>"What if the cultivation method's attribute doesn't match the spiritual root's attribute?" another disciple asked.</p><p></p><p>"Then you simply cannot cultivate it," said Strict Instructor. "A cultivator with a metal-water spiritual root absolutely cannot learn an earth-wood cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"Are there no exceptions?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor raised his brows slightly and said, "At least there are no records of such exceptions in the past two thousand years of cultivation texts in our sect. If you encounter one, you can inform me so I can learn something new."</p><p></p><p>That disciple shrank back and stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>"Instructor, must a cultivation method's grade also match the spiritual root's grade?" yet another disciple asked.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor said, "A high-grade spiritual root can cultivate a low-grade method, but a low-grade spiritual root cannot cultivate a high-grade method."</p><p></p><p>A disciple asked doubtfully, "If one has a high spiritual root grade, why would they choose a low-grade cultivation method? Wouldn't the spiritual power cultivated be less?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor said, "The higher the grade of a cultivation method, the more spirit stones are required for cultivation, and the rarer and more precious the materials needed to break through bottlenecks. Some of those rare materials are simply unavailable to most..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This is not something an ordinary cultivator's background can afford. Don't choose high-grade cultivation methods. If you cultivate halfway through and then realize you can't cultivate it at all, it will be too late for regrets."</p><p></p><p>"What if one has a low spiritual root grade but learns a high-grade cultivation method?" another disciple asked.</p><p></p><p>According to the Records of Cultivation Methods, if the grade of the cultivation method exceeds one's spiritual root, most cultivators who practice it will suffer damage to their qi sea from absorbing too much spiritual energy. Severe cases lead to the collapse of the qi sea, complete loss of cultivation, or even demonic deviation and destruction of the path," the strict instructor said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"You mean some don't deviate into demonic ways?" A disciple's eyes lit up as he asked.</p><p></p><p>The strict instructor gave him a meaningful look: "Don't always think you're the most special one, that others will have problems but you'll be fine if you try. Some may have fortuitous circumstances for cultivation, but don't stake your life on such vague luck and seek your own death."</p><p></p><p>Many of the seated disciples had harbored such thoughts before, and now felt a chill, not daring to entertain other ideas.</p><p></p><p>The instructor continued: "These are not isolated cases, but hard-earned lessons from over twenty thousand years of cultivation history. If you don't learn from predecessors' experiences, it's easy to make mistakes. Once cultivators stray from the right path, they often can't control themselves. Some can turn back, others never can."</p><p></p><p>The instructor sighed, his expression somewhat dejected. Moku felt he seemed preoccupied.</p><p></p><p>But the instructor didn't say more, only pointing to the Catalogue of Outer Qi Refining Methods of the Tong Xian School, saying: "Based on what I just said, find a suitable one for yourselves in here. Remember, in cultivation don't aim too high. What's suitable is best."</p><p></p><p>The disciples then lowered their heads and flipped through the catalogue.</p><p></p><p>Moku understood the gist and began looking for methods. His spiritual root was in the middle-lower grade, so he could only cultivate middle-lower grade methods. But he was curious what higher grade methods were like.</p><p></p><p>Moku flipped to the end of the catalogue and looked at some higher grade methods:</p><p></p><p>The Abstruse Yellow Inscription: Upper-lower grade, suitable for earth spiritual roots. Can cultivate 120 cycles of spiritual energy. Requires at least 5,000 spirit stones to complete the Qi Refining stage. Needs rare materials: yellow grass, bitter water root, celestial rock...</p><p></p><p>The Soft Water Inscription: Upper-lower grade, suitable for water spiritual roots. Can cultivate 130 cycles of spiritual energy. Requires at least 5,200 spirit stones to complete Qi Refining stage. Needs rare materials: century-old rootless water, silver snake blood...</p><p></p><p>The Five Phase Qi Absorption Skill: Upper-lower grade, suitable for metal, wood, water, fire, earth spiritual roots. Can cultivate 150 cycles of spiritual energy. Requires at least 6,000 spirit stones to complete Qi Refining stage. Needs rare materials: primordial metal stone, molten fire stone, century-old earth...</p><p></p><p>Moku was amazed at what he saw.</p><p></p><p>"To complete just the Qi Refining stage requires at least 5,000 to 6,000 spirit stones, and that's just for refining stones, not counting supplementary materials for breakthroughs. Some rare materials could cost more than just 5,000 or 6,000 spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>It took Moku a month of hard work to earn just 50 spirit stones. The consumption of 5,000 stones made his head spin.</p><p></p><p>He had also heard that even cultivators with higher spiritual roots generally couldn't practice higher grade methods on their own.</p><p></p><p>If one insisted, there were usually two options:</p><p></p><p>One was to join a major sect, take an elder as master, and enter the inner sect, binding oneself to the sect for life without leaving.</p><p></p><p>Two was to marry into a cultivator family who would support your cultivation, but you'd have to discard your surname, parents, origins and past entirely. You'd have prospects but no longer be yourself...</p><p></p><p>Either way, it meant depending on others. You could cultivate but would not be free.</p><p></p><p>No wonder cultivators often say: "First destiny, second luck, third geomancy."</p><p></p><p>A cultivator's destiny is set first by their spiritual root, then by their background.</p><p></p><p>To defy Heaven and change destiny is no easy feat...</p><p></p><p>Moku let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

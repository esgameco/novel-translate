        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Mozhan didn't know why Jiqingbai suddenly asked this, but he nodded and said, "Big brother Jiqing is right, my disciple is cultivating at the Tongxian Sect, and his current cultivation level is the second layer of Qi Condensation." </p><p></p><p>Jiqingbai found it hard to believe, "The second layer of Qi Condensation, and he can already draw formation diagrams?"</p><p></p><p>Mozhan said, "It probably doesn't go that far, he has just learned some superficial knowledge at the sect and can draw a few strokes by imitating examples."</p><p></p><p>"Little brother Mozhan is being modest. Just those few strokes he drew earlier looked proper and showed that this child Mozhua has talent."</p><p></p><p>Mozhan smiled, "If that's really the case, then I'll take your auspicious words, big brother."</p><p></p><p>Jiqingbai sighed, "Among the younger generation of us demon hunters, let alone formation masters, there are hardly any who have basic knowledge of formations and can draw a few formation lines. Earlier this year when I needed a formation master to draw some formations for me, I had to swallow my pride, put on a smiling face for him, afraid of offending him."</p><p></p><p>The more Jiqingbai thought about it, the angrier he became, "It was just drawing a small formation diagram, but not only did he ask for an outrageous fee of two hundred spirit stones, he also wanted me to let my niece accompany him for a meal and serve him drinks. If we were in the Black Mountain Range, I would have hacked him to death with my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Mozhan's expression also turned grim, "He was really that unreasonable?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, but what could I do?" Jiqingbai sighed again. "We don't know formation techniques, and the younger generation doesn't study them either. Whenever we need them, we can only lower our heads and beg those clan formation masters. They act so arrogant while we have to put on a smiling face."</p><p></p><p>"Little brother Mozhan," Jiqingbai looked at Mozhan solemnly, "If this child Mozhua is truly willing to learn formation techniques, you must let him continue studying. If there are any difficulties, just come find me - as long as I can help, I will do my utmost!"</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Jiqing, you are too kind!" Mozhan said with a serious expression. "If Mozhua really wants to learn, I will definitely let him continue his studies."</p><p></p><p>Jiqingbai nodded in acknowledgment. </p><p></p><p>The two chatted for a while more about demon hunting matters before Jiqingbai took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Mozhan saw Jiqingbai and his son off at the gate. After they left, Jiqingbai took his son to stay at a senior's place on the west side of South Street.</p><p></p><p>On the way, Jiqingbai instructed his son Jili, "The demon hunting situation in our Qingxuan City is getting tougher, so this time I've come to find your Uncle Mozhan to go explore the inner regions of the Black Mountain Range together. Your talents are decent and you've reached the seventh layer of Qi Condensation, so you can come along to broaden your horizons. But when it comes to demon hunting, let your uncle and I handle it - don't get involved unless absolutely necessary."</p><p></p><p>Jili replied, "Yes father, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"I know you understand, but you're still young and don't fully comprehend. Demonic beasts are vicious and cunning. Your cultivation is the lowest, so it's fine if you don't take action. But if you do and reveal any openings, you'll suffer a huge loss."</p><p></p><p>Jili nodded, then asked curiously, "Father, is Uncle Mozhan's cultivation formidable?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it is. In all these years, your Uncle Mozhan is the most talented demon hunter I've seen. He has great aptitude, quick reflexes, and rich experience in demon hunting. It's just a pity that as wandering cultivators who have settled down and had children, all the spirit stones we've saved up go towards our children's cultivation instead of our own..."</p><p></p><p>Jiqingbai sighed and continued, "Otherwise, with his gifts, if he kept cultivating single-mindedly, he could have reached the Foundation Establishment realm."</p><p></p><p>Jili fell silent for a moment. His father's cultivation could have progressed further too, but the spirit stones he earned later were all spent on Jili's cultivation instead.</p><p></p><p>Mentioning the Foundation Establishment realm, Jili asked in a low voice, "Grandpa Zheng's health..."</p><p></p><p>"Is failing," Jiqingbai's expression turned desolate. "Uncle Zheng is the only Foundation Establishment elder in our Qingxuan City's demon hunting community. If the old master passes away, us Qi Condensation wandering cultivators will probably be bullied by those few clans again. Our future days will only get tougher..."</p><p></p><p>"Does Tongxuan City have Foundation Establishment elders?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, surnamed Yu. He has a bad temper but also protects his own. The entire demon hunting community of Tongxuan City relies on him to maintain face, so those few clans don't dare go too far. If it really becomes unbearable in the future, you..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"We'll go to Tongxian City and find a Daoist companion. I can settle down there, which would put my mind at ease."</p><p></p><p>Ji Li blushed a little, "Father, it's too early to talk about that." </p><p></p><p>Ji Qingbai smiled, "It's not too early, these things require early planning."</p><p></p><p>Ji Li tried to change the subject, "Uncle Mo's younger brother, Mo Hua, can he really become an array master?"</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say," Ji Qingbai frowned slightly, "It's not easy to become an array master. One must go from being an apprentice, to an unranked array master, before finally being ranked as a first-rank array master."</p><p></p><p>"First, just becoming an apprentice is difficult. As wandering cultivators without lineage, to learn array arts we must find a dedicated array master as a teacher." Ji Qingbai explained.</p><p></p><p>"Don't the sects also teach array arts?" Ji Li asked.  </p><p></p><p>"That's just the basics," Ji Qingbai said, "The sects only teach enough for you to know array arts exist, not enough to actually become an array master."</p><p></p><p>Ji Li was amazed. He had found learning arrays at the sect deathly difficult, yet that was just the basics.</p><p></p><p>"Finding an array master as a teacher is no easy feat. Those array masters are so arrogant, their standards are higher than the heavens. To ask them to take an apprentice, you'd have to stake your entire family's assets and it still may not be enough."</p><p></p><p>Ji Qingbai got angry just thinking about it, "Array arts are so difficult. Without lineage or a teacher's guidance, how can one possibly master them?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>Ji Li asked, "So once you become an apprentice, you can be an array master?"</p><p></p><p>"Being an apprentice is just the start. You must endure many years, constantly studying and practicing to slowly raise your skill. Only then can you become an unranked array master. After that, you must endure further to gain some renown and qualify for an official ranking. The ranking is conducted by the Dao Ministry itself, another huge hurdle...Some array masters never get ranked their entire lives."</p><p></p><p>Ji Li was overwhelmed listening to this, "So can little brother Mo Hua really become an array master?"</p><p></p><p>"One can hope," Ji Qingbai sighed, "Even if it's just a delusional dream, at least it's something to look forward to."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua returned to drawing the Bright Fire Array. A few days later, he completed drawing all the arrays - this time he was much more skilled, successfully drawing 9 out of 10 arrays to earn 8 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>On the last day before New Year's Eve, Mo Hua went to the You Yuan Vegetarian restaurant to exchange the arrays for spirit stones with the fat manager.</p><p></p><p>The fat manager looked over the arrays Mo Hua submitted and was quite satisfied.  </p><p></p><p>"This is more like it! Now that you've taken a master and become an apprentice, you should be at this level!"</p><p></p><p>When settling the payment, the fat manager gave Mo Hua 10 spirit stones, with 2 extra as a New Year's gift, "It's not much, but it'll add some festivity!"</p><p></p><p>While not much for the fat manager, it was quite a lot for Mo Hua.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was delighted and said some auspicious well-wishes like "Wishing the manager's business booming and ever greater prosperity!"</p><p></p><p>The fat manager happily nodded along.</p><p></p><p>The next day was New Year's Eve, and Mo Hua's family of three celebrated joyfully.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation realm's New Year customs were quite similar yet different from Mo Hua's memories of his previous world.</p><p></p><p>For example, while they hung spring couplets, the characters on them would glow. The clouds on the "fu" character would float, and the qilin auspicious beasts in the New Year paintings would stare at you with big eyes, sometimes even snorting disdainfully - very novel.</p><p></p><p>The New Year's Eve feast was the most sumptuous of the year, with a bit of meat and delicacies they couldn't normally eat.  </p><p></p><p>Mo Hua had a wonderful New Year's celebration. After playing with friends for a few days, he resumed drawing arrays for You Yuan Vegetarian.</p><p></p><p>Through tireless effort day and night, Mo Hua could draw the Bright Fire Array blindfolded. Drawing 10 arrays only took 3 days with a 90% success rate.  </p><p></p><p>This continued until the 15th day of the first month, the day before entering Tongxian Sect to begin cultivation. By then, Mo Hua had earned nearly 50 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>That evening after dinner, Mo Hua packed his belongings to enter the sect the next day, while Mo Shan and Liu Ruhua discussed his departure.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let me focus on the task at hand first..."</p><p></p><p>Moku thought to himself, then obediently started browsing through the mediocre cultivation methods. </p><p></p><p>The 'Minor Five Phases Manual': A lower-mediocre cultivation method suitable for those with spiritual roots of the five phases. It can cultivate spiritual power up to the 70th celestial cycle. To complete the Qi Refinement stage, at least 1,000 spirit stones need to be refined, requiring rare materials like century-old earth.</p><p></p><p>The 'Rejuvenation Manual': A lower-mediocre cultivation method suitable for those with wood spiritual roots. It can cultivate spiritual power up to the 75th celestial cycle. To complete Qi Refinement, at least 1,100 spirit stones need to be refined, requiring rare materials like evergreen wood or evergreen leaves over 10 years old.</p><p></p><p>The 'Hundred Flames Manual': A lower-mediocre cultivation method suitable for those with fire spiritual roots. It can cultivate spiritual power up to the 60th celestial cycle. To complete Qi Refinement, at least 900 spirit stones need to be refined, requiring rare materials like molten fire stones.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The lower-tier mediocre cultivation methods still required a considerable amount of spirit stones, but it was much better compared to top-tier methods.</p><p></p><p>However, there were pros and cons. The lower-mediocre methods consumed fewer spirit stones but also cultivated less spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>With Moku's lower-mediocre spiritual root cultivating a lower-mediocre method, his spiritual power at the same realm would only be a little over half of a cultivator with a lower-top-tier spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the lower top-tier. The spiritual power cultivated from mid and high top-tier methods would undoubtedly be even more substantial. As the cultivation level increased, the gap in spiritual power from spiritual root differences would become vaster.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, one's spiritual root was innate and unchangeable.</p><p></p><p>"It seems some people are just favored by the heavens from birth..."</p><p></p><p>Moku shook his head, but since spiritual roots couldn't be changed, there was no point dwelling on it.</p><p></p><p>Moku flipped to the last page of the 'Cultivation Method Catalog' and saw a line of small text at the bottom that left him completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation method inheritance fee...what is that?"</p><p></p><p>Moku read the explanation below:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods of our Sect were painstakingly collected, researched, and refined by past Sect Leaders and Elders over generations, embodying the hard work and wisdom of our predecessors.</p><p></p><p>Disciples must pay a certain number of spirit stones to be qualified to inherit these methods.</p><p></p><p>Below listed the specific inheritance fees.</p><p></p><p>For lower-top-tier methods, the inheritance fee was 1,100 spirit stones. Since top-tier spiritual roots were rare, there was a discount to 998 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance fees for mediocre methods were slightly lower, and even lower for lower-mediocre methods, but still required 200 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Moku was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>Why was there an inheritance fee?</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of this before.</p><p></p><p>How could the Sect charge fees so arbitrarily? Wasn't this too shady?!</p><p></p><p>With only 8 spirit stones to his name, Moku could only sigh helplessly.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation world was really too grounded in reality...</p><p></p><p>"After you all have chosen your methods, pay the inheritance fees, and the Sect will pass those methods down to you. Cultivation methods are of utmost importance, so it's best to discuss with your parents and elders before deciding. Don't be overly ambitious nor short-sighted, lest you miss your future in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After Instructor Yan finished speaking, he left. From his expression, he didn't seem too pleased about this either.</p><p></p><p>After the instructor left, the disciples started discussing animatedly in small groups. Some looked excited, others worried, and the room quickly became noisy:</p><p></p><p>"Inheritance fee? Never heard of that before..."</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, if the Sect charges it, can we not pay?"</p><p></p><p>"The 'Heaven and Earth Mystery Manual' has an inheritance fee of over 1,000 spirit stones, tsk tsk..."</p><p></p><p>"If you really learn that, you might as well sell yourself to the Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Thanks, my spiritual root isn't even qualified for that."</p><p></p><p>"My parents both have mediocre spiritual roots, why do I only have a lower spiritual root? There's basically no method I can choose..."</p><p></p><p>"You should read the 'Discourse on Spiritual Root Evolution', then you'll understand why mediocre spiritual root parents can give birth to a lower spiritual root child..."</p><p></p><p>"Say, do we really have any top-tier spiritual roots here?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I have a distant cousin who has a top-tier root. But his dad gambles and his mom is lazy, so their family is dirt poor. He could only choose a lower-mediocre method, what a waste of a good spiritual root, it's really tragic..."</p><p></p><p>"Then even if I had a top-tier root, I still couldn't cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>"You could marry into another family..."</p><p></p><p>"No way!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The disciples debated noisily while Moku pondered with his little chin resting on his hand.</p><p></p><p>This Sect inheritance fee was beyond his expectations. </p><p></p><p>There were methods in the 'Cultivation Method Catalog' that Moku could choose from, but his parents had just managed to gather enough for his tuition fees. In the short term, they couldn't afford to pay so many spirit stones. Even if they borrowed from others, it would place a heavy burden on the family.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I can't choose a method for now. I'll have to make do with the 'Breathing Technique' first. Once I've saved up enough spirit stones from painting talismans, I'll choose a method from above to cultivate. After all, I've only just entered the third level of Qi Refinement, there's still some time before I break through to the fourth level."</p><p></p><p>Moku tossed the 'Cultivation Method Catalog' into his storage ring, feeling rather helpless inside.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The spirit bag, he had no plans to bring it back to show his parents anytime soon. His top priority was to draw formation arrays and earn spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>Moxhua's days continued just like before - diligently cultivating, attending classes, and drawing formation arrays in his free time during the day.</p><p></p><p>Life in the sect was monotonous yet peaceful. </p><p></p><p>Tongling Peak had beautiful scenery, lush green trees providing shade, with a light mist hanging over it. Birds often flew back and forth, and floral fragrances wafted through the air.</p><p></p><p>After classes, outer sect disciples would often play in the mountains. The female disciples, graceful and charming, would admire the flowers in groups. </p><p></p><p>The male disciples chased after spirit beasts all over the mountains. Some cultivators whose feelings were just awakening whispered to each other amidst the streams and flower bushes, while others got into jealous fights.</p><p></p><p>However, none of this concerned Moxhua. He was single-mindedly focused on formation arrays. Apart from eating and attending classes, he spent all his time studying formations. Even when sleeping at night, he practiced drawing formation symbols on stone steles.</p><p></p><p>Among his familiar fellow disciples, Daxhu had reached the fifth level of qi refinement, while Shuangxhu and Xiaoxhu had long since reached the fourth level and were cultivating at Tongxuan Peak. Although the two peaks were not far apart, they knew Moxhua was dedicated to studying formations and generally did not disturb him unless necessary.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua had an obedient and intelligent looking face, appearing harmless, and treated others kindly. He had a decent reputation at Tongling Peak, so no one thought to bully him.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Moxhua excelled at formations and was highly regarded by the strict instructor. If anyone tried to bully him and the instructor found out, the consequences would be severe. The strict instructor hated it most when disciples caused trouble instead of focusing on cultivation. Once the instructor knew, the punishment was extremely harsh.</p><p></p><p>Besides, Daxhu and the others had always looked out for Moxhua. Being large in stature and following the body cultivation path to become demon hunters in the future, they often found ways to spar and fight on regular days. If anything happened to Moxhua, they would quickly come running over from Tongxuan Peak with their sleeves rolled up.</p><p></p><p>The only time Moxhua interacted with other disciples was when he returned the ten spirit stones he had borrowed from An Xiaopang before the new year.</p><p></p><p>When Moxhua gave the spirit stones back to An Xiaopang, he was dazed, clearly having forgotten about it. It took him a while to recall.</p><p></p><p>The An family was a major clan in Tongxian City, so he may not have cared much about those ten spirit stones, or it could have simply been his poor memory.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, An Xiaopang's expression became rather complex as he said, "In all these years, you're the first person who borrowed spirit stones and actually remembered to return them to me."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua felt pity, realizing this must be the foolish son of a wealthy family.</p><p></p><p>Some people may have forgotten to return the borrowed spirit stones, while others intentionally kept them. Since he didn't lack spirit stones, he got used to it over time.</p><p></p><p>"You're so...kind-hearted, be careful others don't take advantage of you," Moxhua gently patted An Xiaopang's shoulder with a tactful remark, having changed the word "foolish" midway.</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang's expression became even more complex, even a hint of being moved:</p><p>"Little Brother Moxhua, everyone says I'm stupid, but you're the only one who knows I'm just kind-hearted. Of all the disciples I've met, you're the smartest - no wonder you're so good at drawing formations!"</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Moxhua didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>After over a month, the sect had a periodic break and two days off were given.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua left the sect and went to the Youyuan Vegetarian Restaurant on North Street to hand in the Bright Fire Formation he had drawn to Manager Wang. Then he asked, "Do you have any formation arrays slightly more difficult than the Bright Fire Formation that can earn more spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Wang glanced at Moxhua, "Is your elder brother asking you to?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Moxhua nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There is one," Manager Wang lowered his head and flipped through some papers behind the desk before pulling out a formation diagram with several unfamiliar formation symbols.</p><p></p><p>"The Earth Reinforcement Formation can solidify soil and rocks. Cultivators generally use it when constructing houses or caves to reinforce doors and windows. The Earth Reinforcement Formation is a bit more difficult than the Bright Fire Formation. The reward for each completed Earth Reinforcement Formation is two spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Two spirit stones...double that of the Bright Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Can I take a look at the formation instructions first?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Wang gave Moxhua a look. "What's the use for you to look? It's for your brother to see."</p><p></p><p>However, despite saying that, he still handed the instructions over to Moxhua. The basic formation instructions themselves were not too rare, so it was fine to let others take a look.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua flipped through the instructions and found that indeed, there were many formation symbols he had never seen before, which the instructors at the sect had also never taught.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long it would take to learn this formation..."</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the sect's cultivation methods was too expensive. It would take quite a while to save up enough spirit stones from drawing the Bright Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua wanted to draw a new formation, but hesitated. If he didn't draw it well, he could lose spirit stones. If he couldn't learn it, and failed to complete it within the time limit, the formation pavilion would confiscate the entire deposit.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I can't afford to lose the deposit!"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua made up his mind. Even if he didn't learn it within the time limit and lost all twenty spirit stones of the deposit, he could just go back to drawing the Bright Fire Formation to earn them back.</p><p></p><p>To become a formation master, the formations he would have to draw in the future could be much more difficult than this. He couldn't just keep drawing the Bright Fire Formation forever.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

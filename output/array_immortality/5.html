        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan was an eighth level qi refining hunter of demonic beasts. He made a living by hunting and skinning demonic beasts for their materials. It sounded quite formidable, but was actually very arduous and risky work. </p><p></p><p>Most demonic beasts in the cultivation world were far stronger than human cultivators, making them exceptionally difficult to hunt. Generally, to hunt a beast of the same level required a team of 5 to 10 cultivators, and even then success was not guaranteed. Even if the hunt was successful, the more valuable parts of the beast could easily be damaged in battle, fetching far fewer spirit stones. After splitting the meager earnings among the team members, the individual's share was quite paltry.</p><p></p><p>If one was careless and got injured, the medicinal pills for treatment were also quite costly, potentially leading to losses. Once seriously injured, it became very difficult to continue making a living as a hunter.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan was stoutly built and a solitary cultivator. His face was heroic and chiseled. Though not yet middle-aged by cultivator standards, the years of roughing it while hunting beasts had weathered his face with the marks of hardship.</p><p></p><p>After entering, Mo Shan set down his blade and what looked like the pelt of some demonic beast he had carried on his shoulder, finally breathing a sigh of relief.  </p><p></p><p>His outer robe was tattered and stained with blood, some fresh and some dark and dried - likely from the beasts he hunted but also from himself or his companions.</p><p></p><p>This hunt probably did not go very smoothly, Mo Hua guessed silently.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan's brow was furrowed with a heavy expression. Combined with the bloodstains on his clothes, he had an unapproachable, chilling aura.</p><p></p><p>But this ferocity dissipated as soon as he entered home and saw his wife, like a battle-weary soldier removing his heavy, scarred armor upon returning.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan's voice was hoarse from fatigue, but he still spoke gently, "Everything okay at home?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua tidied his belongings while fetching a clean cloth to wipe his face. "Everything is fine at home, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his travel-worn face, she couldn't help adding, "Take better care of yourself out there."</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan smiled, then glanced around the house. "Is Hua'er back yet?"</p><p></p><p>"He just got back yesterday. The sect is also on annual break now, so he's probably still sleeping soundly. Should I wake him? He'll be so excited to know you're home."</p><p></p><p>Noticing the bloodstains and injuries on himself, Mo Shan stopped his wife. "Let him rest a while longer. Cultivation at the sect isn't easy either. I'll take a bath first, apply some medicinal herbs, and change out of these clothes."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua nodded. "Alright, but at least have something to eat first."</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan had rushed all night and was ravenously hungry.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua was an excellent cook. Though the dishes were simple, Mo Shan wolfed them down hungrily.</p><p></p><p>When hunting beasts, he often had to rough it, eating just hard, cold rations and unwilling to consume his spirit-replenishing pills. Now, eating his wife's cooking, all his fatigue seemed to melt away.</p><p></p><p>After eating his fill and drinking a large bowl of fragrant, velvety congee, Mo Shan breathed a long sigh of relief. Noticing the bloodstains, Liu Ruhua asked worriedly, "Were there casualties again this time?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan sighed, "Three injured, Old Chu seriously."</p><p></p><p>He then recounted the hunt:</p><p></p><p>"Our team of eight was tracking a wolf demon over ten feet tall. We had it cornered, slowly depleting its demonic energy to kill it. But then another hunting team passed by - mostly newbies who hadn't seen much blood. Brashly trying to steal our prize, they provoked the beast, who devoured two of them alive..."</p><p></p><p>"Replenishing its blood and energy, the accursed thing went berserk..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I joined forces with Old Chu and we exhausted all our spiritual power before finally killing that wolf demon. But the losses were devastating. Old Chu lost an arm and lost a lot of blood, severely depleting his vital energy. I'm afraid he can no longer make a living as a demon hunter..."</p><p></p><p>Moxuan said bitterly again: "Old Chu has a two-year-old child, and his wife only grows some vegetables to supplement the family income. Now that he's seriously injured, he'll need to spend a large sum of spirit stones for treatment. Even if his injuries heal, the family of three will have no idea how to make a living afterwards."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua also sighed and said, "Previously when our family was in difficult circumstances, although Old Chu wasn't wealthy himself, he still lent us some spirit stones. Our family still has some spirit stones left, why don't we give them to Old Chu first, at least to get his injuries treated."</p><p></p><p>Moxuan nodded, "That wolf demon we killed should fetch around three hundred spirit stones when sold. We can give Old Chu a larger share then, and we can also lend him some more spirit stones to tide him over this time. But..."</p><p></p><p>Moxuan felt somewhat guilty, "Hua'er was supposed to enter the sect for cultivation next year...Originally I thought after killing the wolf demon, we'd have enough to cover the tuition fees. But now with this incident..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua held Moxuan's hand and said, "As long as our family is safe, that's what matters. There are always ways to earn spirit stones. I've saved some from helping out in the tavern kitchen. We can borrow some from others too, it won't delay Hua'er's admission to the sect for cultivation next year."</p><p></p><p>Moxuan silently looked at his wife. The once youthful and charming face now showed some signs of being haggard and careworn. He felt even more guilty.</p><p></p><p>"You should quit that kitchen job. The fire energy there is harmful to the heart, lungs and meridian channels. Next year I'll find some more people to team up with and kill more demons to earn more spirit stones. I won't let you suffer like this anymore."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua smiled slightly with a hint of pride, pointing to the hairpin on her head, "Do you see what this is?"</p><p></p><p>When Moxuan entered, he didn't notice it, but now looking closely, he saw that the hairpin was different from what his wife usually wore.</p><p></p><p>"What is this hairpin?"</p><p></p><p>"Hua'er gave it to me. It's called the Fire-Dispelling Hairpin and can dispel the fire energy from the stove, making my heart, lungs and meridians feel much fresher when I wear it."</p><p></p><p>"Hua'er is really sensible."</p><p></p><p>Moxuan felt both gratified and ashamed, "As the husband, I haven't given you a gift in so many years..."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua smiled, "Hua'er is your son, so his gift is as good as yours."</p><p></p><p>Moxuan laughed wryly, then sighed, "In cultivation, we often talk about fate and destiny. My life's destiny must be to have married a wife like you and to have such a sensible son like Hua'er!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua gave her husband a reproachful look but couldn't help laughing too.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his wife's smile, Moxuan silently made a resolution. After the new year, he would find some demon hunters with higher cultivation levels and try to enter the inner mountain to kill more demons and earn more spirit stones. He absolutely could not let his wife toil like this anymore, and he also had to find a way to secure a good future for their son.</p><p></p><p>In the room, little Mohua overheard everything his parents said and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Without his knowledge, his parents had been enduring such hardships in their cultivation life all this time. Perhaps in any world, the burden borne by parents is far greater than children can imagine.</p><p></p><p>Even as cultivators, they still had to busy themselves for spirit stones and struggle to make a living.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators and ordinary people seem different, yet also seem not so different after all.</p><p></p><p>Mohua pondered, then silently wondered to himself: "Is there any way I can also earn some spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's actually the Molten Fire Formation..." Mohua said.</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Master Chen nodded, seeing that Mohua recognized the formation at a glance, he was somewhat impressed and his tone became more serious: </p><p></p><p>"Little brother Mohua, could you take a look and see if there's an issue with this formation? I don't understand these things at all and can't make anything out."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen had someone wipe away the black ash on the smelting furnace, and Mohua leaned over the furnace opening, carefully examining the Molten Fire Formation patterns etched on the furnace walls.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't completely draw it out yet, from practicing day and night, the formation patterns were deeply ingrained in his mind. After a short while, he pointed to a few spots and told Master Chen:</p><p></p><p>"There is indeed an issue with the formation. These few formation lines are worn out, so the spiritual energy can't be conducted properly, causing the formation to fail."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mohua's logical explanation, Master Chen couldn't help but look at him with new eyes. But then he furrowed his brow again:</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll have to invite a formation master to repair it. Alas, business has not been good lately, I don't know how many spirit stones this will cost..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua asked, "Is it very expensive to have a formation master repair a formation?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course," Master Chen replied. "There aren't many formation masters around. For situations like this that require specialized formation repairs, we have to offer more spirit stones, otherwise no one would be willing to come."</p><p></p><p>Mohua pondered and said, "Why don't I give it a try?"</p><p></p><p>"You?" Master Chen was greatly surprised. "Are you already a formation master?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua waved his hand humbly, "Not quite, I've only learned formation arts from the elders of my sect. But I've studied this particular formation before."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the half person-height, baby-faced Mohua, Master Chen politely declined, "Perhaps we should reconsider. You're just a child, I wouldn't want you to strain yourself."</p><p></p><p>Mohua knew Master Chen still had reservations, so he changed tacts and asked, "Master Chen, the people you invite, they may not actually be true formation masters, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Well..." Master Chen said, "That's true, some are just apprentices, not quite formation masters yet. But when asking others for help, it's only polite to refer to them as formation masters, whether they actually are or not. They're happy to hear it, and things go more smoothly. We don't know much about the details and it's impolite to pry. As long as they can repair the formation, that's enough."</p><p></p><p>"But do they always successfully repair it?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen thought for a moment, "A few times it went very smoothly and they repaired it quickly. But other times they made adjustments for a long while and still couldn't fix it, until someone else came and finally repaired it properly."</p><p></p><p>"Well there you have it, most of those who come are likely just apprentices. Even if their formation skills are higher than mine, they can't be that much higher," Mohua said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Of course, formally trained apprentices should have higher skills than Mohua, but the skills of some apprentices may indeed not surpass his own.</p><p></p><p>Mohua continued, "They come to repair it, and I repair it - it's the same thing. At worst if I can't repair it properly, you can still invite them again."</p><p></p><p>This reasoning...seemed to make some sense...</p><p></p><p>Master Chen was somewhat swayed, but still hesitant. Mohua saw this and added:</p><p></p><p>"Even if you invite a formation master, they may not be able to come right away depending on their availability. Each day of delay means one less day of income for the smelting shop. If it drags on too long, expenses may exceed income."</p><p></p><p>The smelting shop's business was decent but profits were low. Master Chen was unwilling to cut corners, so every penny was hard-earned. Moreover, he had to support the few apprentices' room and board. If work stopped for too long, it would indeed be difficult to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen felt a headache coming on. Finally, he gritted his teeth and said, "Alright little brother, you can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Then he cautiously reminded, "But just try it out, don't force it. Be careful not to damage the formation..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua assured him, "Don't worry, at most I just won't be able to repair it properly."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen felt somewhat reassured, but also not quite reassured.</p><p></p><p>Mohua asked Master Chen to wait, and went back home to retrieve his brush and fire-attuned ink, as well as the Molten Fire Formation diagram. Back at the smelting shop, he first showed Master Chen the diagram.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the formation in the diagram did resemble the one on the furnace, Master Chen felt a bit more at ease - at least it wasn't completely unreliable.</p><p></p><p>This was Mohua's first time drawing a formation on an actual spiritual apparatus, so he was a bit nervous. However, he had practiced the Molten Fire Formation countless times, and once he started drawing, his mind became calm.</p><p></p><p>Repairing a formation was different from drawing a new one - it didn't require expending too much spiritual sense. Since the formation itself was already complete, one only needed to reconnect the damaged formation lines with ink.</p><p></p><p>What was tested was the formation master's eyesight, meticulousness, and familiarity with the formation.</p><p></p><p>Mohua lay beside the furnace, fully focused on drawing the lines.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, Mohua had finished repairing the formation. He then spent another cup of tea's worth of time double checking, and only relaxed once confirming there were no issues.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen had been anxiously watching from the side, worried that Mohua might damage the formation. Seeing this, he hurriedly asked, "Is this...is it repaired now?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua's clothes were stained...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>With a few streaks of ash on his face, he said uncertainly, "It should be fixed now. Shall we try lighting a fire to test it?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen's expression was a bit complicated, but he still worked with a few apprentices to reseal the formation array and set up the smelting furnace properly. Then they embedded spirit stones into the furnace and channeled their spiritual power to ignite it. </p><p></p><p>But no fire started. </p><p></p><p>Mo Hua stood dazed, rubbing his chin. His originally ashy little face was now even dirtier. "Why didn't it light? The formation array should be repaired."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen asked, "Little brother, are you sure there's no problem with the array?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua took out the Molten Fire Formation diagram and carefully compared it again. Then he nodded, "The array is fine."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen felt the smelting furnace with his hand to gauge the temperature, then instructed the few apprentices, "The spiritual power is insufficient. Add a few more spirit stones and throw in a heated branding iron."</p><p></p><p>The disciples did as told, and soon the furnace's temperature gradually rose higher. </p><p></p><p>Not long after, fire suddenly burst out with a "whoosh".</p><p></p><p>Master Chen rejoiced, "Good!"</p><p></p><p>The few disciples also became excited. If the smelting furnace worked, they would have work to do and could learn from their master. So they looked at Mo Hua with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was also delighted. "Let's try smelting a spirit artifact to see if there are any issues."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen casually tossed in a knife and after smelting it for a while, he said with some regret, "There's no major problem using it, just that the fire power is a bit weaker than before, so smelting artifacts may take longer."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was puzzled, "With the same formation array, why would the fire power decrease? Could the array's efficacy diminish after being repaired?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen shook his head. "I've repaired it a few times before, but the fire power didn't drop much."</p><p></p><p>"Then what's the reason?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua frowned, wondering if he hadn't drawn part of the array properly.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen pondered for a moment, then pointed at the ink in Mo Hua's inkstone. "Perhaps it's an issue with the ink? When I had others come repair it before, the ink they used was clearly a deeper color, a fresh red like a burning fire."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua realized - to save money, he had bought the cheapest fire-element ink. It was fine for practicing formations, but when actually drawing on spirit artifacts, the effect would naturally be inferior.</p><p></p><p>"For good array efficacy, you need higher-grade spirit ink."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua made a mental note, then said a bit embarrassedly, "So it must be an issue with the ink. The one I bought was cheap, so its ability to activate spiritual power may not be very good."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen said, "No need to say that. Even though the fire is weaker, at least it works. In the end, I should be thanking you."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen thought for a bit, then gritted his teeth. "As for the stove you wanted, forget about the smelting fee. I'll forge that stove for you for free. Of course, I can't waive the material costs - I've got this whole group of lads to feed after all."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua looked at the spacious yet simple smelting workshop, then at the soot-covered Master Chen and the sweat-drenched, ash-stained apprentices. Knowing how difficult it was for them to earn spirit stones, he said, "Master Chen, just charge me half the smelting fee."</p><p></p><p>But Master Chen shook his head. "No, that won't do. I'd be taking advantage then. Getting others to repair this array would cost at least one or two hundred spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to charge that much."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen became stubborn. "As cultivators, we value integrity. We must keep our word. Since I said I won't take your spirit stones, I absolutely cannot take them!"</p><p></p><p>This stubbornness was a bit excessive...</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua had no choice but to switch tactics. Smiling, he said, "Alright, then how about this? I won't pay the smelting fee. But after the stove is forged, I'll give some spirit stones as compensation for your and everyone's hard work."</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen couldn't quite figure it out at first. The smelting fee and compensation for hard work seemed the same, yet also felt a bit different.</p><p></p><p>"It's like giving friends a little something when they help out," Mo Hua added.</p><p></p><p>"Well...okay then."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen felt that made sense.</p><p></p><p>The few disciples also looked at Mo Hua gratefully. Their families were not well-off, so being able to earn some spirit stones as apprentice workers provided a bit of financial aid. If they couldn't earn stones, their already difficult lives would be even harder.</p><p></p><p>But if they could earn some stones, even just a few more, life became a little easier.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, it's settled then! It's getting late, I should head home for dinner!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua waved goodbye.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen reminded Mo Hua to be careful on the road, and said, "Feel free to come to me for any smelting needs in the future. I'll give you a discount!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the following few days, except for eating meals, Mohua locked himself in the room, drawing the formation diagrams for the Bright Fire Formation. </p><p></p><p>Five days later, Mohua had used up ten sets of materials, but unfortunately only successfully drew eight formations. One was due to carelessness, and one was because of a brushwork mistake he had not noticed before.</p><p></p><p>The Bright Fire Formation was already the simplest and most basic formation in the cultivation world, but Mohua had drawn it so many times and still occasionally made mistakes, some of which were errors he had made before.</p><p></p><p>"Formations are indeed profound and meticulous, one cannot be careless at all!" Mohua inwardly reminded himself.</p><p></p><p>Mohua took the time to hand over the completed formation diagrams to the fat manager of the Youyuan Vegetarian Restaurant. </p><p></p><p>This time the manager was a little more satisfied, feeling that Mohua's elder brother was diligent in attitude, and his brushwork was much more skilled than before. He was also happy to continue cooperating, giving Mohua six spirit stones after handing him another ten sets of materials.</p><p></p><p>Mohua had already earned twelve spirit stones. At this pace, he could make a decent sum before the new year, earning at least six more spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Mohua painted even more attentively, becoming more adept at the Bright Fire Formation. His spiritual awareness also greatly increased. Without exhausting his spiritual awareness, he could complete an entire Bright Fire Formation diagram, greatly reducing the time Mohua spent drawing formations.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, after finishing dinner, Mohua was about to return to his room when he suddenly heard a knock at the door.</p><p></p><p>Moshan got up to open it and saw two people standing outside.</p><p></p><p>One was a young man wearing a clean and tidy Daoist robe. His cultivation level seemed high, and his demeanor was very polite.</p><p></p><p>The other was a middle-aged cultivator with a few shallow scars on his face. His gaze seemed calm, but flickered with sharpness. The spiritual power in his body was clearly much thicker, at least at the 8th or 9th level of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, does a fellow Daoist named Moshan live here?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you looking for my dad?" Mohua asked, tilting his little head.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator's gaze softened as he looked at Mohua. "So you must be Mohua!"</p><p></p><p>Moshan also came out to greet them, cupping his hands in salutation. "Elder Brother Ji!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged cultivator returned the courtesy. "Little Brother Mo, my apologies for disturbing you so late! My son and I came from Black Mountain City, traveling non-stop. This is the time we arrived."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a place to stay?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's the residence of a fellow Daoist from my father's generation. I'll go pay a visit and stay there temporarily. I came to discuss with you the matter you mentioned before..."</p><p></p><p>"Please come in."</p><p></p><p>Moshan ushered them inside. Liuruxia tidied up the table and brewed tea to serve them. Moshan invited the two to be seated, then introduced to Mohua:</p><p></p><p>"This is your Uncle Ji, named Qingbai. Next to him is your Elder Brother Ji, with the courtesy name Li."</p><p></p><p>Mohua saluted formally. "Greetings Uncle Ji, greetings Elder Brother Ji!"</p><p></p><p>Ji Qingbai smiled and nodded slightly. He wanted to compliment Mohua, but looking at the tall and sturdy Moshan with his sword-like brows and starry eyes, then at the delicate and obedient Mohua with fair skin beside him, the phrase "the tiger father has no dog son" didn't seem appropriate to praise them.</p><p></p><p>Generally, when a father is tall and strong, and the son is also robust, then that phrase fits well.</p><p></p><p>But Ji Qingbai was a demon hunter who only knew how to fight and kill demons daily. When it came to praising children, the universal "the tiger father has no dog son" would suffice. Now that phrase didn't apply, and Ji Qingbai was suddenly at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"This child..." Ji Qingbai hesitated for a moment before saying, "Looks really good!"</p><p></p><p>To avoid sounding perfunctory, Ji Qingbai added, "Handsome in appearance, resembling Brother Mo, yet with gentle eyes and a scholarly temperament similar to Sister-in-law. I've never seen such a good-looking child before."</p><p></p><p>Moshan didn't think too much about it, happy as long as Mohua was being praised.</p><p></p><p>Moshan exchanged some pleasantries, then said to Mohua, "Dad and your Uncle Ji need to discuss some matters. You can go back to your room and play."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Mohua saluted Ji Qingbai and returned to his own room.</p><p></p><p>Ji Qingbai was likely also a demon hunter, coming to see his father, probably to discuss...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In order to discuss hunting evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan was tall and sturdy, with excellent body cultivation talents. He had reached the 8th level of qi cultivation and practiced several formidable body cultivation martial arts like the Cracking Golden Claw and Fierce Flame Fist. He also had abundant experience hunting evil spirits. On top of being an upright person, he had quite a reputation among the qi cultivation spirit hunters in Tongxian City.</p><p></p><p>"Ji Qingbai must be coming to discuss going to the inner Black Mountain to hunt evil spirits after the new year..."</p><p></p><p>The inner mountain must be very dangerous...</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua thought to herself with a sigh. These were not things she could concern herself with now. Her cultivation was only at the 2nd level of qi, she couldn't practice body cultivation martial arts, hadn't chosen a cultivation method yet, and didn't know any spells, so she couldn't really help.</p><p></p><p>She should just focus on drawing formation diagrams. </p><p></p><p>Muo Hua took out paper and a brush, poured ink into the inkstone, and focused on drawing the formation diagram, hoping to complete the Full Fire Formation diagram before falling asleep and entering her inner consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Dipping the brush in ink, she drew line after line of the formation pattern with the reddish ink following the movements of her brush tip.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua had the Full Fire Formation completely memorized, so she drew it almost effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>After the time it took to burn through a few incense sticks, the candlelight suddenly flickered and went out, leaving the room in total darkness.</p><p></p><p>Did the candle go bad?</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua put down her brush and, borrowing light from the main hall, picked up the candle and examined it, muttering, "Did I use it for too long?"</p><p></p><p>There was still a long time until the midnight hour, and Muo Hua wanted to draw formation diagrams for a while longer.</p><p></p><p>What should she do?</p><p></p><p>Holding the candle, Muo Hua went to the door and peeked through the crack to see Muo Shan and Ji Qingbai still chatting in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua didn't want to disturb Muo Shan at this time and was about to pull her head back when she heard Muo Shan say, "Hua'er, is something the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Only then did Muo Hua realize she had been discovered. With Muo Shan's 8th level of qi cultivation and Ji Qingbai's even higher level, it was impossible for her peeking through the door to escape their spiritual perception.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua could only say, "Dad, the candle went out."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan waved his hand, "Bring it here and let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua handed the candle over.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan took it, forcefully twisted open the candle base, glanced inside and said, "It's been used for a long time, so the formation pattern inside has faded. Dad will buy you a new one tomorrow, but go to sleep early tonight."</p><p></p><p>"Formation pattern?" Muo Hua's eyes lit up. "Dad, let me see."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan looked slightly puzzled but still handed the candle to Muo Hua.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua took the candle and found the formation pattern on the base looked familiar, very similar to the Full Fire Formation pattern, but clearly more crudely drawn with only two lines.</p><p></p><p>It seemed a simplified Full Fire Formation was used to cut costs.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua was very familiar with the Full Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Dad, wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua ran back to her room, grabbed her brush and ink, and traced over the faded formation pattern on the base. She looked at it, then drew a few more strokes in another spot.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan and Ji Qingbai stayed silent, watching her intently.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Muo Hua finished drawing. "Dad, try it again."</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan took the candle, twisted the base back on, then flicked the small switch on the candle, and the flame lit up again, brightening the room.</p><p></p><p>"It works?" Muo Shan seemed a bit surprised, then stroked Muo Hua's head affectionately. "Not bad, take it back and get some rest early. Don't study too late."</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua responded, "Yes Dad, Uncle Ji, please continue your discussion. I'll go back to my room now." She grabbed the candle and hurried back.</p><p></p><p>Muo Shan said to Ji Qingbai, "Sorry, Elder Ji, let's continue."</p><p></p><p>But Ji Qingbai seemed to not have heard, staring blankly at Muo Hua's retreating back. After a long while, he carefully said, "Muo Hua is only at the 2nd level of qi cultivation, right?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Mò Huà did not practice the Molten Fire Formation, but instead took some spirit stones to Chen's Artifact Forging Shop to find Master Chen.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen was a bit surprised to see Mò Huà, and even more surprised when he heard that Mò Huà really intended to forge a stove.</p><p></p><p>"You really plan to forge a stove?"</p><p></p><p>"Naturally, but just a small one, about four feet tall. The materials don't need to be too expensive, just sturdy and durable."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen nodded, "That's perfect then. If it was a large stove, I might not have enough manpower here. Since this seems to be for your own household use, being neighbors, I'll pick out some affordable but good materials for you, guaranteed to be cost-effective yet durable."</p><p></p><p>Mò Huà said happily, "Thank you Master Chen!"</p><p></p><p>"However," Master Chen looked at Mò Huà, then glanced behind him, puzzled, "Where are your parents? Forging a stove is no small matter, there should be an adult to handle this."</p><p></p><p>Mò Huà patted his chest, "My dad put me in charge, Master Chen, you can just deal with me."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen looked at the little Mò Huà and nodded, "Indeed, a poor family's child has to grow up fast."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he frowned slightly, hesitated, but still said:</p><p></p><p>"Did you bring the deposit? The material cost for the stove is 150 spirit stones. The forging takes 20 days, 5 spirit stones per day, with a forging fee of 100 spirit stones. So the deposit is the material cost, you need to pay 150 spirit stones upfront, and the forging fee can be paid after completion."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have it."</p><p></p><p>Mò Huà took out a heavy storage bag from his robe and opened it - it was full of translucent spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary cultivator's household, this amount of spirit stones was a huge sum, yet this child just carried it in his robe...</p><p></p><p>Master Chen accepted the storage bag with a complex expression, counted out exactly 150 spirit stones, and then took out a spirit contract, writing down the stove materials, costs, and delivery date.</p><p></p><p>A spirit contract is a recognized proof of agreement in the cultivation world. Each one is special, difficult to destroy or forge, serving as evidence for spirit stone transactions between cultivators. In case of disputes, an authoritative cultivator or the Dao Court can be called to judge.</p><p></p><p>There were two copies of the spirit contract. Master Chen signed one, then passed it to Mò Huà.</p><p></p><p>Mò Huà also signed his own name. Each kept one copy as proof for the stove delivery.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen had wanted Mò Huà to sign his father's name, but after thinking it over, he didn't say anything, figuring that since his parents put him in charge, his signature was valid.</p><p></p><p>Under the Heavenly Dao, all beings are equal. Regardless of cultivation level or age, once a spirit contract is signed, it counts.</p><p></p><p>"Mò Huà..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elegant handwriting on the contract, Master Chen realized this child was called "Mò Huà". Looking at his appearance, with red lips, white teeth, and handsome features like a painting, it did suit his name.</p><p></p><p>Having secured a decent business deal to cover half a month's living, Master Chen looked at Mò Huà more and more favorably.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, the spirit contract is signed. Work will begin tomorrow, and I'll make sure to forge it quickly for you. If you're free, you can come watch the progress, or even learn some forging skills - normally I don't let outsiders watch."</p><p></p><p>"Great, thank you Master Chen!"</p><p></p><p>Mò Huà was quite interested in forging, even though he might never succeed in forging an artifact himself. But learning the relevant knowledge would be beneficial. Such practical forging skills were not taught in his sect.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Mò Huà still practiced the Molten Fire Formation diligently, but whenever he had free time, he would run over to the forging shop to check on the stove's progress.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"By the way, let me ask you some questions about forging artifacts."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen did not hold anything back and answered every question. After spending a few days together, he was surprised by Moku's high comprehension in learning, but also regretted Moku's poor physical aptitude for body cultivation. </p><p></p><p>He had seen children born physically weak before, but rarely encountered someone as frail as this, unable to even swing a blacksmith's hammer.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Master Chen really wanted to accept Moku as his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Moku observed the forging process for a few days, firstly to learn some common knowledge about forging, and secondly to check the brushwork and dimensions for the Molten Fire Array he was drawing.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he practiced arrays on paper, where he could make mistakes without consequence and simply use a new sheet. </p><p></p><p>But now he needed to draw it on a furnace. If he made a mistake, he couldn't ask Master Chen to forge a new one...</p><p></p><p>So Moku needed to be very familiar with the furnace's structure and frequently visit the forge to check on the progress.</p><p></p><p>One early morning, after drinking the porridge his mother made, and practicing the array formation, Moku leisurely made his way to Chen's Forge before the sun grew too hot.</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at the usually lively forge, it was strangely quiet today, without the loud calls or clanging of hammers on metal.</p><p></p><p>Moku went to the backyard and saw Master Chen and a few apprentices cleaning up. The forge fire was extinguished, the furnace lid open, with ashes swept on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Master Chen, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Moku, Master Chen apologized, "Little brother, I'm sorry, the forge furnace is broken. The stove you wanted will have to be delayed."</p><p></p><p>"The forge furnace is broken?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen looked gloomy. "This forge furnace is quite old. There were some small issues before that I managed to fix temporarily. But today when we came, we couldn't even light the fire anymore. Sigh..."</p><p></p><p>"Can't it be repaired?" Moku asked.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen shook his head. "Before it was just external components with issues that I could fix. Now it seems to be a problem with the internal array formation, which I can't do anything about. The only option is to invite a master from another forge to take a look. And if we need to call in an array master to repair the formation, that will cost quite a few spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>"Array formation?" Moku's interest was piqued. "Can I take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen looked puzzled. "Look at what?"</p><p></p><p>"Let me examine the array formation."</p><p></p><p>"Why would you want to look at it?" Master Chen asked doubtfully. "Do you understand array formations?"</p><p></p><p>Moku replied, "I've learned some array formations from my master at the sect. Let me take a look, maybe I can help identify if it's an issue with the formation."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen didn't fully believe him, but thought since the furnace was already broken, there was no harm in letting him take a look. "Alright then, I'll have them fully dismantle the forge furnace so you can examine the internal array."</p><p></p><p>He instructed his apprentices, and together they carefully took the furnace apart piece by piece. </p><p></p><p>The forge furnace stood over two people tall, forged from various refined metals and extremely heavy. But the brawny apprentices with decent body cultivation coordinated well, so it wasn't too difficult a task.</p><p></p><p>Moku had enough self-awareness to not even consider offering to help.</p><p></p><p>Once dismantled, they could see the dense array patterns engraved inside the furnace walls, the dark red lines partially obscured by black soot. But Moku could still make out the complete fire-type array formation inscribed within - it was the very Molten Fire Array he had been practicing drawing every day but had yet to complete.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

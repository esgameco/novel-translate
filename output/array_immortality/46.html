        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The contents of the booklet were very simple, containing only a few diagrams for regulating breathing and calming the mind, and a few pages of explanations on the mental techniques - briefly introducing how to regulate and stop the breath, how to enter a meditative state, and how to cast aside distracting thoughts to reach a state of unity between self and environment. </p><p></p><p>After glancing through the few diagrams and lines of text in the booklet, Mozhua hesitated before speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Does it seem too simple?" </p><p></p><p>Mozhua nodded, then asked, "Master, is this just an elementary meditation method?"</p><p></p><p>"No," Master Zhuang denied. "All the insights and practices of the meditation method are contained in this small booklet."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mozhua's puzzled look, Master Zhuang explained further:</p><p></p><p>"The meditation method is simple in its simplicity, yet extremely difficult. Its simplicity lies in the fact that all its key points are clearly laid out in these diagrams and notes. The difficulty, however, lies in the vagueness of the human mind - it's not as if you can enter the meditative state or achieve unity just by wanting to."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua looked pensive, and Master Zhuang continued:</p><p></p><p>"Take for example the myriad desires of this world - we may claim to see through them, but how many can truly let them go? Some principles seem simple - those who understand can grasp them immediately, while those who don't may never understand in their lifetime. And often, those who don't understand think they do."</p><p></p><p>"This meditation method is the same. If you can truly enter the state, cast aside distracting thoughts, then learning it will come quickly. But if your mind is burdened with troubles and distractions, no amount of learning will allow you to master it."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua realized, furrowing his brow. "So if I cannot let go of distracting thoughts, I cannot learn it?"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang smiled slightly. "It's not as difficult as you think. After practicing this meditation method for many years, I've summarized the simplest way to enter the state in just one phrase..."</p><p></p><p>"Let your heart follow its nature, without self-deception."</p><p></p><p>"Let your heart follow its nature, without self-deception..." Mozhua repeated quietly.</p><p></p><p>"All things in this world simply are as they are. Your own thoughts and feelings too - whether restless or calm, violent or dejected, upright or base, no matter how unacceptable, you must accept them as they are, without deceiving yourself."</p><p></p><p>"If you can do these two things, your heart will be like still waters, like a clear mirror. To a greater or lesser degree, you will be able to enter the meditative state."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua seemed to gain some insight and began reading the Meditation Method booklet. After a while, curiosity struck and he asked:  "Master, does reaching the profound levels of this meditation method grant any special abilities?"</p><p></p><p>"No, from beginning to end, the meditation method can only allow you to enter the meditative state and restore your spiritual awareness. Even at the deepest levels, it only allows you to enter that state and regain awareness more quickly. Moreover, the longer you practice, it doesn't necessarily mean you'll get better at it."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua was stunned. "You can actually get worse the more you practice?"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang looked at Mozhua meaningfully. "You are still a child now, with relatively simple experiences, thoughts and distractions. Entering meditation may come more easily. But as you grow older, having seen and experienced more of the world's complexities, your distractions and worldly desires will increase. Trying to enter meditation then will not be so simple."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua understood. But then he thought, with the memories of his previous life, his experiences were not so few after all.</p><p></p><p>Yet on second thought, in his previous life he was only in his twenties, without much profound experience. And in this life, he was just ten years old. The combined years of his two lives still paled compared to Master Zhuang's age and experience. Being called a "child" was not inaccurate.</p><p></p><p>Curious again, Mozhua asked: "How about your meditation practice now compared to before, Master?"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang pondered briefly: "I began memorizing all kinds of array theories and had learned most of the first-level arrays by around ten years old. That's when I started learning this meditation method. I progressed quickly at first, and even into my youth this method only improved. Back then, after drawing an array, I could restore my spiritual awareness in just the time it took to drink a cup of tea through meditation."</p><p></p><p>"In my reckless youth, my mind was unsteady, so I made no further progress in this method. After that, going through many vicissitudes in life, with an unsettled state of mind, I never calmed down enough to practice, and my meditation skills actually regressed."</p><p></p><p>"Now, having let go of many things, I find I can no longer apply this meditation method at all..."</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang sounded somewhat wistful, then snapped out of his reverie, realizing he had unconsciously revealed too much.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He had said too much, seeing that Moku was still listening to the story with relish, so he tapped Moku's forehead and said, "Study well."</p><p></p><p>"Oh," Moku then gathered his thoughts and calmed his mind to slowly study the meditation method. </p><p></p><p>The key point of the meditation method was mainly to cast aside distracting thoughts, clear the mind, and enter a state of forgetting both self and surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Following the methods described in the "Meditation Method", Moku sat in meditation, not considering anything, and slowly entered a state of absorption.</p><p></p><p>After entering the absorbed state, he could indeed feel his whole body relaxing, as if he had shed the shackles of the physical form. His mental state opened up expansively, and the spiritual energy consumed from drawing formation arrays earlier was also slowly recovering at a much faster pace than before.</p><p></p><p>However, Moku's state of absorption was quite shallow. Not even the time it took to drink a cup of tea had passed before his thoughts started wavering and he exited the absorbed state.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang, who had been meditating with his eyes closed, opened his eyes upon seeing this and said:</p><p>"To reach this level of absorption on your first try is not bad. In the future, once you master it, after drawing formation arrays, you only need to meditate and absorb, and it will naturally double your efficiency."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Moku was overjoyed. Previously, he could only practice array formations on the stele in his consciousness sea. His progress in the day was very slow. Now that he had learned meditation, his spiritual energy could recover much faster. Although his foundation was not as strong as those disciples from great clans, through diligence he could make up for his shortcomings, so in the future he may not lag too far behind others.</p><p></p><p>Moku then asked: "Master, I understand the meditation method now, but what is the visualization method you mentioned earlier?"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang leisurely reclined on the bamboo chair and said, "Why don't you guess what the visualization method is used for?"</p><p></p><p>Moku pondered and said, "The meditation method is used to recover spiritual energy, so is the visualization method used to strengthen spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct," Master Zhuang nodded. "In the cultivation world, there are no techniques to cultivate spiritual energy, so ancient cultivators created the visualization method to strengthen spiritual energy through visualization."</p><p></p><p>"Is the visualization method different from cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"The visualization method is a simplified, unstable method to increase spiritual energy, but it is not a true spiritual energy cultivation technique," Master Zhuang explained.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual power can be observed and perceived, it can activate spiritual tools and wield mystical methods, it has meridians to follow. But spiritual energy is different, the consciousness sea has no meridians, there is no path to trace its operation. So there is no stable way to cultivate spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"The only way to rapidly enhance spiritual energy is through observation. Observing patterns, texts or ancient objects imbued with the rules of the Heavenly Dao or powerful spiritual energy can, to a certain extent, allow one to assimilate and gradually strengthen one's spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"However, this visualization method varies from person to person. The effects differ, and the visualization images that can be used for practice are extremely rare, even among great clans and families of the cultivation world. So it is not widely spread in the cultivation world, unable to become a stable practice like techniques."</p><p></p><p>"The visualization method..." Moku murmured.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang hesitated slightly, his expression turning somewhat stern. "Although the visualization method can strengthen spiritual energy, it's best you don't use it. Even if you do, you must remain vigilant and not become overly reliant on it."</p><p></p><p>Moku asked doubtfully, "Is it because my aptitude is insufficient, so I may suffer a backlash?"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang shook his head. "It has nothing to do with aptitude. The visualization images reflect others' spiritual energy and their understanding of the Heavenly Dao. In other words, what is visualized is others' 'Way', or perhaps even the 'Way' of non-humans. If one's spiritual energy becomes immersed in it, the consequences can be terribly dire."</p><p></p><p>Moku's heart was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang waved his hand. "It's too early to tell you these things. You only need to focus on studying array formations. As for visualization images and the like, you may never encounter them in the future."</p><p></p><p>After that, Master Zhuang had Moku practice the meditation method a few more times. As dusk fell, he allowed Moku to leave.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to Oubihai Zijue for the contribution~</p><p></p><p>Also thanks to everyone for your bookmarks, recommendations and follows~ (=^_^=)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

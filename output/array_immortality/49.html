        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the evening, Mozhua went home first and had his mother prepare some food - two steaming bowls of noodles, some braised beef, crisp pickled vegetables, as well as a few plates of snacks and a few jugs of osmanthus wine. </p><p></p><p>He then packed all the food into containers and put them into his carrying bag before heading up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Halfway up the mountain, a boy and a girl, along with a woman wearing a veil, were still standing upright. </p><p></p><p>Mozhua slung his carrying bag over his shoulder, walked up to them and said bluntly:</p><p>"You have disturbed Mr. Zhuang's peace and quiet. You should leave. Mr. Zhuang does not wish to see you."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the two children looked somewhat dejected. The veiled woman then said:</p><p>"Please inform him that old friends have come to visit and discuss an important matter. We must see Mr. Zhuang in person."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua replied: "Mr. Zhuang knows why you have come. Since he does not wish to see you, then he will not see you no matter how long you wait."</p><p></p><p>The boy said resolutely: "As long as I can see Mr. Zhuang, I will wait however long it takes."</p><p></p><p>The girl did not say anything, but her eyes showed no intention of leaving either.</p><p></p><p>Mozhua asked curiously: "What if Mr. Zhuang never agrees to see you? Will you really wait ten years? A hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>The boy remained silent, his neck stiff.</p><p>He's quite handsome and seems intelligent, just a bit too stubborn, Mozhua thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Then what will you eat?"</p><p></p><p>"I have fasting pills."</p><p></p><p>"Eating too many fasting pills will harm your body," said Mozhua.</p><p></p><p>Fasting pills were one type of elixir pill refined by alchemists, made from common ingredients combined with preservative medicines. They were easy to store and had the effects of staving off hunger and replenishing vital energy - an essential pill for cultivators traveling long distances or in extended seclusion. However, long-term consumption would damage a cultivator's vital energy.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for ordinary cultivators who did not take fasting pills, there was another reason - fasting pills were not cheap, so it was not cost-effective to use them to stave off hunger.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph," the boy snorted. "Mind your own business."</p><p></p><p>But he still snuck a glance at the veiled woman beside him.</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman said: "We understand your good intentions, young friend. But on this trip, we must see Mr. Zhuang, otherwise we will not leave."</p><p></p><p>"You can stay here, but no matter how long you wait, you will not see Mr. Zhuang. Given Mr. Zhuang's temperament, the longer you stay, the less inclined he will be to see you," said Mozhua.</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman hesitated for a moment. Although she had never met Mr. Zhuang, she had heard a little about how he conducted himself, and realized the young man before her was likely correct.</p><p></p><p>If Mr. Zhuang did not wish to see them, they could wait until they turned to dried bones and still not get an audience.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her waver slightly, Mozhua continued: "For cultivators, everything is about seizing the right opportunity. Mr. Zhuang not seeing you means the conditions are not ripe. Since the conditions are not right, no matter how persistent you are, it will be in vain."</p><p></p><p>The woman could not help but ask: "Then when will the conditions be right to see the master?"</p><p></p><p>Mozhua replied: "That depends on the master's mood. You should come visit on a clear, sunny day. There is no need to linger. Just perform a courtesy at the gate. If the doors open, it means the master wishes to see you. But if the gates remain tightly shut, it means the conditions are not met and the master does not want to see you. Then you should leave of your own accord."</p><p></p><p>The woman still hesitated: "The lady instructed us that we must let the young master and young miss see Mr. Zhuang. If we leave now..."</p><p></p><p>"If you bitterly wait for ten or eight years, neglecting your cultivation, not resting or eating properly, ruining your vital energy, then even if you do get to see Mr. Zhuang and take him as your master, your foundation will be damaged. How can you hope to glimpse the great Way then? What meaning would that have?" Mozhua questioned.</p><p></p><p>The woman nodded, then suddenly frowned: "We never said we wanted to take Mr. Zhuang as our master. How did you know?"</p><p></p><p>Mozhua thought to himself - you've brought two children of initiation age to visit the master, if not to take him as your master, then what other reason could there be?</p><p></p><p>If it was just a casual visit with an old friend, you wouldn't insist on staying for seven days.</p><p></p><p>However, outwardly Mozhua maintained a calm demeanor and quoted Mr. Zhuang:</p><p></p><p>"As I said, everything is within Mr. Zhuang's expectations. You should leave. When Mr. Zhuang is willing to see you, he will see you naturally."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Mozhua felt the timing was right, so he opened the food container, allowing the fragrance to waft out.</p><p></p><p>"Would you like something to eat?"</p><p></p><p>The girl was fine, but the boy immediately started struggling to stay still. Although he pretended to be composed, his eyes could not help but glance towards the food container.</p><p></p><p>Fasting pills did not taste good, and eating too many would inevitably make one feel unwell. The colors, aromas and flavors could not match the braised meats, snacks and wine in Mozhua's container.</p><p></p><p>The veiled woman saw that the young master and</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The young lady's face was paler than paper, and her lips had no color, as if she had not eaten well in a long time. Thinking that the two children were previously raised in luxury, and wondering when they had endured such hunger and hardship, her heart softened. </p><p></p><p>She had watched the two children grow up. Even though she could not become the master's disciple against the lady's wishes, she would accept punishment from the lady herself. But she could not bear to see the young master and lady suffer.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the young man was right - if they kept taking fasting pills and never rested, enduring the mountain's extreme temperatures, it could ruin their foundation and hinder their future cultivation, which nothing could make up for.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young friend."</p><p></p><p>The woman thanked Moku, then said to the two children: "Young master, young lady, please eat something first. Since the master does not wish to see us, the timing must not be right. We will visit another day."</p><p></p><p>The two children also thanked Moku. They then took out bread and snacks from their food boxes and began eating. Though ravenously hungry, they ate with perfect manners befitting their noble upbringing. </p><p></p><p>The boy tasted the spicy beef and at first noticed an odd smell, but then the fragrance spread as he chewed. He couldn't help asking: "What kind of meat is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Demonic beast meat."</p><p></p><p>The boy's eyes went wide. "We can eat demonic beast meat?!"</p><p></p><p>Moku gave him a look. "You're eating it right now..."</p><p></p><p>"But I heard eating demonic beast meat ruins your inner energies and makes you lose your mind."</p><p></p><p>"This is wild ox demon meat. It only eats plants, so it won't ruin a cultivator's energies. It's the meat-eating, human-devouring demonic beasts you can't eat."</p><p></p><p>Moku seemed to find his surprise amusing.</p><p></p><p>The boy looked at the meat in his hand with trepidation, but not wanting Moku to look down on him, he took a few more bites. He found that the more he ate, the more delicious it became, until he couldn't stop...</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the girl eyed the pastries in Moku's food box. "These pastries..."</p><p></p><p>"My mother made them herself. Delicious, right?" Moku said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Your mother...makes pastries for you?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just pastries, but lots of tasty food," Moku nodded.</p><p></p><p>A hint of envy flashed across the girl's cool eyes. She picked up a pastry, parted her lips slightly, and took a delicate bite.</p><p></p><p>Crisp and lightly sweet.</p><p></p><p>She lowered her long lashes, hiding her thoughts. After a moment, she raised her head and praised in her clear, melodious voice: "Very delicious."</p><p></p><p>It was said that even celestial musicians playing divine music could not surpass such beauty.</p><p></p><p>Moku beamed happily. "Yeah, my mom makes the best food!"</p><p></p><p>After they finished eating, before leaving, Auntie Xue took out a jade pendant emitting brilliant light and gave it to Moku. "This is a top-grade Clear Mind Pendant. Wearing it can help focus your mind during cultivation. It's not priceless, but I give it to you as a token of thanks."</p><p></p><p>Though Auntie Xue said it was not priceless, the flowing light suggested it was far from ordinary - very precious for a wandering cultivator like Moku.</p><p></p><p>Moku did want it, but knew he should not accept it. Their courtesy was solely out of respect for Master Zhuang. Without that, their difference in status meant they likely would not have spoken to him at all.</p><p></p><p>Being able to learn formations from Master Zhuang was already a great kindness. He could not take advantage of the master's reputation for personal gain.</p><p></p><p>So Moku politely declined. When Auntie Xue insisted, he said: "If you truly wish to give me something, just some travel money will do - five spirit stones is enough."</p><p></p><p>Auntie Xue seemed stunned, as if no one had ever made such a request before. But she still took out a storage bag filled with forty or fifty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Moku only took five stones, returned the bag, and without waiting for Auntie Xue to respond, he waved and headed down the mountain with his own storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Auntie Xue watched Moku's departing figure in a daze. Just as he was about to disappear from view, the young lady suddenly spoke in her clear, melodious voice: "What is your name?"</p><p></p><p>Though soft, Moku still heard her words. He turned back with a smile. "My name is Moku."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the sunset looked like spilled ink, the mountain scenery like a painting. </p><p></p><p>In the brilliant glow, Moku stood amidst the vibrant mountain colors, as if standing within a brocade landscape painting itself.</p><p></p><p>The name "Moku" etched itself into her mind, along with that breathtaking sunset vista.</p><p></p><p>I hope everyone has time to follow the story. The more readers, the sooner it can be published, and the more I can write! (=^_^=)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

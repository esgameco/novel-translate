        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper went upstairs and came back shortly after, politely inviting Moku to go up. </p><p></p><p>When Moku saw An Xiaopang, he was drinking with a few fashionably dressed young men. On the table were various colorful and fresh spiritual fruits, with maidservants fanning them and a gentle fragrant breeze. There were also singing girls whose lingering melodies filled the room. </p><p></p><p>Inside was cool and comfortable, without the scorching summer heat. There were even ice talismans painted on the folding screens to lower the temperature and allow airflow.</p><p></p><p>Moku thought about the wandering cultivators out on the street, peddling their wares and struggling to make a living under the baking sun, and felt pensive. </p><p></p><p>They were all just Qi Refining cultivators living in the same Immortal City, yet it was as if they inhabited two different worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Moku, it really is you!" An Xiaopang seemed pleased to see him. "Come, come, have a drink with us."</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang's face was flushed red from drinking, but he was still young, so it was probably just fruit wine which wouldn't harm his body too much even if he got drunk.</p><p></p><p>Moku had no interest in drinking though. He went straight to the point, "Young Master An, I have something to ask of you."</p><p></p><p>"Oh?" An Xiaopang regained some sobriety and waved at the other young men, "You all keep drinking, I have something to attend to."</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper then led Moku and An Xiaopang to a private room. Moku got right to it, "Young Master An, I need to ask for your help."</p><p></p><p>Still a bit drunk, An Xiaopang thumped his chest, "As long as I can help, just say the word!"</p><p></p><p>Moku looked around at the luxurious decor and asked, "This restaurant, it belongs to your family, right?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang said proudly, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>"For the kitchen's cooking stoves, do you use regular furnaces or cultivator spirit power?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang looked confused for a moment, then called out, "Innkeeper!"</p><p></p><p>Soon the innkeeper came in, and An Xiaopang gestured at him telling Moku, "Ask him."</p><p></p><p>Moku repeated his question to the innkeeper.</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper replied, "We used to use cultivator spirit power for the flames, but that method can damage a cultivator's lungs and the flames were unstable. So the owner decided to stop and had a Talisman Master forge a special stove furnace last year, with talismans drawn to control it. We've been using the furnace ever since."</p><p></p><p>Moku asked curiously, "Is the cost of the furnace higher than just hiring cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper answered honestly, "In the long run, the furnace is better. In the short term, hiring cultivators is cheaper. And you can bargain them down - when business is slow, you can hire a Qi Refining cultivator for just half a spirit stone sometimes."</p><p></p><p>Moku felt a bit uncomfortable hearing this. Even as cultivators, they could not avoid exploitation.</p><p></p><p>"Can I take a look at the furnace?" </p><p></p><p>The innkeeper hesitated, glancing at the young master, as the kitchen was normally off-limits to outsiders.</p><p></p><p>A bit more sober now, An Xiaopang asked, "Is it not allowed for others to see?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, our recipes are secret, but the furnace itself is nothing special. Many restaurants have them, those that don't just don't want to spend spirit stones forging one. It's not a big secret," the innkeeper explained.</p><p></p><p>"Then let him take a look. I'll go too, I've actually never seen our furnace before," said An Xiaopang.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, I'll take you two young masters over."</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper was relieved, with the young master present, he wouldn't be solely blamed if anything went wrong.</p><p></p><p>He brought them to the kitchen and pointed at a huge furnace-like apparatus twice a man's height. "This is the furnace. You put spirit stones in, and the talismans inside convert their energy into flames which are channeled to each stove station for the chefs to cook with."</p><p></p><p>"There are also talismans connecting the furnace to each station to control the flame intensity. Each station has its own talisman array for fine heat adjustments..."</p><p></p><p>Moku found it all very novel - he had never seen talismans and forging used in such applications before.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Xiao Pang also stared wide-eyed, as he usually only knew about eating, but not how the food was made. </p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper introduced the stove to Moku and him with a rather proud expression.</p><p></p><p>Moku carefully examined the stove, looking left and right, not missing the gaps between the stove openings and the stove body. </p><p></p><p>Seeing him looking like he wanted to dismantle the stove to see what was inside, the shopkeeper couldn't help but ask: "Young Master Moku, is there something you want to know?"</p><p></p><p>Moku asked: "Shopkeeper, do you know what array patterns are carved inside this stove?"</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper hesitated, but then thought that just knowing what array patterns were used was useless. The most important thing was whether one could draw the array patterns, which was not easy at all.</p><p></p><p>"The array inside this stove is not too complicated, just a Molten Fire Array containing five array lines. But the position of the Molten Fire Array is quite particular - it needs to be drawn at the bottom of the stove so the fire power is even. On the outside of the stove, there needs to be an opening to place a spirit stone. This way, the spiritual energy from the spirit stone can seep into the Molten Fire Array and activate its fire power..."</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper explained everything in detail to Moku.</p><p></p><p>"Oh oh," Moku nodded continuously.</p><p></p><p>After observing and chatting for a while, Moku had probably asked all he wanted to know. He sincerely thanked the shopkeeper and was about to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Pang pulled Moku's sleeve, "Don't leave in a hurry, let me treat you to something delicious."</p><p></p><p>Moku had something else to attend to, so he declined.</p><p></p><p>"Are you looking down on me?" Xiao Pang got a bit angry.</p><p></p><p>Moku praised Xiao Pang for being generous, then whispered to him: "Next time when we have an array drawing assignment, I'll draw it for you for free."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Pang was overjoyed and quickly nodded: "Mmhmm."</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about spirit stones, he cared about face. Having Moku draw arrays for free made him feel honored.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper watched Moku's departing back and asked Xiao Pang, "Young Master, what is this Moku's status?"</p><p></p><p>"He's kind of a fellow disciple of mine. He's extremely skilled at drawing arrays, even better than me. To be honest, all my array assignments were drawn by him!"</p><p></p><p>Xiao Pang sounded a bit proud.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper's expression didn't change, but he was speechless. There was really nothing to be proud of...</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, you can go back to work. I'm going to drink some wine."</p><p></p><p>As Xiao Pang turned to leave, he suddenly froze, grabbing the shopkeeper's clothes tightly and staring at him wide-eyed.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper felt a bit nervous under his gaze. "Young...Young Master..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Pang lowered his voice: "This matter must never reach my father's ears!"</p><p></p><p>"This matter?"</p><p></p><p>"That someone else did my homework for me, my father must never find out about this!"</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper's mouth twitched. "Okay, okay..."</p><p></p><p>Xiao Pang patted his chest. "That was a close one, good thing I'm smart, or it would've been exposed." Then he made the shopkeeper swear not to tell his father before finally feeling reassured to go upstairs.</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper felt a bit helpless, thinking: "Can the An family's business really be maintained by this unreliable young master..."</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper then thought about that Moku kid from earlier. </p><p></p><p>He didn't seem to be from a wealthy family, just an ordinary cultivator's child. But why did he ask about the stove?</p><p></p><p>After a few steps, the shopkeeper recalled Xiao Pang's words and stopped, thinking: "He's good at drawing arrays? He's not trying to copy the stove's array pattern, is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Pang is at the third level of Qi Refining, and that Moku kid is his fellow disciple, so he's probably also at the third level at most. How could someone at the third Qi Refining level have the spiritual perception to draw arrays?"</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper shook his head and went to find a place to drink tea.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The meat in the bowl had a pale golden color. The meat was translucent and glistening, looking like chicken leg, but about the same size as the pork knuckle Moxhua had eaten in a previous life. </p><p></p><p>The soup was clear and glossy with a thin layer of oil, not greasy, garnished with some mushroom vegetables and chopped green herbs.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua hadn't eaten meat for a long time. The last time was half a year ago during the Hunting Demons Festival. </p><p></p><p>Meat was very expensive in the cultivation world. Unless it was a festival, ordinary cultivators could hardly afford meat.</p><p></p><p>There were roughly two types of meat that cultivators ate. One was the meat of spirit beasts. Unlike demon beasts, spirit beasts were raised by cultivators, fed with spirit grasses and other natural spirit materials. Their meat was tender, easy to cook, and contained spiritual energy, so it was very expensive and unaffordable for wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The other type was the meat of herbivorous demon beasts. All demon beasts killed humans, but not all ate human flesh. Demon beasts that fed on spirit grasses, though vicious and killed cultivators, would not eat cultivator flesh. </p><p></p><p>However, carnivorous demon beasts basically all ate humans. If they hadn't, it was not because they didn't eat humans, just that they hadn't encountered cultivators to eat yet.</p><p></p><p>So the meat of herbivorous demon beasts, though smelly, could still be consumed by cultivators. But the meat of carnivorous demon beasts was bloody and polluted, inedible. If cultivators mistakenly ate it, it could contaminate their qi and blood, causing meridian disruptions, some even going insane.</p><p></p><p>Though not expensive, herbivorous demon beast meat was still rarely eaten by cultivators in general. Demon beasts were much stronger than cultivators physically, including the herbivores, so their meat was too tough to chew and swallow. To consume it required long stewing over fire to tenderize, which wandering cultivators could not afford the effort for. Those who could afford it would just choose to eat spirit beast meat instead.</p><p></p><p>So no matter what kind of meat, it was rarely seen on a wandering cultivator's table.</p><p></p><p>But the meat in this bowl had wisps of white vapor rising from it, though faint, clearly indicating it contained some spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruxhua beckoned to Moxhua, "This is meat from a fire chick, your dad bought it back to nourish you."</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but pinch Moxhua's pale little face, "Look how thin you've gotten recently."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua was a bit reluctant and couldn't help asking, "This meat must be quite expensive?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan waved his hand, "I only bought half, didn't cost too many spirit stones. Plus it's from a friend in the demon hunting squad, we're working together next year, so it's half purchased half gifted as a courtesy."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua said, "Dad, are you going into the inner mountain next year?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan nodded, "It's hard to get by in the outer mountain now, the profit from killing demon beasts is too low. If someone gets injured, we may not even break even. The demon beasts in the inner mountain are stronger, but if they drop anything good, we can easily earn a fortune. So next year..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan suddenly stopped, laughing at himself, "Why am I telling you all this?"  </p><p></p><p>Liu Ruxhua gave Mo Shan a light glare, scooping a bowl of meat soup for Moxhua, "Try it, how's the taste?"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua took a sip of the soup and a bite of the meat. The soup was fresh and the meat was fragrant, rich but not greasy, perfect in color, aroma and flavor.</p><p></p><p>This was the most delicious meat Moxhua had ever eaten.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua narrowed his eyes in praise, "Mom, you made it so delicious!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruxhua also couldn't help but smile, "If it's delicious, eat more. This whole bowl is for you, you have to finish it." She headed to the kitchen, "There are some other dishes too, let me bring them over..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan stood up, "Let me help..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his parents go to the kitchen, Moxhua took a few pieces of the fire chick meat and put them in his own bowl, leaving the rest in his parents' bowls.</p><p></p><p>When Mo Shan and Liu Ruxhua brought the dishes back, they saw their bowls piled high with meat.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Liuruhuan felt both relieved and amused, saying with a laugh, "This meat was specially bought for you. Your parents at this age don't expect to make any breakthroughs in cultivation, so eating this spirit-infused meat would just be a waste..."</p><p></p><p>Liuruhuan tried to put some meat into Mohua's bowl, but Mohua covered his bowl with both hands and shook his head, "I've had enough, I can't finish any more."</p><p></p><p>Mohua kept his bowl covered and refused to eat any more.</p><p></p><p>Moshan and Liuruhuan felt helpless and could only give up, but the couple started deferring to each other instead.</p><p></p><p>Moshan added meat to his wife's bowl, saying softly, "You've worked hard all these years, eat more to nourish yourself..."</p><p></p><p>Liuruhuan transferred the meat to her husband's bowl tenderly, "You travel far and wide, enduring hardships. You should eat more..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua felt a pang listening to them, and couldn't help but say, "Parents, the meat will get cold if you don't eat it soon."</p><p></p><p>Moshan and his wife had forgotten their son was beside them. Seeing their son's large watery eyes watching them, Liuruhuan's face flushed slightly, while Moshan gave a light cough and pretended nothing had happened as he ate.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his parents had eaten the meat in their bowls, Mohua finally nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Then he thought, although the spiritual chicken meat tasted good, it was too expensive.</p><p></p><p>The meat of demonic beasts may lack spiritual energy, but it could replenish blood and qi, which would definitely benefit cultivators. But the meat of demonic beasts was truly hard to chew...</p><p></p><p>He wondered if there was a way for his parents to eat more meat?</p><p></p><p>Mohua set this thought aside for now. His current priority was to finish painting the Bright Fire Formation and exchange it with the fat clerk at the company for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Mohua returned to his room and meditated briefly to digest the spiritual chicken meat, as it didn't contain much spiritual energy so it didn't take long.</p><p></p><p>Once he had refined all the spiritual energy, Mohua resumed painting the Bright Fire Formation. He finally completed another one before going to bed that night.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Mohua entered sleep and continued painting formations on the Dao Stele, repeating it over and over to reinforce his memory of the formations and reflect on issues with his brushwork.</p><p></p><p>The next day after morning meditation, he continued painting formations, completing one in the morning and another in the afternoon, both successfully. But it consumed quite a bit of his spiritual sense, so after dinner he had to rest for a while. That night in his dreams he continued practicing on the Dao Stele.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth day, Mohua's brushwork had become much more skilled, and his spiritual sense also seemed thicker, or perhaps he just understood the Bright Fire Formation more thoroughly, consuming less spiritual sense. After completing two formations during the day, he still had energy left after dinner to paint another, though he made a rushed mistake so that formation failed.</p><p></p><p>That night when Mohua slept, he continued reviewing and summarizing in his consciousness, practicing painting on the Dao Stele.</p><p></p><p>On the fifth day, Mohua spent the entire day painting three Bright Fire Formations, all successful, though it consumed quite a bit of his spiritual sense leaving him dizzy, but no longer the splitting headache from the first time. He could recover by closing his eyes and meditating briefly.</p><p></p><p>By now Mohua had used up all ten sets of formation materials assigned by the company, painting a total of eight Bright Fire Formations.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some flaws and much room for improvement, overall he was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>That night, Mohua indulged himself a little and didn't practice on the Dao Stele, instead drawing a few comic strips on it purely for entertainment.</p><p></p><p>The next day after breakfast, Mohua made plans with Dahu and the other three to go out on the town.</p><p></p><p>Mohua put the painted formations into his storage pouch and slung it over his shoulder. Before leaving, Liuruhuan gave Mohua a spirit stone and five spirit stone shards, telling him to buy anything good to eat or play with that he saw, and reminding him carefully to stay safe.</p><p></p><p>Dahu and the others thumped their chests, vowing to protect Mohua and not let anyone bully him.</p><p></p><p>Mohua waved goodbye to his mother, then headed out with his three little friends.</p><p></p><p>The energetic Dahu and the others bounced and jumped all the way.</p><p></p><p>On the lively stone path, the three tiger-headed little lads and a porcelain doll-like child hopped and skipped along...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Using the Dao steles in the Sea of Knowledge, he continuously practiced array formations, strengthening his spiritual sense. </p><p></p><p>Although this method was crude, it was currently Mo Hua's only option.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing there are Dao steles in the Sea of Knowledge, otherwise even using this crude method would be impossible," Mo Hua thought with some relief. In reality, drawing array formations consumed too much spiritual sense and recovery was too slow. To strengthen his spiritual sense through this method would inevitably require several times more time and effort.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Mo Hua settled down and focused singlemindedly on practicing the Molten Fire Array on the Dao steles. </p><p></p><p>As long as he kept practicing, he was bound to learn it eventually.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua first tried his best to draw the first four array lines, until his spiritual sense was almost depleted, then he erased the array lines.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a bit, he continued drawing, and then erased it again.</p><p></p><p>He repeated this cycle, and when he felt his spiritual sense had recovered a little, after completing the four array lines, he drew one more stroke.</p><p></p><p>A whole night passed, and Mo Hua had only managed to draw two more strokes than when he started, but those two strokes at least showed that his spiritual sense was indeed growing.</p><p></p><p>The next day when he woke up, Mo Hua went to the market to buy some of the special ink needed for the Molten Fire Array.</p><p></p><p>The ink was made by using the blood of fire-attribute demonic beasts as the base and mixing in some medicinal herbs. It wasn't particularly expensive. Mo Hua bought more than ten portions at once.</p><p></p><p>Since there were few array cultivators, not many cultivators knew how to draw array formations, so there were also few who bought the special ink. The shopkeeper rarely encountered a big customer like Mo Hua, so he gave Mo Hua a few extra portions.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, Mo Hua began practicing drawing the Molten Fire Array using the special ink.</p><p></p><p>Since the ink was purchased with spirit stones, Mo Hua was exceptionally careful, taking great pains with every stroke.</p><p></p><p>Of course, limited by his spiritual sense, Mo Hua could at most only draw two extra strokes after completing the first four array lines of the Molten Fire Array - he could not draw the complete five-lined Molten Fire Array.</p><p></p><p>After drawing like this, he would have to put down his brush and rest for an hour to recover his spiritual sense. Once his spiritual sense was replenished, he would resume drawing.</p><p></p><p>This efficiency was much lower compared to practicing on the Dao steles in the Sea of Knowledge. It also consumed ink and spirit paper, which meant spending spirit stones. However, in order to learn the Molten Fire Array sooner, Mo Hua didn't mind.</p><p></p><p>Practicing array formations day and night like this, half a month later, in addition to the first four lines, Mo Hua could draw about ten extra strokes, roughly half of another array line.</p><p></p><p>At this pace, Mo Hua estimated it would take another half a month before his spiritual sense was sufficient to draw a complete Molten Fire Array with all five lines.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua silently breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Considering that forging the furnace would also take time, he had to plan some things early.</p><p></p><p>During the day, Mo Hua went out for a stroll on the streets. In the evening he returned home to have dinner with his parents.</p><p></p><p>Under the flickering candlelight, the table was set with fragrant rice porridge, soft white steamed buns, two dishes of fresh vegetables, and a small plate of pickled vegetables.</p><p></p><p>For an ordinary scattered cultivator family, this was already quite abundant - they normally could not afford meat.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua was an excellent cook; although the dishes were simple, they tasted delicious. Mo Hua ate with relish.</p><p></p><p>However, while the food was cooked by Liu Ruhua, the fire was provided by Mo Shan's spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua's expression seemed normal, but in her furtive glances, her eyes would occasionally show a hint of loss, and she would sometimes space out.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua quickly ate a steamed bun, puffing out his cheeks as he suddenly asked, "Mom, have you ever thought about opening a restaurant?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua, who was sipping her porridge, was stunned. Smiling, she said, "Why are you suddenly asking this?"</p><p></p><p>"Mom, your cooking is so delicious. If you opened a restaurant, you could definitely earn a lot of spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Opening a restaurant also requires capital. How could scattered cultivators of our status afford the spirit stones to open a restaurant?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua laughed, then tapped Mo Hua's nose with her fair fingers and teased, "Wait until you grow up and your cultivation is high, when you can earn a lot of spirit stones, then we'll open one."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua whispered, "Then let's start with a small one first."</p><p></p><p>"What small one?" Liu Ruhua was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"A food stall," Mo Hua said. "I took a look around the streets today and saw there are many food stalls selling things like wine, dishes, snacks, noodles and so on. Their business seems pretty good."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua seemed to want to say something but held back, her expression a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan spoke up softly, "Hua'er, your mother...can't use spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Without spiritual power, they couldn't keep the fire going, making it impossible to cook meals for cultivation. </p><p></p><p>Even if they could use spiritual power, with customers coming and going at the restaurant, they would need to cook many dishes, which would be too much for a cultivator at the Qi Refining stage to sustain with their spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Moxiu arched her delicate eyebrows confidently and said, "We'll build a stove furnace."</p><p></p><p>"A stove furnace?"</p><p></p><p>Moshan and Liu Ruhua looked at each other in surprise.  </p><p></p><p>Moxiu took out a large drawing from her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"This is the design drawing for the stove furnace. I asked Master Chen from the Refining Workshop about what materials to use, the dimensions, and how many spirit stones are needed - I've calculated it all. I'll figure out the array formation. Once this stove furnace is refined, cultivators won't need to use their spiritual power to fuel it. We just need to put in spirit stones, and it will continuously provide fire, making cooking dishes and simmering ingredients much more convenient."</p><p></p><p>Moshan and his wife didn't expect their son to have already prepared the drawings, leaving them stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Refining a stove furnace will require a lot of spirit stones, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's first make a small stove furnace. I asked Master Chen, and it won't need too many spirit stones. For a small restaurant, a smaller furnace will be enough."</p><p></p><p>"What about the array formation?" Liu Ruhua asked.</p><p></p><p>Moxiu feigned nonchalance, but couldn't quite hide his proud expression. "I can draw it myself. I already got the array drawings from Manager Mo a long time ago. The formation isn't too difficult..."</p><p></p><p>After spending several nights exhausting his spiritual awareness, practicing the Molten Fire Array over and over but still not fully mastering it, Moxiu felt a tinge of unease as he said it wasn't difficult.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua looked at Moxiu skeptically, "Really not difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Moxiu laughed, "Although I haven't learned it yet, I'll have no problem after a few more days of practice."</p><p></p><p>He had no choice - the five-line array formation wasn't that easy to learn.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua nodded, thinking to herself that since Moxiu was young and hadn't studied array formations for long, if he could learn it, it probably wasn't an extremely difficult formation.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking it over, she shook her head and said, "Opening a restaurant isn't that simple. Even for a small eatery, we need to rent the premises, hire helpers, and take care of many other matters. It will also require spending quite a few spirit stones. If our income can't cover the expenses, our family's finances will be even tighter. The most important thing now is to save some spirit stones for your cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>The previously silent Moshan suddenly said, "We'll open this restaurant. I'll figure out the premises and staffing issues, you two don't need to worry about it."</p><p></p><p>Moshan took out another storage bag and handed it to Moxiu. "There are over a hundred spirit stones in here from the demonic beasts I hunted these past few months. I know you've also earned quite a few spirit stones drawing array formations for others, but use these first for refining the stove furnace..."</p><p></p><p>Moxiu was about to refuse when Moshan stuffed the bag into his hand.</p><p></p><p>Holding the bag of spirit stones earned by his father through life-and-death battles with demonic beasts, Moxiu felt it weigh much heavier than ordinary spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Since Moshan had agreed, the decision to open a restaurant was basically made. After dinner, Moxiu returned to his room to continue practicing drawing the Molten Fire Array.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua still looked worried.</p><p></p><p>Moshan comforted her, "Don't overthink it. Opening a small restaurant is just a minor business venture. Even if we lose money, it won't be that much."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua sighed, "Hua'er is talented and will need many spirit stones in the future for his cultivation, learning martial arts, Daoist teachings, and array formations to become an arrayed master. If we use up all our spirit stones now, what will we do when he needs them for his cultivation later?"</p><p></p><p>Moshan said soothingly, "Don't underestimate Hua'er. He can already help businesses draw simple array formations. It's no small feat. In ten or twenty years, after more practice with formations, he may truly become an arrayed master."</p><p></p><p>Moshan laughed, "By then, we might have to rely on our son to support us."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua smiled but still felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>Moshan held Liu Ruhua's hand. "Then let's make this restaurant business successful and save up more spirit stones. In the future, we can find a way to get Moxiu a young wife and have him get married and have children."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua considered Moshan's words and smiled, but still felt unsettled. "But what if..."</p><p></p><p>"Even if something happens, you still have me. No matter how difficult life gets, there will always be a way. I'll just have to work harder and kill more demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Moshan's tone was gentle yet resolute.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua said nothing more and silently leaned against Moshan's embrace.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

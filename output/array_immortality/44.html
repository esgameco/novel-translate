        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The "Treatise on Array Formations" could only be read at Mr. Zhuang's place and could not be taken out. </p><p></p><p>For the next few days, Moku would arrive early at Mr. Zhuang's Sitting Forgetfulness Dwelling, then find a quiet and comfortable spot to read the book alone.</p><p></p><p>If he had any questions, he would quietly note them down, and then ask Mr. Zhuang after he had finished his nap. Mr. Zhuang would answer any question asked, often able to resolve Moku's doubts with just a few words, earning Moku's great admiration.</p><p></p><p>In this short period of time, Moku's insights into array formations grew considerably.  </p><p></p><p>The Moku couple wanted to pay a courtesy visit to express their gratitude, but Mr. Zhuang declined, saying he enjoyed solitude and did not associate with others. He appreciated their goodwill, but there was no need for them to visit.</p><p></p><p>Despite these words, the Moku couple still felt unsettled in their hearts without any expression of thanks.</p><p></p><p>So Moku went up the mountain and killed a wild buffalo. Liu Ruhua cured and stewed the buffalo meat to infuse it with flavors, and also made various snacks. She had Moku take them all to present to Mr. Zhuang, reminding him:</p><p></p><p>"Since Mr. Zhuang likes tranquility, we won't disturb him. But we still need to offer a small gift. He probably doesn't lack things like spirit stones, and though this food is not precious, it is at least an expression of our sincere intentions. Hua'er, please give them to the master, and hopefully he will not disdain them."</p><p></p><p>"Mm hmm," Moku nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>When Moku delivered the food box to Mr. Zhuang, he felt a bit apprehensive in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Mr. Zhuang's manner, he had probably eaten all kinds of delicacies before. These ordinary foods that cultivators eat were unlikely to appeal to him.</p><p></p><p>But when Mr. Zhuang received the food box, he seemed quite intrigued. He tasted a few slices of the beef and gave a slight nod.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a low-grade wild demonic beast without spiritual energy, the cooking method was quite unique. The aroma of the buffalo meat mixed with the spicy seasonings had a kind of untried rustic charm.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time Mr. Zhuang had tasted beef with these flavors. He couldn't help but eat a few more slices and even saved some to have with alcohol later.</p><p></p><p>Moku also gave some of the snacks to Old Tao. When Old Tao received them, he seemed a bit surprised but did not treat Moku as an outsider. He tried a few bites without saying they were good or bad.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that both had accepted the gifts and tasted them, without any signs of dissatisfaction, Moku felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua was very happy and would make various dishes whenever she had time for Moku to bring to Mr. Zhuang and Old Tao.</p><p></p><p>There were many different types of demonic beasts in the mountains with distinct flavors. Usually busy with the restaurant, Liu Ruhua would focus on studying cooking in her free time. Using the meat Moku hunted from demonic beasts, she would experiment with various cooking methods, combining different meats with different seasonings and stewing techniques to present diverse flavors.</p><p></p><p>Some tasted quite good, while others were not so easily palatable. Liu Ruhua would select the tasty ones for Moku to bring for Mr. Zhuang to try.</p><p></p><p>As for Old Tao, he loved eating snacks, and from Moku's observations, he especially enjoyed crispy snacks and liked to eat them while playing chess. So Liu Ruhua made some pastries for Moku to deliver to Old Tao every so often.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Mr. Zhuang became accustomed to these foods and no longer cared much for the dishes Old Tao made.</p><p></p><p>One day, after Moku delivered some braised meat and snacks to Mr. Zhuang and Old Tao, read for the day, and asked about a few questions, he took his leave to return home.</p><p></p><p>It was already late in the evening. Mr. Zhuang sat by the pond, watching the sunset glow as he ate the beef and drank a little wine, looking quite at leisure.</p><p></p><p>Off to the side, Old Tao ate snacks while playing chess against himself. After a moment, he glanced at Mr. Zhuang and said:</p><p></p><p>"Your Sea of Qi is shattered. You can eat other things, but don't be greedy. Don't neglect the medicinal cuisine I make for you either."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang seemed entirely unconcerned: "A broken mirror cannot be made whole again, spilled water cannot be recovered. Since my Sea of Qi is already shattered, it doesn't matter what I eat. I might as well eat what makes me happy."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Old Tao couldn't be bothered to manage him. After a moment, he suddenly asked, "Is it really that delicious?"</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang picked up another piece of meat with his chopsticks and put it in his mouth, savoring it carefully. "The flavor is very special."</p><p></p><p>Old Tao frowned and said, "What delicacy haven't you tasted in your life? How is it that you're getting greedy now?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang revealed an amusing expression, but his eyes concealed the warmth and coldness of the world:</p><p></p><p>"I've grown tired of delicacies from the mountains and seas. Although these things are simple, the intention behind them is also simple, which is why they are most precious."</p><p></p><p>"Oh," Old Tao seemed not to have heard, still focused on playing chess, picking up a pastry and putting it in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang looked at him and suddenly asked in return, "Can't you taste the flavor? Then why are you eating these?"</p><p></p><p>Old Tao was focused on the chess game. After a moment, he said, "I'm just chewing to hear the sound."</p><p></p><p>He picked up a crispy flatbread and began chewing it, making a crunching sound.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, Mo Hua had more or less finished reading the "Origins of Array Formations" that Sir Zhuang had given him, so Sir Zhuang began teaching Mo Hua array formation theory.</p><p></p><p>The array formation theory Sir Zhuang taught was broader and more abstruse than what Tutor Yan had taught. It was full of array formation terminology that Mo Hua had never heard before, so he learned very slowly.</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang also had a laissez-faire attitude. Whether Mo Hua learned quickly or slowly, well or poorly, he never said a word.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that he had become uneasy from eating too much beef, so he asked Mo Hua:</p><p></p><p>"What kind of array formation master do you want to become?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua wanted to say he wanted to become a first-rank array master, but this goal might seem too small in Sir Zhuang's eyes. And he really didn't know what kinds of array masters there were, so he honestly said:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple does not know what kind of array master he can become."</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang pondered for a moment and said, "Your spiritual roots are not outstanding. Even if you don't lack spirit stones and cultivation methods, it will still be difficult to reach the Golden Core stage. One's cultivation realm determines an array master's upper limit. No matter how high your comprehension, without a sufficient realm, you cannot access the deeper array formations..."</p><p></p><p>"As for comprehension, yours is actually not bad. But unfortunately, you started too late and lack a foundation for understanding the various array theories. The scions of great clans and families are imbued with these from childhood, becoming very familiar with the profound perceptions of array formations from a young age. You lack this grounding. Even if you start learning from the beginning now, you will be much slower."</p><p></p><p>"When I taught my previous disciples, I would first teach array theory, have them memorize the myriad array schools and theories of the cultivation world, and lay the foundation. That way, they could integrate their understanding more easily in the future and go further on the path of array formations."</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang looked at Mo Hua, his expression slightly apologetic, but he still spoke frankly: "But you may not be able to go far at all. A third-rank array master may already be your limit. So teaching you the previous way would just be a waste of time and of no benefit to you."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua's expression dimmed, and he felt a bit disappointed inside.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking about it, even becoming a second-rank array master would be a secret joy. After all, in the entire Spirit City, there were only a handful of first-rank array masters.</p><p></p><p>He had almost let himself get carried away by Sir Zhuang's expectations...</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Mo Hua said solemnly, "All things in the world have their destined limits. Your disciple only needs to wholeheartedly study array formations. Whatever level I can reach, that will be it. Being overly concerned with gain and loss will only cause me to lose my original intent. Please do not withhold your guidance, Master."</p><p></p><p>Sir Zhuang's expression was slightly surprised. He silently looked at Mo Hua, then calmly smiled and said, "You speak correctly. Matters are in human hands, but gain and loss are in heaven's hands. One cannot become discouraged due to worries of success or failure. Since that is the case, tomorrow I will change my teaching method."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

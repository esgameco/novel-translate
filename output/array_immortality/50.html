        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After that, the three of them would come to pay a visit to Master Zhuang every morning. They would bow respectfully from outside the gate, wait for half a tea's time, and if the gate remained tightly closed, they would then go back down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Mozi actually wanted to tell them that Master Zhuang liked to sleep in late in the mornings, sleeping until the afternoon, so the timing of their visits was off. </p><p></p><p>But then he thought again, at least for the short term, it seemed Master Zhuang didn't really want to see them.</p><p></p><p>Whether they came early and didn't get to see Master Zhuang, or came late with the same result of not seeing him, since they wouldn't get to see him either way, it didn't really matter what time they came to visit.</p><p></p><p>By coming to the mountain in the early morning, they could at least see the mountainsides bathed in the morning glow, so it wasn't a total loss.</p><p></p><p>When Mozi went up the mountain, he would occasionally run into them too. Sometimes he would greet them, and if he had enough time, he would casually chat with them.</p><p></p><p>Although they were scions of aristocratic families and looked proud, they were actually quite approachable.</p><p></p><p>From his casual chats with them, Mozi learned that the two were surnamed Bai, both a few years older than him. The good-looking boy was named Bai Zisheng, and the exquisite girl, pretty as a porcelain doll, was named Bai Zixi.</p><p></p><p>They were brother and sister who had come from afar at the behest of their family elders to seek Master Zhuang as their teacher and study formation arts.</p><p></p><p>Bai Zisheng was the talkative one, while Bai Zixi was quieter.</p><p></p><p>The two looked somewhat similar, but Bai Zixi was obviously far prettier.</p><p></p><p>In fact, she was stunningly beautiful...</p><p></p><p>From afar, Mozi just thought she looked petite and delicate, but up close he would realize that although young, Bai Zixi's face was flawlessly pale and exquisitely beautiful despite its fragility.</p><p></p><p>Could a human face really look like this? Mozi was utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>The saying goes that Nuwa created humans from clay, but clearly some people were not made from clay. At the very least, Bai Zixi before him was not.</p><p></p><p>When Nuwa created her, she must have molded her from the essence of snow, moonlight and graceful beauty, sculpting an icy jade-like body.</p><p></p><p>Mozi stole another glance at Bai Zixi, thinking to himself:</p><p></p><p>"The old saying goes that a beautiful woman brings disaster, but Nuwa wasn't creating a person here, she was clearly creating a calamity..."</p><p></p><p>The woman walking behind the Bai siblings with a veiled face, called Auntie Xue, was probably a bodyguard sent by their family clan to protect them.</p><p></p><p>Mozi didn't know Auntie Xue's level of cultivation, but her skills were definitely formidable. There was a subtle oppressive aura about her that Mozi had never sensed from other cultivators before.  </p><p></p><p>The highest level cultivator Mozi had seen before was the old patriarch of the Tongren sect, who had reached the middle stage of Foundation Establishment. However, the old patriarch was kind-natured, and his spiritual power had declined with age, so his oppressive aura was not as strong as Auntie Xue's.</p><p></p><p>"At least at the Foundation Establishment stage..."</p><p></p><p>Mozi guessed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>To have a Foundation Establishment cultivator as a bodyguard, these siblings must have extraordinary status. The Bai family was probably a prominent major clan outside of Lizhou. Mozi tactfully didn't ask about the specifics of what kind of major clan they were from.</p><p></p><p>Matters of aristocratic clans were far removed from Mozi's world.</p><p></p><p>For a cultivator from a scattered cultivation background like himself, breaking through to the Foundation Establishment realm was extremely difficult. But in this small town of Tongren, a Foundation Establishment cultivator would already have a rather lofty status.</p><p></p><p>His own cultivation in this lifetime might not even surpass that of someone else's bodyguard.</p><p></p><p>Mozi kept his original aspiration in mind - to diligently study formation arts and become a first-rank formation master, so that he could have a foothold in the cultivation world in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Bai siblings continued their morning visits every day, which Master Zhuang did not comment on, seeming to accept it by default, but still showed no intention of meeting them.</p><p></p><p>However, Master Zhuang also seemed to have let go, and his daily routine returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>He still slept until the afternoon before getting up, then sat in the courtyard drinking wine with beef, or having tea with pastries, gazing at the mountain scenery lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Mozi continued studying formation arts, drawing formations, meditating, then drawing more formations, and whenever he had doubts, he would go ask Master Zhuang for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On this day, Mr. Zhuang suddenly asked Moxie to draw an array formation called the "Three Talents Formation". </p><p></p><p>This formation contained six array patterns. With Moxie's current spiritual awareness, it was impossible for him to complete drawing it. Moreover, the structure looked very special, and the array patterns were different from the five elements arrays he had encountered before.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang gave Moxie only one day. The next day, Moxie had to show him whatever he could draw of the formation.</p><p></p><p>During the day, Moxie devoted himself entirely to studying the diagram of the Three Talents Formation. He tried drawing it several times and also practiced on the remnant steles in his inner world overnight.</p><p></p><p>The next day, in front of Mr. Zhuang, with stops and starts and with great difficulty, he drew out the array formation. However, due to insufficient spiritual awareness, a few strokes of the array patterns he drew were ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang did not say anything. Seeing that Moxie looked fatigued and slightly pale, knowing it was the result of overusing his spiritual awareness, he lit an incense stick. White smoke wafted up with a refreshing fragrance that soothed the mind and spirit.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang said, "This is a mind-calming incense that can nourish spiritual awareness. Sit here in meditation. When the incense is finished, you can go back and rest. Don't draw any more array formations today."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>Moxie thanked him, then sat in meditation. He indeed felt his spiritual awareness recovering faster. After about the time it takes to drink two cups of tea, the mind-calming incense had burned out, and Moxie bid farewell with a bow.</p><p></p><p>After Moxie left, Mr. Zhuang looked at the Three Talents Formation that Moxie had drawn, frowning in contemplation without saying a word for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Lao Gui entered and, seeing this, asked, "Did he not draw it well?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang shook his head. "It's not a matter of good or bad... With insufficient spiritual awareness and such a rushed timeframe, it was impossible for him to draw this formation well. There were bound to be mistakes no matter what. But..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang frowned slightly. "This kid Moxie learns too fast."</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with learning fast?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not just fast, it's too fast..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang opened up the Three Talents Formation diagram. "This Three Talents Formation uses a completely different array pivot compared to the five elements arrays. The array patterns are also different. I just gave him the diagram yesterday, and in only one day, he had more or less learned it. If it weren't for his lacking spiritual awareness, he might have actually managed to haphazardly draw out this entire formation..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang's gaze sharpened slightly. "The strangest thing is, in one day and with Moxie's spiritual awareness, he could have practiced this formation at most three or four times. But looking at the brushwork of this Three Talents Formation he drew, it seems quite practiced, as if he did it over ten times."</p><p></p><p>Lao Gui's expression did not change, but his tone became more solemn. "Are you saying... this kid Moxie is hiding something from you?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang shook his head. "I never asked, so there is no question of hiding anything. But it seems this kid Moxie must have some other fortuitous opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Lao Gui rolled his eyes. "What cultivator doesn't have some fortuitous opportunity? Don't you have your own opportunities? Among the myriad living beings in this world, the very fact that one is born into this world means inheriting great heavenly fortune."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Mr. Zhuang fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Lao Gui said, "If you really care about it, just ask him."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang looked slightly dazed. "Ask him?"</p><p></p><p>Lao Gui said impatiently, "You're the kind of person who claims to have profound thoughts, but actually you're just too suspicious. You always think everyone is like you, hiding everything as if it can't be told to anyone. I think this kid Moxie seems pretty good, not like you always concealing eighteen different secrets and being so cagey about everything."</p><p></p><p>Lying in the chair, Mr. Zhuang calmly said, "If I were truly that suspicious, I wouldn't have ended up in my current situation."</p><p></p><p>"Birds of a feather flock together. You think you're so smart and like associating with suspicious people, so of course you end up being schemed against. This back-and-forth, you brought it on yourself. You can't blame others."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang smiled bitterly. "Yes, that's why now I can only stay with someone as guileless as you to have a bit of peace."</p><p></p><p>Lao Gui's expression became wooden, and he said nothing more.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In the realm of knowledge, Moku's painted form looked the same as his physical body, able to move freely at will. However, it was not made of flesh and blood, nor even formed from spiritual energy, but merely a virtual shadow of his consciousness. </p><p></p><p>Moku's shadowy form held his breath and focused, using his fingers as a brush to paint the formation patterns of the Ming Fire Formation onto the stele.</p><p></p><p>Pale blue lines danced nimbly following his fingertips, gradually appearing on the pitch-black stele, strand by strand interweaving from simple to complex into an abstruse pattern.</p><p></p><p>After completing the second pattern line, as Moku continued painting, he gradually felt an unprecedented fatigue and even pain.</p><p></p><p>His realm of knowledge was like a breached dam, his consciousness gushing out like a tide.</p><p></p><p>The more consciousness flowed out, the closer his realm of knowledge came to being drained dry, like a retreating riverbed gradually cracking from unnamed pressure, causing a stabbing pain, even making his scalp go numb.</p><p></p><p>Moku also gradually felt his thoughts becoming sluggish, the third pattern line painted slower and slower.  </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a needle-like pain shot through from his realm of knowledge, causing Moku to briefly lose focus. Unable to control himself, he made a mistake in one part of the pattern on the stele.</p><p></p><p>Moku had to stop and hold his head, waiting for the pain to slowly subside.</p><p></p><p>It took the time to drink a whole cup of tea before Moku finally recovered. After pondering for a moment, he finally understood:</p><p></p><p>"For cultivators to draw formation patterns requires a huge amount of consciousness, far more than what other cultivation paths consume! Much more than I had imagined!"</p><p></p><p>"That's why the illustrated manuals specially note in red ink - those of insufficient realm, beware of studying this. If one's realm is not high enough, if the consciousness is not strong enough, forcibly copying formation patterns will over-consume consciousness, even leading to consciousness depletion..."</p><p></p><p>Consciousness depletion would bring cultivators intense pain, even causing cracks to form in their realm of knowledge. And if the cracks became too severe, the realm of knowledge would shatter completely, causing the cultivator's mind and path to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>This was mentioned in the formation lessons, but Moku hadn't paid much attention at the time. Only now remembering did he feel a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Ming Fire Formation requires the third level of Qi Refinement, but I've only reached the second level. My consciousness is indeed a bit lacking..."</p><p></p><p>Moku hugged his head with both hands, lying on the ground of his realm of knowledge, slowly pondering:</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm a bit lacking, it shouldn't be too far off. My consciousness has always been a bit stronger than others'. And I've studied formations for so long - if I practice it over and over, I should be able to draw it eventually."</p><p></p><p>"If I can't draw it in one try, I'll do it a second time, a third time... Each time my consciousness grows a bit stronger, each time I can draw a little more than the last, I'll eventually be able to complete the formation pattern..."</p><p></p><p>After thinking it through, Moku stood up and wiped away the unfinished pattern on the stele. His consciousness immediately became full again.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had never drawn the formation before, yet every stroke he had made was now etched into his mind.</p><p></p><p>Moku couldn't help feeling admiration in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing there's this stele here. Otherwise, with his consciousness nearly depleted, who knows how long he would have to rest before attempting it a second time. By the time he learned the Ming Fire Formation, ten days or even half a month might have passed. And if it took over ten days, all the spirit stones he had pawned would be confiscated.</p><p></p><p>The thought pained his heart, and his consciousness became even more focused as he began drawing the Ming Fire Formation a second time...</p><p></p><p>In the empty white expanse of his realm of knowledge, the passage of time could not be felt.</p><p></p><p>Moku painted for a while, stopped for a while, rested for a while. When he could no longer continue, he wiped it clean and started over from the beginning.  </p><p></p><p>He didn't know how many tries it took, but finally he succeeded in drawing out the complete Ming Fire Formation pattern.</p><p></p><p>Moku let out a long sigh of relief, his limbs collapsing to the ground, feeling like a little salted fish that had its consciousness completely wrung dry.</p><p></p><p>After resting for about half a cup of tea's time, Moku finally mustered the energy to stand up and admire the formation pattern he had drawn for the first time - the Ming Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>On the jet black stele was painted a complete pale blue patterned formation, the lines strict yet elegant, carrying an air of profound mystery. In the light and dark of the pattern, it seemed to contain indescribable rules and power.</p><p></p><p>So this is a formation pattern!</p><p></p><p>Moku's heart was filled with awe, as if in this world there could be nothing more beautiful than these rule-containing lines.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The West, even just looking at it, made one involuntarily immerse themselves in it...</p><p></p><p>As Moku looked at the formation, he suddenly realized something was off. </p><p></p><p>When painting it, the pattern lines were light blue, but now they seemed to be gradually fading, and the colors were dim, gradually turning a pale gray.</p><p></p><p>It was as if...the stele was telling Moku that he had painted it wrong...</p><p></p><p>Moku was dazed. </p><p></p><p>"Painted it wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be..."</p><p></p><p>Moku felt a bit discouraged, but still mustered his energy and carefully checked it line by line. In the end, he realized that he had indeed painted it wrong, and not just in one place.</p><p></p><p>In some places, he had added an extra line to the pattern. In others, the angles of the connecting lines were wrong. In others still, he had incorrectly merged two fire patterns...</p><p></p><p>Because he had painted it wrong, he didn't expend as much spiritual energy, which is why he was able to complete painting the Bright Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>Scratching his head, Moku had no choice but to carefully note down the mistakes, then erase the formation and paint it again from the start.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He repeated this process of painting it over and over many times. Moku couldn't help but feel dizzy and his spiritual awareness ached. On top of that numbness, looking at the formation patterns on the stele, they all appeared blurred with overlapping images.</p><p></p><p>At some point in this muddled state, Moku completed the final stroke of the formation.</p><p></p><p>The stele seemed to lightly tremble, and the light blue formation lines on it emitted a gentle white light. Within the white light, it seemed like flickering flames were dancing, like the glow of a candle illuminating the night.</p><p></p><p>The Bright Fire Formation!</p><p></p><p>Moku could barely contain his excitement, and all the fatigue from the night vanished.</p><p></p><p>For the first time in his life, Moku personally experienced the abilities of a cultivator - that feeling of comprehending for oneself, then creating from that understanding, manifesting the rules of the Dao through formations, grasping the mighty powers of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a tiny first step, a minuscule fraction of that power, it was the first drop that would accumulate into the great river of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>Moku felt very proud. Even though the Bright Fire Formation could only be used for illumination and was one of the most common and inexpensive formations in cultivation, at least this formation had lit the first step of Moku's path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Not feeling fully satisfied, Moku couldn't help but want to paint it a few more times. But he also knew that his feeble spiritual awareness was like a candle flickering in the wind, unable to withstand any more exertion.</p><p></p><p>If he kept painting, his spiritual sea might not just dry up - he would definitely go insane.</p><p></p><p>After all, although spiritual awareness could recover, during the process of painting formations, it was constantly being gradually depleted, and this process was not very comfortable.</p><p></p><p>This was Moku's first time painting a proper formation, but it certainly would not be the last.</p><p></p><p>He planned to practice the Bright Fire Formation a few times every night. After a few days of complete familiarity, he would use materials from the Formation Pavilion to actually construct the formation. Once completed, he could exchange it with the supervisor for spirit stones, hopefully enough to cover the sect's monthly tuition fees, so his parents wouldn't have to work so hard.</p><p></p><p>"Let's stop here for tonight..."</p><p></p><p>The Bright Fire Formation on the stele glowed brilliantly. Moku admired it once more, nodding involuntarily with a hint of reluctance, before waving his hand to erase the formation.</p><p></p><p>In that instant of erasing it, his spiritual awareness was like the ebb and flow of the tides, the waxing and waning of the moon - the depleted spiritual energy instantly rushed back, refilling Moku's spiritual sea!</p><p></p><p>Moku stood before the stele, his spiritual awareness brimming, just like a few hours ago when he had first entered his spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>The sensation of spiritual awareness cycling from full to empty and back to full again was profound no matter how many times he experienced it.</p><p></p><p>But this experience was even more profound than any previous time.</p><p></p><p>Moku looked at the stele, its surface black and deep, appearing to be utter nothingness, yet seeming to contain everything, appearing to have nothing, yet able to manifest anything.</p><p></p><p>Transforming spiritual awareness into formations, reversing formations back into awareness - being and non-being, giving birth to each other in a cycle of mutual transformation.</p><p></p><p>Unbidden, a line from the ancient texts surfaced in Moku's mind:</p><p></p><p>"Existence is for benefit, non-existence is for utility!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

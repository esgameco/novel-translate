        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In front of the mountain path leading to the Zhuangwangju Residence, three cultivators were standing.</p><p></p><p>Among the three cultivators, two children stood in the front, with a veiled woman behind them. </p><p></p><p>One boy and one girl, they appeared slightly older than children drawn in ink paintings. Their clothes were splendid and luxurious, not of ordinary people. Just from their appearances, their status seemed extraordinary. At this moment, the two were respectfully standing on the steps in front of the gate, bowing towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The boy had handsome features, his eyes shining brightly. </p><p></p><p>The girl was extremely beautiful, with her skin appearing even more delicate and translucent than snow under the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>From afar, the two resembled divine children attending celestial beings.</p><p></p><p>Behind the two children stood a tall woman wearing a veil, her face obscured. She looked like a butler or bodyguard of a noble family. There were no fluctuations of spiritual energy around her, but she exuded an oppressive aura that Moku had never experienced before.</p><p></p><p>"It seems they are scions of a noble family, coming to seek tutelage from Master Zhuang..."</p><p></p><p>Moku pondered silently, but such matters were obviously up to Master Zhuang to decide, unrelated to himself.</p><p></p><p>Moku only needed to study formation arts well under Master Zhuang's guidance. After all, he was just a nominal disciple, unsure of how long Master Zhuang would teach him.</p><p></p><p>Moku headed up the mountain by himself, while the three at the gate naturally noticed him too. But seeing Moku's plain clothes and weak spiritual energy, they only gave him a cursory glance, paying him no real attention.</p><p></p><p>Until Moku walked right past them, ascending the distant mountain path into the cloudy dwelling.</p><p></p><p>Then, he simply stretched out his little hand and pushed open the bamboo gate that they had been waiting in vain to open for hours. He entered as casually as entering his own home...</p><p></p><p>Only then did the three show complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>The two children couldn't help glancing at the woman behind them, who shook her head slightly, signaling them to be patient. The two children then calmed down and continued waiting respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Moku entered the courtyard, set down the bamboo basket he was carrying, took out a plate of braised meat and a few plates of snacks, and placed them on the small table in the courtyard, so Master Zhuang could enjoy the scenery while eating or drinking tea after waking up.</p><p></p><p>Moku peeked into the inner room and indeed, the master was still sleeping in.</p><p></p><p>Moku then brought two boxes of freshly roasted pine nuts to Lao Tan, who had woken up early and was playing a solitary game of Five Elements Chess, his expression calm, unclear whether he found it interesting or boring.</p><p></p><p>Moku set the pine nuts aside, and Lao Tan tasted one, his expression slightly changing. "The flavor is different."</p><p></p><p>"There are two flavors - one roasted with fragrant licorice, the other with spicy seasonings. My mother said for you to try them, for a change of taste."</p><p></p><p>Lao Tan tasted one from each box, nodded slightly and said, "You go study formation arts first. Come play chess with me when you're tired."</p><p></p><p>Moku then ran to the study to find the unfinished formation manuals, took them to the large catalpa tree in the courtyard, sat on the small wooden stool at the little stone table, and studied the formation arts.</p><p></p><p>This little table and stool were specially made for Moku by Lao Tan and placed where Moku liked, with the height perfectly suited for him.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang was lax and did not make excessive demands of Moku. But Moku knew this opportunity was precious - he might never again have the chance to learn formation arts under such an expert's guidance.</p><p></p><p>So Moku studied diligently. For a scattered cultivator like him, even being just a nominal disciple was already a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Moku was grateful and never slacked off.</p><p></p><p>Studying formation manuals and drawing formation diagrams consumed spiritual energy. When Moku depleted his, he would recover through meditation, then continue reading and drawing until depleted again, at which point he would meditate to recover once more. But he should not continue meditating after depleting his energy again.</p><p></p><p>As Master Zhuang said, moderation is key. Although...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Momo didn't think there was any problem, but still followed Mr. Zhuang's teachings diligently. </p><p></p><p>When his spiritual energy was depleted and he couldn't read books or draw talismans, Momo would go find Old Gui to play chess.</p><p></p><p>The game of Five Elements Chess was simple and easy to understand, not requiring much mental effort, so it was relaxing to play.</p><p></p><p>After Momo and Old Gui played a few games, as dusk fell, Momo bid farewell to Mr. Zhuang and brought the empty plates and food containers back with him.</p><p></p><p>As the sun set in the west, with the red glow beside the mountains, when Momo left Mr. Zhuang's courtyard, he noticed the three people he had seen in the morning were still standing outside the gate. Though still respectful in posture and expression, they looked somewhat weary.</p><p></p><p>Even for cultivators, standing all day without food or drink would inevitably cause some discomfort, not to mention there were two children not much older than Momo.</p><p></p><p>However, Momo didn't want to meddle in other's affairs.</p><p></p><p>They had been standing outside the gate all day, so Mr. Zhuang must have known about it. In this situation, it was clear that Mr. Zhuang did not wish to see them.</p><p></p><p>Whether to see them or not, Mr. Zhuang must have his own plans. It was none of Momo's business to worry about it unnecessarily.</p><p></p><p>So Momo simply nodded briefly to the three as a greeting, then without a word, he slung his small basket over his shoulder and went down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The next day when Momo went up the mountain, he found the three were still standing outside the gate.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was scorching hot during the day and the night brought heavy dew and chill.</p><p></p><p>After standing for a day and night, the veiled woman was still fine thanks to her deep cultivation which could withstand heat and cold.</p><p></p><p>But the two children looked haggard. The boy's expression was grim, clearly gritting his teeth to persevere, his eyes full of defiance.  </p><p></p><p>The girl's face had grown even paler, looking like a dewy plum blossom, but her clear eyes also revealed determination.</p><p></p><p>Momo stole another glance, sighing that truly beautiful people looked beautiful no matter what.</p><p></p><p>But Momo's heart remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>In this world, the more beautiful a woman was, the less relevance she had to you.</p><p></p><p>Just like the day before, Momo pushed open the bamboo gate, ignoring the three's complicated and somewhat resentful gazes, and carried his little basket into Mr. Zhuang's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Momo thought the three would leave after three or four days at most, but they continued waiting outside the gate for seven days. The two children's faces were as pale as paper, yet showed no sign of giving up. Momo couldn't help but admire their perseverance.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit embarrassed, especially recalling that he had faced no obstacles when seeking an audience with Mr. Zhuang, while these three had stood for seven days without food or drink yet still couldn't even enter the gate.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Momo prepared some questions about talisman formations and deliberately went to consult Mr. Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang's expression was as usual, patiently answering while occasionally glancing towards the gate with a profound look, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Momo said, "Master, you don't wish to see the people outside?"</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang came back to his senses. Originally not intending to say anything, but seeing Momo, he said, "Old friends, with complicated karmic ties. I don't wish to get involved, so it's better not to see them."</p><p></p><p>Momo said, "Then shall I ask them to leave?"  </p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang's expression flickered slightly, "They've stood there for seven days. If they could leave, they would have left already. At this point, would they still listen to you?"</p><p></p><p>"How would we know if we don't try?" Momo smiled. "They've been standing outside for seven days, disturbing your peace. You can't even sleep well now."</p><p></p><p>Previously he often slept in until the afternoon, but now he was getting up at noon...</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang said with amusement, "Very well, you can try asking them to leave and not disturb the tranquility of this mountain."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Mo Shan also hurriedly rushed back.</p><p></p><p>When Mo Shan arrived at Xinglin Hall, his clothes were tattered and covered in mud. His arm was wrapped in a bandage, as if it had been torn open by some demonic beast, with bloodstains seeping through. </p><p></p><p>It seemed the demon hunting squad had just finished battling a demonic beast and he rushed back without having a chance to treat his wound.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that his wife's life was not in danger, Mo Shan finally breathed a sigh of relief. After Old Master Feng examined Liu Ruhua's condition, he also helped treat the wound on Mo Shan's arm.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Liu Ruhua went home to recuperate. Following Old Master Feng's instructions, she had to eat a light diet, avoid strenuous activity, take spirit pills on schedule, and could not use her spiritual power for a month.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan and his son stayed home for a few days, but were then kicked out by Liu Ruhuaâ€”Mo Shan was the captain of the demon hunting squad and had to lead his team to hunt demonic beasts, while Mo Hua was a disciple of their sect and had to go cultivate, unable to neglect his studies for too long.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Liu Ruhua could only not use her spiritual power, her normal life was not affected much.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan could only ask a neighboring auntie to help take care of her. He would come back whenever he had time, and Mo Hua would take leave from his teacher to come home and see her every ten days during his break.</p><p></p><p>His strict teacher was understanding and did not give Mo Hua a hard time, only reminding him not to neglect his cultivation and studies at the sect.</p><p></p><p>After a month, Liu Ruhua's health had mostly recovered. Although she still could not use spiritual power and would cough incessantly if she tried, otherwise there was no other harm.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was finally relieved, but found that his mother did not seem very happy. She would still smile, but her expression was obviously much more dejected than before, often spacing out alone.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was very worried but could not figure out why, so he went to ask Mo Shan.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan sighed and told Mo Hua: "Your mother's thoughts are simple. What she wants most is to save up some spirit stones for you to cultivate properly, to watch you grow into an adult, and eventually take a wife and have children... But now your mother cannot use her spiritual power, so naturally she cannot do anything, let alone earn spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"She has been busy for most of her life, but now that she suddenly cannot do anything or help you at all, her heart feels rather empty..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua felt uncomfortable hearing this and asked: "Doesn't mother have any other interests? Like pill refining, talisman arraying and so on..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan pondered and said: "Your mother doesn't seem particularly interested in those. But she does quite enjoy cooking. I'm not just praising her, but within ten li around, no one makes better dishes than your mother."</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan sighed again: "When your mother and I became sworn cultivation partners back then, I bragged that I would open a restaurant for her to specialize in studying all kinds of cuisines. But all these years, she has just been suffering hardships with me. I never kept that promise..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his remorseful father, Mo Hua knew he could not be blamed.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan's cultivation level and methods were among the best demon hunters around. All these years, he risked his life battling demonic beasts, always returning home covered in blood. Even so, their family income was never enough.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, the life of a lower-level vagrant cultivator was just too difficult - it was exhausting just to make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>So Mo Hua said: "Don't worry father, I will definitely help mother open a big restaurant in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan knew his son was just trying to console him. He patted Mo Hua's head and said gratefully: "Good!"</p><p></p><p>But without spiritual power, even working as a chef required its use. Even if they opened a restaurant, without spiritual power, it would be very difficult for her to be the chef.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his dejected wife, Mo Shan felt pained. He patted Mo Hua's shoulder and said, "Spend more time talking to your mother when you can. Sometimes she listens to you better than me. Don't let her dwell too much."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Mo Hua nodded.</p><p></p><p>After that, whenever Mo Hua was free, he would actively keep Liu Ruhua company and chat with her. Her complexion did improve somewhat, but when alone, she would still look dejected.</p><p></p><p>"If only mother could use her spiritual power," Mo Hua thought, but knew it was unlikely.</p><p></p><p>An illness comes like a mountain, but its departure is like a trailing thread. Moreover, this was an illness built up over many years - it could only be alleviated through gradual recuperation, unlikely to be cured quickly.</p><p></p><p>There were certainly heavenly treasures in the cultivation world that could cure it, as Old Master Feng had mentioned a few, but a family like Mo Hua's had no way to acquire them, let alone afford them.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua could only give up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, the hottest period of the year arrived. The sun hung high, the floor was scorching, and the Immortal Gate also followed tradition and...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>For example, the summer vacation that lasted over a month had begun.</p><p></p><p>A winter break and a summer break were the two longest vacations of the year. </p><p></p><p>The weather was scorching hot, and even demons didn't like to appear much. The demons that did appear were all fire-type, with stronger demonic powers in this weather, making them extremely difficult to deal with. So the summer vacation period was also the off-season for demon hunting.</p><p></p><p>Moxuan would stay home for a relatively long time, only occasionally going out for a few days when a team member discovered some valuable demons, then returning with some spirit stones or fur and such from the demons.</p><p></p><p>Once when Moxuan went out for a few days, he brought back a large bundle upon returning home. When Mohua opened it, she found it was a large bundle of beef tendon. She couldn't help but open her mouth wide, "Dad, this is..."</p><p></p><p>"This is wild ox meat. It doesn't have much spiritual energy and isn't worth much money, but compared to other demons, the meat quality isn't too bad and doesn't have too strong a smell."</p><p></p><p>"The demon hunting team didn't have much gain recently. We only got this wild ox. After skinning it and cutting the meat, we couldn't even sell it because everyone complained the beef was too tough and old, impossible to cook tender or chew. So we each took some and brought it back to eat." Moxuan explained.</p><p></p><p>Mohua said uncertainly, "Dad, are you going to cook this meat?"</p><p></p><p>Moxuan rubbed Mohua's head. "What? You don't think your dad's cooking is good?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua smiled without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>At noon, Moxuan stewed the beef. It took him a great effort to finally cook it tender, serving it in a large open white porcelain bowl.</p><p></p><p>"Try it and see how it tastes!"</p><p></p><p>The white porcelain bowl contained reddish-brown braised beef.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the beef, Liu Ruhua put down her chopsticks and only used a spoon to scoop up a mouthful of soup, slowly drinking it.</p><p></p><p>Mohua, however, picked up a piece of beef and put it in her mouth. After chewing a few times, her teeth felt sore, and the meat stubbornly refused to be chewed apart.</p><p></p><p>Mohua awkwardly but politely spit out the meat, also picking up a spoon to drink some soup, then praising, "The soup is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Moxuan glared at him unhappily, "The soup is made from the sauce your mother prepared, of course it's good."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua smiled faintly, "I know you mean well, but this dish is not something that can be made casually. Even using spiritual power to stoke the stove fire to cook things, there are quite a few points to pay attention to - when to use high heat, when to use low heat, when to add what sauce ingredients and how much...it takes skill."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mohua suddenly asked, "So if it's cooked for a long enough time, could this beef be stewed soft?"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua said, "In theory yes, but a cultivator would have to watch the pot day and night, constantly using spiritual power to stoke the stove fire..."</p><p></p><p>"An ordinary cultivator definitely couldn't do that, and any cultivator capable probably wouldn't be that bored," Moxuan also said.</p><p></p><p>"What about using a formation array?" Mohua's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"A formation array..." Liu Ruhua thought for a moment, then said, "I'm not too sure about that. But I've heard the head chef at the restaurant say that some large restaurants have artifact refiners make special stoves, and then array masters draw formation arrays on them. That way, they only need spirit stones to power it, allowing long simmering of ingredients without expending a cultivator's spiritual power. However, hiring an array master is very expensive. At least the previous restaurant couldn't afford to build such a stove."</p><p></p><p>"I see..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua looked pensive.</p><p></p><p>Moxuan also picked up a piece of beef and put it in his mouth. After failing to chew it, he had to admit, "Indeed, it's not easy to chew." Then he just swallowed it whole, using his spiritual power to forcibly refine it.</p><p></p><p>That night, while practicing array formations on the remnant stele, Mohua was also thinking about the restaurant matter.</p><p></p><p>The next day, instead of drawing arrays at home, Mohua went out into the scorching sun towards North Street.</p><p></p><p>The sweltering heat made him sweat profusely after just a few steps. Nevertheless, there were still some small street vendors enduring the blazing sun, feebly hawking their wares.</p><p></p><p>Mohua arrived at North Street and found the largest restaurant there - the Fulu Restaurant. He asked the manager, "Is your young master surnamed An, called An Xiaopang...no, An Xiaofu?"</p><p></p><p>The manager didn't look down on Mohua for his ordinary attire. Instead, guessing from Mohua's familiar manner that he might truly be an acquaintance of the young master, he politely replied, "You're correct, young sir. The young master is upstairs. Shall I announce you?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua also replied courteously, "If you could please inform him that a fellow cultivator surnamed Mo wishes to see him on some matter."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The Moshi couple was delighted to hear that their son Moshi Hua was recommended by Master Yan to take an array formation master as his teacher. </p><p></p><p>Moshi Shan originally had some reservations, but after thinking it over, he felt there was nothing to worry about. Master Yan had taught at the Tonxian Gate for many years and had a good reputation. Anyone recommended by Master Yan must have an extraordinary background.</p><p></p><p>The Moshi family were just ordinary cultivators with no spirit stones or family assets, so they didn't need to suspect others of plotting against them. Moreover, it was rare for them to even get to meet an array master of such status.</p><p></p><p>With Moshi Hua now studying array formations and living at home, Liu Ruhua could see her son every day and cook for him, which made her even happier.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, after eating the hearty breakfast prepared by Liu Ruhua, Moshi Hua set out for Southeast Mountain to seek apprenticeship from Master Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>When Moshi Hua arrived at the foot of the mountain and followed the small path to the bamboo gate, he noticed there was actually a plaque in front of the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>The plaque read "Sitting and Forgetting Dwelling." He didn't know why he didn't see it yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua entered the Sitting and Forgetting Dwelling and saw Master Zhuang idly sitting by the pool, one hand propping his chin, the other holding a fishing rod made of bamboo with no bait on the empty line.</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua peeked into the pool and found there were no fish at all.</p><p></p><p>He thought Master Zhuang might have some profound meaning behind this, so he looked up at him again, only to find Master Zhuang wasn't actually fishing, but just dozing with his chin propped up.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the old man who greeted Moshi Hua yesterday called him over and said:</p><p></p><p>"The master often nods off. When he's napping, just ignore him and don't disturb him."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay."</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua nodded, feeling a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The old man continued, "I'm the...steward here, taking care of the master's daily needs. You can call me Old Gao."</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua politely said, "Old Gao Grandpa."</p><p></p><p>Old Gao glanced at Moshi Hua but didn't say anything. Instead, he took out a chess board and asked, "Do you play chess?"</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua looked at the board. "This is Five Elements Chess?"</p><p></p><p>There were many types of chess games in the cultivation world, such as Bagua Chess, Five Elements Chess, Heavenly Origin Chess, Three Talents Chess, and so on. Five Elements Chess was one of the simplest and most popular, mainly used to introduce the concepts of the five elements' productive and overcoming cycles to children cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The rules were simple. Each side controlled two types of chess pieces. Different elemental pieces would randomly appear on the board, only revealing their attributes when flipped over. One's own productive cycle pieces were stronger, while the opponent's overcoming cycle pieces could capture them.</p><p></p><p>It was a fun and thoughtless game, perfect for cultivator children to exercise their minds.</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua himself was fine with Five Elements Chess, but the weathered Old Gao also playing it...</p><p></p><p>Old Gao seemed to read Moshi Hua's thoughts. "You think Five Elements Chess is too simple?"</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua hesitated for a moment, then said tactfully, "The greatest way is the simplest. The more simple something is, the more profound it can be."</p><p></p><p>Old Gao was stunned, pondering for a bit before realizing, "That's a good reason. Next time I invite someone to play chess, I'll use that line."</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua: "......"</p><p></p><p>So Moshi Hua started playing chess with Old Gao.</p><p></p><p>At first, Moshi Hua thought Old Gao must be a master and was fully focused, but after a few rounds he realized Old Gao was evenly matched with him - neither was better than the other. He relaxed and they both enjoyed the game immensely.</p><p></p><p>Before they knew it, it was noon. Only then did Moshi Hua remember why he had come here in the first place...</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang had been napping by the pool, sleeping through the whole morning. He opened his eyes now, glanced at the sun's position, and nodded, "It's time for lunch."</p><p></p><p>So after spending the whole morning playing chess and killing time, Moshi Hua ended up mooching another meal.</p><p></p><p>The dishes were cooked by Old Gao - there was meat, vegetables, and rice, all imbued with spiritual energy. But the taste was, to put it mildly, indescribable.</p><p></p><p>From Old Gao's demeanor, he didn't seem skilled at cooking meals.</p><p></p><p>But Master Zhuang didn't mind. To him, grains entering the belly and transforming into energy - the sense of taste was an illusion. No matter the flavor, he ate every bite and sip with serene elegance, as if consuming not grains but the wind and dew of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Moshi Hua felt that Master Zhuang's...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Her demeanor was truly graceful and dashing, which made him feel somewhat envious inside. Mozhua tried to imitate Master Zhuang's manner of eating slowly and elegantly with chopsticks, but failed to fully capture it, appearing a bit awkward. In the end, he simply picked up the bowl and ate the rice directly. </p><p></p><p>Although the food didn't taste that great, the ingredients were of top quality and imbued with spiritual energy. Besides, Mozhua was not particularly picky about food anyway.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mozhua eating with relish, the old Daoist master served him a few more pieces of meat.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Master Zhuang finally seemed to remember why Mozhua had come, and led him to a bamboo pavilion in the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>A cool breeze wafted through along with the swishing sounds of bamboo.</p><p></p><p>"I've taken in disciples before, but what they studied was different from you, so it's hard to generalize. Let me first see what level you've reached in formation studies."</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang then asked Mozhua a few questions, which Mozhua answered one by one.</p><p></p><p>After Mozhua finished, Master Zhuang pondered for a moment, took out a thick book, and instructed Mozhua:</p><p></p><p>"Your knowledge of formation theory is too shallow. What you've learned are just some basic formation patterns, scattered and incomplete. With such a shaky foundation, it will be difficult to understand more profound formations later on. On the path of formations, you won't be able to go far."</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang handed the book to Mozhua and said:</p><p></p><p>"You should start from the most basic things. This book contains some fundamental formation theories in the cultivation world, covering different schools, attributes, and lineages. First commit these to memory. If you can understand, then understand. If not, come ask me. Once your foundation in formation theory is solid, I'll teach you how to draw formations."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua received the thick formation manual and said, "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang waved his hand. "Feel free to find a comfortable spot in the courtyard to read. I need to meditate now."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua took his leave, hugged the "Source Theory of Formations", found a shady spot under a tree, lay down on the soft grass, and began reading.</p><p></p><p>The "Source Theory" began by explaining that ancient immortals observed celestial phenomena and examined terrestrial patterns. From the transformations of all things in heaven and earth, they comprehended the Dao and manifested it as formations. By operating formations that emulated the workings of the Dao, they could wield immeasurable power.</p><p></p><p>Among the myriad cultivation arts, only formations were the most direct and fundamental way to realize the Dao, while also being the most demanding on one's spiritual cognition.</p><p></p><p>Formation masters were ranked in nine grades, with the ninth grade being the highest. Above the ninth grade were immortals, called immortal formation masters.</p><p></p><p>However, immortal formation masters were only spoken of in legends. For nearly twenty thousand years, no one had truly become an immortal, let alone an immortal formation master. No one knew what earth-shaking, heaven-overturning immortal formations looked like.</p><p></p><p>Not just immortal formation masters, but even ninth grade formation masters had no records. Eighth grade masters were also legends. The recorded ones were a few sixth or seventh grade masters from great clans, ancient sects, or top-ranking Daoist officials - all peerless cultivators already out of reach.</p><p></p><p>Records of fifth to third grade formation masters became more numerous, but below that there were none, indicating lower-ranked masters had no chance of being recorded unless they made unprecedented breakthroughs in formations.</p><p></p><p>After the history of formations, the book analyzed different formation lineages and various formation terminology.</p><p></p><p>Due to different clans, sects, and regions, formation lineages diverged greatly. Even within the same formation lineage, there could be minor branches with subtle differences in learning, research, application, and effects.</p><p></p><p>Major powers all treated their core formations as secrets, researching and applying them independently, resulting in a situation of diverse blossoming yet closed-door development in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Categorized by formation types, there were yin-yang formations, three realms formations, four symbols formations, five phases formations, six harmonies formations, seven stars formations, eight trigrams formations, and so on. The most widely transmitted and used were the five phases and eight trigrams formations, while other formations had their own specialized purposes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Mozhua spent most of the day skimming through the "Source Theory of Formations". After finishing, he felt enlightened yet also acutely aware of his own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>For Mozhua, becoming even a first grade formation master would be no easy feat, let alone a seventh, eighth, ninth grade or immortal master. The path of formations was as vast as an ocean, and Mozhua, not even a first grade master yet, was but a tiny speck within it.</p><p></p><p>Tomorrow there will be a new chapter release, hehe ~(=^_^=)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

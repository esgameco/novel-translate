        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Moxiang returned home under the blazing sun. He picked up the teapot on the table, gulped down a few big mouthfuls of tea, and finally felt the summer heat dissipate. Then he went back to his room, took out paper and pen, and began planning.</p><p></p><p>First was the stove furnace. </p><p></p><p>The stove furnace was a type of spirit apparatus.</p><p></p><p>The spirit apparatuses used by cultivators covered a wide range, including swords, spears, staves for attack, armor and robes for defense, hairpins, jade pendants for spellcasting, as well as pots, pans, and stove furnaces needed for daily life.</p><p></p><p>Moxiang's understanding of refining apparatuses was limited to the basic theoretical knowledge learned from the Introductory Apparatus Refining course at Tongxian School, such as the key points of using a refining furnace, forging iron, and quenching.</p><p></p><p>But he had no ability to actually refine apparatuses himself.  </p><p></p><p>In the apparatus refining course at Tongxian School, students would also have to refine apparatuses themselves. However, since Moxiang was physically weak and couldn't even swing a hammer properly for the basic ironworking, the instructors didn't force him.</p><p></p><p>Now to refine a stove furnace, which was no ordinary spirit apparatus, he could only seek out a specialized apparatus refiner.</p><p></p><p>Next was the array formation. The Molten Fire Array contained five array lines, which would be quite taxing for Moxiang's current level.</p><p></p><p>The array formations Moxiang had drawn before mostly only contained four array lines at most.  </p><p></p><p>For cultivators at the Qi Condensation realm, each additional array line made a significant difference in the array's effect. A difference of just one array line represented a major hurdle for the array master.</p><p></p><p>Moxiang drew array formations every day and practiced on the stele to hone his skills, so his spiritual sense had strengthened considerably. He could draw four-line arrays with ease, but five-line arrays were another story.</p><p></p><p>There was also another difficulty - this Molten Fire Array had to be drawn on the stove furnace itself.  </p><p></p><p>The furnace walls of a refining furnace were made of refined iron, which had poor ink absorption compared to paper, making drawing arrays on it much harder than on paper and consuming more spiritual power and spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>According to the Elementary Array Theory by Instructor Yan, the medium that carried the array formation was called the "array medium" by array masters.  </p><p></p><p>The most common array medium used by array masters was paper, followed by iron, wood, earth and stone.</p><p></p><p>Moxiang had only drawn on paper before. Drawing directly on a refining furnace was uncharted territory, and he didn't know if there would be any issues.</p><p></p><p>Moxiang pondered for a bit, sighed, and decided to just take it one step at a time.</p><p></p><p>The most pressing matter was finding a way to obtain the complete Molten Fire Array diagram.</p><p></p><p>The next day after breakfast, Moxiang went to find Manager Mo first.</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo was a bit plump and afraid of heat, lying listlessly on the counter with a fan beside him inscribed with an array to power it with spiritual energy, fanning constantly.</p><p></p><p>But in such sweltering heat, it was just blowing hot air around.</p><p></p><p>Moxiang said, "Manager Mo, I noticed the other shops have drawn ice-attribute arrays on their walls for cooling. Why don't you get one too?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo gave Moxiang a listless glare and said, "Do you know how expensive a whole set of those arrays costs? Give me some spirit stones and I'll get one!"</p><p></p><p>Moxiang chuckled, then sat at a nearby table, pouring himself a cup of tea to sip slowly.</p><p></p><p>In this quiet little teahouse, Moxiang was the most familiar regular customer. Manager Mo didn't mind him doing as he pleased, burying his head back into the counter.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his tea, Moxiang asked, "Manager Mo, do you have a diagram for the Molten Fire Array here?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo lifted his head, annoyed. "This is a shop specializing in array formations. What kind of array diagram don't I have?"</p><p></p><p>Moxiang didn't believe him. "Even second-grade arrays?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo slammed the counter angrily. "Don't be cheeky, kid!" Then he asked suspiciously, "Why do you need the Molten Fire Array diagram?"</p><p></p><p>"I saw this array drawn on the stoves at the restaurant and got curious, so I'm asking," Moxiang thought for a bit, then added, "Manager Mo, do you know if there are any special considerations for drawing the Molten Fire Array on stoves?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo said listlessly, "It's just a Molten Fire Array, what special considerations could there be? A few restaurants wanted to build new stoves last year and bought the array diagrams from me. I have all their stove array designs here."</p><p></p><p>Moxiang's eyes lit up. "Can I take a look?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"Just a quick look!" Moxiang pleaded.</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo was about to refuse again, but hesitated and sighed instead.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>With a helpless tone, he took out a large blueprint from a cabinet behind him and placed it on the table.</p><p></p><p>"You can only look at this here. In theory, these things are supposed to be kept confidential and can't be shown to others casually." </p><p></p><p>Ink Painting opened up the blueprint and saw it contained the design plans for a stove furnace. The blueprint was densely covered with annotations, including materials needed for the furnace, locations matching the corresponding talisman patterns, even the dimensions of the talisman patterns, specifying how certain strokes should be varied, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Curiously, Ink Painting asked, "Are these talisman patterns different from ordinary ones, requiring the strokes and dimensions to be specified?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course," the clerk explained. "The core talisman patterns are standardized, but their specific applications differ. For some standardized spiritual devices with identical scales and dimensions, the patterns can be uniformly drawn. But for some specially customized spiritual devices, the patterns need to be modified according to the device's shape to properly accommodate it."</p><p></p><p>"For example, this furnace stove was specially customized for the Palace Kitchen, different from those used by other households. Naturally, the Smelt Fire Talisman inside also needs to be altered based on the stove's size, shape and structure to properly match it..."</p><p></p><p>"I see..." Ink Painting nodded in understanding. </p><p></p><p>He carefully studied the blueprint, trying to commit the key points to memory for reference.</p><p></p><p>After Ink Painting had looked at it for a while, the clerk collected the blueprint.</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting then asked, "Clerk Mo, can I borrow a copy of the Smelt Fire Talisman blueprint?"</p><p></p><p>The clerk had expected this request. He took out a copy of the Smelt Fire Talisman and said, "Normally this blueprint costs ten spirit stones. I won't charge you the stones, but you must return it to me undamaged after viewing it."</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting was surprised. "Ten spirit stones? That's quite expensive!"</p><p></p><p>"Of course," the clerk fanned himself. "You can't compare it to those low-level talismans with only two or three pattern strokes. Those are a dime a dozen and you can get the blueprints anywhere. But blueprints for talismans with four strokes, especially five or more, are much rarer. The more strokes a talisman contains, the more potent its effects, so naturally the blueprints are more valuable."</p><p></p><p>He continued waving his fan, "Some blueprints containing ten or more talisman strokes are even closely guarded ancestral secrets of certain clans and families. Not only could you never buy them with spirit stones, you wouldn't even be allowed to glimpse them!"</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting was amazed to learn that reaching the higher realms of talisman studies was indeed extremely difficult. Without proper inheritance, it would be impossible to even begin learning.</p><p></p><p>He gratefully accepted the Smelt Fire Talisman blueprint from Clerk Mo. </p><p></p><p>The clerk said it was no big deal and not to be so courteous, but his expression showed he appreciated the gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Clerk Mo advised Ink Painting:</p><p></p><p>"It's fine to research this, but don't get carried away or obsessed with it. If your spiritual awareness is overly consumed and your spiritual sea is damaged, it could cause endless troubles for a talisman master."</p><p></p><p>After a pause and a cough, he added, "Pass this message to your elder brother as well..."</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting smiled, gave the clerk a courtesy, and left the Destiny Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, Ink Painting first made a handwritten copy of the furnace stove blueprint for reference.</p><p></p><p>There was a lot of information on it that he didn't fully record, only noting the key points. But this was enough.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to fully replicate the Palace Kitchen's furnace design anyway, and even if he did, he lacked the spirit stones required to forge it.</p><p></p><p>After roughly copying down the blueprint, Ink Painting went out again to a refinery workshop at the end of the street.</p><p></p><p>The refinery was rather shabby but quite spacious, with various spiritual devices and household items like candlesticks, teapots, pots, hairpins, bracelets, and even swords and armor scattered about in a disorderly fashion.</p><p></p><p>An old signboard hung in front reading "Chen's Refinery Workshop" - it was quite worn and covered in soot, having been used for many years.</p><p></p><p>This was the refinery that Ink Painting had heard about from Big Tiger and the others, said to be the oldest and best in the area.</p><p></p><p>The refinery's blacksmith was named Chen, whom everyone called Master Chen...</p><p></p><p>(The chapter ends here)</p>

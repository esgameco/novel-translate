        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel to English:</p><p></p><p>After Mozhua entered Tonglian Gate, his new life at the sect began for the year. </p><p></p><p>Tonglian Gate was a first-rank sect, the lowest level of sects in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The ranks of sects in the cultivation world were very strict. </p><p></p><p>When a sect was first established, it needed to have its rank determined and assessed by the Dao Court.</p><p></p><p>The requirements for determining rank were very stringent, strictly evaluating the sect's assets, the mountains it occupied, the depth of its inherited traditions, whether the sect leader had any moral flaws, the cultivation levels and numbers of its elders and instructors, the number of disciples it could accept, and more.</p><p></p><p>Advancing a sect's rank was even more rigorous - it required having multiple high-level cultivators residing there to preach the Dao for a certain number of years before applying for advancement at the Celestial Authority Hall of the Dao Court. </p><p></p><p>For any sect, advancing its rank was a paramount priority that required years of preparation, maintaining good relations with the Dao Court, and expending tremendous human effort and financial resources.</p><p></p><p>In Tonglian Gate, only the old sect leader had reached the Foundation Establishment realm, far from meeting the conditions for a second-rank sect. It was estimated they would not qualify for advancement for another hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Tonglian Gate's assets only consisted of three mountain peaks: Tongling Peak, Tongxuan Peak, and Tongming Peak.</p><p></p><p>On the outer sect's Tongling Peak, disciples from the early Qi Refining levels 1-3 cultivated and studied the Dao. On Tongxuan Peak were the middle Qi Refining levels 4-6, and the extremely few late Qi Refining levels 7-9 outer disciples were also there, since there were so few of them they were just accommodated together.</p><p></p><p>The inner sect disciples, direct disciples, as well as the sect leader, elders and instructors were all on Tongming Peak.</p><p></p><p>It was said there used to be a Tonglian Peak solely for the sect leader and elders to reside and cultivate on, but due to the sect's poor management and inability to repay debts, they had to sell it off in tears.</p><p></p><p>How could a Tonglian Gate not have a Tonglian Peak?</p><p></p><p>Every generation of Tonglian Gate's sect leaders vowed to redeem Tonglian Peak, but this grand aspiration had yet to be realized.</p><p></p><p>The disciples on each of Tonglian Gate's peaks were further divided into four classes: A, B, C and D, with their talent and the sect's emphasis on cultivating them decreasing from A class down.</p><p></p><p>The A class generally only recruited so-called "sons of heaven" - those with good spiritual roots, high aptitudes and fast cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you had connections with the sect leader or elders, or were willing to donate a considerable sum of spirit stones to the sect, you could also enter the A class.</p><p></p><p>In short, either have talent, connections or spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The B class accepted disciples with average spiritual roots but decent aptitudes, who were diligent and had decent overall performance.</p><p></p><p>C class disciples had average spiritual roots, aptitudes and performance. D class disciples were even worse in spiritual roots and performance, basically just getting by.</p><p></p><p>Mozhua was placed in the B class, having average spiritual roots but being quite diligent with decent overall coursework.</p><p></p><p>Having only reached the second level of Qi Refining, Mozhua's accommodations and cultivation took place on Tongling Peak, which had the most disciples at Tonglian Gate.</p><p></p><p>After entering the sect and greeting his familiar fellow disciples, Mozhua began a year of study and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even the poorest cultivators would try to scrape together some spirit stones to allow their children to enter a sect and cultivate, at least laying some foundational cultivation basics and not being completely ignorant of the various knowledges of the cultivation world. So Tonglian Gate had the most disciples in the early Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they could continue cultivating into the middle Qi Refining stage, it depended first on the cultivator's innate talent, and second on their family's financial resources.</p><p></p><p>Some scattered cultivator families simply could not afford spirit stones, so their children had to drop out, do odd jobs like forging tools or hunting demons to get by. The 100 spirit stone tuition per year was no small sum - otherwise the family would starve before the child could make it as a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>As for those able to reach the late Qi Refining stage and continue cultivating in the sect...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Those with good family backgrounds were already few and far between. </p><p></p><p>Moku was familiar with several fellow disciples, but they had disappeared. Upon inquiring, he learned that due to their impoverished family situations and encountering difficulties, they could not afford to pay the tuition fees, so they had to drop out of school.</p><p></p><p>The path of cultivation is vast and profound. Without a teacher's guidance, one could wander down many wrong paths. Dropping out during the early Qi Refining stage, unless they encountered an extraordinary opportunity, it would be very difficult to make any further progress in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moku let out a slight sigh, feeling regretful, but his own circumstances were not much better, so he did not dwell on it too long.  </p><p></p><p>Moku attended classes while also cultivating. In his free time, he drew talismanic formations, living a busy yet fulfilling life.</p><p></p><p>A few months later, without realizing it, Moku broke through to the third level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating at the Qi Refining stage relied more on perseverance and accumulation. By diligently cultivating every day, the spirit stones would gradually accumulate, allowing a smooth breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But what scattered cultivators lacked most was always spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Breakthroughs at lower realms could be achieved through accumulation, but breakthroughs at the middle realms would encounter bottlenecks. These bottlenecks required corresponding heavenly treasures or elixirs to aid in the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>As for breakthroughs to higher realms, such as from Qi Refining to Foundation Establishment, it depended more on destiny. For most lower-level scattered cultivators, it was an insurmountable chasm in their lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Each realm breakthrough brought immense benefits to cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the third level of Qi Refining, Moku felt his spiritual power was more abundant, and his spiritual sense naturally became stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Bright Fire Formation, which he had previously struggled to draw, now came effortlessly, and he didn't even need to rest much after completing it.</p><p></p><p>Although it was within his expectations, Moku was still pleasantly surprised.</p><p></p><p>No wonder so many cultivators endured the tedium of cultivation, single-mindedly pursuing realm breakthroughs. The simple, unadorned joy obtained after such tedium was true happiness.</p><p></p><p>At ten years old, with the third level of Qi Refining, Moku's cultivation was considered above average in the second-grade class.</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the third level of Qi Refining, Moku had to choose a cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>One day after class, Instructor Yan asked the disciples who had reached the third level of Qi Refining, including Moku, to stay behind.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan then got straight to the point:</p><p></p><p>"This was originally Instructor Zhou's responsibility, but since he is feeling unwell, I'm temporarily taking over to discuss cultivation methods with you."</p><p></p><p>"For cultivators, spiritual power is most important. Whether it's body cultivation or spirit cultivation, drawing formations, refining pills, forging artifacts, or making talismans, all require the use of spiritual power. With strong spiritual power, you will surpass others. With weak spiritual power, you will fall behind. The fundamental difference between cultivators lies in their spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator's spiritual power is determined by their cultivation method, and the cultivation method is determined by their spiritual root. Different spiritual roots require different cultivation methods, and the cultivation method determines the strength of one's spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual root is inborn and predetermined by Heaven; it cannot be changed later in life. You cannot choose your spiritual root, but you can choose which cultivation method to practice."</p><p></p><p>"Choosing a suitable cultivation method will greatly benefit your future cultivation. With a slightly inferior spiritual root, practicing the right method can still lead to a relatively long cultivation path. However, if you have a superior spiritual root but practice the wrong method, it is essentially cutting off your path to longevity."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, regardless of the quality of your spiritual root, the matter of choosing a cultivation method must be treated with the utmost caution..."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation method, huh..." Moku pondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Moku had a lower-grade minor five elemental spiritual root, which was considered below average among his peers in Tongshen City.</p><p></p><p>He wondered what kind of cultivation method would suit his spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

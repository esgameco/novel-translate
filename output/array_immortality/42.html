        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>There were clouds and mist among the mountains. Within the mist was a courtyard, and in the courtyard was a bamboo gate. A small winding path led from the gate down to Mozhua's feet. </p><p></p><p>At first glance, nothing seemed out of the ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Mozhua took a step onto the small path, and then his spiritual sense felt a ripple, as if something had been triggered. </p><p></p><p>But looking around, the surrounding mountains were still mountains, the trees still trees, the flowers and plants unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Mozhua paused and surveyed the area, but still couldn't detect anything unusual. </p><p></p><p>He had heard that some senior cultivators enjoyed setting up formations or situations to test others. He wondered if the senior here on the mountain had the same habit.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps this small path itself was already a test? </p><p></p><p>Mozhua felt a bit inexplicably nervous. Since there was a ripple in his spiritual sense, this small path most likely had a formation set upon it.</p><p></p><p>But what kind of formation was it? With Mozhua's limited knowledge of formations, he had no clue. No matter how he looked, the surroundings seemed completely normal.</p><p></p><p>Mozhua pondered as he walked, but couldn't figure it out. He could only follow his teacher's instructions - keep a clear mind, go with the flow, neither forcing it nor getting discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Walking this way, he eventually arrived at the courtyard gate. The bamboo gate was simple but had a quaint charm.</p><p></p><p>Passing through, the view opened up to reveal a picturesque courtyard, with a few elegant bamboo dwellings. Emerald grass covered the ground, a pond rippled, cranes drank from the dew - just looking at it made one's heart feel refreshed.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard stood a withered old man. Mozhua hurriedly paid his respects: "Greetings, Master."</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice matched his appearance, raspy and parched, like the sound of rotten wood decaying in the wind: "I'm not the master, the master is inside. Follow me."</p><p></p><p>He led Mozhua into one of the bamboo dwellings. Simple and unadorned, the dwelling allowed the breeze to flow through.</p><p></p><p>Seated in the middle was a middle-aged cultivator in white robes. Extremely handsome, with a carefree and unrestrained demeanor. With just a glance, he exuded a sense of detachment, as if untethered from all worldly matters.</p><p></p><p>He was the most spiritually transcendent person Mozhua had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>When the middle-aged cultivator saw Mozhua, he smiled amiably. "You must be Mozhua. Master Yan told me about you. I'll ask you some questions which you can answer freely, no need to be reserved. Just say whatever comes to mind."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua bowed. "Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>"My surname is Zhuang. You can address me as Master Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua bowed again. "Master Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang nodded slightly. "On that small path up the mountain earlier, what did you see?"</p><p></p><p>Mozhua thought for a moment. "There were mountains, trees, flowers, plants, and a small path."</p><p></p><p>"Anything else?" Master Zhuang asked with interest. "Didn't you see any people or events?"</p><p></p><p>Mozhua shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang said, "There was a formation on that path, called the Water Mirror Formation, gifted to me by a fellow cultivator long ago. When someone walks it for the first time, it can reveal glimpses of their past experiences or future events."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua was shocked. There were actually formations that could reveal the past and future?</p><p></p><p>If he didn't see anything, did that mean he had no future...?</p><p></p><p>Mozhua felt a bit anxious, but remembering his teacher's instructions, he honestly said, "I didn't see anything else..."</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang looked slightly surprised, then nodded. "I see." He took out a formation diagram and continued, "Here are brushes and ink. Draw out this formation diagram as much as you can."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua glanced at the diagram - it was the Stilling Water Formation that Master Yan had tested him on before.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Mozhua took the brushes and paper and began drawing the formation while referring to the diagram.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Mozhua's spiritual energy was depleted, and he could only draw five and a half strokes of the formation lines.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It had only been a few days since the last time he drew the water formation array, but Moku's spiritual awareness had not grown quickly enough in such a short time to draw an array with six pattern lines. </p><p></p><p>This time, the array he drew was just a bit more skillful than the last, with neater brushstrokes.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang looked at the array Moku had drawn, slightly raising his eyebrows, and then said:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. Would you like to become my officially recognized disciple? I won't teach you the sect's array methods, but if you wish to learn the commonly used arrays in the cultivation world, I can teach you those."</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know why, it seemed Moku had passed Master Zhuang's test. </p><p></p><p>Moku was overjoyed and respectfully bowed to Master Zhuang, saying: "Thank you Master, your disciple is willing!"</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, there were two types of master-disciple relationships - officially recognized disciples and inner disciples.</p><p></p><p>Inner disciples called their master "Shifu" and received direct transmission from the master. The relationship of "one day as master, lifelong as father" was deeply cherished.</p><p></p><p>For officially recognized disciples, it was much more casual. The master taught whatever he wished, and the disciple could not call him "Shifu", only "Master/Xiansheng". There was affection between them, but not as deep as an inner disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, Moku was already grateful that Master Zhuang was willing to accept him as an officially recognized disciple.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang nodded slightly, "You can return home today. Come back tomorrow at the Chen hour and I'll start teaching you some array methods."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Moku bowed again, this time the bow of a disciple to a master, bid farewell to Master Zhuang, and left his courtyard with light steps.</p><p></p><p>When Moku reached the foot of the mountain, he found Instructor Yan still waiting there. Upon learning that Master Zhuang agreed to take Moku as a student, Yan also breathed a sigh of relief and said approvingly:</p><p></p><p>"For Master Zhuang to value you so highly is your good fortune. You must cherish this opportunity well. Master Zhuang is a great master and you must show him the utmost respect."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Instructor," Moku replied.</p><p></p><p>The two walked along the mountain path for a while, when suddenly Moku curiously asked: "Instructor, have you been to Master Zhuang's courtyard? When we passed that small path, what did you see?"</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan turned his head, silently looking at Moku. After a moment, he said:</p><p></p><p>"When I walked that small path, I vaguely saw some visions flash by. Those fleeting visions told me that Master Zhuang was willing to take you as a disciple, and that you would also become an extraordinary array master in the future."</p><p></p><p>After Yan finished speaking, they had arrived at the fork in the road leading to Tongxian City.  </p><p></p><p>Yan looked at Moku and suddenly said solemnly, "Moku."</p><p></p><p>Moku turned back, and after a pause, Yan said:</p><p></p><p>"Array masters seek the Heavenly Dao, yet the Heavenly Dao is boundless while human life is limited. Only by passing down array methods from generation to generation can cultivators have a chance to comprehend the Heavenly Dao, and array methods have a chance to benefit all living beings."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if one day you become a first-rank, or even higher than first-rank array master, and you encounter cultivators with good moral character and an aptitude for arrays, I hope you will not be stingy in guiding them. The Dao of arrays is like water - only by flowing onwards can it become an ever-flowing stream. Otherwise, it will just become a stagnant pool."</p><p></p><p>Moku suddenly felt a weight on his shoulders. He bowed respectfully to Instructor Yan and said solemnly: "Your disciple will remember!"</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan's expression showed relief.</p><p></p><p>Moku couldn't help but ask: "Instructor, are you leaving Tongxian City?"</p><p></p><p>Yan nodded, "I cannot stay at Tongxian Sect any longer, and I also have some private matters to attend to, so I will be leaving soon."</p><p></p><p>"Will I be able to see you again then?"</p><p></p><p>Yan looked into Moku's deep black eyes, smiled slightly and said, "We'll see what fate has in store."</p><p></p><p>Yan reached out and patted Moku's head. "Go on home now and tell your parents."</p><p></p><p>Moku walked towards the city gates, but after a few steps he turned back and bowed to Instructor Yan again.</p><p></p><p>Yan waved his hand and said warmly, "Go on."  He watched until Moku's figure grew smaller in the distance before turning to leave himself.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Moku also turned back to look at Yan, and deeply bowed once more.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan's figure gradually faded into the misty mountains.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

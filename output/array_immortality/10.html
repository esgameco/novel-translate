        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The next morning, after finishing breakfast, Mohua put down his chopsticks and went back to his room. He took out paper and ink for tracing talismans, and while his memory of the Bright Fire Formation was still quite clear, he began meticulously tracing it stroke by stroke. </p><p></p><p>For tracing talismans, he used the cheapest ordinary ink and paper, which did not contain any spiritual energy. The formation he drew was just a pattern without any effects, so it consumed an extremely tiny amount of spiritual awareness. He also didn't need to worry about wasting spirit stones if he failed.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his memory, Mohua traced the entire formation in one go. Since it didn't consume much spiritual awareness, there was almost no pause.</p><p></p><p>Mohua took out the diagram of the Bright Fire Formation and carefully checked it against his traced version, finding three mistakes. </p><p></p><p>He set that tracing paper aside and took out a new sheet to draw on again. He did this continuously for three sheets until he finally produced a complete and flawless tracing of the Bright Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>Mohua let out a long breath, stretched lazily, and glanced at the small sundial in front of the desk, realizing it was already noon before he felt hungry.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhua had already prepared the meal - rice made from spirit grain, a few simply stir-fried vegetable dishes, and the only meat dish was demon chicken eggs. The spirit grain was of low quality, but enough to fill the stomach.</p><p></p><p>The simple yet tasty meal made Mohua eat heartily. After finishing, he ran back to his room to continue practicing tracing the Bright Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>Watching Mohua's figure leave, Liuruhua worried: "This child is too diligent, he looks much thinner."</p><p></p><p>Moshan nodded, "Being diligent is good, but I'm just afraid he'll exhaust himself. Hua was born frail and his foundation is weak, he really shouldn't overexert himself."</p><p></p><p>Liuruhua sighed, "It's a pity he didn't inherit your talent for body cultivation, he's just as frail and sickly as me..."</p><p></p><p>Moshan gently put his arm around Liuruhua's thin shoulders, "How can you blame yourself? When Hua was born with weak vital energy, we had the old doctor Feng from the Xinglin Hall examine him. He said that at birth, one's spiritual awareness and physical body are balanced - Hua was born with strong spiritual awareness, so his physical body was weaker. Look at Mohua now, though frail, which neighborhood child is as brilliant as him? Hua is so smart, and good-looking too, isn't that all thanks to you?"</p><p></p><p>Liuruhua couldn't help but smile, "You really know how to sweet talk."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his wife's expression soften, Moshan then said, "This morning I chatted with Old Zhou from the demon-hunting squad. Apparently a few days ago, their squad happened to kill a young fire chicken - not a demon beast, but its meat contains some spiritual energy. I'll buy some for Mohua to try, it can also help nourish you."</p><p></p><p>"Do we have enough spirit stones?" Liuruhua asked.</p><p></p><p>"No need," Moshan replied. "We're all brothers who've hunted demons together, we have a good relationship. I can pay later, it's the same after the New Year."</p><p></p><p>Liuruhua handed her storage pouch to Moshan, "Pay as much as we can, we'll settle the rest after New Year's. It's almost the holidays, everyone needs to earn some spirit stones to celebrate."</p><p></p><p>Moshan considered it and nodded, "Alright."</p><p></p><p>As the couple chatted, Mohua remained focused, continuing to draw the Bright Fire Formation until night fell. By evening, he had become quite proficient at it.</p><p></p><p>At dinner, Mohua hurriedly finished eating, then eagerly returned to his room. He held his breath to calm his mind for a moment before going to sleep on schedule and entering his inner spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>An ancient stone stele stood in the vast blankness of his spiritual realm's sea of awareness.</p><p></p><p>Using his fingers as a brush, Mohua formally drew the formation pattern on the stele. As the array became complete, his spiritual awareness poured out.</p><p></p><p>When his spiritual awareness gradually became depleted to the point he could barely sustain it, Mohua finally completed drawing the entire Bright Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>He stopped, and the array on the stele emanated a warm white glow.</p><p></p><p>The Bright Fire Formation was an array that could only be drawn by cultivators at the third level of Qi Refining. Mohua was just at the second level...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Although it was a struggle, Moku was now able to draw a complete Fire Array Formation diagram with his spiritual sense. </p><p></p><p>This also meant that Moku's spiritual sense was in no way inferior to cultivators at the third level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Moku felt a slight sense of pride in his heart, then erased the Fire Array he had drawn, and his spiritual sense immediately filled up again.</p><p></p><p>Moku continued drawing the Fire Array Formation. He had to use this night to fully master the formation diagram, so he could formally start drawing the array tomorrow. </p><p></p><p>In the empty and silent sea of consciousness, Moku drew the Fire Array Formation over and over again, summarizing and reflecting on the various problems he encountered.</p><p></p><p>Before he knew it, daylight had arrived, and Moku involuntarily withdrew from the sea of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Feeling no fatigue at all, Moku immediately got up, sat cross-legged on the bed to cultivate for a while. After eating breakfast, he washed his hands solemnly and took out the array materials the fat steward had given him.</p><p></p><p>The materials included ten array papers and ten small bottles of pale red ink. The array papers were made from demonic beast hides and spirit herb scraps. The ink was blended from the blood and spiritual liquids of fire-type demonic beasts. Unlike the paper and ink Moku used for tracing, these materials contained spiritual energy and were much more expensive.</p><p></p><p>The fat steward also provided a new but very crudely made brush. It wasn't much better than Moku's own brush, so Moku didn't unseal it and used his regular brush instead, which felt more comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Moku laid out the array papers on the table and carefully poured the ink into the inkstone. The inkstone could preserve the spiritual power of the ink longer, preventing it from dissipating quickly.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the Fire Array pattern in his mind once more, Moku began formally drawing the formation.</p><p></p><p>The process of drawing the array went more smoothly than Moku expected. Aside from using real brushes, ink, and array papers, everything felt exactly the same as drawing on the stele in the sea of consciousness, even the rate of spiritual sense consumption.</p><p></p><p>However, due to some nervousness, some of his brushstrokes were slightly skewed, which didn't affect the efficacy of the array itself but made the drawn formation look a bit ugly.</p><p></p><p>Moku exhausted his spiritual sense but finally completed the Fire Array Formation, though unfortunately he made one mistake.</p><p></p><p>Not achieving full mastery on the first try, he lost one spirit stone...</p><p></p><p>Moku felt heartbroken about it.</p><p></p><p>With his spiritual sense depleted, Moku could no longer continue drawing arrays and could only rest with his eyes closed to recover.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there's any way to quickly restore spiritual sense..." Moku thought to himself, now missing the stele in the sea of consciousness, which couldn't be used in reality.</p><p></p><p>As Moku rested, the morning passed by before his spiritual sense could fully recover, and Liu Ruhua had already called him for lunch.</p><p></p><p>At lunch, Moku just had a few bites of rice, then hurried back to his room and laid out a new array paper.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the blank paper in front of him, Moku calmed his mind, summarized his experience, silently recited "failure is the mother of success", and began drawing the second Fire Array Formation.</p><p></p><p>This time, Moku was more focused and careful, only putting down each stroke after considering it thoroughly, envisioning the next array pattern in advance. When his spiritual sense was depleted, he closed his eyes to rest while constantly recalling the Fire Array diagram in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Moku drew very slowly, but time flew by quickly. By dusk, although still intermittent, he had finally succeeded in drawing out the complete Fire Array Formation.</p><p></p><p>Unable to conceal his excitement, yet also overwhelmed by fatigue from depleting his spiritual thoughts, Moku fell contentedly onto the bed and immediately fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>When Moku awoke, night had fallen. Feeling ravenously hungry, he suddenly smelled an aroma and followed the scent into the main hall, where he saw a large bowl of meat on the table!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

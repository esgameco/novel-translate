        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It had been sixteen days since Mohua started learning the Molten Fire Formation. </p><p></p><p>On this day, Mohua woke up early. The morning sunlight shone on the table, fresh and bright, without the sultriness of noon.</p><p></p><p>Mohua laid out paper on the table, prepared red ink, and then began drawing the Molten Fire Formation. </p><p></p><p>This was something Mohua did every day for more than ten days.</p><p></p><p>But today was different from usual - Mohua would formally draw a complete Molten Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>Last night in his spiritual awareness, Mohua could draw the Molten Fire Formation on the broken stele, meaning his spiritual awareness was strong enough to draw the five formation lines.</p><p></p><p>After repeated practice and repairing it once on the smelting furnace at the Refinery, Mohua had mastered the formation lines of the Molten Fire Formation.</p><p></p><p>Mohua drew carefully and meticulously. An hour later, when Mohua felt his spiritual awareness was somewhat painful and gradually becoming exhausted, the final stroke of the Molten Fire Formation was completed.  </p><p></p><p>Mohua infused a bit of spiritual power, which flowed slowly along the red formation lines, gradually transferring from the first stroke of the first line to the last stroke of the fifth line, ultimately connecting the entire formation without any obstructions.</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>Mohua took a long breath, feeling a sense of steady accumulation finally paying off.</p><p></p><p>"A five-line formation!"</p><p></p><p>At the third level of Qi Refining, he could draw a five-line formation.</p><p></p><p>Mohua knew that normally at the third level of Qi Refining, one could at most draw three formation lines. Those disciples from great clans and sects, with higher talents and better inheritances, were probably stronger than him at the same level when it came to formations.</p><p></p><p>But even if they were stronger, they probably wouldn't be much stronger.</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the more he drew formations, his spiritual awareness would inevitably grow stronger, making it easier to learn formations. Becoming a first-rank Formation Master should only be a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Once he truly became a first-rank Formation Master, even if he didn't pass the certification, as an ordinary Formation Master he could earn quite a few spirit stones, and his parents wouldn't have to work so hard.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Mohua couldn't help but feel happy.</p><p></p><p>Then the fatigue from repeatedly practicing formations these past few days caught up to him. Mohua fell onto the bed and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhua came in carrying some cleaned wild fruits. Seeing the newly drawn formation on the table and Mohua sleeping soundly on the bed, she tidied up the table for him and covered his little belly with a fur blanket. She then gazed at Mohua for a long while.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mohua sleeping sweetly, dreaming about eating something with glistening drool at the corner of his mouth, Liuruhua couldn't help but smile. She wiped the corner of his mouth with her sleeve before leaving.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Dazhu came to notify Mohua that the smelting stove was also finished.</p><p></p><p>Dazhu was Master Chen's senior apprentice, tall and sturdy with an honest smile.</p><p></p><p>Mohua followed Dazhu to the Chen Refinery and saw a person-high smelting stove displayed in the shop. Its shape was ancient but sturdy, with three legs and a round belly covered by a lid.</p><p></p><p>The stove lid was open, waiting for Mohua to draw the formation inside before it could be sealed.</p><p></p><p>"The smelting stove is forged, little brother. Take a look and see if you're satisfied," said Dazhu.</p><p></p><p>Mohua circled the stove, examining it from different angles and feeling the texture. It felt solid, clearly made with high-quality materials and meticulously crafted.</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded in praise, "As expected of Master Chen, this is the finest spirit artifact I've seen."</p><p></p><p>Of course, he hadn't actually seen that many spirit artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen stroked his beard, "Naturally, I made the best for the little brother's request."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master Chen!"</p><p></p><p>Mohua said happily, then took out a storage bag. "There are sixty spirit stones inside as compensation for your hard work."</p><p></p><p>For over twenty days of work, the cost should be over a hundred spirit stones. Mohua offered a fifty percent discount plus a little extra.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Master Chen originally wanted to refuse, but thinking that the refining business had not been going well these past few months, and that his disciples like Da Zhu could barely get enough to eat, he accepted it. However, he told Moxhua:</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if you need anything refined, come to me and I'll give you the lowest price in Xian City." </p><p></p><p>"Mm hmm, thank you Master Chen!" Moxhua said happily.</p><p></p><p>"However," Master Chen hesitated, "This stove still needs to have a formation array drawn on it before it can be used. Who will you get to draw the formation?"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua patted his chest: "I'll draw it myself!"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen was both surprised and not surprised. </p><p></p><p>The formation array on the refining furnace at the refining workshop was repaired by Moxhua. The procedures for refining furnaces, pill furnaces, and stoves are similar, and the core formation arrays are also close, so it wasn't a problem for Moxhua to draw it himself.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Master Chen advised kindly: "Drawing a formation array is different from repairing one, you know. I've heard that drawing formations consumes more spiritual energy. Your cultivation level is not high, so your spiritual energy may not be enough. Don't force yourself to draw the array and end up damaging your spiritual sea."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry," Moxhua said, "I know what I'm doing."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen didn't say anything more. When it came to formation arrays, he didn't understand more than this young cultivator before him.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua was not very tall, so Master Chen disassembled the stove he had just assembled and laid it out on the ground, making it easier for Moxhua to draw the formation array.</p><p></p><p>Da Zhu and the other disciples also lent a hand, then stood to the side, craning their necks curiously to watch Moxhua draw the formation array. They didn't often see cultivators drawing formations, so they found it novel, especially since the one drawing was much younger than them.</p><p></p><p>First, Moxhua dipped his brush in water and tried drawing some strokes on the inner wall of the stove, getting used to using the brush and the feel of actually drawing on a spiritual artifact.</p><p></p><p>He also envisioned in his mind the potential problems he might encounter when actually drawing the array.</p><p></p><p>Preparation leads to establishment, lack of preparation leads to waste. More preparation beforehand can greatly increase the success rate of the formation.</p><p></p><p>After preparing, Moxhua laid out the Molten Fire Array diagram for reference, then took out a brush and a small bottle of ink.</p><p></p><p>The ink was a fresh red color and quite thick - it was said to be made from the blood of a fire-attribute beast, of medium quality. Although not the best, it was better than what Moxhua had used before and the best he could afford with his limited funds.</p><p></p><p>This small bottle of ink cost ten spirit stones, enough for only two Molten Fire Arrays, so he had to be fully prepared to avoid failure.</p><p></p><p>If he failed, just the wasted ink alone would be enough to make Moxhua's heart ache.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua took a deep breath, calmed his mind, and began drawing the formation array. His originally innocent childlike face gradually became solemn, his bright black eyes shining with an ethereal light, as if containing starlight.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen and the disciples stood to the side. Seeing Moxhua's serious expression, they didn't dare breathe too loudly, for fear of disturbing him. Their expressions looked even more tense than Moxhua's.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua's delicate little hand gripped the brush, his wrist nimbly twisting to guide the brush tip across the furnace wall, tracing vivid strokes in a measured cadence with perfect structure.</p><p></p><p>Though the onlookers couldn't understand the formation or the strokes, they saw the wondrous lines seeming to flow from the brush tip, and for a moment they all watched, entranced.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Moxhua finally put down his brush and let out a long breath.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others inexplicably also let out a breath of relief.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen hesitated, then asked softly, "Little friend, does this mean...you succeeded in drawing it?"</p><p></p><p>The solemn look on Moxhua's youthful face was replaced once more by a radiant smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Thank you all for your bookmarks and votes~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

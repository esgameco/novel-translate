        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Young Master An?"</p><p></p><p>The lavishly dressed little fatty was the great young master of the An family in Tongxian City, named An Xiaofu. Perhaps his father didn't have high expectations for him, so he gave him the name Xiaofu, which means "small fortune."</p><p></p><p>However, because of his plump appearance, his peers privately called him "An Xiaopang" (little fatty).</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang was a bit slow-witted and sometimes had the temperament of a young master, but he wasn't ill-nationed. He often asked Moxhua to draw the array diagrams for his homework assignments. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't draw arrays at all and didn't want to be punished by the instructor or beaten by his father for failing, so he could only ask Moxhua for help.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, An Xiaopang was fuming with rage, "You Moxhua! I treated you as a friend, but you look down on me?!"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua was completely baffled, "How am I looking down on you?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang took out an array diagram with annotations in red ink from his pocket, "You helped me draw the array homework, and you got six parts wrong! But when you helped that skinny monkey Qian Xing, there wasn't a single mistake! Isn't this looking down on me? Isn't this saying I'm inferior to him?"</p><p></p><p>The "skinny monkey" An Xiaopang referred to was the thin young master from before, named Qian Xing, the third young master of the Qian family's main branch.</p><p></p><p>The Qian family was the biggest family in Tongxian City, with the An family second. Both families ran businesses and were competitors, with long-standing grudges between the ancestors. The younger generations were also at odds, always trying to outdo each other in every aspect, even their body types - one fat and one thin - like water and fire.</p><p></p><p>However, the two were equally lazy and unaccomplished in their cultivation studies, which could be considered "equally matched."</p><p></p><p>Although both were scions, Qian Xing had a worse reputation because apart from being unaccomplished, he was also arrogant, bullying others by taking advantage of his family's power. It was said he had done many bad things behind the scenes, but due to his family's protection, nothing ever came of it.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, An Xiaopang was just a glutton who liked to show off and flaunt his wealth in the streets. But because his father kept him in check, he didn't go too far overboard.</p><p></p><p>"So that's what this is about?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Moxhua's nonchalant attitude, An Xiaopang's face turned red with anger.</p><p></p><p>"I did that to help you," said Moxhua.</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang sneered at Moxhua, "How is that helping me?"</p><p></p><p>"How does your array skill compare to Young Master Qian's?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang confidently said, "At least it's not worse than his!"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua was a bit speechless. Was that something to be proud of?</p><p></p><p>Moxhua continued, "Exactly, so with his level of skill, how could he possibly draw the arrays without a single mistake?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this young master can't even draw them properly, so naturally he can't either!"</p><p></p><p>"So you know, how could the instructor not see through it? The instructor has always been strict and will definitely punish him. He'll also inform his father, and his father will lose face. Naturally, he won't get off easy..."</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang pondered for a moment, "That makes some sense, but I haven't heard of the skinny Qian being beaten...are you tricking me...?"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua gave him a blank look, "Family scandals can't be made public. Of course fathers beat their sons behind closed doors, how would you know?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang nodded with lingering fear, "You're right, when my father beats me, he never lets others know!"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua added, "This time, didn't Old Master An not only refrain from beating you, but even praised you?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang immediately became smug, "That's right, the instructor gave me a B grade, and when my father found out, he praised me for improving and even gave me lots of good things!"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang's temper came and went quickly. He no longer felt angry and even felt a bit guilty. He said to Moxhua, "I was wrong to blame you! Let me treat you to a meal at Lingxian Lou - that's my family's restaurant. Eat whatever you want!"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua didn't expect An Xiaopang to be so generous, but still declined, "No need, I still have things to do."</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang was displeased, "My father always teaches me to repay kindness. If you don't go, that means you're looking down on me!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the red, swollen buttocks from his father's previous beating, An Xiaopang insisted, "This kindness is no small matter, you must go!"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang's childish temper was flaring up again, making him rather difficult.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua felt a bit of a headache. He glanced at the door of the Array Pavilion and suddenly said, "Young Master An, let's not go to Lingxian Lou, but there is a favor I need. Can you help?"</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang thumped his chest, "Tell me!"</p><p></p><p>"Lend me ten spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang frowned slightly. He really didn't have ten spirit stones on him. To prevent him from recklessly spending spirit stones outside, Old Master An never let him carry more than five at a time.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He invited Moxhua to eat at the Lingshan Tower, and it could be recorded on his father's account. Since it was just food and drink, and there was an account record, his father wouldn't say anything about it. What his father was afraid of was him spending spirit stones on some unorthodox practices without any account records to check. If his father didn't know about it, big trouble could arise inadvertently. </p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang took out five spirit stones from his body and looked at the little attendants beside him, saying, "Give me all your spirit stones, I'll give them back to you when I get home."</p><p></p><p>The attendants were a bit reluctant but still took out their spirit stones, which added up to ten spirit stones in total.</p><p></p><p>An Xiaopang handed the spirit stones to Moxhua, "Here, you don't need to return them!"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua shook his head, "I'll return them to you in a few days."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua weighed the spirit stones in his hand for a few times, then carefully put them away. After bidding farewell to An Xiaopang, he returned to that array pavilion. There were still no customers in the pavilion, and the clerk was still napping.</p><p></p><p>After entering, Moxhua tiptoed and placed the ten spirit stones on the counter.</p><p></p><p>"I've brought the spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The clerk had just taken a short nap when he heard the ringing sound again and saw Moxhua and the ten spirit stones on the counter.</p><p></p><p>The clerk picked up the spirit stones, examined them carefully, and seeing no issue with the quality, he nodded and reached under the counter to take out a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"This contains an array diagram of the 'Bright Fire Array', as well as ten array papers and spirit ink, enough to draw ten Bright Fire Arrays. This order has a deadline of ten days. If overdue, the entire deposit will be deducted. For each successful Bright Fire Array drawn, you can get one spirit stone. If you make a mistake or it doesn't meet the standard, one spirit stone deposit will be deducted. These are the common rules of the merchant group, which your elder brother should be familiar with."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua nodded.</p><p></p><p>If he successfully completed this batch of arrays, he could earn ten spirit stones. If he failed completely, he would lose ten spirit stones. As long as he succeeded more than half, it would be profitable.</p><p></p><p>The clerk reminded him again, "Ten days deadline, don't forget. If overdue, I'll deduct the entire deposit."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua hurriedly nodded, thanked the clerk with a courtesy, and left.</p><p></p><p>After returning home, Moxhua locked himself in the room and began to ponder the array intently.</p><p></p><p>The highest profit of ten spirit stones was already very considerable. Although Moxhua earned twelve spirit stones by helping his fellow disciples draw arrays for their assignments, he couldn't earn that much in a year.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, drawing arrays for fellow disciples' assignments was not considered proper business.</p><p></p><p>Doing it occasionally was fine, but if it went on for too long, it would hinder the progress of his fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>It was different with the merchant group. If he did well, he could earn spirit stones for a long time and practice arrays, which could be considered killing two birds with one stone.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua spread out the array diagram of the 'Bright Fire Array' in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The array diagram was pre-drawn by other array masters and could be used as a template.</p><p></p><p>Behind the diagram was an array illustration, recording the array patterns, the use of brush, ink, and other precautions. It was the common way to record arrays in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>The illustration of the 'Bright Fire Array' recorded the annotations related to the array, such as where to use the fire-element patterns, how the patterns were connected, the ratio of ink mixing and application, etc. Many of the concepts seemed unfamiliar to Moxhua, and he found them a bit difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Moxhua had seen a formal array illustration. What he had learned in the sect before were the simplest arrays - although called arrays, most of them only contained one or two basic patterns for disciples to learn and practice. They were different from the arrays widely used in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the 'Bright Fire Array' illustration, there was a note:</p><p></p><p>Bright Fire Array, fire-element array, containing three array patterns, requiring at least the third level of Qi Refinement Realm.</p><p></p><p>But what caught Moxhua's attention the most was the small handwritten note in vermilion ink below:</p><p></p><p>Those who have not reached the required realm, lacking sufficient spiritual sense, be cautious in learning!</p><p></p><p>Moxhua, who was only at the second level of Qi Refinement, couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>Any action of a cultivator required spiritual sense to guide spiritual energy, wield spiritual power, cast spells, control spiritual weapons, refine pills and artifacts, etc. It was common knowledge that drawing arrays consumed the most spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>But the fact that it was specially noted as "lacking sufficient spiritual sense, be cautious" and the realm was specified, with the note written in vermilion ink, made Moxhua realize that he might have underestimated just how much spiritual sense was needed...</p><p></p><p>"Could drawing arrays really require that much spiritual sense?"</p><p></p><p>Moxhua pondered with his little chin propped up.</p><p></p><p>"Well, let me first get familiar with the patterns, and practice on the stele tonight before deciding."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua memorized the array diagram of the Bright Fire Array. After having dinner with his parents, he returned to his room and practiced the patterns a few times with regular paper and ink to get familiar with them. When it was around midnight, he lay on the bed, closed his eyes, and the ancient and ethereal broken stele appeared in his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

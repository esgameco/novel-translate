        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Moku returned to the cultivation room and sat down, and a group of disciples gathered around him again.</p><p></p><p>"Moku, Moku, what did the instructor want you for?"</p><p></p><p>"Did the instructor punish you?" </p><p></p><p>Moku told the truth: "The instructor told me to go see him every day after class."</p><p></p><p>One disciple said: "It must be because you were negligent in array formations, so the instructor got angry and is making you practice array formations every day so you don't fall behind."</p><p></p><p>Another disciple expressed sympathy: "That's too cruel for you, having to draw array formations under the instructor's watchful eye every day."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, it's too cruel. I get nervous just from the instructor glancing at me, let alone him watching me draw array formations..."</p><p></p><p>Moku also sighed. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the other disciples tried to console Moku.</p><p></p><p>However, Moku's sigh was not because he had to draw array formations under the instructor's watch, but because going to the instructor's place every day left him little time to draw array formations for the Array Pavilion to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But since the instructor had asked Moku if he wanted to become an array master, he should provide some guidance, which was a good thing after all.</p><p></p><p>The next day after class, Moku arrived at Strict Instructor Yan's residence on time. </p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan got straight to the point and placed a scroll titled "Elementary Explication of Array Formation Theory" in front of Moku.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to go far in the way of array formations, you must have a solid foundation. This foundation includes not only grasping the basic array patterns, skillful brushwork, and firm spiritual awareness, but also the theoretical studies of array formations in the cultivation world."</p><p></p><p>"The so-called array formation theory is the insights and theoretical summaries of countless great array masters on the myriad array formations in the cultivation world, seeking the unchanging principles within ever-changing array formations."</p><p></p><p>"Some cultivators draw array formations well, but are completely ignorant of the theories. Once they reach profound levels, they are lost in a fog, unable to make any progress on the way of array formations."</p><p></p><p>"I am still one step away from becoming a first-rank array master. Most of our sect's inherited teachings have been lost, so I cannot teach you the profound array formation theories like those of the great clans and sects. But for your current level of array formation skill, it should be sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Moku sat up straight, his expression becoming increasingly respectful. "Please enlighten me, Instructor."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan nodded, opened the "Elementary Explication of Array Formation Theory", and said:</p><p></p><p>"This elementary explication records some basic principles of array formations, such as the round heaven and square earth, the eight trigrams and directions, the generating and overcoming cycle of the five elements, as well as the composition of single arrays, combined arrays, and great arrays..."</p><p></p><p>"Array formations are the manifestation of the laws of heaven and earth. The outer circle and inner square symbolize the round heaven and square earth. The positions of different array patterns follow the eight trigram theory. Array patterns of different attributes generate and overcome each other. A single array formation is a single array. Multiple single arrays combined form a combined array. And a great array is formed by linking numerous single and combined arrays..."</p><p></p><p>"Great arrays are extremely powerful. The so-called sect-protecting great arrays belong to this type. A great array contains hundreds, thousands, or even tens of thousands of array formations, created through the collaboration of dozens or hundreds of array masters. Only array masters of the highest attainment can serve as the chief array master, leading the design and inscription of the great array..."</p><p></p><p>"To become a chief array master and design and construct a great array is the lifelong aspiration of many array masters."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan spoke with some emotion, then continued: "But talking about that is too far ahead. Even becoming an ordinary first-rank array master is already no easy feat."</p><p></p><p>Moku also felt a sense of admiration listening to this. If a single array formation was already so profound, what kind of spectacle would it be to activate a great array containing tens of thousands of array formations?</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan hesitated a little, then solemnly handed the "Elementary Explication of Array Formation Theory" to Moku and said:</p><p></p><p>"Take this elementary explication first and study it carefully yourself. Remember, do not spread it outside, and do not show it to anyone else..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>He spoke.</p><p></p><p>After that, Strict Instructor explained some basic theories about battle formations, then allowed Ink Painting to leave.</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting returned to the Disciple's Quarters, holding the thin book "Initial Interpretation of the Classics" in his hands, yet feeling its weight. For the first time, he sensed the importance of the inheritance of cultivation. Without someone to teach him, he would have to grope around for a lifetime to understand these things.</p><p></p><p>He was merely an ordinary disciple, yet Strict Instructor taught him so diligently. Ink Painting felt increasingly grateful in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting calmed his mind and read through the "Initial Interpretation of the Classics" word by word, making notes of anything he didn't understand to ask the instructor about the next day.</p><p></p><p>Before sleeping, Ink Painting took out the "Battle Formation Diagrams of Metal and Stone" again, memorizing the formation patterns inside. He then entered his inner consciousness and practiced the Metal and Stone Formation on the stone stele.</p><p></p><p>The Metal and Stone Formation only had four formation patterns, not too difficult, but it would take time to become familiar with the patterns through practice.</p><p></p><p>Benefiting from the "Initial Interpretation of Battle Formations", when Ink Painting drew the Metal and Stone Formation diagram, he felt his thinking was much clearer.</p><p></p><p>Why were the four formation patterns positioned in the west? Because the west belongs to metal, matching the attribute of the Metal and Stone Formation diagram. There were also many symbolic considerations in the specific way of drawing it.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Ink Painting only knew how to draw according to the formation diagram, but didn't understand the reasons behind it. Now, he had a deeper level of understanding.</p><p></p><p>On the second day, Ink Painting went to Clarity Peak.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor asked Ink Painting some questions from the "Battle Formation Classics". Ink Painting answered them one by one, confirming he had carefully read through the "Classics of Battle Formation Theory". Strict Instructor couldn't help but nod his head.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ink Painting raised the questions he had noted down to ask Strict Instructor. The instructor answered each one patiently, his expression visibly more relieved.</p><p></p><p>On the third day when Ink Painting went again, Strict Instructor used specific battle formations as examples to analyze for Ink Painting, helping him understand some basic theories of formations.</p><p></p><p>The instructor started by lecturing on several formations with a single pattern, including the Bright Fire Formation that Ink Painting had drawn before, as well as a few other formations Ink Painting had never learned. Then came formations with two patterns, which were also new to Ink Painting. He listened attentively.</p><p></p><p>Among the four-pattern formations, the first one the instructor mentioned was the Stabilizing Earth Formation - something Ink Painting had previously asked about. Although Ink Painting could draw it quite fluently by now, listening to the instructor's explanation, he realized that before he had only known the surface, not the underlying reasons, lacking much deeper understanding of the formation.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the Stabilizing Earth Formation, Strict Instructor brought up the Metal and Stone Formation:</p><p></p><p>"The Metal and Stone Formation has a similar function to the Stabilizing Earth Formation. Among the five elements of metal, wood, water, fire and earth, earth can generate metal. So when cultivators build caves or dwellings, they use the Stabilizing Earth Formation to solidify the foundation, while also using the Metal and Stone Formation to reinforce the structure. Due to the earth generating metal relationship, the effect of the formations is enhanced. These two formations can be understood by referencing each other..."</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting felt enlightened listening to this.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor lectured for over an hour, then assigned a few homework questions, asking Ink Painting to find some examples himself of formations generating or overcoming each other based on the elemental relationships. He then allowed Ink Painting to leave.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Disciple's Quarters, the more Ink Painting thought about it, the more puzzled he became.</p><p></p><p>Many of the formation examples the instructor had used were ones Ink Painting had helped draw for the Formation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Bright Fire and Stabilizing Earth Formations, the Metal and Stone Formation was one Fatty Clerk had asked him to draw. Today the instructor had even specifically explained the Metal and Stone Formation diagram to illustrate the generating relationships between elements, but it was too coincidental.</p><p></p><p>"Could the instructor and Fatty Clerk have some connection? Could it be that the instructor already knows I personally drew all those formations for Destiny Teahouse?"</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting pondered secretly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The deposit for the Earth Reinforcement Formation was twenty spirit stones. Moxhua took out ten spirit stones from his previous earnings and gave them to the fat clerk as a deposit. He received the Earth Reinforcement Formation diagram and ten sets of paper and ink materials. The time limit was twenty days. </p><p></p><p>After leaving the trading firm, Moxhua went to the pastry shop and spent two spirit stones to buy ten colorful cakes. He then went straight back to the sect and shared some of the cakes with Dahu and the other two.</p><p></p><p>The food at the sect was not very good. The three of them often craved delicacies, but there was nothing tasty available. Moxhua bought some cakes to satisfy their cravings.</p><p></p><p>A few evenings later, after finishing classes for the day, Moxhua was studying the Earth Reinforcement Formation pattern behind closed doors in the disciples' quarters when he suddenly heard a knock on the door.</p><p></p><p>When Moxhua opened the door, he saw Shuanghu standing outside furtively. Shuanghu secretly handed an oiled paper package to Moxhua and said in a low voice, "This is especially saved for you, don't tell anyone else." After looking around, he scampered away like a thief.</p><p></p><p>The disciples' quarters were dormitories provided by Tongxian Gate for disciples to live in, with two people per room. The room was not big, with two simple wooden beds and two slightly dilapidated wooden desks, just enough for disciples' daily living needs. There were also more luxurious and comfortable disciples' quarters in Tongxian Gate, but extra spirit stones had to be paid.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua originally had a roommate from the same sect, but he dropped out this year. It wasn't because he couldn't afford the tuition, but simply because he found cultivation dull and didn't want to study anymore. So now there was only Moxhua in the room.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua closed the door, opened the still slightly hot oiled paper package, and found a freshly roasted chicken leg inside. The chicken leg was about the size of a fist, steaming hot, a bit charred, and giving off an appetizing aroma, especially with a faint spiritual energy lingering on it. It was spirit beast meat.</p><p></p><p>"This... can't be stolen from somewhere, can it..."</p><p></p><p>With its spiritual energy, Shuanghu and the others could never afford such spirit beast meat. And judging from Shuanghu's furtive manner, it could only have been stolen.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua hesitated for a moment, then took a bite. It tasted a bit burnt and had a meaty aroma, but it wasn't cooked through and wasn't seasoned, so the flavor was a bit bland.</p><p></p><p>Cooking in the cultivation world was quite sophisticated. If one hadn't studied it specifically, it was difficult to make something delicious. The ingredients in the cultivation world were hard to handle. For example, the texture of meat was very tough, and some meats, such as those from herbivorous demonic beasts, couldn't be cooked tender without expending a great deal of spiritual power to stoke the flames for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Spirit beast meat would be a bit more tender, but cooking it still required some effort. Apart from the inherent flavors, most vegetables also contained some spiritual energy, which would mix with the original flavors. If not properly combined, the taste would be quite strange.</p><p></p><p>The chicken leg in Moxhua's hand was simply roasted, probably because they were afraid of being discovered, so they stealthily lit a fire and hastily roasted it, which is why it couldn't taste very good.</p><p></p><p>But for Moxhua, who hadn't eaten meat for over a month, having something to eat was good enough without being too picky.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua had some difficulty finishing the chicken leg, then lit a fire to burn the oiled paper and threw the bones into the small stream outside, completely destroying the evidence.</p><p></p><p>After eating his fill, Moxhua spent some time refining the spiritual energy contained in the chicken meat, then buried himself in studying the formation pattern again.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a couple of days later, Moxhua heard that a few Qi Refining disciples had stolen the brocade chickens raised by an elder, plucked them, and roasted them to eat.</p><p></p><p>The elder was furious, caught those disciples, and severely punished them.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Moxhua saw Dahu and the other two with swollen faces and two big bumps on their heads.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were all at Tongxuan Peak, so the elder was able to find out. There was no way for them to escape punishment.</p><p></p><p>However, they had only suffered some minor physical injuries. The elder would not really do anything too severe to them. It was just a light punishment and a warning for the other disciples.</p><p></p><p>Dahu and the others looked miserable, but they held their heads high with a hint of pride on their faces. After all, being able to steal chickens from right under the elder's nose was no easy feat for ordinary disciples.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Moxhua, they pretended not to recognize him. Little Hu even secretly gestured to Moxhua to act like he didn't know them either.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua couldn't help feeling amused and thought he would buy more cakes for them during the next periodic rest.</p><p></p><p>There were still seven days until the next periodic rest, and seven days until he could retrieve the deposit from the fat clerk for the Earth Reinforcement Formation diagram...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It had been thirteen days since Mohua received the talisman materials, but his comprehension of the Earth Stabilization Talisman was not going very smoothly. </p><p></p><p>The talisman patterns of the Earth Stabilization Talisman were ones Mohua had never learned before. They were much more complicated than the basic earth element talisman patterns taught by the sect, making them rather laborious to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Earth Stabilization Talisman consisted of four talisman patterns, requiring high spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>While memorizing the patterns wasn't too difficult for Mohua, when practicing on the stele, he consumed much more spiritual awareness and easily made mistakes.  </p><p></p><p>Either the talisman patterns he drew failed to form the complete talisman, or the patterns he drew were completely ineffective and unable to channel spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>After fumbling around for over ten days with no clue, sometimes seeming to understand but still making mistakes with each stroke, Mohua finally decided to seek guidance from Master Yan.</p><p></p><p>One day, after Master Yan finished his class and was tidying up the books on his desk, the disciples dispersed in groups of three or two. </p><p></p><p>Mohua brought a few basic earth element talisman patterns before Master Yan and respectfully asked for guidance:</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple does not fully understand these earth element talisman patterns here. Please enlighten me."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan looked at the few patterns Mohua handed over and said:</p><p></p><p>"These are the basic five element talisman patterns for earth, and they are quite standard and common patterns. For you, they should not be too difficult. If you cannot draw them well, just keep practicing."</p><p></p><p>The earth element patterns taught by the sect were very basic, so of course they were not difficult for Mohua. What Mohua actually wanted to ask about was something else.</p><p></p><p>Mohua then took out a few earth element patterns from the Earth Stabilization Talisman and said:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple happened to see these few patterns, and found they are somewhat different from the ones in the textbooks, but cannot pinpoint exactly how they differ. And when drawing them, it is very easy to make mistakes. I don't know where the problem lies."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan looked at them with some surprise and said:</p><p></p><p>"These are variations of the five element patterns, different from what the sect officially teaches. These are non-standard and not very common. To draw these patterns, you need to modify the brushstrokes and the sequence is also different from the standard patterns. Basically, the order of these few strokes needs to be changed..."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan took a piece of paper and casually drew a few talisman strokes while explaining.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Mohua finally realized the issue.</p><p></p><p>Drawing talisman patterns is somewhat similar to calligraphy. Besides the standard, codified patterns, there are also some more stylized patterns where the brushwork differs slightly.</p><p></p><p>There are numerous variations of these stylized patterns, and they cannot be categorized, so the sect normally only teaches the standard codified patterns.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they say the study of talismans is vast and profound. There are so many twists and turns, if I didn't ask the master, I wouldn't be able to figure it out even with two heads..." Mohua silently complained to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Then to connect these patterns together to form a talisman, like this kind of talisman..." </p><p></p><p>Mohua finally took out the full diagram of the Earth Stabilization Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan glanced at it and immediately recognized it, exclaiming in surprise: "This is the Earth Stabilization Talisman!" Then looking at Mohua, he said: "It's still too early for you to learn this, it's not something you can draw at your current level."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple is just curious and wants to understand the principles behind it," Mohua earnestly asked to learn.</p><p></p><p>"Well...you're right, it's good for you to know some of this in advance."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan's spirit lifted. Normally just teaching basic patterns, it could get rather dull, so being able to discuss a proper advanced talisman was a rare opportunity that clearly piqued his interest greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Talismans are formed by arranging and combining talisman patterns. Simple talismans contain simple patterns and fewer patterns, while more difficult talismans contain more patterns, and the sequence, spatial arrangement, and coherent connection of the various patterns becomes increasingly complex and exquisite. The Earth Stabilization Talisman contains four patterns. The patterns need to be drawn in a fixed directional order, with the remaining Qian and Kun positions..."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan lectured with great enthusiasm, and Mohua listened with rapt attention. Even after finishing the explanation, Master Yan still seemed not quite satisfied, and went on to caution:</p><p></p><p>"The study of talismans is vast and profound. It's good for you to understand some of this in advance. What the sect teaches is only the basics of basics, not even enough to be considered an entry-level. To become a true talisman master, the difficulty and amount of effort required is beyond what you can imagine now..."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan paused, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"At the same time, you must never be overly ambitious or blindly attempt to draw talismans beyond your grasp. Just looking is fine, but if you actually try drawing them, it's very easy to deplete your spiritual awareness - you must remember this point!"</p><p></p><p>Mohua bowed and said, "Your disciple understands the teaching."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

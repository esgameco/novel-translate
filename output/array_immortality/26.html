        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After classes each day, Moxihua would go to Strict Instructor's place to study array theories and ask questions about array formations. With Strict Instructor's explanations, Moxihua learned the Jinshi Array formations very quickly. Additionally, he could repeatedly practice on the stele in the Sea of Wisdom, so within just about ten days, Moxihua had completed painting five Jinshi Array formations. </p><p></p><p>Since he had ample time, Moxihua painted carefully, failing only one formation. After deducting material costs, he earned around twelve spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>During the periodic break, Moxihua handed the array formations to Manager Mo. After looking at them, Manager Mo seemed quite satisfied and nodded, saying, "Your...elder brother's array formations are becoming more and more systematic."</p><p></p><p>Moxihua looked at Manager Mo with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, being looked at made Manager Mo feel a bit guilty. He coughed and waved his hand, saying, "It's nothing, just go back to the sect. I'm very busy here."</p><p></p><p>Moxihua looked around the empty Destiny Pavilion without a single customer and curiously asked, "There's not a single customer here, what are you busy with, Manager?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo felt that his approach was more like Buddhist-style operations, fundamentally different from simply poor business.</p><p></p><p>But the lack of customers was indeed obvious at a glance.</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo got a bit angry, "What do you kids understand? The business I do here is all big deals, busy whether there are customers or not! If I say I'm busy, then I'm busy!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Manager, you be busy then. I'll get going."</p><p></p><p>Moxihua said goodbye and after taking a few steps, suddenly turned back and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Manager, are you very familiar with Strict Instructor?"</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo felt a bit guilty and said, "Not really that familiar, just some fellowship between fellow disciples. His temper is foul and stubborn, normal people can't stand him. We haven't been in contact for many years until we happened to run into each other recently and had some tea to catch up."</p><p></p><p>"Oh..."</p><p></p><p>Moxihua gave a meaningful "oh".</p><p></p><p>He said they weren't close, but his tone was very familiar, so they must be quite familiar, at least not mere acquaintances.</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo hurriedly waved his hand, "Go, go, don't disturb my business."</p><p></p><p>After leaving Destiny Pavilion, Moxihua thought to himself:</p><p></p><p>"It seems Manager Mo and Strict Instructor do have some shady dealings in private..."</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Moxihua returned to the mundane routine sect life - attending classes daily, seeking instruction on array formations from Strict Instructor after class, painting array formations back at the disciples' residence, and practicing array formations on the steles in the Sea of Wisdom after midnight.</p><p></p><p>Simple yet fulfilling.</p><p></p><p>Moxihua's array formation skills improved daily, and his spiritual awareness deepened. At the very least, he had ample capacity for painting four-line Jinshi Arrays and felt increasingly at ease without any sense of depleted spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>Manager Mo's array formation orders changed a few times, each time with the excuse of "market conditions changing, the previous array formations are no longer needed, new ones need to be painted." He would then provide Moxihua with new array diagrams.</p><p></p><p>When teaching array theories, Strict Instructor would explain the array formations Manager Mo assigned to Moxihua, essentially spoon-feeding him.</p><p></p><p>This basically confirmed Moxihua's suspicion that Manager Mo and Strict Instructor must have some private connection, and they likely both knew about Moxihua painting array formations for Destiny Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone remained tight-lipped, and Moxihua pretended not to know.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled Moxihua was why the instructor was so attentive towards him, answering all his questions about array formations, while Manager Mo provided him so many conveniences.</p><p></p><p>Could it really just be because he had decent aptitude for array formations?</p><p></p><p>Later, Moxihua thought about it and felt he was probably overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor was meticulous and conscientious by nature, never holding back when teaching students or dealing with array formations. His attentiveness towards Moxihua was likely because he cherished talent and didn't want it to go to waste.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Talent wasted in a lifetime, I really hope I can make progress in array formations. </p><p></p><p>Momanager and Strict Instructor have a connection, it must be at Strict Instructor's request that he is gradually arranging for me to practice drawing array formations step-by-step.</p><p></p><p>Moxia silently recorded their good intentions in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But now I'm just a low-level Condensing Qi third stage cultivator, can't do anything. Even if I want to repay this kindness, I can only wait until later.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, besides the metal and stone array, Moxia also learned the mud array, quicksand array and wind array. Including the spirit stones accumulated from previously drawing arrays, he had over 180 spirit stones in total. </p><p></p><p>Moxia planned to save up 200 spirit stones himself, then choose a mid-grade lower-tier cultivation technique, which could save his parents a lot of burden.</p><p></p><p>Once he has enough spirit stones and chosen a technique, he will tell his parents, they should be happy too.</p><p></p><p>But before Moxia could save up enough spirit stones, something happened at home.</p><p></p><p>One day during pill refining class, Strict Instructor suddenly called Moxia out, with a somewhat grave expression, telling him his mother was critically ill and to hurry home to see her.</p><p></p><p>Moxia was stunned for a moment, then felt like a bucket of cold water was poured over his head, a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Moxia asked the instructor for a few days off, then hurriedly returned home.</p><p></p><p>But the door was closed, Moxia knocked several times with no answer. As he was getting anxious, the neighboring auntie heard the noise and came out, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Is that Moxia?"</p><p></p><p>"Auntie Yang, my mother..."</p><p></p><p>"I was just about to tell you, your mother is critically ill and is at the Xinglintang seeking treatment from Old Master Feng!"</p><p></p><p>Moxia thanked her profusely, then rushed to Xinglintang.</p><p></p><p>Xinglintang was the only pill hall in the area.</p><p></p><p>Pill halls have pill masters on duty. Generally when cultivators are injured or ill, they go to the pill hall to request the pill master diagnose them and refine pills for healing and treatment.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Feng of Xinglintang was a renowned old pill master in Tongxiancheng. He studied the pill dao for most of his life, and in his later years even passed the graded examination to become a true first-grade pill master, one of the few graded pill masters in Tongxiancheng.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after becoming a first-grade pill master, Old Master Feng was the only one in Tongxiancheng willing to open a shop in the commoner district to see patients.</p><p></p><p>When Moxia arrived at Xinglintang, Old Master Feng was seeing patients.  </p><p></p><p>Old Master Feng wore a clean but somewhat old faded black daoist robe, with white hair and beard, a kind expression. Seeing Moxia, he gave the current patient a few reminders, then waved Moxia over.</p><p></p><p>Moxia hurried forward and paid respects, saying "Greetings Old Master Feng! My mother..."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Feng nodded, saying "Good child, I've seen your mother's condition. Though quite serious, her life is not in danger, you can set your mind at ease first."</p><p></p><p>Only then did Moxia breathe a sigh of relief, but then felt his mouth was dry, throat burning like it was on fire.</p><p></p><p>Moxia had a weak body since childhood. From rushing over in such a hurry just now, he was sweating all over upon stopping.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Feng gently pressed Moxia's back with his right hand, a faint cyan glow flickering, transferring some spiritual power over. Moxia felt like a spring breeze caressed his whole body, his breath instantly much smoother.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Feng then poured a shallow cup of tea, instructing: "Drink a little at a time, slowly."</p><p></p><p>Following Old Master Feng's instructions, Moxia slowly drank some of the misty tea, and his breathing finally became unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

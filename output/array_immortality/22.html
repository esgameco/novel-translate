        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor left the Formation Pavilion and returned to the Tongxian Sect's Tongming Peak. </p><p></p><p>The instructors of the Tongxian Sect all had their own separate residences on Tongming Peak - three rooms and a hall, with a small courtyard where they could grow spirit flowers and herbs, or keep spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor's residence was clean and tidy. The walls were neatly covered with formation diagrams, with no other decorations.</p><p></p><p>He reviewed the basic formation classics, prepared the few formations he would teach in the latter half of the month, and then began grading the formation homework submitted by the Qi Refining disciples.</p><p></p><p>There were nearly a thousand Qi Refining disciples at the Tongxian Sect's Tongxuan Peak. He would meticulously grade every single formation assignment and note any errors.</p><p></p><p>This took a lot of time and patience, but Strict Instructor did it scrupulously nonetheless. </p><p></p><p>This was his habit, upholding the teachings his master had imparted over many years.</p><p></p><p>His master used to grade their formation work in the same meticulous and patient way when he was a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor's master was a first-rank Formation Master, though not a particularly remarkable one in the cultivation world. But for his entire life, he did his utmost to pass on the Dao of formations in accordance with the heavenly principles.</p><p></p><p>Now that his master had passed away and he had become an instructor, he could appreciate his master's devoted efforts.</p><p></p><p>As dusk fell, Strict Instructor lit a lamp and continued grading the formations.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Tongxian Sect was just a small, remote sect with a weak cultivation lineage. Among the nearly thousand disciples, only a few could draw the basic formations properly.</p><p></p><p>Those who drew well generally had family teachings or came from wealthy families who could afford to cultivate them with spirit stones, such as the children of officials in the Dao Ministry, the children of sect elders, or disciples from cultivating clans in the city.</p><p></p><p>Very few from impoverished traveling cultivator backgrounds could draw formations well.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of background, however, Strict Instructor treated everyone equally, judging only by their formations.</p><p></p><p>For those who drew poorly but had a diligent attitude, he would add more comments to explain. For those who were both poor and careless, his comments would be harsher, and he would note down their names.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally there were excellent formations, which made Strict Instructor feel gratified, and he would write "Excellent" beside them as encouragement.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor graded tirelessly. When he flipped to one formation, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The brushwork was very skilled, clearly the result of hard practice. The formation strokes followed the proper methods - this formation would qualify for formal use.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor looked at the name "Moku Hua" and nodded slightly, writing a large "Excellent" beside the formation.</p><p></p><p>This "Excellent" was bigger than the others.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor turned the page and continued grading.</p><p></p><p>As he graded, he flipped back and looked at Moku Hua's formation again, frowning slightly.</p><p></p><p>The brushwork was too skilled, even looking a bit... too facile?</p><p></p><p>For a Qi Refining cultivator at the second or third level to draw a complete formation was already impressive.</p><p></p><p>Recalling his encounter with Moku Hua at the Formation Pavilion today, Strict Instructor pondered silently. Suddenly a question occurred to him:</p><p></p><p>"Does Moku Hua have an elder brother?"</p><p></p><p>"If his brother is skilled at formations, and he draws well too, then they must have family teachings. But if I remember correctly, this child Moku Hua is just from an impoverished traveling cultivator background. Families with formation teachings generally wouldn't be that poor..."</p><p></p><p>"If his brother could help draw formations at the Pavilion, he must have talent too. But I've taught at the Tongxian Sect for nearly ten years and don't recall teaching anyone like that..."</p><p></p><p>"At another sect? That's unlikely too, brothers from the same family usually join the same sect, especially since the Tongxian Sect is already the biggest in the city..."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor drummed his fingers on the desk, pondering, but set aside his thoughts for now to focus on finishing the grading.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Strict Instructor rose very early and asked the Tongming Peak's supervisor for the register of disciples' backgrounds. He found Moku Hua's entry:</p><p></p><p>Moku Hua: Age 10, Qi Refining 3rd Level, Lower Mid-Grade Five Phase Spirit Root...</p><p>Father: Moku Shan, Monster Hunter; Mother: Willow Painting, Chef.</p><p></p><p>Apart from his parents, there were no other listed relatives, certainly no elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor had a vague guess in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He wanted to test it, but also felt it was unlikely. </p><p></p><p>That morning during the array formation class, Master Yan suddenly announced an impromptu assignment - to draw out all the five element array patterns they had learned so far, to be handed in three days later.</p><p></p><p>The disciples present were stunned by this bad news, looking like eggplants hit by frost. </p><p></p><p>For Moku, drawing the arrays was no big deal since he had helped the Array Pavilion draw formations before. Now he just needed to draw a few array patterns, which wouldn't take much effort.</p><p></p><p>But why did Master Yan suddenly assign this homework? </p><p></p><p>This wasn't something the master normally did. Moku was a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Then An Xiaopang came begging Moku for help.</p><p></p><p>"Moku, you have to help me!!" An Xiaopang was almost in tears.</p><p></p><p>Who knew why the master had suddenly assigned homework? Normally it was only every few months that he would assign work to evaluate the disciples' array formation skills.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, An Xiaopang couldn't draw a single array pattern. With time running short, he could only turn to Moku for help.</p><p></p><p>Moku didn't mind - these basic array patterns held no difficulty for him now. </p><p></p><p>Moku drew the array formations for An Xiaopang, only charging a friendly price. When a few other fellow disciples from well-off families but lacking array skills also came to him, Moku agreed to help them too.</p><p></p><p>With array drawings to make and spirit stones to earn, Moku didn't have the mind to think about other things.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, when the array homework was handed in, Master Yan picked out the array patterns drawn by Moku, carefully looking them over before putting them into his storage bag. He then went to the Youyuan Vegetarian Hall to find the stout clerk.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Master Yan, the stout clerk became a bit wary. "Have you come for tea this time, or for me to handle something?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan said, "Neither tea nor a task, just asking you about something."</p><p></p><p>The stout clerk relaxed. "Oh, that's fine then."</p><p></p><p>"Do you still have the array diagrams Moku gave you?"</p><p></p><p>"Moku?" The clerk paused briefly. "Oh, that little brother. Yes, I do have them. What do you need them for?"</p><p></p><p>"How many sets?"</p><p></p><p>"I have several sets each of the Bright Flame Array and the Stabilizing Earth Array that I kept in reserve."</p><p></p><p>The stout clerk took out one copy each of the Bright Flame and Stabilizing Earth arrays that Moku had previously provided and handed them to Master Yan.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan looked them over, then took out Moku's homework and compared the array patterns on it one-by-one to the diagrams.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, Master Yan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The stout clerk craned his neck to look. "What are you looking at?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan pointed to the array patterns and the array diagrams beside them. "Do you think these patterns and these two arrays were drawn by the same person?"</p><p></p><p>The clerk took the patterns and arrays, furrowed his brow studying them carefully, then nodded. "The brushwork does seem quite similar. If I had to guess, they were likely done by the same hand..."</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then suddenly said, "Have you met Moku's elder brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Moku has no elder brother."</p><p></p><p>"No elder brother? Then who drew these arrays?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan gave the stout clerk an inscrutable look.</p><p></p><p>The clerk froze for a moment. "You can't mean...he drew them himself?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>The stout clerk fell silent for a moment, then scoffed derisively, "What nonsense!"</p><p></p><p>"Leaving aside the Bright Flame Array that he might possibly draw, this Stabilizing Earth Array has four interlinked patterns. Where would he get that much spiritual sense? Unless he grew a second head with another sea of consciousness?"</p><p></p><p>The stout clerk looked at Master Yan skeptically and continued, "Are you trying to say you taught a genius who can draw array formations at the third level of qi refinement? You can't be intentionally making yourself look good...I've known you for so many years, you're not that kind of person!"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan coolly looked at him and pointed to the arrays in front of them. "You yourself said these patterns and these two arrays were done by the same person. These patterns were drawn by Moku, so who drew these two arrays?"</p><p></p><p>The stout clerk was rendered speechless.</p><p></p><p>He stared at the patterns in his left hand and the arrays in his right for a long while before finally muttering, "It can't be..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

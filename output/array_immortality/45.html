        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Mr. Zhuang's teaching method changed. He only taught Mopi the theories of array formations up to the Qi Refining stage, while also having him practice various array formations, allowing Mopi to learn progressively step-by-step. </p><p></p><p>This method was similar to Master Yan's teaching approach, but Mr. Zhuang's realm was likely much higher, so his scope was broader, the details more comprehensive, and the logic clearer.</p><p></p><p>Mopi inwardly felt pity for Master Yan. If not for his realm limitations, Master Yan could have been more than an ordinary instructor. At least in terms of the inheritance of array formations and educational philosophies, Master Yan shared commonalities with the highly accomplished Mr. Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>The abstruse array formation theories that Mr. Zhuang previously taught gave Mopi headaches. Some theories Mopi had never encountered before, so he was completely clueless and could only memorize them mechanically. But no matter how good his memory was, he couldn't memorize those abstract, hollow theories. He would often forget the beginning after memorizing the end, and when revisiting the beginning, he would forget what came after. So his learning progressed very slowly.</p><p></p><p>These things that Mopi found so difficult to learn were considered the basics of studying array formations by the great clans. No wonder those great clans had stood in the cultivation world for tens of thousands of years without falling.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators lacked the profound heritage and inheritance compared to the clans, to the point that array masters were almost non-existent among ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Mopi sighed. Comparing himself to others was meaningless. He could only strive to do his best. Mopi admonished himself, then calmed his mind to study array formations according to Mr. Zhuang's method.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the Qi Refining stage now, focusing on drawing arrays with array theories as a supplement, Mopi learned much faster.</p><p></p><p>Because Mopi had drawn a huge number of array formations day and night - drawing on the Dao stele at night, on paper during the day, and occasionally doodling them on the ground with sticks when idle.</p><p></p><p>Just in terms of array formation practice volume, some late Qi Refining stage array masters might not surpass Mopi.</p><p></p><p>So after Mr. Zhuang changed his teaching method, Mopi learned very quickly. When it came to drawing the array formations himself after finishing the theories, Mopi's progress accelerated even more.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang first had Mopi re-learn a few array formations containing five array lines, including some five-element attributed arrays Mopi had never seen before. Lao Zuo even prepared the array diagrams and inks for Mopi.</p><p></p><p>Mopi studied them hungrily and persisted in drawing them. During the day at Mr. Zhuang's quiet residence, he drew array formations. At night in his dreams, he continued practicing on the Dao stele in his inner world. The five-line array formations posed little difficulty for Mopi - he could generally master one formation within a few days of familiarization.</p><p></p><p>Next was the six-line Freezing Water Array. Previously limited by his spiritual sense, Mopi couldn't draw the complete formation. But now, after more than half a month of daily array practice, his spiritual sense had grown considerably. Although still somewhat strained, he could fully draw out the six-line Freezing Water Array.</p><p></p><p>After the Freezing Water Array, Mr. Zhuang taught some new formations like the Thousand Catties Array, Flowing Sand Array, Light Rain Array and others. With his spiritual sense as support and diligent day-and-night practice, Mopi mastered all of them within half a month.</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang was quite satisfied - satisfied with Mopi's progress as well as his temperament. Not every child of Mopi's age had the perseverance to sit studying array formations daily.</p><p></p><p>However, privately Mr. Zhuang still felt a tinge of regret, so he said to Lao Zuo:</p><p></p><p>"This child Mopi's comprehension is even better than I initially thought. It's just a pity he's from an ordinary cultivator background lacking an array formation inheritance. His foundations are much weaker. Otherwise, he might not be too inferior to those genius scions of the great clans..."</p><p></p><p>"What's so great about those genius scions?" Mr. Zhuang fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Lao Zuo silently watched him, his voice flat and indifferent yet carrying an indescribable cynicism, "Weren't you once a genius scion yourself? And those disciples you took in before, weren't they all genius scions too? What was the end result? Do I need to spell out your current fallen state..."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang sighed, displeased, "If I died young, I would definitely be killed by your nagging!"</p><p></p><p>Lao Zuo remained unmoved, "Life and death is fated. For you to say such words shows you have not even glimpsed the essence of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Mr. Zhuang simply lay on the recliner, his tone profound, "The Heavens are cruel, all beings are like grass dogs. If one could truly comprehend the Heavenly Dao, then could one still be considered..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"What about people?"</p><p></p><p>The old Tao priest was still playing chess alone, sitting motionless like a rotten log. </p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang had taught quite a lot about the array formations containing six spirit lines, because the six-line formations were already quite comprehensive, involving the rudiments of many basic formations, so they required extensive study and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>When the six-line array formations had been completed, as Master Zhuang prepared to teach the seven-line formations, he discovered something quite surprising - Mo Hua's spiritual cognition was growing rather quickly. </p><p></p><p>When Master Zhuang first met Mo Hua, Mo Hua's spiritual cognition was insufficient for drawing six-line formations. But now, after a month, not only could Mo Hua's spiritual cognition support him in drawing a complete six-line array formation, he could even draw six and a half lines of a seven-line formation.</p><p></p><p>In just one month's time, Mo Hua's spiritual power had progressed only slightly, but his spiritual cognition had grown rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang slightly furrowed his brow, feeling something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>One day when Mo Hua was studying the seven-line array formations, Master Zhuang suddenly asked, "Mo Hua, do you know the meditation technique?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua looked puzzled and said, "This disciple has never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>"I see," Master Zhuang tapped his fingers on the table, pondered for a moment, and asked again, "Then have you ever seen any strange images or patterns before that, once you glanced at them, made your spiritual cognition involuntarily immersed in them?"</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua thought for a moment and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The strangest thing he had seen was the Dao stele in his mind, but there were no patterns or obvious lines on that stele. Staring at it for a long time wouldn't cause immersion either.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang was silent for a moment, then said, "You must have noticed that your spiritual cognition is growing faster than others'."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua nodded and said, "This disciple draws formations during the day and practices formations in dreams at night. Dreaming about drawing formations doesn't consume spiritual cognition, so by doing it day and night without stop, my spiritual cognition gradually strengthens."</p><p></p><p>He didn't mention the Dao stele, but everything else was the truth.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua wasn't actually sure whether the strengthening of his spiritual cognition was due to the Dao stele or simply from constantly drawing formations.</p><p></p><p>So Mo Hua asked, "Master, if I just keep drawing formations, will my spiritual cognition strengthen?"</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang was stumped by the question.</p><p></p><p>Drawing formations constantly consumes spiritual cognition, but also trains the sea of consciousness. Over a long period of time, spiritual cognition would naturally strengthen as well.</p><p></p><p>However, according to common practices in the cultivation world, the usual approach is to first find a way to enhance spiritual cognition, and then learn array formations.</p><p></p><p>Because relying solely on drawing formations to increase spiritual cognition is an extremely slow process, and it also risks depleting spiritual cognition and damaging the sea of consciousness, causing irreversible consequences.</p><p></p><p>Hence, very few cultivators attempt to strengthen their spiritual cognition through the most rudimentary, slowest, and highly risky method of just drawing formations.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang felt the situation wasn't that simple. With a hint of doubt, he looked at Mo Hua, but when he met Mo Hua's gaze, he found Mo Hua's eyes remarkably lucid and unexpectedly earnest and candid.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang had taught many disciples and seen admiring gazes, fearful ones, and those full of thoughts, but never such an honest look. He couldn't help but laugh and say, "Nevermind then."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the meditation technique?" Master Zhuang asked again.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua shook his head once more.</p><p></p><p>"The meditation technique allows a cultivator to quickly enter a state of meditation through contemplation, rapidly restoring spiritual cognition. This is not something a cultivator of your level should learn, but you are a bit special, so you can learn it now."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua didn't know what Master Zhuang meant by him being special, but he was happy to learn something new and said, "Thank you, Master."</p><p></p><p>"But there is one thing you must remember," Master Zhuang's expression gradually became solemn. "If anyone asks why your spiritual cognition is growing so quickly, just say it's because I taught you the meditation technique. Don't say anything else."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua felt a bit puzzled but had a vague sense that Master Zhuang was doing this for his own good, so he silently committed Master Zhuang's words to memory.</p><p></p><p>Master Zhuang nodded slightly, took out a thin book from his sleeve, on which three words were written:</p><p></p><p>'Meditation Technique'.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

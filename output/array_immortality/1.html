        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The year was 20,022 in the Dao calendar, the 10th day of the 9th month.</p><p></p><p>At Mount Tongshen outside Tongshen City. </p><p></p><p>A 10-year-old boy named Mohua, dressed in the plain disciple's robe of the outer sect, was squatting idly behind a huge boulder at the foot of the mountain, holding a grass stem and drawing intricate patterns on the ground.</p><p></p><p>As the Mao hour (5-7am) arrived, outer sect disciples studying at the sect trickled up the mountain in small groups, chatting and laughing.</p><p></p><p>A chubby boy wearing the standard outer sect robe adorned with precious jade ornaments, with a round face and small eyes, found Mohua contentedly drawing behind the boulder, accompanied by two or three attendants.</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy looked around and, seeing no sect instructors nearby, called out in a hushed voice, "Mohua!"  </p><p></p><p>Mohua looked up, revealing a handsome face with clear eyes like pools of water.</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy lowered his voice, "Did you get it done?"</p><p></p><p>The 10-year-old Mohua patted his chest like a little adult, "I took care of it, don't worry." He took out several talisman diagrams in red ink on white paper from his storage bag and handed them to the chubby boy. "Take a look and see if there's anything wrong."</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy accepted them solemnly, opened the copied diagrams, studied them carefully, then said with a pained look, "I can't make sense of them..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua patiently explained, "The assignment from the instructor was the basic talismans of the Five Phases. I drew them for you, but deliberately made six mistakes, so the instructor won't realize these talismans weren't drawn by you..."</p><p></p><p>"Six mistakes...isn't that too many?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua silently looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy soon realized his mistake and reflected, "One can't be too greedy. As long as I can turn in the assignment, that's good enough. If I do too well, it will arouse suspicion. If the instructor finds out, and my father learns of it, he'll beat me badly. It's not worth it, not worth it at all..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded, "As expected of Young Master An, you understand so quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The chubby boy stuffed two spirit stones into Mohua's hand. "Brother Mohua, you have good foresight to know I'm smart! Here are the spirit stones. Next time the instructor assigns a talisman exercise, I'll come to you again!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he tucked the talismans into his robe and scurried up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Mohua carefully put away the two spirit stones, plucked a new grass stem, and continued drawing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a thin young master arrived, fanning himself with a gilded paper fan. He had a sharp face and even more jade ornaments.</p><p></p><p>Mohua also gave him a set of talisman diagrams. The thin young master glanced at them and gave a signal to his attendant, who came forward, took the diagrams, and gave Mohua two spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But the thin young master didn't leave after getting the talismans. He suddenly closed his fan with an arrogant air and said, "This young master is also highly skilled in talismans. I just don't have time for these basic exercises, which is why I had you ghostwrite them."</p><p></p><p>Mohua ignored him and kept drawing with the grass stem.</p><p></p><p>The thin young master seemed a bit vexed and sneered, "Word is, among the Qi Refining disciples of Tongshen Sect, you draw the best talismans. I wonder how you compare to this young master? We should have a contest sometime."</p><p></p><p>Mohua thought to himself, "You're having me write your homework, how good can you be?"</p><p></p><p>But adhering to the principle of making money peacefully, Mohua looked up and flattered him, "Of course Young Master's talisman skills far surpass mine. The Qian family is the greatest clan in Tongshen City - no other disciples can match your inherited knowledge of talismans."</p><p></p><p>The thin young master's expression cleared slightly and he asked, "Then tell me, among the Qi Refining disciples here, who has talisman skills that can compare to mine?"</p><p></p><p>"There are some..."</p><p></p><p>The thin young master frowned, "Who?"</p><p></p><p>"Like me..." Of course Mohua wouldn't say something so stupid.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few, I can't list them all right now."</p><p></p><p>The thin young master was clearly angered.</p><p></p><p>"That's a good thing!" Mohua opened his eyes wide and spouted nonsense.</p><p></p><p>The thin young master sneered, "Not from as great a lineage as me, not as wealthy in spirit stones as me, yet surpassing me in talismans - are you saying there are many people like that? How is that a good thing? Are you implying my talents are stupid and inferior to others?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua said, "Among the cultivators of Tongshen City, no matter how gifted or skilled they become, in the end don't they all have to join your Qian family's Wanbao Pavilion to forge artifacts, concoct pills, and draw talismans?"</p><p></p><p>"Think about it - you're only at the Qi Refining stage, yet you'll have Foundational cultivators serving you. You're just a first-rank talisman master, yet higher-ranked masters will take your orders. How powerful is that! The stronger the abilities of your subordinates, the greater your own abilities appear!"</p><p></p><p>The thin young master was dumbstruck, then suddenly enlightened. "That...makes some sense."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Understand?"</p><p></p><p>The thin young master nodded, looking at the multitude of cultivators down the mountain, his neck raised even higher:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad! Not bad! No matter how great your talents are or how hard you cultivate, in the end don't you still have to be servants and horses for my Qian family?"</p><p></p><p>With a disdainful look, the young master of the Qian family finished speaking, then walked away with his chest puffed out.</p><p></p><p>After getting rid of the young master of the Qian family, Mo Hua continued practicing formation techniques on the ground using grass roots. </p><p></p><p>Soon a few more cultivators from wealthy families came over, exchanging money for goods, using spirit stones to buy several formation techniques from Mo Hua's hands. When Mo Hua finished trading the copied formation techniques, he had twelve spirit stones in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Twelve spirit stones was already a decent amount for a rogue cultivator, but for cultivation it was still far from enough.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua sighed, a hint of helplessness on his youthful face.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators at the bottom, the path of cultivation was hopeless...</p><p></p><p>In the first year of the Dao Era, over twenty thousand years ago, the greatest force in the cultivation world - the Dao Court, unified the nine states of cultivation, enfeoffed aristocratic families and sects, established a unified ranking system, and standardized the levels of cultivation professions.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Court also promulgated the 'Dao Laws', restricting cultivators from killing indiscriminately, plundering, or gathering resources excessively.  </p><p></p><p>Under this, the cultivation world developed and enjoyed over twenty thousand years of peace and prosperity, expanding vastly with cultivators too numerous to count.</p><p></p><p>However, while the Dao Court flourished, the aristocratic families feasted, and the great sects occupied entire regions, the rogue cultivators at the bottom had no one to rely on and lived impoverished lives with no hope of advancing in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Over the twenty thousand years the cultivation world propagated, the ordinary people without spiritual roots were naturally eliminated, leaving only those with spiritual roots who could cultivate.  But as more cultivators appeared, more and more spiritual qi was consumed from the heavens and earth until it was nearly depleted.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, for cultivators to advance, they not only needed inherited teachings, but also spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Yet the great clans monopolized the spirit mines, leaving the rogue cultivators at the bottom lacking spirit stones. The major sects monopolized the inherited teachings, barring ordinary rogue cultivators from the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In Tongxian City, the vast majority of rogue cultivators lacked both inherited teachings and spirit stones, so their entire lives they could only reach the Qi Refining realm.  </p><p></p><p>The Qi Refining realm was merely an insignificant insect under the vast heavens.</p><p></p><p>And Mo Hua was one of those countless insects.</p><p></p><p>And quite possibly would be for his entire life!</p><p></p><p>A hint of bitterness appeared on Mo Hua's childish face.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly dao may be impartial, but the path of cultivation was absolutely not...</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was a second level Qi Refining rogue cultivator born into a Qi Refining rogue cultivator family, with both his parents at the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>His father Mo Shan made a living as a spirit hunter, constantly battling demonic beasts and covered in scars. His mother worked as a cook's assistant in a restaurant, her lungs damaged from the stove's fumes, constantly coughing.</p><p></p><p>All the spirit stones his parents could save up through frugal living were just to allow Mo Hua to join the outer sect of Tongxian Sect and cultivate.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how hard Mo Hua cultivated, with his mediocre lower-grade spiritual root, though slightly better than ordinary people, in the cultivation world filled with geniuses, he was destined to be simply an average talent.</p><p></p><p>No matter how hard he cultivated, he would likely only reach the Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>With difficult family circumstances and no spirit stones, Mo Hua could only cultivate like an ordinary disciple up to the sixth level of Qi Refining before leaving the sect and finding some profession to make a living.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Hua was also born physically frail!</p><p></p><p>The livelihoods that Qi Refining cultivators typically relied on like crafting artifacts or spirit hunting generally required robust physical constitutions. With his innately frail body, Mo Hua might not even be able to find work for basic food and clothing.</p><p></p><p>If he got married and had children in the future, with increased burdens, any spirit stones would just go towards supporting the family.</p><p></p><p>Without spirit stones for cultivation, Mo Hua's cultivation would forever stagnate at the Qi Refining realm for his entire life.</p><p></p><p>Just like all the impoverished rogue cultivators in Tongxian City.  </p><p></p><p>Just like the countless cultivators at the bottom of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>His entire life would only reach the Qi Refining realm!</p><p></p><p>The ten-year-old Mo Hua sighed, composed himself, and went to attend classes at the sect. After cultivating for the day, Mo Hua returned to the disciples' residence, read some cultivation manuals, and lay down to sleep at the midnight hour.</p><p></p><p>As Mo Hua closed his eyes, a broken stele appeared in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>There were no words on the stele, but it seemed from the first moment Mo Hua saw it, he knew its name:</p><p></p><p>The Dao Stele!</p><p></p><p>A new xianxia novel, with the overall outline and world setting already completed.</p><p></p><p>Setting a small goal first, to write 1 million words.</p><p></p><p>Please help me get started!</p><p></p><p>Thank you.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

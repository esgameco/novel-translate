        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The market was a place for lower-level cultivators to trade cultivation items. There were all kinds of things - pills, formations, spiritual artifacts - you name it. However, the grades were generally not high, and the quality was uneven. </p><p></p><p>As the new year approached, there were many cultivators in the market, coming and going, noisy and boisterous.</p><p></p><p>Mohua went straight to a small stall at the end of the street. The stall owner was an old man named Sun, called Old Sun by regulars. His son worked as a minor clerk at Wanbao Building, and sometimes got his hands on substandard goods that Wanbao didn't want, which he would then pass on to his father to sell cheaply at the street stall.</p><p></p><p>Old Sun was calling out to attract customers when he saw Mohua running over, face flushed red from exertion. He couldn't help teasing: "Little brother, are you here to look at spiritual artifacts again? Don't tell me you're just going to look without buying, like last few times..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua waved his little hand dismissively, "Buy!"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun wondered, "It's still a few days until the new year, did your family give you your new year's money early?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua said displeased, "What new year's money, I earned this myself!" He patted the pouch at his waist.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the crisp sound of spirit stones clinking in the pouch, Old Sun's spirit lifted. He hurriedly said, "Pills, formations, artifacts - I've got it all here. Good quality, cheap prices, no cheating. And they're all from Wanbao Building, top-notch stuff. What does the young friend want to buy?"</p><p></p><p>If it was really top quality, Wanbao would sell it themselves instead of it ending up here. But Mohua didn't care, he couldn't afford Wanbao's goods anyway.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any fire-repelling artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun showed an "ah, I thought so" expression and took out a cloth bundle, laying it open in front of Mohua.</p><p></p><p>"The young friend mentioned it a few days ago, so I kept an eye out. I went and specifically found a few good fire-repelling artifacts. They're top-quality, portable, and beautifully designed. Take a look, young friend?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua gave Old Sun a surprised look, thinking to himself that as someone who had run a stall in the market for decades, he was certainly well-prepared to seize any business opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The artifacts laid out in front of Mohua were of various styles - rings, jade pendants, lamps, even a cover and scarf... Just looking at the variety, it was already the most complete selection in this market.</p><p></p><p>Mohua examined them carefully, then picked up an antiqued but exquisite hairpin and asked, "What kind of hairpin is this?"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun replied, "This is called a fire-repelling hairpin. It's a standard spiritual artifact with unified materials and craftsmanship standards. It has a basic fire-repelling formation carved on it. You need to charge it with spirit stones, and when activated, the formation can block out heat and keep the user cool. Although it consumes spirit stones, one stone can last three months of use, so it's quite economical..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua said skeptically, "If this is a standard Wanbao Building artifact being sold here, it must have some defect..."</p><p></p><p>Old Sun smiled, "You're not wrong, you seem to know a fair bit. I won't lie to you - if it was flawless, it would be sold at Wanbao for at least twice the price I'm offering. But it's not that there's a major defect..."</p><p></p><p>Old Sun pointed to the peony flower pattern on the hairpin, "When the craftsman was carving this peony, they added a few extra strokes, which violates the standard. So this hairpin got classified as a substandard product. But the formation inside is intact and the efficacy is still the same."</p><p></p><p>Mohua nodded, feeling this hairpin was the most suitable choice. He asked, "How many spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun stroked his beard, "One flat price - fifteen spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Mohua shook his head, "Five!"  </p><p></p><p>Old Sun's eyes widened, "Who taught you to bargain like that?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua felt a bit embarrassed, "I overheard it from other stalls, they all bargain like this..."</p><p></p><p>Old Sun sighed deeply, "Truly the moral decline of our era, even good kids are being led astray!" Then he said, "Fourteen spirit stones, I can't go any lower!"</p><p></p><p>Mohua probed a bit higher, "Six?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After some back-and-forth bargaining, the final price settled at ten spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>Old Sun felt he couldn't afford to go any lower, not a single spirit stone less. And Mohua had asked around about artifact prices at other stalls, so he knew this was about as cheap as it gets, and agreed.</p><p></p><p>Old Sun took the spirit stones from Mohua and carefully wrapped the hairpin in an inexpensive but exquisite paper box, handing it to Mohua while muttering:</p><p></p><p>"If my grandson was even half as clever as you, I'd have him help me at the stall. But alas, my grandson is so dull-witted, he can't even speak up around strangers."</p><p></p><p>Mohua took the hairpin, satisfied, waved goodbye to Old Sun, and left with a light step.</p><p></p><p>A neighboring stall owner laughed, "Old Sun, you took a loss on this one!"</p><p></p><p>Old Sun stroked his beard, "Not a loss, just a bit less profit."</p><p></p><p>The stall owner asked curiously, "Ten spirit stones for that hairpin..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"That's not a small amount of spirit stones. I wonder who this child bought the hairpin for."</p><p></p><p>"The Fire-Dispelling Hairpin is for dispelling fire, dispelling the fire energy from stoves. Who else would it be for?" </p><p></p><p>Watching Moku's figure gradually disappear into the distance, the old Mr. Sun let out a slight sigh, "What a good child!"</p><p></p><p>Moku's home was on a remote street on the edge of Tongxian City. The house was old and not very big, just enough for a family of three. The surrounding residents were also low-level cultivators who made a living doing odd jobs and temporary work. Though not wealthy, the neighborhood had a lively atmosphere. </p><p></p><p>In the evening, wisps of cooking smoke rose from every household and yellow lamps were lit.</p><p></p><p>Moku ran in the door, calling out, "Mother, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>From the inner room came a woman dressed in simple cotton clothes with a beautiful face. Seeing Moku, her eyes lit up with delight. Unable to contain herself, she pulled Moku in front of her, stroking his head and pinching his face for a moment before saying, "You must have been too diligent in your cultivation, you've lost so much weight."</p><p></p><p>Moku said, "I haven't lost weight." Then he took out a box, "Mother, this is for you!"</p><p></p><p>The woman was stunned for a moment, then took the box and opened it to find a hairpin inside.</p><p></p><p>"This is a Fire-Dispelling Hairpin. Mother, you work in the tavern kitchen, constantly exposed to fire energy which is bad for your health. This hairpin can dispel the fire energy and keep you much cooler."</p><p></p><p>The woman's surname was Liu, her given name Ruhua, Moku's mother and a scattered cultivator at the Qi Condensation realm in Tongxian City.</p><p></p><p>The life of a scattered cultivator was already difficult, with no good jobs to earn spirit stones. Having a child made it even harder, with expenses for food, clothing, shelter, and especially cultivation resources for disciples who joined sects - these were considerable costs for ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua was a skilled cook and worked as a kitchen assistant at a small tavern in the city. </p><p></p><p>Large taverns generally used stoves refined by artifact refiners with formations that consumed spirit stones to convert spiritual energy into fire power for cooking.</p><p></p><p>But small taverns tried to save costs by not using spirit stones. Instead, they had cultivators with fire spiritual roots expend spiritual power to produce the cooking flames. Over time, this inevitably caused damage to the body from the invasive fire energy, drying up the meridians and causing symptoms like lung pain and dry coughing.</p><p></p><p>When Liu Ruhua assisted in the tavern kitchen, she had to expend her spiritual power from time to time to produce flames, earning around thirty spirit stones per month in wages. Although it harmed her body, this was considered a decent job for a scattered cultivator, with many Qi Condensation cultivators unable to find such an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the hairpin in her hand, Liu Ruhua pursed her lips without speaking.</p><p></p><p>Moku hurriedly said, "The spirit stones I used to buy the hairpin were earned by helping out fellow disciples, I didn't deceive or steal or rob anyone!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua couldn't help but smile, her heart warming though with a tinge of sourness. "Mother can't accept this hairpin. You're still young and will need a lot of spirit stones for future cultivation. We should save where we can. Mother can take care of herself, you don't need to worry..."</p><p></p><p>Moku confidently said, "We'll talk about the future later. Maybe I'll become a great Golden Core or Nascent Soul cultivator in the future with as many spirit stones as I need."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua laughed out loud, tapping Moku's forehead with her finger. "At such a young age, you've already learned to brag."</p><p></p><p>"Mother, just keep it. I bargained for a long time before I could buy it at that price. If you don't take it, wouldn't all my effort have been wasted?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Moku took the hairpin and pinned it in Liu Ruhua's bun, then ran to fetch a mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Look, isn't it beautiful?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the elegant woman in the mirror adorned with the simple hairpin, looking graceful and lovely, and seeing her son's bright, blinking eyes, Liu Ruhua's heart softened. She gently said, "Alright, I'll accept this hairpin, but don't give me anything else next time."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes," Moku readily agreed. "Mother, is the food ready? I'm hungry."</p><p></p><p>"It's ready, all your favorites. Eat more!"</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua was an excellent cook. Although it was just simple vegetable dishes without any spiritual energy, she made them exquisite and delicious. After eating and chatting with his mother, Moku returned to his room to read.</p><p></p><p>After the third night watch, Moku entered his consciousness realm and practiced array formations on the stele all night, waking up at the fifth night watch.</p><p></p><p>Moku sat in meditation, holding a spirit stone as he went through his regular cultivation routine.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes again, dawn had arrived and bright sunlight shone into the room. Moku lay there, stretching lazily, about to get up when he heard heavy footsteps outside.</p><p></p><p>Moku rolled over onto his stomach and peeked through the door crack to see a man covered in bloodstains and dust enter - it was his father, Moku Shan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

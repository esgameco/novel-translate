        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Moku went back and tried drawing the array patterns several times according to Yan Jiaoxi's instructions, and indeed felt enlightened. </p><p></p><p>At night when practicing on the stone tablet, his comprehension became much quicker. </p><p></p><p>For parts he didn't understand, drawing them repeatedly would gradually reveal the crux.</p><p></p><p>As long as he grasped the basic array patterns firmly, learning some variations wouldn't be too difficult. The hard part was having no one to guide him, so Moku wouldn't think in that direction naturally, getting stuck.</p><p></p><p>After another day of familiarization, on the third evening after class, Moku began formally drawing the Earth-Stabilizing Array.</p><p></p><p>The start wasn't smooth, but after stumbling, he managed to draw it out, though it took quite a long time.</p><p></p><p>For the four-line Earth-Stabilizing Array, it took Moku one and a half hours to complete. Afterwards, due to depleting his spiritual energy greatly, he had to rest for another hour.  </p><p></p><p>By the time Moku finished the array, it was already the midnight hour.</p><p></p><p>Moku checked it over and unsurprisingly, found he had drawn it incorrectly.</p><p></p><p>Moku sighed.</p><p></p><p>He only drew one array the whole night, and it was wrong.</p><p></p><p>With only five days left to complete ten arrays, time was getting tight.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Moku pondered and ultimately had no choice but to skip some cultivation classes.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't skip classes like cultivation history and general knowledge, as those could broaden his horizons and experience.</p><p></p><p>As for pill refining and talisman scripting which required spending spirit stones on herbs and jade slips, renting the sect's furnaces, the tuition was quite costly, so Moku selectively skipped some of those classes.</p><p></p><p>After all, in these cultivation paths requiring huge spirit stone expenses, he likely had no future in this lifetime anyway.</p><p></p><p>Then he could just skip all the body cultivation classes.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators temper their spiritual power through methods, using spiritual power to drive martial or spell techniques.</p><p></p><p>There were two main categories of techniques - spell-type and martial-type.</p><p></p><p>Spells manipulate spiritual energy with the spiritual sense, condensing it into spell attacks. Martial arts stimulate the body's potential with spiritual energy for physical combat.</p><p></p><p>Those who cultivate spells are called spirit cultivators, those who cultivate martial arts are body cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the Qi Condensation stage, there are more body cultivators than spirit cultivators. Especially in Tongshen City where most make a living hunting demons, spirit cultivation is weak and unsuitable for demon hunting, so most roaming cultivators take the body cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Tongshen Sect specially opened a body cultivation class to let inner disciples temper their bodies early on.</p><p></p><p>But Moku was destined to be unable to cultivate his body.</p><p></p><p>He didn't inherit his father Moku Shan's talent for body cultivation, instead being more like his mother Liu Ruhua, born somewhat frail, even weaker than Liu Ruhua's constitution.</p><p></p><p>According to Elder Feng from the Xinglin Hall of Pill Refining, cultivators are born following the Heavenly Dao, their spiritual sense and physical body relatively balanced.</p><p></p><p>Moku was born with memories from two lifetimes, his spiritual sense innately too strong, causing an imbalance with his body that consumed the other, leaving Moku frail and sickly from birth.</p><p></p><p>A hundred-pound cauldron others could easily lift, Moku couldn't budge an inch even exerting all his strength. Cultivators of the same age were generally a head taller and more robust than Moku.</p><p></p><p>Though slender, Moku's appearance was at least refined and gentle, with red lips and white teeth. At ten years old he looked like a porcelain doll.</p><p></p><p>This appearance wasn't bad, but Moku still felt a grown man should be more imposing and heroic.</p><p></p><p>Like his father - tall and heroic-looking, exuding might.</p><p></p><p>In Moku's dreams, he would wear white robes, cultivate a supreme martial art, wield a dragon-like spear, able to guard a pass alone against tens of thousands of foes.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this scene could only be seen in dreams.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's right."</p><p></p><p>Mohua realized that after falling asleep, his spiritual consciousness would automatically enter the sea of consciousness, so he couldn't dream...</p><p></p><p>The instructor who taught disciples body cultivation originally wanted to strictly require Mohua, but after Mohua pushed the stone cauldron a few times without it budging an inch, while Mohua himself sprained his arm, the instructor became much more lenient with Mohua. </p><p></p><p>Cultivation is like this, sometimes no matter how hard you try, it can't solve the problem.</p><p></p><p>The instructor was very understanding towards Mohua.</p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Way closes a window for you, it may want you to go through a different door, rather than wanting you to stubbornly keep knocking on that closed window.</p><p></p><p>So for these few classes, Mohua chose to skip them selectively. With the freed up time, Mohua locked himself in his room, focused solely on painting the Fixed Earth Formation.</p><p></p><p>Five days later during the periodic break, Mohua finally used up the ten sets of materials, successfully completing six out of the ten formations.</p><p></p><p>Not only did he avoid losses, he could even earn four spirit stones. Mohua was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the one day break during the periodic rest, Mohua went to the Youyuan Vegetarian Restaurant on North Street and handed over the painted Fixed Earth Formations to the fat manager.</p><p></p><p>After looking them over, the fat manager said to Mohua: "Your elder brother's foundation in this formation really is quite poor, but he does seem to learn things quite quickly. These few formations visibly get better and better with each one. It's just that..."</p><p></p><p>The manager took out the first formation to critique again: "This formation is painted just like a beginner's work, with some of the basic formation lines drawn clumsily..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua was used to the manager's nagging, letting it go in one ear and out the other.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the manager was talking about his elder brother, what did it have to do with him?</p><p></p><p>He didn't have an elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Mohua directly asked the key point: "Can I exchange them for spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>The manager gave Mohua a blank look, but still counted out four spirit stones for him, "Tell your elder brother to paint better next time."</p><p></p><p>"Mm hmm," Mohua nodded repeatedly after getting the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Mohua used these four spirit stones to buy pastries. He ate two pieces himself, kept two, and gave the rest to Dahu and the others.</p><p></p><p>Seeing so many pastries, Dahu and the other two were deeply moved and asked Mohua if he wanted to eat meat too, as they had seen the elder raising a colorful and plump duck.</p><p></p><p>Mohua had a bit of a headache and told them not to steal anymore, otherwise the sect would notify their parents, and it would be strange if their fathers and mothers didn't beat them until they shed a layer of skin when they returned home.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Dahu and the other two reluctantly give up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Mohua continued painting the Fixed Earth Formation for over two more months.</p><p></p><p>The more he painted, the more proficient he became in grasping it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Previously, painting one Fixed Earth Formation, including the time to rest and recover his spiritual consciousness, took about three hours. Now it only took an hour and a half.</p><p></p><p>Firstly, practice makes perfect - the deeper his understanding and grasp of the formation lines, the less time was needed to draw them. Secondly, from constantly practicing the formation day and night, continuously expending, recovering and applying his spiritual consciousness, Mohua's spiritual consciousness strength was tempered unknowingly, becoming much thicker and richer compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Having powerful spiritual consciousness clearly provided great benefits for painting formations.</p><p></p><p>The success rate of the Fixed Earth Formation also reached 80-90%. Occasionally all ten would succeed. Each formation could earn two spirit stones, so over these two months, after deducting living expenses, Mohua had earned a full one hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Mohua planned to save up two hundred spirit stones, then go to the sect to select a mid-grade lower-tier cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>After selecting it, he would tell his parents. Otherwise they would definitely say they would provide the spirit stones, and that Mohua should keep his spirit stones for future cultivation, or for marrying a spouse and buying a cave abode and such.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Your mother overexerted herself. She used her spiritual power to stoke the kitchen fires for long periods, which damaged her heart and lungs from the fire's qi. This caused her coughing, weakness and difficulty breathing."</p><p></p><p>Elder Feng explained the condition to Moxhua, continuing:</p><p></p><p>"When she was first brought in, she could barely breathe. I refined some medicinal pills that temporarily relieved her, so there's no immediate concern for now. But going forward, she needs to recuperate properly. She cannot use her spiritual power to stoke the fires anymore, nor can she continue her kitchen duties at the dining hall. Otherwise, it will inevitably ruin her heart and lungs beyond recovery."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Moxhua became afraid and couldn't help deeply bowing again, saying: "I will forever remember Elder Feng's kindness!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Feng helped Moxhua up, giving a slight smile. "Saving lives is simply part of a pill master's duties, no need to speak of kindness. Though young, you are quite formal in speech. By the time you can repay me, this old man may already be in the ground."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua felt relieved and smiled back: "With Elder Feng's benevolent heart as a pill master, you're sure to live a few hundred years more!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Feng laughed aloud. "You've been able to speak well since young."</p><p></p><p>"My mother works in the dining hall's kitchens, which should only be four hours a day. Previously she was fine, so why did her heart and lungs suddenly become so severely damaged?" Moxhua couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>Elder Feng said: "I asked the head kitchen lady. Starting this year, your mother's kitchen hours increased from four to six hours per day. With the longer time, her spiritual power depleted more easily, coupled with overexertion, her condition naturally worsened."</p><p></p><p>"But didn't the fire-dispelling hairpin help?"</p><p></p><p>"You mean the hairpin your mother wore?" Elder Feng stroked his beard and nodded in explanation. "That hairpin is useful, but it's just an ordinary spiritual tool, not high-grade. Its efficacy is limited. But it's still good she had that hairpin, otherwise your mother's condition would be even worse. Even if cured, there would be lingering heart and lung issues."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua felt some relief but also lingering worry. He then asked about the diagnosis fees. Elder Feng said: "The dining hall's manager came earlier. They feel very regretful about your mother's situation, so they will cover all the medicinal pill costs. You don't need to worry about that."</p><p></p><p>Elder Feng winked slyly at Moxhua and said softly: "Since they are being so considerate, this old man won't be polite and will use only the best ingredients to refine the pills, ensuring your mother's full recovery."</p><p></p><p>Moxhua felt reassured and sincerely thanked Elder Feng again. He then asked softly: "Can I go see my mother?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Feng nodded. "Go ahead, your mother just took the pills and is resting. Just be quiet."</p><p></p><p>The side rooms at the Xinlin Hall were connected, with a few sickbeds set up for patients to rest. Though simple, it was clean and tidy, with a faint scent of incense.</p><p></p><p>When Moxhua saw Liuruxhua, she was lying quietly asleep on an inner sickbed, breathing lightly with a pale and somewhat haggard face.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua brought over a small stool and sat quietly by her side, gazing at her face.</p><p></p><p>He remembered when he was first born, his mother was still very young, gentle and beautiful, with a lovely smile.</p><p></p><p>Now, ten years had passed without realizing it.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators with longer lifespans, ten years wasn't much. Some cultivators' appearances wouldn't change at all in that time.</p><p></p><p>But Moxhua's mother had already become somewhat haggard, with a few strands of white hair at her temples.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how he was slowly growing up, while his parents aged unknowingly, by the time he suddenly noticed, they were no longer as he remembered.</p><p></p><p>Moxhua's heart...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau did not know how long she had been asleep. When she woke up, she found Mohua lying beside her with red eyes. She felt both reassured and a little distressed. </p><p></p><p>Liuruhau stroked Mohua's head, "Why did you come here? Shouldn't you be cultivating at the sect?"</p><p></p><p>Mohua silently looked at her. Liuruhau felt a bit embarrassed and said, "Mother is fine, you don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>"Master Feng said you have to help in the kitchen for six hours every day."</p><p></p><p>"Six hours is nothing. Look at the uncles and aunties in the neighborhood, sometimes their work is even harder. Your father goes out hunting demons and sometimes doesn't sleep for days. Everyone is like this..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua shook his head, "Mother, your body is not well, how can it be the same? Are we short of spirit stones at home?"</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau sighed slightly, "We don't lack spirit stones at home, but aren't you about to learn a cultivation method soon? A mid-grade lower-level method needs over 200 spirit stones. I want to save up so you can choose a better one."</p><p></p><p>Mohua looked dazed, "I didn't mention cultivation methods, how did you know, Mother?"</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau stroked Mohua's head again, "Silly child, how could your mother not know? You didn't say it because you're sensible, but your parents must make plans for you. Your father and I are only at the Qi Refining stage, so we can't give you the best, but we still want to give you something better within our means."</p><p></p><p>Mohua's nose felt sour. Then he took out a storage bag and said, "Mother, I can earn it myself. I've already earned 180 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>This time it was Liuruhau's turn to be surprised. She opened her mouth slightly, and after a while said, "How did you earn so many..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua's mood improved, "I help people draw formation diagrams."</p><p></p><p>"Is it still that Fortunate Teahouse on North Street?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Mohua said, then looked dazed again, "How did you know about this too, Mother?"</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau laughed lightly, "Your father told me. That day he saw you take out so many spirit stones, he suspected someone was trying to deceive you for ill intentions, so he followed you to that shop and asked the manager a few questions. Then he found out you weren't deceived, but instead you deceived the manager. As your mother, I didn't even know you had taken an elder brother..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua's mouth opened wide. He felt he had hidden everything, but in fact hid nothing. He didn't even know when his father had followed him to the formation pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau stroked Mohua's face with relief, "When I saw you were so small and thin as a child, I worried you would be bullied and wouldn't be able to make a living in the future. I never expected at such a young age you could already earn so many spirit stones. Your mother can finally be at ease."</p><p></p><p>"However, you should keep these spirit stones for yourself. Don't think the amount is still decent now - when your cultivation level rises in the future, or you take a spouse and have children, you'll need to spend quite a few spirit stones. Save them now so you won't be caught unprepared later."</p><p></p><p>Mohua shook his head, "Mother, I'll definitely earn more spirit stones in the future. You don't need to worry about that now. The most important thing is for you to recover your health. Don't concern yourself with other matters."</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau looked at Mohua warmly, wanting to say more, but unable to hold back a cough. Mohua stopped her from speaking further and urged her to rest well.</p>

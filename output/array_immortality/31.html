        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Master Chen had cultivated to the 8th level of qi refining and was over 100 years old. His hair was half white, his physique was strong, and his face was darkened from years of being exposed to the forge fires, but his spirit was vigorous and his voice boomed loudly. </p><p></p><p>Master Chen was watching a few of his disciples forging iron. Perhaps the disciples had done something incorrectly, as Master Chen glared sternly at them, scolding them harshly. The tall, burly disciples obediently took the scolding without daring to raise their heads.</p><p></p><p>After reprimanding them, Master Chen himself grabbed a large hammer to demonstrate, his powerful physique making the heavy hammer seem light as he struck the glowing red iron, sending sparks flying everywhere. Gradually, the shape of a blade began to form.</p><p></p><p>When he finished hammering, Master Chen merely wiped away some sweat, his breathing even, as if he hadn't exerted much effort at all.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua, who was naturally weak, watched enviously, wishing he could one day have such strength...</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, this is how you forge iron properly. What you all were doing earlier was feeble and lacking spirit - even a young lady embroidering would have more vigor!"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen scolded his disciples again, then turned to see a rosy-cheeked, bright-eyed child gazing at him admiringly. </p><p></p><p>Master Chen hesitated a moment before asking, "Little one, do you want to learn how to forge as well?"</p><p></p><p>It was difficult for wandering cultivators to make a living outside of sects, so those who didn't learn practical skills had to find their own ways to support themselves by learning a trade.</p><p></p><p>Nearby cultivators often sent their children to learn forging from Master Chen so they could become self-sufficient in the future.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen only charged a modest fee in spirit stones, or accepted spirit grains as tuition.</p><p></p><p>Muo Hua looked at the tall, burly disciples, then down at his own skinny arms and legs, and shook his head. He said directly, "Master, do you also craft stoves here?"</p><p></p><p>"Stoves?" Master Chen looked at Muo Hua. "Why is a little kid asking about that?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm asking for my mother."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I can certainly forge stoves. But crafting a stove requires a lot of refined iron, which would cost quite a significant sum in spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"What about a smaller one, would that be cheaper?"</p><p></p><p>Master Chen replied, "Naturally, a smaller stove requires less refined iron and labor, so it would be more affordable. However, in this Immortal City, few craft small stoves. We'd have to specially hire someone to design and inscribe the array formations, which would also require a considerable amount of spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Then what would be the approximate cost in spirit stones for the smallest stove?"</p><p></p><p>Rather than brushing off Muo Hua for being a child, Master Chen seriously took out a sheet of paper and listed out the prices for all the required materials. He then calculated the total costs for stoves of different sizes and scales.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen handed the paper to Muo Hua and added, "Of course, this is just the material cost. We forgers also charge for our labor time - however many days it takes to craft the stove, we charge for that many days' worth of fees."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see," Muo Hua noted it all down, then said, "I'll record this and discuss with my parents what size stove to have forged before coming back to you."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen nodded and waved, "Go on home then, little one. Be careful on the road!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't think much of what Muo Hua said. Many cultivators inquired about commissioning work from him, only to say they'd consider it and never follow up after hearing the prices.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this was just a ten-year-old child asking about a stove - a labor-intensive spirit tool. Most likely it would lead nowhere.</p><p></p><p>When Muo Hua returned home, he selected an appropriately sized and affordable stove option from Master Chen's price list, with just the material cost being around 150 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>There was also the labor fee still to be negotiated. Muo Hua didn't know how long it would take Master Chen to forge this particular stove, but estimated it would require at least 10 to 15 days, so the labor cost would likely be 50 to 75 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Between the rocks. </p><p></p><p>Some were beyond the budget for ink paintings, so he might need to ask his parents for some spirit stones later, or borrow some from someone.</p><p></p><p>Next, the most crucial part was the array formation. </p><p></p><p>Moku unfolded the Molten Fire Array diagram and placed it on the table, beginning to study it carefully.</p><p></p><p>The Molten Fire Array diagram contained five fire-type array patterns. The strokes of the patterns were mostly positioned in the parting fire position. Just looking at the intricate patterns, they were much more complex than the Gold Stone Array and the Stabilizing Earth Array.</p><p></p><p>Moku let out a slight sigh, cleared his mind of distractions, and began to focus on memorizing the patterns and stroke order.</p><p></p><p>Moku studied diligently, and before he knew it, the sky had turned dark.</p><p></p><p>Even during mealtimes, Moku was thinking about the patterns of the Molten Fire Array. He took a few bites of the steamed bun, then became lost in thought, gripping the bun absentmindedly. </p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua looked at him with a mix of exasperation and amusement, pinching his cheeks, "You need to eat your food properly. Finish eating before thinking about other things."</p><p></p><p>Moku snapped out of it, letting out an awkward laugh, then focused on eating. After finishing, he ran back into the room.</p><p></p><p>Moku had more or less memorized the patterns of the Molten Fire Array. He then spent another hour practicing on draft paper using non-spiritually imbued ink. Afterwards, during the night watch, he entered his consciousness realm and began practicing the array formation on the stone stele.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at the patterns, although quite intricate, the basic construction logic was no different from other array formations. Memorizing the patterns wasn't too difficult; the hard part would be his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Moku's spiritual consciousness might not be able to sustain him drawing a complete Molten Fire Array diagram.</p><p></p><p>Moku began drawing the Molten Fire Array on the broken stele.</p><p></p><p>Initially, the first three patterns went smoothly, but when he reached the fourth pattern, he clearly started struggling. His spiritual consciousness gradually slowed down, with a feeling of gradually drying up.</p><p></p><p>Moku's small brow furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>By the time he finished the fourth pattern, stabbing pains reverberated through his consciousness realm, as if the dried-up riverbed had started developing cracks.</p><p></p><p>Moku hurriedly stopped and quickly erased the patterns from the broken stele, and the stabbing pains in his spiritual consciousness eased.</p><p></p><p>Moku collapsed onto the seemingly real yet unreal ground of his consciousness realm, gasping for air.</p><p></p><p>"It's no good, my spiritual consciousness is lacking too much..."</p><p></p><p>Moku's spiritual consciousness was only enough to draw four of the patterns. After drawing four patterns, he had no remaining energy to draw the fifth pattern.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was only missing one pattern, but his spiritual consciousness couldn't rapidly increase in the short term. This single remaining pattern might stall his progress for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Moku pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>There was no shortcut for increasing spiritual consciousness - this was a commonly accepted truth in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>At least for cultivators at the Refining Qi realm in Tongxian City, this point was accepted.</p><p></p><p>Moku had consulted Master Yan before, and Master Yan had said that the growth of spiritual consciousness mostly relies on increasing one's cultivation level. The higher the cultivation realm, the stronger one's spiritual consciousness naturally becomes.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, it depends on exercising the use of one's spiritual consciousness to strengthen it. The more frequently a cultivator uses their spiritual consciousness, the stronger it naturally becomes. For example, array cultivators who constantly draw array formations need to frequently utilize their spiritual consciousness, so their spiritual consciousness is much stronger than ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moku had also asked if there were any special methods to cultivate spiritual consciousness, but Master Yan directly stated there were none.</p><p></p><p>Whether in ancient texts or the various cultivation methods recorded by great clans, there were no safe and reliable methods for cultivating spiritual consciousness. Some were demonic cultivation methods of evil paths - once practiced, the cultivator would likely stray into demonic cultivation and become a demon cultivator to be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>As for whether such methods truly didn't exist or were secretly kept by the great clans, that was unknown.</p><p></p><p>But even if such methods existed, Moku definitely couldn't obtain them. And even if he did, he wouldn't dare take the risk of straying into demonic cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moku was currently at the third level of Refining Qi and couldn't break through to the fourth level anytime soon, so he couldn't rely on increasing his cultivation level to strengthen his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The only method available was:</p><p></p><p>Constantly drawing array formations.  </p><p></p><p>When there is no shortcut, the best shortcut is the method without shortcuts.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

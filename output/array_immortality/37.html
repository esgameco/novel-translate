        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Mo Shan went out and returned in the evening carrying a large bundle filled with buffalo meat. </p><p></p><p>"I went to see Old Zhao. He still had a lot left over. No one was buying this meat and he couldn't eat it all himself, so I took it all back."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua then soaked the meat to remove the blood, and marinated it with some spicy and fragrant seasonings.</p><p></p><p>These seasonings were gathered by Liu Ruhua from the mountains and sun-dried herself, using a method she learned from a neighbor's wife. It was a seasoning blend that scattered cultivator families in Tongxian City would make, but Liu Ruhua's had a better aroma.</p><p></p><p>The buffalo meat was marinated overnight. The next day, it was put into the stove and boiled for half a day. Liu Ruhua then fished out the meat, discarded the water in the pot, added fresh water and more spicy seasonings. She first boiled it over high heat, then simmered over low heat, stewing it this way for another night and day.</p><p></p><p>On the third evening, the stove fire was finally extinguished and the pot lid lifted. Hot steam billowed out, the aroma of meat mingling with the fragrance of spices, pervading the entire room.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua took a small knife, sliced off a piece of meat into thin slices, placed them on a plate and set it on the table. She then motioned to Mo Hua, "Hua'er, come try it."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua picked up his chopsticks, took a piece and put it in his mouth. After a few chews, he found it meltingly tender and flavorful, the lingering aroma coating his palate. The slight gaminess was neutralized by the spicy flavors, presenting a unique taste.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, this is the most delicious meat I've ever eaten!"</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan also tried a bite, his eyes lighting up as he praised his wife, "It's even better than what the chefs at restaurants make."</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua smiled modestly, sampling a piece herself. But she still seemed a bit unsatisfied, "The flavor is still a bit off. The spices need to be a bit lighter, the spicy taste a bit stronger...and it needs to be cooked over higher heat..."</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua thought it was already delicious. In his decade of life, he had never tasted meat this good. As for whether he had in his previous life, he couldn't recall.</p><p></p><p>The buffalo meat tasted excellent, giving them confidence to open a food stall. Liu Ruhua portioned out some of the meat into small food containers, asking Mo Shan and Mo Hua to distribute some to their neighbors and friends.</p><p></p><p>Mo Shan took some to share with the neighbors and his friends in the monster-hunting squad.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua carried a container and first delivered a portion to Old Master Feng at the Xinglin Hall, thanking him for treating his mother's illness. He then brought a portion to Master Chen, since the stove used to stew the buffalo was forged by him, so he should let the maker taste it too.</p><p></p><p>Old Master Feng was an expert in dietary therapy, but he couldn't resist trying a few slices of the buffalo meat Mo Hua brought, praising it profusely.</p><p></p><p>As for Master Chen, he split half the portion for his disciples like Da Zhu to eat, keeping the rest for himself to enjoy with alcohol.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua also brought some portions to the home of Da Hu and his family.</p><p></p><p>Da Hu's family surname was Meng, though the three of them - Da Hu, Shuang Hu and Xiao Hu - were not biological brothers...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If they made a mistake, they were beaten and scolded together. </p><p></p><p>As the three children gradually grew up and had bigger appetites, the originally not well-off family became even more strapped for money than others.</p><p></p><p>When Moxiang delivered beef, the Meng family was having dinner. </p><p></p><p>Da Hu, Shuang Hu, and Xiao Hu were gnawing on steamed buns and chewing on salted vegetables. When they heard Moxiang had brought beef, their eyes went wide. When Moxiang opened the food container and the aroma wafted out, all three had their mouths watering.</p><p></p><p>Auntie Meng glared at the three kids, "Thank the person before eating their food!"</p><p></p><p>Shuang Hu was the first to thump his chest and say, "Moxiang! Between brothers, no need for polite words. No matter who bullies you in the future, I'll beat them up for you!"</p><p></p><p>Da Hu and Xiao Hu chimed in together, "Me too! Me too!"</p><p></p><p>Auntie Meng picked up her chopsticks and rapped each of the three little tigers on the head, saying irritably, "You never study properly, only know how to fight. If the three of you together were half as sensible as Moxiang, I'd burn incense to give thanks!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, seeing the three kids looking pitifully at the meat, Auntie Meng softened a bit and said, "Eat, eat. But remember to help your Uncle Moxiang and Auntie Liu with chores in the future. Don't just eat other people's food for free all the time."</p><p></p><p>The three little tigers quickly nodded, then each took a piece of meat and put it in Grandpa Meng and Grandma Meng's bowls before digging into the rest.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the beef entered Xiao Hu's mouth, he widened his eyes and said, "This meat is so delicious!"</p><p></p><p>Da Hu and Shuang Hu nodded vigorously with their mouths stuffed with meat.</p><p></p><p>Hearing his mother's cooking praised made Moxiang very happy too.</p><p></p><p>Grandpa and Grandma Meng tasted the meat and kept nodding, then put the remaining meat onto the three boys' plates.</p><p></p><p>Auntie Meng said enviously to Moxiang, "Your mother's cooking skills are really good!"</p><p></p><p>Moxiang also complimented, "Auntie Meng's cooking skills are great too!"</p><p></p><p>Auntie Meng laughed and took Moxiang's little hand, saying, "I really don't know how such an obedient and sensible child was born."</p><p></p><p>Grandpa Meng tasted the beef and asked curiously, "Is this wild cattle meat? It doesn't quite taste like it."</p><p></p><p>"It is wild cattle meat, but stewed for a very long time."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, no wonder," Grandpa Meng nodded, then said to Moxiang, "I heard your family is going to open a food stall. If there's anything we can help with, just tell your uncle and auntie, we'll definitely lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Grandpa Meng!"</p><p></p><p>After a few more pleasantries, Moxiang got up to leave. Auntie Meng gave him some freshly steamed buns and wild fruits to take home.</p><p></p><p>"We don't have much good stuff at home, take these buns and fruits back to eat."</p><p></p><p>Moxiang didn't refuse, putting the buns in the food container and munching on the wild fruits as he walked home.</p><p></p><p>The beef that had been stewed over a long period was praised as delicious by anyone who tasted it.</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua had further improved the seasoning and adjusted the stewing time. She also made a few bowls of beef noodle soup for Moxiang to try. The broth was rich, the noodles had a nice chew, and the beef was fresh and fragrant, making Moxiang happily squint his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, Liu Ruhua had prepared some other alcoholic drinks and snacks to sell at the food stall.</p><p></p><p>Wine was definitely a must, but as poor cultivators, the grains they used for brewing weren't very good quality, so the taste wasn't great either. But the wine Liu Ruhua made herself was completely different.</p><p></p><p>She added various flowers, herbs, and fresh fruits to the wine brew. It had a lower alcohol content, along with the rich aroma of different flowers and fruits, giving it a slightly intoxicating sweetness and lingering aftertaste that Moxiang especially loved.</p><p></p><p>Besides the beef dishes, there were also pastries, fruits, pine nuts, beef noodles, and more.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, with the help of neighbors and friends, all the preparations were complete, and the food stall officially opened on the 1st day of the month.</p><p></p><p>Originally following the local naming convention, it was going to be called "Moxiang Food Stall", but at Moxiang's suggestion and with Moxiang's father's approval, the name was ultimately changed to "Liu Food Stall".</p><p></p><p>Liu Ruhua couldn't dissuade the father and son, so she had to agree.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

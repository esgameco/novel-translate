        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Moku Hua frowned slightly. </p><p></p><p>Something didn't seem right...</p><p></p><p>For the third level of qi cultivation array assessment, why would they test on an array formation containing six array patterns? Could the instructor have grabbed the wrong test papers?</p><p></p><p>The instructor shouldn't make that kind of mistake, or was there some deeper meaning?</p><p></p><p>At this point, some disciples had already started feverishly writing, but most likely they didn't know anything and couldn't leave it blank, so they were just blindly drawing.</p><p></p><p>Moku Hua gathered his thoughts and reminded himself:</p><p></p><p>"Since the instructor is testing us on a six-pattern array formation, he must have a purpose, perhaps to let us know that the way of array formations is vast and profound, so we don't become arrogant and conceited..."</p><p></p><p>After calming his mind, Moku Hua focused intently on studying the array formation. </p><p></p><p>The name of the formation was the 'Stabilizing Water Array'. Its purpose wasn't stated, but the annotations were complete. Although the formation contained six patterns, the individual patterns were quite simple, with a structure the instructor had often mentioned in class, so it wasn't too obscure.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, it was unlikely he could memorize the patterns, learn how to draw the entire formation, and complete drawing it all in the short time allowed.</p><p></p><p>If everyone failed to draw it, the instructor would probably grade based on how complete their attempt was.</p><p></p><p>Moku Hua could only try his best to memorize it and draw as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Once he focused on drawing the array, time seemed to fly by. But when time was up, Moku Hua still hadn't finished - he had only drawn a bit over five of the six patterns. And for those five he had drawn, he hadn't carefully checked them, so he didn't know if they contained errors.</p><p></p><p>Moku Hua felt a tinge of regret, and deeply realized he still had a very long way to go in studying array formations.</p><p></p><p>After completing the array portion, they collectively submitted their work to the Mingde Building at Tongming Peak.</p><p></p><p>This was where all the instructors at Tongxuan Gate archived and graded assignments.</p><p></p><p>The usually stern Instructor Yan surprisingly looked displeased as he glared at a middle-aged cultivator wearing an elder's robe from Tongxuan Gate:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Qian, what is the meaning of this? Wasn't it said we were only testing the first two patterns of the Stabilizing Water Array? Why did you test the entire formation?"</p><p></p><p>"The way of array formations is vast and profound. I wanted the disciples to understand this ahead of time."</p><p></p><p>"And then what?" Instructor Yan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"And then, they will know their limits and give up any notions of becoming array masters."</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian said indifferently, "A six-pattern array formation is the threshold to become an array master. Formations of this difficulty are not something these outer gate disciples without talent can learn."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan suppressed his anger, "But I am the outer gate instructor. Isn't Elder Qian overstepping a bit?"</p><p></p><p>"Instructor Yan, these outer gate disciples cannot become array masters no matter what. Teaching them is a complete waste of time."</p><p></p><p>"So what if it is?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian's tone became more polite, "Instructor Yan, we all know your level of attainment in array formations, which we greatly admire. But with your talents, don't you feel it is beneath you to teach these dull outer disciples, most of whom are just scattered cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Instructor Yan's gaze sharpened slightly.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian stated solemnly, "If Instructor Yan agrees, my Qian family would be honored to hire you as our instructor to teach array formations to the Qian family disciples. Whether it's spirit stones, spirit materials, or even some array formation inheritances, just say the word and my Qian family will do our utmost to provide."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan's eyelids twitched slightly, but he didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian paused, then continued, "Of course, if you're unwilling to leave Tongxuan Gate, that's fine too. I can recommend you join the inner court as an elder to teach array formations to the inner disciples, even the direct disciples. At that time, the sect's direct disciples would all have to address you as 'Master', giving you a status far above a regular elder."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan was silent for a moment before slowly saying, "And if I refuse?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian's expression turned cold, "Why must Instructor Yan be so stubborn?"</p><p></p><p>"I teach array formations to spread the way, not for fame or profit," Instructor Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Elder Qian sneered, "Fine, keep your lofty ideals!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he ignored Instructor Yan and left with a wave of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>By his side, the elderly instructor Zhou finally said: "Master Yan, why must you do this? The Qian family is powerful, and we cannot afford to offend them."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan sighed, "I just cannot tolerate this. If things continue this way, with the sect and clans becoming one entity, those disciples from humble backgrounds will have no path to cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The elderly instructor Zhou also sighed, "When the former sect leader was in charge, he could still withstand the pressure from the Qian family. But now the former leader is old and about to retire. I'm afraid this Tong Xian Sect will change..."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan also looked worried. </p><p></p><p>"In my opinion, Elder Qian has already shown you considerable courtesy by allowing you to teach these outer disciples. You have indeed put in a lot of effort, but what use is it? Few of them can go far down the path of array formations. It's not without reason that wandering cultivators cannot become array masters."</p><p></p><p>Old Master Zhou advised, "Don't go so far that you can't even be an instructor anymore."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan remained unmoved, "As long as I am an instructor, I will do what I must to the end."</p><p></p><p>The elderly Master Zhou shook his head and said no more.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan sighed again. After calming his mind, he opened the array formation exam papers in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were mistakes in the questions, he still had to grade them carefully.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, the grading results were a mess.</p><p></p><p>Most disciples could only draw one or two array lines. Some didn't know how at all and just scribbled nonsense to get by.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan silently recorded the names of these disciples. Not knowing is understandable, and they get credit for whatever they could draw. But scribbling nonsense is unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>There were also some who drew relatively well. These tended to be from wealthier families in Tong Xian City who had learned array formations from a young age. These disciples could generally draw three array lines, which is the limit for a third-level Qi Refining cultivator's spiritual sense - already considered very good.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan couldn't help but think of Mo Hua. A wandering cultivator like Mo Hua, a child with such an innate gift for spiritual sense, was truly rare.</p><p></p><p>Based on Mo Hua's progress, he estimated she could draw around four array lines. If she didn't slack off over summer break, she might be able to draw a bit more than four.</p><p></p><p>As Master Yan graded, he finally came to Mo Hua's paper. Opening it, he was dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>The paper had five array lines drawn neatly, and not just that - there was an additional half-line drawn more sloppily after, clearly due to running out of time, but the technique was still flawless.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>This meant that at the third level of Qi Refining, Mo Hua could draw five and a half lines of the Fixed Water Array formation on her first attempt!</p><p></p><p>Five and a half array lines...</p><p></p><p>This requires not only experience and comprehension of array formations, but also an extremely powerful spiritual sense to support it.</p><p></p><p>Previously when Master Yan saw Mo Hua draw array formations, she could manage four lines, but it was clearly a struggle - her spiritual sense was not quite ample enough.</p><p></p><p>But in just two months, she could now draw five and a half lines of the Fixed Water Array.</p><p></p><p>If this was true, it meant this child Mo Hua was not only born with an exceptional spiritual sense, but her spiritual sense was growing at an astonishing speed. And there is no way for cultivators to rapidly enhance their spiritual sense besides increasing their cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan held his breath, staring at Mo Hua's paper in disbelief. He finally exhaled slowly, muttering to himself, "This is impossible..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the elderly Master Zhou noticed Yan's dazed expression and asked, "Master Yan, what has happened?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan regained his senses. His expression flickered as he pondered for a moment before saying, "Some disciples drew the array formations so poorly, I was momentarily thrown off..."</p><p></p><p>The elderly Master Zhou showed an understanding look, "It's indeed not easy teaching these disciples. Master Yan, don't take it too seriously. You need to cultivate your mind and temper, don't get agitated..."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan nodded, but his eyes remained fixed on Mo Hua's paper, his thoughts wavering.</p>

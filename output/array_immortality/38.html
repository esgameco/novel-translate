        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The pricing at the restaurant was not expensive, because they considered that most of the customers were neighbors or ordinary lower-level cultivators who didn't have much money. If the prices were too high, everyone wouldn't be able to afford it, so they aimed for low profit margins but high sales volume. </p><p></p><p>The restaurant's specialty was beef dishes. A plate of beef cost two spirit stones, which wasn't cheap for scattered cultivators. But compared to spirit meats or other restaurants selling beef, it was already an extremely good deal.</p><p></p><p>Beef noodles were even cheaper - plain noodles only cost three spirit stone shards, and with beef it was six shards. </p><p></p><p>For an ordinary qi cultivation cultivator, their daily income was probably only around one spirit stone plus a few shards. A plate of beef required two days of hard work to afford. Having it occasionally was possible, but eating it every day was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>However, being able to eat meat for just two spirit stones, there was only this one restaurant in the entire Celestial City. Even if just to satisfy a craving by eating a bowl of beef noodles, it only cost six spirit stone shards.</p><p></p><p>After opening for just a few days, customers started coming in greater numbers. </p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators nearby, although unable to eat meat every day, there were always some who wanted to treat themselves to something nice each day.</p><p></p><p>Some were qi cultivators with relatively affluent family situations, able to eat there every few days. Others were fellow cultivators meeting up - not wanting to be too extravagant but also not too simple, so they ordered a plate of beef with some side dishes to snack on while chatting over drinks.</p><p></p><p>There were also parents who brought their children who had made progress in their cultivation, treating them to a hearty bowl of spicy beef noodles as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally there were also traveling merchants passing through from other places. Weary from their journey, upon hearing the restaurant had meat dishes, they wanted to satisfy their cravings but were embarrassed by their lack of funds, hesitating whether to order.</p><p></p><p>Until they heard that a whole plate of beef was only two spirit stones, their eyes went wide with surprise.</p><p></p><p>They still had some doubts in their minds, wondering if something so cheap could possibly taste good.</p><p></p><p>But then thinking that the restaurant's business was so good, the taste couldn't be too bad, they decided to give it a try and order a plate.</p><p></p><p>After just one bite, they couldn't stop eating.</p><p></p><p>From then on, any merchants who frequently passed through would always stop at the restaurant, order a plate of meat and have a few drinks. Those who used to just pass by without stopping would now take a break there to eat some meat and chat.</p><p></p><p>Some merchants who didn't originally pass this way would even go out of their way to take a detour to the restaurant, just to taste this beef and relieve the fatigue of their long journeys.</p><p></p><p>After all, for hundreds of miles around, this was the only place where one could eat such delicious meat at such an affordable price.</p><p></p><p>As customers gradually increased, the restaurant became busier. Big Tiger and the other two came to help out. After working all day, they happily ate a big bowl of beef noodles in the evening and brought some beef home, feeling fully satisfied.</p><p></p><p>However, the Celestial Gate would soon be starting its new semester, so everyone would be entering to cultivate, leaving them shorthanded.</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting didn't want his mother to overwork herself, so he suggested hiring someone to help out. Ink Mountain also worried about his wife's health still recovering and her inability to use spiritual power, so he agreed with Ink Painting's idea.</p><p></p><p>After discussing with his wife, Ink Mountain hired a wife from the Monster Hunting Squad to help at the restaurant for thirty spirit stones per month.</p><p></p><p>The next day, a young woman with a modest demeanor arrived, carrying a basket of fresh wild vegetables still moist with morning dew, seemingly just picked from the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Ink Painting learned from his parents' conversation that the woman's surname was Jiang, with the given name of one character, Yun.</p><p></p><p>Her husband's surname was Chu. Previously when hunting monsters, he was clawed in the chest by a wolf demon, using up all their savings to treat his injuries. Although his life was spared, he was severely injured and unable to continue monster hunting, leaving their family without income.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yun's spiritual roots were poor, only reaching the fourth level of qi cultivation before leaving her sect. A few years later she married and had a child. After her husband was injured, she wanted to find some work to supplement their finances. But with only a fourth level cultivation base, she couldn't earn much spirit stones. Doing odd jobs paid very little and was unstable income. Plus having to care for their young child, making a living was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Being able to have this stable job at the restaurant earning thirty spirit stones per month was already very fortunate.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yun felt immensely grateful, but by nature she was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Introverted and inarticulate, she wanted to express her gratitude but couldn't find the words, her face turning red from embarrassment. </p><p></p><p>Liuruhau hurriedly reassured her, telling her not to overthink it and to just focus on doing her job well.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Jiang Yun relax. She listened to Liuruhau's instructions and worked diligently. Though a slow learner, she was earnest and meticulous, which Liuruhau appreciated.</p><p></p><p>After closing up for the night, Liuruhau packed a few bowls of noodles with extra meat slices and asked Jiang Yun to take them home.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yun quickly declined, her face flushed, saying "Sister Liu, you've been too kind already, I can't accept this."</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau insisted she take it, but Jiang Yun refused.</p><p></p><p>So Liuruhau said, "Then take it for your child to eat."</p><p></p><p>With that, Jiang Yun had no excuse to refuse. Her child hadn't had a full meal in days, let alone meat. She took the food container, trying to express her gratitude but could only repeat the same few words of thanks awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau just comforted her, "Don't overthink it. It's getting late, you should head home to your child."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Yun carefully carried the container and walked home. Passing an alley corner, she paused, her back showing she was sobbing. After a moment, she wiped her tears with her sleeve and continued on her way.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua watched her figure from afar, his heart heavy with mixed emotions.</p><p></p><p>His own family was not wealthy, living frugally, but in this Spiritual City there were many cultivator families even poorer and more destitute.</p><p></p><p>If only cultivators did not have to suffer such hardship just to make a living.</p><p>Mo Hua thought to himself quietly.</p><p></p><p>Liu's restaurant had a successful opening. Liuruhau was busy all day with the business, looking thinner but with a rosier complexion and better energy.</p><p></p><p>Running the restaurant allowed her to research various cuisines and save spirit stones for her son's future cultivation and marriage. Liuruhau felt very satisfied, smiling more often.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his wife in such good spirits, Mo Shan felt reassured.</p><p></p><p>And with more delicious food, Mo Hua also became happier.</p><p></p><p>The restaurant's income increased their spirit stone savings, easing their previous financial strain. Before the Spiritual Academy reopened, they had profited over 200 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau gave all 200+ spirit stones to Mo Hua, telling him to choose a suitable cultivation method at the sect and urging him not to neglect his training.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The next day, after summer break ended, the Spiritual Academy reopened its gates to welcome students back.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua waved goodbye to Liuruhau at the foothill before entering the academy gates.</p><p></p><p>As students returned, the once quiet Spiritual Peak became lively again.</p><p></p><p>However, after two idle months, many students had become lax in their cultivation during the break and now felt apprehensive about resuming.</p><p></p><p>To refocus everyone, Instructor Yan abruptly announced an impromptu formation assessment.</p><p></p><p>The lingering summer heat was instantly doused by this cold shower, leaving many students despairing.</p><p></p><p>This was an on-site exam with no chance to work on it beforehand or cheat.</p><p></p><p>But Mo Hua felt no fear.</p><p></p><p>He could already draw five formation lines, making him an experienced student. Such basic formation exams posed no challenge.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the latter part of the break, he had practiced formations day and night, depleting his spiritual sense to the limit each time to strengthen it through constant exertion.</p><p></p><p>Mo Hua was full of confidence he could easily handle this minor assessment.</p><p></p><p>However, when the exam papers were distributed, Mo Hua was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He double and triple checked, finally realizing the exam was not on individual formation lines, but rather a complete six-line spirit formation!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor asked, "Are there any cultivators at the third level of Qi Refinement who can draw formation diagrams?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, there should naturally be some," the fat steward pondered, then continued, "The cultivation world is vast, with an unknown number of heavenly talents. If you say there are people born with the ability to draw formations, I believe it. It's just that these are merely rumors - I haven't seen it with my own eyes."  </p><p></p><p>"Even for those with exceptional talents, those who forget their roots and betray their masters...ahem, those born into formation aristocratic families and learn formations from a young age, by the time they reach the third level of Qi Refinement, they can draw simple formations containing three formation lines."</p><p></p><p>"As for those great aristocratic families and sects, their inheritance is profoundly deep, so among their disciples there are definitely not a lack of formation talents, they just don't usually reveal it."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor said, "If that's the case, then it's not impossible for Moxhua at the third level of Qi Refinement to be able to draw formations."</p><p></p><p>The fat steward didn't really want to admit it, but at this moment he had to.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Martial Brother Yan, although stubborn, always thought meticulously and his judgement was quite accurate.</p><p></p><p>"If it's really like this, then it's serious. Do you want to take him as a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>The fat steward pondered and continued, "In my opinion, this child is indeed a good seedling. Why don't you officially take him as your disciple? That way you can pass down the formation arts your master taught you."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor had never considered this, and upon hearing it he was clearly tempted, but after careful consideration he shook his head and said, "Our sect is in decline, and the remaining formation arts are just fragmentary pieces. What's worth passing down? Taking him as a disciple would just mislead the young man. Moreover, my master's dying wish is still unfulfilled - there's still no lead on that person, so I have no mind to consider other matters."</p><p></p><p>The fat steward wanted to persuade further, but Strict Instructor just waved his hand dismissively. </p><p></p><p>The fat steward sighed, "Forget it, I won't persuade you anymore, since you won't listen anyway. But about this child Moxhua..."</p><p></p><p>"For now, don't tell anyone. A gifted seedling inevitably gets blown down by the wind - this is an age-old truth. Moreover, he's still young, we can't let him become arrogant, otherwise he'll inevitably go down the wrong path in the future."</p><p></p><p>The fat steward agreed, "That's true."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor continued, "Also, don't let him take any more formation diagram orders here. Just make up some excuse about poor business management."</p><p></p><p>Although it was indeed poor business management, being told so still made the fat steward feel a lack of face, so he corrected, "This isn't called poor business management, it's called going with the flow!"</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this child is so talented at drawing formations and earning spirit stones to supplement the family finances, why not let him continue?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor frowned, "At the third level of Qi Refinement, even if he can draw formations, his spiritual awareness is limited. Drawing too many will lead to excessive depletion of spiritual awareness, inevitably leaving future problems and ruining the foundation of his consciousness sea."  </p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, he's still young, at the crucial stage of laying the foundations of cultivation. Not just formations, he needs to understand the myriad paths of cultivation, especially his cultivation base - he can't be blinded by small gains and neglect that..."</p><p></p><p>The fat steward said, "But scattered cultivators don't have such ample financial means - they don't even have enough spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"Even if the family is impoverished, one cannot neglect the future..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know just how poor ordinary scattered cultivators are?"</p><p></p><p>The fat steward's expression unusually turned solemn.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his expression, Strict Instructor's brow also slightly furrowed.  </p><p></p><p>The fat steward said seriously, "I know your own childhood circumstances were difficult. Although from a clan, you were just a branch descendant not valued by the main family. Later you joined the sect and were personally taught by your master, diligently cultivating yourself and making progress in formations, so things got a bit better. But even if your situation was difficult, you still had a family..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"With the support of a family, at least you have food and clothing, and no worries about living. At most, life is just not as satisfactory."</p><p></p><p>The fat manager sighed, "People often say that cultivating is arduous. After leaving the sect and staying in Tongxian City for more than a decade, interacting with many wandering cultivators, I realized that although people often say cultivation is arduous, the degree of hardship varies vastly."</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary wandering cultivators, making a living is difficult and the gains are meager. Being able to support a family is already not bad. Those who refine artifacts may have half their body burned by the furnace fire. Those who hunt demons may have an arm eaten by a demonic beast. Those who sell their spiritual power to do odd jobs for others have their meridians more or less damaged. If they fall ill or get injured, they have no spirit stones for treatment. Whether they can pull through depends entirely on the heavens' favor."</p><p></p><p>"It's best if they can pull through. If not, they lose their life, which is the worst case. Even worse is clinging to a half-life while spending spirit stones, draining the entire family's resources. What can they do? They just want to live."  </p><p></p><p>"Cultivators indeed cannot neglect the future, but these lower-rank wandering cultivators can hardly think about the present, let alone the future."</p><p></p><p>The fat manager finished speaking in one breath, poured himself a cup of tea, and gulped it down noisily.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan fell silent for a while, then sighed with a sense of apology, "I didn't consider it thoroughly enough."</p><p></p><p>The fat manager glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Master Yan said to the fat manager, "Give me the catalog of formations here."</p><p></p><p>"What do you need the catalog for?" The fat manager looked puzzled but still obediently went behind the counter to retrieve a book and handed it to Master Yan.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan took the formation catalog, browsed through it first, then picked up a pen from the table and checked off a few formations, numbering them in sequence.</p><p></p><p>"You're..."</p><p></p><p>"Next time Moxiang comes, have him draw the formations I've marked in the catalog in order. This way, he'll learn in a progressive manner and gain a more solid foundation. When I guide him at the sect later, it'll be better than him learning blindly."</p><p></p><p>"This way, he can also earn some spirit stones by drawing formations to supplement the family finances while learning formations systematically."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan finished speaking and reminded, "One more thing, don't let him draw too many of these formations. Collect three or four from him every half month. Otherwise, if his spiritual consciousness is overexerted, damaging his consciousness sea, it'll leave major issues."</p><p></p><p>The fat manager looked at the catalog, then at Master Yan with a complicated expression. "You really don't plan to take him as your disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan just shook his head, then stood up to leave. Before walking away, he repeated, "Be sure not to forget - have him draw them in the order I marked."</p><p></p><p>The fat manager watched his back in silence for a long while, finally sighing helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the fat manager seemed to remember something and called out to Master Yan again.</p><p></p><p>Master Yan turned back to look at him.</p><p></p><p>The fat manager pondered for a moment, then said, "There's one point you may have gotten wrong..."</p><p></p><p>Master Yan frowned. "What did I get wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"When Moxiang brought the Fire Formation, he was only at the second level of Qi Refinement. If these formations were truly drawn by him, then that means..."</p><p></p><p>The fat manager paused, choosing his words carefully, "He may have been able to draw formations at just the second level of Qi Refinement!"</p><p></p><p>Master Yan's pupils contracted slightly, revealing an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

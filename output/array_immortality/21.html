        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Moku continued painting the Fixed Earth Formation, spending two whole months on it. </p><p></p><p>If there were parts of the formation he didn't understand, he would go ask Strict Instructor for guidance. Strict Instructor was a stern and demanding person, but he was always willing to thoroughly explain any questions his disciples had in great detail and sincerity.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor naturally felt that Moku's foundations were not solid enough yet, so it was too early for him to be researching such advanced formations. But whenever Moku asked, he would still patiently explain it to him, which made Moku very grateful.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes when Moku skipped classes to secretly paint formations to earn spirit stones, Strict Instructor would not investigate too deeply, only reminding Moku:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators can have specialties, but don't become too lopsided. There may be some disciplines you don't need to master, but you must at least understand them. Otherwise, after graduating and leaving the sect to roam the cultivation world, if you have blind spots in your cultivation knowledge, it will be easy to suffer losses and be deceived."</p><p></p><p>Moku listened humbly and benefited greatly. However, since he currently lacked spirit stones to learn techniques, he could only continue skipping classes and painting formations to accumulate some spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>One Fixed Earth Formation contained four formation lines and could earn two spirit stones. Thanks to this, Moku's spirit stone accumulation sped up considerably.</p><p></p><p>Two months later, on one day when Moku went as usual to deliver an order to Fat Clerk, he entered and saw a middle-aged man in a azure Daoist robe drinking tea in the usually deserted Destiny Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The man had his back to Moku, but the back view looked very familiar. When he turned around, Moku was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The man in the azure Daoist robe was Strict Instructor...</p><p></p><p>Moku suddenly felt like he had been caught skipping class.</p><p></p><p>"Moku?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor also saw Moku and looked somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Fat Clerk was sitting across from the instructor, pouring him tea. Hearing this, he looked up in astonishment and said, "You two know each other?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor said, "He is a disciple I teach at the Tongxuan Gate."</p><p></p><p>Moku bowed respectfully and said, "This disciple greets the instructor!"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor nodded in acknowledgment and asked, "What brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Before Moku could speak, Fat Clerk explained, "He's running errands for his elder brother, who paints formations for our Formation Pavilion. When a formation is done, he has Moku deliver it."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor nodded, not asking further.</p><p></p><p>Moku breathed a sigh of relief, then handed over the formation to Fat Clerk, took the spirit stones, and hurriedly said, "This disciple will take his leave now and not disturb the instructor further."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor must have had something to discuss with Fat Clerk. Seeing Moku's polite manner, he couldn't help but nod approvingly and say, "Return to the sect soon and be careful on the road."</p><p></p><p>Moku respectfully acknowledged and, after a bow, left the Formation Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Watching Moku's departing back, Fat Clerk said to Strict Instructor, "That kid is quite polite and smart. You're lucky to have such a good disciple."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor gave a light "mm" sound, then asked, "You said his elder brother paints formations for you?"</p><p></p><p>Fat Clerk took out the Fixed Earth Formation Moku had delivered and handed it to Strict Instructor. "It's not bad."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor looked at it, slightly stunned that it was a Fixed Earth Formation. "His elder brother painted this?"</p><p></p><p>"Who else?" said Fat Clerk. "You think he painted it himself? At his age, even if he wrung his spiritual awareness dry, he couldn't paint a complete formation."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor nodded, recalling that Moku had consulted him about the Fixed Earth Formation before. It seemed his elder brother must have painted the Fixed Earth Formation, which Moku saw and developed questions about, prompting him to come ask Strict Instructor.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Having a desire to learn about formation arts is a good thing," Strict Instructor thought to himself. "If he can maintain this mindset, he may truly achieve something in formation arts in the future."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Strict Instructor did not pursue it further. He glanced around the remote and quiet shop, then said to Fatty Steward, "Do you really want to live like this your whole life?"</p><p></p><p>Fatty Steward said, "We're fellow cultivators from the same sect. You should know about me - I'm different from you. You're currently an instructor at the Tonxian Sect, proficient in formation arts. You're just a step away from the first-rank realm. Once you cross over, you'll be a true first-rank formation master. At that point in Tonxian City, you'll have connections if you want them, status if you want it. You'll never lack spirit stones, and the Tonxian Sect will surely give you an elder position."</p><p></p><p>"As for me," Fatty Steward took a sip of tea, "I'm content to get by. I only dabbled shallowly in formation arts and can't stand the loneliness of cultivation. As long as I can muddle through each day, I'm satisfied. Don't look down on me - see those scattered cultivators hustling busily on the streets? This leisurely life is something they can only dream of."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Fatty Steward looked at him and sighed helplessly, "Just say it, what do you need me to do for you?"</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor said solemnly, "Help me find the Spiritual Pivot Formation Diagram."</p><p></p><p>Fatty Steward pinched the bridge of his nose. "After all these years, you still haven't given up? Let me tell you, you're not that young anymore. You should find a cultivation partner and live a good life."</p><p></p><p>"Personal matters are trivial compared to the inheritance of formation arts."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you find it, so what? Your grandmaster couldn't learn it, your master couldn't either. You think you'll be able to? It's a first-rank, twelve-line formation art. First-rank masters only need to know nine lines. You haven't even become a first-rank yet. What good would getting the Spiritual Pivot do? By the time you're in the grave, you probably still wouldn't have learned it."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Fatty Steward earnestly advised, "Brother, just let it go. Besides, you'll never be able to find it anyway. That traitor who stole the arts and left the sect all those years ago - even the Dao Enforcement Office couldn't track him down. You're just a formation master, not skilled in daoist arts. What can you do?"</p><p></p><p>Unmoved, Strict Instructor said hoarsely, "My master's kindness to me was as vast as mountains. All my formation arts were passed down from him. Now that my master has passed and the sect is scattered, with the arts lost, every time I think of it I can't rest. As long as I can recover the arts and pass them on, fulfilling my master's dying wish, nothing else matters."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Fatty Steward again. "I know you like leisure and won't make you do too much. Just let me know if you get any leads on the Spiritual Pivot Formation Diagram's whereabouts. You don't need to worry about the rest."</p><p></p><p>"How do you know there would be a lead in Tonxian City?" Fatty Steward frowned.</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>Fatty Steward waved his hand. "Fine, the less I know the better for me. I'll agree to this request. But let me warn you - you're putting in so much effort, but in the end you may just be drawing water with a bamboo basket, unable to find even a trace."</p><p></p><p>Feeling troubled, Fatty Steward couldn't help adding:</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, you should spend some effort finding a cultivation partner instead. Have a child. Even if you can't find it, your child can keep searching in the future. At least you won't be a lonely, bitter old man when you die. While you're still not that old, hurry and find a partner. Just find one, so you don't end up..."</p><p></p><p>"The tea is cold. I'm leaving."</p><p></p><p>Strict Instructor stood up, brushed his sleeves, and left without paying any more attention to the rambling Fatty Steward behind him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In front of the business shop hung a signboard with the words "Destiny Pavilion" written on it. </p><p></p><p>The interior was not large, a bit simple and crude. Different patterns of formation talismans were hung all around, some of the talismans appeared to have been hung for quite a while as the ink had faded.</p><p></p><p>The counter was rather high, with a middle-aged plump cultivator sitting on it. He had a pale face without any beard, looking like he was likely the manager of the shop.</p><p></p><p>A bell hung by the doorway. When Moku entered, the bell rang out a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>The stout manager had been dozing off with half-closed eyes. Hearing the bell, he raised his head and looked around, not seeing anyone at first and about to get angry. Then lowering his gaze, he noticed a small head peeking over the counter.</p><p></p><p>The stout manager was stunned for a moment, seeing Moku was alone, and then spoke: "Little brother, where are your parents?"</p><p></p><p>Moku shook his head, "My parents didn't come to find you, I came to find you."</p><p></p><p>The manager was stunned again, "You came to find me? What for?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you need someone to help draw formation talismans here?"</p><p></p><p>The manager found it amusing and joked: "What? You little squirt know how to draw formations?"</p><p></p><p>Moku said humbly: "I know a little."</p><p></p><p>The manager laughed: "Knowing a little won't do. You'd at least need to be at the sixth level of qi cultivation, have study jade slips from a sect, be a formation apprentice under the tutelage of a formation master, and also pay a deposit before you can draw formations for us."</p><p></p><p>Moku was dumbstruck in his heart. He didn't know there were so many requirements before, it seemed he couldn't meet any of those conditions.</p><p></p><p>Thinking quickly, Moku said: "Okay, I lied. I'm not that skilled, I'm just running an errand for my brother."</p><p></p><p>The manager didn't make a big deal out of it and asked: "What does your brother do?"</p><p></p><p>"My brother is a formation apprentice, studying under a formation master. He also helps businesses draw basic formations to earn some money for supplies. He's too busy studying formations, so I'm running this errand for him."</p><p></p><p>Moku directly altered the identity of his distant uncle from the Meng family to use.</p><p></p><p>The manager stroked his chin, thinking for a moment before refusing: "No, just words without proof. If your brother wants to draw formations for our shop, he has to come himself."</p><p></p><p>Moku's eyes shifted and he said: "Don't you all also require a deposit?"</p><p></p><p>The manager nodded, "That's right."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't the deposit cover the formation diagrams and materials like brushes, ink and paper for drawing? So if I pay the deposit, even if I'm tricking you, it's just like you sold a formation diagram and materials at cost price. You don't profit but don't lose either, right?"</p><p></p><p>In fact, they would still make a small profit, as the deposit was higher than just the cost of drawing materials. As for the formation diagrams, they were just the most basic common ones not worth much spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, the manager became a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Is business not going well for your shop?" Moku asked again.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, business was not good at all. There were hardly any customers in a day. With no customers, they sold few formations. Even formation apprentices willing to draw for them were rare, otherwise the shop wouldn't be so deserted. </p><p></p><p>However, the manager wouldn't admit it, still holding his head high albeit with a hint of unease.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Moku seized the opportunity: "My brother is really good at drawing formations. Everyone says in just a few more years he'll definitely become a formation master. Once he's a master and studies for another twenty years or so, passing the grading, he might even become a first-rank formation master. By then he'll naturally help draw some higher-level formations for you all, wouldn't that be profitable?"</p><p></p><p>Passing the grading? That was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>The manager inwardly scoffed, but as the saying goes, 'never underestimate the potential of the young and poor.' Who could say for sure about the future? If he could truly become a first-rank master, it would be good to establish some goodwill now to call upon later if needed.</p><p></p><p>The rules were just for show to outsiders. As long as one could draw formations, there weren't really any so-called requirements.</p><p></p><p>"You make a fair point," the manager said. "But you claim your brother is skilled at formations without any proof. You're just a child who doesn't understand formations, how would you know good from bad? Here's what, bring me one of the formations your brother has drawn before. If it's truly decent, then I'll agree to do this business with you."</p><p></p><p>Moku didn't actually have a brother. Where could he find a formation drawn by his 'brother'?</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any from a 'brother', but he did have ones he drew himself.</p><p></p><p>Moku's storage pouch contained a few formations he had drawn before, but those were just coursework from the sect - basic individual talisman strokes or combinations, not complete integrated formations.</p><p></p><p>Anyone with a discerning eye could tell at a glance that they weren't complete formations.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a bit, Moku's eyes lit up: "I didn't bring any of my brother's formations, but he taught me a little bit before. Let me draw one for you to see, then you'll know my brother's formations are good."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Oh no."</p><p></p><p>"You can also draw formation talismans?"</p><p></p><p>The clerk was stunned for a moment, thought about it, and said, "I suppose so."</p><p></p><p>He was also curious to see how well the young child could draw, so he casually took out a formation talisman diagram from under the counter, grabbed some paper and an ink brush, and handed them to Mopi.</p><p></p><p>The diagram was labeled "Bright Fire Formation" - something not taught at their sect. It was a complete formation talisman with three interlocking patterns, appearing very difficult. </p><p></p><p>Mopi definitely couldn't draw a complete formation talisman. The talismans taught at the sect, though called formations, only contained one or at most two basic patterns. These were just introductory talismans, not considered true formations outside.</p><p></p><p>A real formation had to have at least three interlocking patterns with an interconnected structure, like this "Bright Fire Formation."</p><p></p><p>Mopi glanced at the clerk and boldly said, "This is too hard. If I could draw it, I'd draw formations for spirit stones myself instead of asking my brother."</p><p></p><p>The clerk patted his head, realizing he'd forgotten - of course a ten-year-old couldn't possibly draw a complete formation talisman. That was too much to ask. He just wasn't used to dealing with children at the trading house.</p><p></p><p>The clerk pointed to the upper left corner and said, "If you can draw just this small portion, I'll agree to hire your brother to draw formations."</p><p></p><p>Mopi looked at the pattern in the upper left. He breathed a small sigh of relief - it was a basic fire pattern he'd learned at the sect, just with some added details and connections. Still within his abilities.</p><p></p><p>Mopi took up the brush, dipped it in ink, and deftly drew the pattern on the paper in no time.</p><p></p><p>The portly clerk had nodded slightly when Mopi started drawing, impressed by his skilled brushwork and natural, fluid strokes without any nervousness. He clearly had a solid foundation, either from family instruction or excellent teaching from his brother.</p><p></p><p>The clerk leaned toward the latter explanation based on Mopi's plain but tidy clothing, indicating a household of modest means. A cultivator family skilled in formations would not be so impoverished.</p><p></p><p>Satisfied with Mopi's rendition, the clerk said, "Ten spirit stones as a deposit, and I'll provide the formation diagrams and materials."</p><p></p><p>"Ten spirit stones!" Mopi was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He only had three spirit stones - twelve earned from helping sect-mates copy formations, minus ten spent on a fire-repelling hairpin, plus one carefully saved up. That was his entire net worth.</p><p></p><p>He'd have to wait until the next formation exam to earn that much by drawing talismans for others. Who knew when that would be?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mopi's crestfallen look, the clerk realized he didn't have enough spirit stones. He didn't comment, understanding that life was difficult for cultivators, especially poorly-off wanderers like Mopi.</p><p></p><p>The clerk had been short on funds himself at times. He just kindly said, "Without a spirit stone deposit, I can't give you this job."</p><p></p><p>Then, not wanting to discourage Mopi, he added, "I'll hold this order for your brother. Come back whenever you have the spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Mopi nodded eagerly, "Yes, I'll go get spirit stones from my brother and come back for this order!"</p><p></p><p>The portly clerk waved his hand. "Run along and play for now. I'll just rest my eyes a bit..." He trailed off, already dozing.</p><p></p><p>Outside, Mopi squatted on the steps, chin in hand, feeling stumped.</p><p></p><p>"Seven spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>He wanted to earn stones by drawing formations, but needed stones first to get that chance. No stones, no formations. It was a cycle.</p><p></p><p>Mopi's head spun. Ask his parents? He shook his head. They needed what little they had for expenses, tuition, and lending to an injured martial uncle. The family likely had no extras.</p><p></p><p>Borrow from friends? His poor classmates were even worse off than him.</p><p></p><p>As Mopi pondered, a shrill voice suddenly cried out, "Mopi, you're actually here!"</p><p></p><p>Mopi looked up to see a richly-dressed plump boy glaring at him, surrounded by attendants.</p>

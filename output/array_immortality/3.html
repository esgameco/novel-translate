        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After getting up at the hour of Mao (5-7am), Moxie began his routine cultivation practice. </p><p></p><p>An hour later, he finished cultivating and went to the classroom to wait for the instructor.</p><p></p><p>The term "instructor" refers to the teachers who give lessons to the outer door disciples, teaching them cultivation methods, array techniques, pill refining, artifact forging, and other specific courses. They are also responsible for supervising and guiding the outer door disciples' cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>Like other sects in the cultivation world, the Tongxian Sect also divides its disciples into three categories: direct line, inner door, and outer door disciples.</p><p></p><p>The outer door of the sect is open to the public for spreading the teachings and accepting students to cultivate, making a living by collecting tuition fees, known as "shufei", from the enrolling disciples. The outer door disciples learn only the part of the sect's teachings that are open to the public. After graduation or withdrawal, they maintain a relationship but have no actual ties with the sect.</p><p></p><p>The inner door disciples form the main body of the sect. In addition to cultivation, they also manage the sect's various businesses such as spirit mines, spirit fields, caves, and merchant firms.  </p><p></p><p>Inner door disciples can learn the sect's methods and spells that are generally not taught publicly. They have a master-disciple relationship and are closely tied to the sect, inseparable. If an inner door disciple commits a crime outside, the sect can be held accountable. If an inner door disciple betrays the sect, it is considered a grave sin with severe consequences.</p><p></p><p>The direct line disciples are the core members among the inner door, either having blood relations with the sect leader or elders, or sharing an extremely deep master-disciple bond. These direct line disciples study the sect's core teachings and other forbidden supreme skills. If they betray the sect, they will be hunted down and killed.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Laws prohibit cultivators from taking private revenge or killing indiscriminately. Hunting down and killing betraying direct line disciples violates the Dao Laws and can lead to punishment from the Dao Court. However, cases of betrayal are mostly handled by the local Dao Court Offices. The Dao Court has the greatest power, but its subordinate local offices governing different regions, realms, and even cities may not have powerful cultivators stationed there.</p><p></p><p>When a direct line disciple betrays a sect, it concerns the sect's core inheritance, a serious matter. Generally, the local Dao Court Offices will not intervene, especially when it involves a major powerful sect - the local offices dare not interfere.</p><p></p><p>However, none of this was very relevant to Moxie.</p><p></p><p>He was merely an outer door disciple of the first rank at the Tongxian Sect, not an inner door disciple, let alone a direct line one. Even if he wanted to be hunted down, others would not bother with him...</p><p></p><p>Moxie wished to join the inner door, but he lacked spirit stones and connections. He estimated it was unlikely in this lifetime, not to mention becoming a direct line disciple of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Moxie calmed his mind and sat in meditation for a while before seeing Instructor Yan walk in with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Around forty or fifty years old, Instructor Yan was a stern man who had reached the ninth level of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Within the Tongxian Sect, Instructor Yan held a high position because he was the only instructor versed in array techniques. Rumor had it that in a few years, he might pass the evaluation and become a first-rank Array Master.</p><p></p><p>All disciples in the Qi Refinement stage at the Tongxian Sect learned array techniques from Instructor Yan, whether they were from cultivator clans or ordinary practitioners. Instructor Yan treated everyone equally - he would criticize or punish anyone who made mistakes, regardless of status or connections.</p><p></p><p>Hence, the disciples both respected and feared Instructor Yan.</p><p></p><p>Tuition fees at the sect were paid annually, so classes were also scheduled yearly.</p><p></p><p>Today was the last day of the yearly cultivation period at the Tongxian Sect. After today, there would be a long break of over half a month. The disciples' examination scores for all courses would also be issued today.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan held a stack of score reports in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The disciples felt anxious. Although Moxie didn't care much initially, seeing his peers looking so tense made him nervous too.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Moxie received his sect examination scores.</p><p></p><p>As expected, he scored an A in the array techniques exam - his strongest subject. Not many disciples at the Tongxian Sect could achieve an A in this course, and Moxie was one of them.</p><p></p><p>Moxie's cultivation level was rated B. It wasn't because he didn't cultivate diligently, but rather due to his limited innate talents. With a mediocre lower-grade five elements spiritual root, no matter how hard he cultivated, his progress would be limited, neither outstanding nor too lacking.</p><p></p><p>For courses that could be learned well through effort, such as the history of the Dao or the introduction to Qi refinement, he generally scored A's. However, for subjects that required spending spirit stones on materials like pill refining or talisman making, his scores were often B's or C's.</p><p></p><p>From a poor family, Moxie could not even afford to borrow a pill furnace, so he naturally did not learn those subjects well. During the exams, he could only refine pills based on feeling, leaving the outcome to chance. The scores depended not only on skill but also luck.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>And it was unstable and unsteady. </p><p></p><p>But overall, the results were not bad. As the saying goes, "One outstanding student outshines a hundred ugly ones." After all, array formations are difficult to learn, so getting an A-grade in array formations is already quite good.</p><p></p><p>The instructor, Mr. Yan, said a few words and then temporarily left. The disciples inside began looking at each other's grades and whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Mohua, you got an 'A' in array formations again!" A disciple secretly peeked at Mohua's transcript and exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Another A..."</p><p></p><p>"I always get B..."</p><p></p><p>"I only got a C."  </p><p></p><p>"Array formations are so hard to learn, my head spins just looking at them..."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>The disciples crowded around Mohua.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" A disciple from the Qian family wearing a silver-white Daoist robe, unsatisfied with the situation, coldly snorted and said:</p><p></p><p>"What's so great about it? It's just the simple array formations of the Painting School that allow you to get an 'A'."</p><p></p><p>"What did you get?" A disciple asked defiantly. </p><p></p><p>"Why should I tell you?" The Qian disciple disdained.</p><p></p><p>Another disciple secretly peeked at his transcript, then laughed loudly, "He got a C!"</p><p></p><p>The disciples were stunned for a moment, then burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"You got a C, yet you're laughing at someone who got an A? How thick-skinned!"</p><p></p><p>"Thicker than a smelting furnace!"</p><p></p><p>"You're from the Qian family too, yet so stupid. I did better than you with a B."</p><p></p><p>The Qian disciple became enraged. "So what if it's an A-grade? You scattered cultivators don't understand array masters, do you?"</p><p></p><p>He pointed at Mohua and the others. "You scattered cultivators are like frogs at the bottom of a well. Without any lineage, for your entire life - listen carefully - your entire life, you'll never produce a true array master. Spit! An A-grade!" He sneered, "Remember, among scattered cultivators, there can never be a true array master! If you don't understand, I can repeat it."</p><p></p><p>"Scattered cultivators can never become array masters!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding disciples fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Mohua looked at him like he was an idiot, then stood up, bowed to the space behind the Qian disciple, and said, "Instructor Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The Qian disciple was struck by lightning. He stiffly turned his head around to indeed find Instructor Yan standing behind him, his face ashen.</p><p></p><p>"The sect exists to spread the Dao and cultivate, not for you to compare and slander your fellow disciples!"</p><p></p><p>"You can't even learn array formations properly, yet you dare mock your peers?"</p><p></p><p>"Go stand outside as punishment until nightfall."</p><p></p><p>"And copy the basic five element array patterns one hundred times. Show them to me when you enroll next year. If you can't draw them, then don't bother coming back..."</p><p></p><p>The Qian disciple's face drained of color, but he didn't dare refute a word.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan's status was high - he could even discipline a disciple from the Qian family's main branch, let alone this distant offshoot.</p><p></p><p>The Qian disciple slunk away to stand as punishment.</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan stood in front of Mohua, silent for a moment. He patted Mohua's thin shoulders and sighed, "Don't mind what others say, just study well."</p><p></p><p>Mohua remained composed and respectfully bowed to Instructor Yan, "This disciple will remember."</p><p></p><p>Instructor Yan nodded, then walked to the instructor's seat and gave the disciples some final instructions before announcing the sect's annual break - they could return home.</p><p></p><p>The disciples suppressed their excitement, bowed to thank the instructors for a year of guidance in cultivation, and then scattered like birds and beasts.</p><p></p><p>It was the sect's annual break - the disciples were elated.</p><p></p><p>But Mohua's heart was conflicted as he watched them.</p><p></p><p>These Qi Refining disciples were mostly still young, carefree, unaware of the hardships of the cultivation life.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of his father's scars from demon hunting and his mother's haggard appearance, Mohua's heart ached and he couldn't help sighing.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a first-rank array master still seemed distant, but within his limited means, he wanted to make life a little better for his parents.</p><p></p><p>Mohua pocketed his transcript and twelve spirit stones, and instead of returning home after leaving the Tongshen Gate, he headed towards the market streets.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the main character's reincarnation setting:</p><p></p><p>He has awakened memories, but it's not a traditional soul reincarnation - his physical body is his own, and he is blood-related to his parents.</p><p></p><p>The main character is set as a 10-year-old child in the cultivation world, but with some modern thinking and cognition.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

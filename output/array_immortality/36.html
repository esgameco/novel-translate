        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mohua's smile, Master Chen and the others also became happy.</p><p></p><p>Master Chen couldn't help but praise: "Little brother, you are really remarkable. I've lived more than half my life, but this is the first time I've seen such a young cultivator able to draw formation arrays."</p><p></p><p>Mohua felt a bit shy being praised, and said modestly: "Master Chen, let's see first if the stove formation I drew can actually be used."</p><p></p><p>Master Chen called out, and a few strong apprentices reassembled the stove, putting in a few spirit stones. Soon, flames arose inside the stove. </p><p></p><p>Master Chen nodded, saying: "No problem, apart from being a bit small in size, this stove is no different from the expensive ones forged in big restaurants. In fact, this fire seems even fiercer."</p><p></p><p>Mohua breathed a sigh of relief. Afterwards, Master Chen had the senior apprentice Dazhu and others deliver the stove to Mohua's home.</p><p></p><p>After discussing with his parents, Mohua decided to open the eatery at their own home in the end. Firstly for convenience, and secondly because shop spaces near the market were too expensive. Originally just a small business, if they rented an expensive shop and lost money, it would bankrupt the family.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the area Mohua lived in, though mostly poor wandering cultivators, was near the main road with plenty of foot traffic and became lively during festivals. As long as the food was delicious, they wouldn't have trouble selling it.</p><p></p><p>Mohua's home was small, just two rooms and a hall, with a small courtyard - the basic layout for a cultivator's residence. Enough for the three of them to live in, but not enough to open an eatery.</p><p></p><p>So Mohua discussed with the neighbors to rent their courtyards for spirit stones each month. He then asked friends from the monster-hunting squad to help renovate a kitchen area, connecting the several courtyards into one large open space where tables and chairs could be set up for dining.</p><p></p><p>The stove was too big to fit in a storage bag, so Dazhu and the apprentices carried it to Mohua's home. When they arrived, Mohua's parents were cleaning up the courtyard, digging soil and building walls, so it looked quite messy.</p><p></p><p>The apprentices didn't mind the hard work and helped set up the stove properly. After drinking some tea, they took their leave.</p><p></p><p>Although Mohua had promised confidently before and was generally reliable, seeing the actual stove right before their eyes still made Mohua's parents feel incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau stroked the stove and said: "It looks about the same as those in big restaurants, just smaller. But it's clearly more sturdy and exquisitely crafted. Though it must have cost quite a few spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"I helped Master Chen fix the formation array in his forging furnace, so he gave me a 50% discount. Plus the formation array in this stove was drawn by me, so it didn't cost too many spirit stones," Mohua said with some pride.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau and Moshan looked at each other. They knew Mohua had talent in formation arrays, but didn't expect he could not only help others repair them, but could even draw arrays on spirit tools himself.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau hugged Mohua and praised: "Hua'er is so remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Moshan also looked at his son with gratification. Originally worried about Mohua's frail body, now seeing his talent in formations, he knew even if unable to cultivate his body, Mohua could make a living just with formations. And without risking his life fighting monsters like himself - nothing could be better.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, let me tell you how to use the stove..."</p><p></p><p>Mohua took Liuruhau's hand and explained the stove's usage, spirit stone consumption, temperature control. It wasn't difficult - Liuruhau understood after one explanation.</p><p></p><p>Liuruhau then used the stove to cook dinner - a pot of plain rice porridge, some simple vegetable dishes, and soft, white steamed buns. Simple yet delicious.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After eating the dishes made by his mother, Moku was deeply moved, especially since most of the meals at home had been cooked by his father Mokuzan recently, whose cooking skills were needless to say.</p><p></p><p>Moku spoke frankly, "Mom, the dishes you make are so much more delicious than Dad's!"</p><p></p><p>"You little brat!" Mokuzan grumpily ruffled Moku's hair, but seeing the smile on his wife's face, he couldn't help but smile too.</p><p></p><p>After the family of three finished eating, Liuruhua asked, "Opening a food stall is possible, but what should we sell?"</p><p></p><p>Mokuzan and Liuruhua both looked at Moku. </p><p></p><p>Moku met his parents' gaze and said, "Beef!"</p><p></p><p>Mokuzan was stunned for a moment, then frowned, "But where would we get beef? Meat with spiritual energy is very expensive, we can't afford it. And the surrounding areas are all scattered cultivators, so beef wouldn't sell well either."</p><p></p><p>Moku said, "Dad, didn't you kill a wild bull before? We can use that meat."</p><p></p><p>"Wild bull meat...it's too tough and dry, no one would want to eat it."</p><p></p><p>"Then we can stew it for two days and two nights. No matter how tough the meat is, it should become tender if stewed long enough to absorb the flavors, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Stew for two days and two nights..." Mokuzan unconsciously turned his gaze towards the stove. "So you forged this stove not just so your mother could cook without using spiritual energy, but also to stew meat, huh..."</p><p></p><p>"Yeah!" Moku nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Will this work?" Mokuzan was a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"It will work," Liuruhua's eyes lit up. "Meat with spiritual energy is eaten for its tenderness, so it doesn't need long stewing or it will lose its energy. But that meat is too expensive for ordinary families like us."</p><p></p><p>"Meat without spiritual energy is cheap but tough, requiring long stewing times. Scattered cultivators can afford it but don't have the conditions to stew it for so long, so they rarely eat it."  </p><p></p><p>"With this stove, we can stew inexpensive but delicious meat that even ordinary scattered cultivators can afford."</p><p></p><p>Mokuzan nodded, then said, "But fueling the stove fire for two days and two nights will consume quite a few spirit stones, right?"</p><p></p><p>Moku calculated on his fingers, then said, "It should take around ten spirit stones, but one stew pot can make a lot of meat. If we sell it, it shouldn't be a loss."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll try stewing a pot first in a couple days to calculate the costs," said Liuruhua.</p><p></p><p>Mokuzan nodded, "I'll go get some more wild bull meat. We're out at home, but Old Zhao's family should have some left. If this meat can sell, then the meat from the demonic beasts I hunt will also have a market. Everyone's lives could improve."</p><p></p><p>As it was getting late, Liuruhua urged Moku to go to bed soon after.</p><p></p><p>Moku got up, but suddenly thought of a question and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Mom, in theory, forging a stove isn't that difficult. But why do so few ordinary scattered cultivators use them?"</p><p></p><p>"Silly child," Liuruhua stroked Moku's face with a wry smile. "Let's not even talk about refining equipment. For the array formations on the stove, if you didn't draw them yourself and hired an array master instead, how many spirit stones would that cost?"</p><p></p><p>"It's so difficult to become an array master. Once someone becomes one, they naturally want to advance further by relying on their clan and sect to draw higher-level arrays and earn more spirit stones. Why would they care about us poor scattered cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not just array masters, all cultivators are the same. When people walk towards greater heights, they don't look down..."</p><p></p><p>Moku felt very conflicted and couldn't say a word for a while.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

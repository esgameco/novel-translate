        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The total casualties this time were seventeen people, with eight people missing. It seems that during the chaos, they fell into the eighth layer of the celestial prison, and we were unable to rescue them," the white-haired Zhao Changhe respectfully reported to the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any survivors?" asked the man, his voice calm and gentle.</p><p></p><p>The man, who appeared to be in his forties, was dressed in a white robe, though it had been stained by dust, turning it into a gray robe. With a feathered fan and a scholar's cap, his appearance was not extraordinary, but he had an elegant and refined air about him.</p><p></p><p>Staying in this celestial prison, his attire seemed somewhat out of place, not like a jailer, but more like a village schoolteacher.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe, who was rarely hesitant, answered truthfully. "According to the warden, among the eight missing people, there was a level-B jailer named Lu Caiwai. We have investigated before, and the life lamp has been extinguished..."</p><p></p><p>The man's expression did not change, and he simply walked forward in silence.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe, who was a level-A person in the celestial prison, felt somewhat tense at the moment.</p><p></p><p>As a level-A figure in the celestial prison, Zhao Changhe knew many things. For example, the talented young woman Lu Caiwai, who was personally recruited by the former warden, was rumored to be from a prominent family in another country.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, it would be understandable. The key point was that this current warden also had the surname Lu... Was he a relative? A niece? Or even an illegitimate daughter? This left much room for speculation.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, are you now going to the eighth layer?" Lü Qingshan nodded slightly, then stopped at the door, looking at Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>"This trip to the capital has been eventful, and even on the way back, I was delayed for quite some time," he sighed.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for that, I should have been able to return a few days earlier, and these events would not have occurred."</p><p></p><p>"But then again, perhaps not."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe listened quietly without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>"In the first layer of the celestial prison, the people from the Zhang and Lin families have been executed."</p><p></p><p>"In the second layer, the people from the Sword Sect and Miaoyin Mountain, they don't need to be kept either."</p><p></p><p>"The third layer..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's voice was calm and gentle, like a schoolteacher, which could lull students to sleep. But Zhao Changhe was increasingly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>One force after another was mentioned by him, which meant the life and death of those people. And Lü Qingshan, who made all these decisions, spoke of it lightly, like a judge of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe responded, but many questions were swirling in his mind. What exactly happened during this trip to the capital? And why did these forces have to provoke Lord Lü?</p><p></p><p>"I'll go down and take a look first. Old Zhao, remember to help me buy some white sugar cakes from the shop in the east, and also get a couple of steamed buns from the Cheng family shop nearby. I suddenly feel like eating them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Warden Lord."</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Changhe had completely left the corridor, Lü Qingshan raised his hand and slowly pressed it against the stone wall. The light flowed, and the "door" that had remained unscathed even when the celestial prison collapsed was gradually opened.</p><p></p><p>"Whether alive or dead, I must bring the remains back home..." Lü Qingshan muttered to himself as he stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>But then, he frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the prison, the strange beings suddenly changed their behavior. The white jelly-like creature that had been trying to escape stopped for a moment, then retreated back into the cell, looking quite comical.</p><p></p><p>The legless man who had been kneeling on the ground for a long time suddenly stood up and walked back into the cell, even closing the door behind him carefully.</p><p></p><p>The mute woman who had been clinging to Ye Wuyu's legs also seemed a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Finally, she still trembled and silently got up, greedily rubbing against Ye Wuyu's legs a few times. Ye Wuyu kicked her away with one foot, then silently walked back to the cage.</p><p></p><p>The prison doors closed one by one, and the strange beings were all well-behaved, staying in their cages.</p><p></p><p>As if the initial chaos was not their usual state.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze was calm as he looked towards the distance of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>The "door" of the eighth layer of the Heavenly Prison was finally opened.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"I will enter the state of no-form and seek my true self," Ye Wuyu said suddenly.</p><p></p><p>The dim candlelight suddenly flared up at this moment, as if the flame was jumping more vigorously with the arrival of the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a figure slowly walked out from the other end of the corridor, amid the play of light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>The man in the gray robe walked to the side of the cage, stood still, and did not hurry to do anything, but first tried to brush the dust off his clothes.</p><p></p><p>The dust scattered, and the gray robe regained some of its original white appearance.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan looked into the prison, his gaze sweeping over the strange beings.</p><p></p><p>The strange beings whose gaze he met all had a calm expression, as if they could also see him.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, this was the case, as Lu Qingshan's gaze swept over the only open cage, seeing the unconscious Lu Caiwei inside.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after surveying the entire place, his gaze fell on Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>He sensed a similar aura from Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"Was this your doing?" Lu Qingshan's gaze pointed to the empty cage.</p><p></p><p>The strange beings inside were gone.</p><p></p><p>So was the figure standing before him, Ye Wuyu, a human or a strange being?</p><p></p><p>"So what if it is? And so what if it isn't?" Ye Wuyu took a step forward, calmly answering.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan remained silent, only raising a finger to point at the unconscious Lu Caiwei in the cage, saying, "She's still alive, so I can let you say a few more words."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu smiled lightly, his gaze calm as he looked at the other and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The Warden? A mere mortal of the Fifth Realm, you dare to waste my words?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan first paused, then burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu seemed quite dissatisfied with the laughter, frowning slightly, but then relaxing and saying contentedly, "Since I have attained the state of no-form and found my true self, a mere Fifth Realm, no matter how profound the mysteries you possess, is but grains of sand to me."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan listened silently, then spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>"One more thing."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu took a deep breath, then narrowed his eyes, looking not at Lu Qingshan, but behind him.</p><p></p><p>The all-seeing Ye Wuyu now chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"But a dying husk of a general, without the remnants of the Dao on your body, what ability do you have to be my enemy?"</p><p></p><p>This sentence was finally said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's figure flashed like a white rainbow, becoming a phantom.</p><p></p><p>The Ye Wuyu who had found his "true self" was suddenly struck hard, flying out like a meteor shell.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A thunderous roar arose, and Ye Wuyu's entire body was driven into the prison wall, leaving a dent.</p><p></p><p>The roar subsided, and the strange beings in the cage were all silent and motionless.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei was suspended in midair, while on the ground was the bloodied Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>The candlelight illuminated the retreating figure of Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

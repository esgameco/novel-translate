        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At least that's how the summer dream that possessed her body felt at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Although her own strength was weak, she was not affected by the erosion of this place, and she could even point out the crux of the situation with a single word.</p><p></p><p>And... why is this body so suitable for her spirit? Summer Dream was puzzled, but that was the reality.</p><p></p><p>It is true that the possession of a remnant soul and rebirth does exist, but it is not as simple as drinking water and eating food.</p><p></p><p>Unless one cultivates demonic cultivation techniques, the "compatibility" and "rejection" of the original body will have a huge impact.</p><p></p><p>Take Lu Caiwei as an example... Although Summer Dream had no intention of harming her own disciple, even when possessing her, she could only bring the other party a slight improvement in realm.</p><p></p><p>And it would also consume her own soul power.</p><p></p><p>The techniques and moves she herself possessed could not be directly applied to the other party.</p><p></p><p>But it seems to be different with Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>There is no rejection, no incompatibility at all. If Summer Dream is willing, she can even make the other party instantly grasp the techniques she has learned.</p><p></p><p>Summer Dream's heart was moved.</p><p></p><p>But after all, she had taken a vow of demonic heart...</p><p></p><p>[You bitch, you have some ill intentions towards you at the moment, and you have already foreseen this matter. It's better to turn the tables and use your own body as a furnace, and her spirit as a cauldron, to have a shocking spiritual exchange... After that, your realm will improve by leaps and bounds, and your great cause can be accomplished.]</p><p></p><p>Awesome.</p><p></p><p>Even though Ye Wuyu was already used to it, his footsteps paused slightly at the moment, took a deep breath, and continued to walk forward in the dark corridor.</p><p></p><p>The corridor was pitch black, the candles had burned out, and only the precious sword in his hand emitted a cold and sharp glow in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>As for the little stuttering Lu Caiwei, she was quietly lying behind him, soundly asleep.</p><p></p><p>As a teacher, Summer Dream had fulfilled her duty.</p><p></p><p>She sacrificed a portion of her own soul power and left it in Lu Caiwei's body, as a temporary capital to resist the erosion.</p><p></p><p>This also allowed Lu Caiwei to rest for a while.</p><p></p><p>After all, three days and three nights of continuous guard, plus the occasional use of force, had already pushed her to the limit.</p><p></p><p>But even so, this soul power still has a time limit and cannot be replenished.</p><p></p><p>After all, Summer Dream stated bluntly that she could not reach the point of soul dissipation.</p><p></p><p>If a solution is not found in time, Lu Caiwei may never wake up.</p><p></p><p>Rather than passively waiting to die, it is better to take the initiative to break the deadlock.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with Summer Dream, an ancient six-realm remnant soul, Ye Wuyu has obtained some valuable information.</p><p></p><p>First, between different anomalies, unless there are special circumstances, they will not interfere with each other.</p><p></p><p>Second, each anomaly has only one unique supernatural power, and the manifestation of this power is not necessarily to kill, but it cannot be resisted.</p><p></p><p>Third, anomalies can be killed, but they cannot be eliminated. Even if a powerful cultivator crushes an anomaly, given enough time, the killed anomaly will reappear somewhere in the world.</p><p></p><p>Finally, this is the point that prompted Ye Wuyu to make this decision.</p><p></p><p>The cage that imprisons the anomaly forms a separate space within, which can isolate all anomalies and erosion.</p><p></p><p>In other words, if you're lucky enough to kill one anomaly, you can then occupy its cage and lock yourself inside.</p><p></p><p>At least, you can survive here for a long time.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>In the silent corridor, Ye Wuyu stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Even with the temporary second-realm cultivation gained from Summer Dream's possession, it was enough for Ye Wuyu to see the darkness before him.</p><p></p><p>In the dark corridor, a white face was lightly swaying on the side wall.</p><p></p><p>Although it had changed its form, Ye Wuyu had seen it for the third time.</p><p></p><p>The white face was just hanging on the wall, without any movement.</p><p></p><p>"There is an anomaly's aura on the right wall in front," Summer Dream reminded him in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The insight of the sixth realm is truly terrifying, but it is only terrifying.</p><p></p><p>She could not see it as directly as Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the urge to draw his sword, Ye Wuyu calmly walked deeper into the corridor.</p><p></p><p>After clearly identifying the target, any unnecessary battle would be unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what kind of "supernatural power" does that white jelly-like anomaly possess? Judging from its previous control of the dead bodies, it seems to have some ability.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The meaning of possession...</p><p></p><p>After a long while...</p><p></p><p>The white jelly-like substance was still clinging to the wall, swaying gently.</p><p></p><p>And Ye Wuyu's figure was walking down the corridor, just as it was at the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this familiar scene, Ye Wuyu calmly said,</p><p></p><p>"How long have we been here?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng pondered for a moment before responding.</p><p></p><p>"From the time we set out, about a quarter of an hour."</p><p></p><p>A quarter of an hour, enough time for a person in full health to run back and forth along the eighth layer of the Heavenly Prison twice.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu was still walking in this dimly lit corridor, with no sign of the prison cells.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... If this were in the past, this thing would have been called a "ghost wall"? Looks like he has fallen into some strange "divine ability"?</p><p></p><p>But surely this seemingly simple "ghost wall" loop is not just some small trick, right?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, did you sense anything unusual just now?"</p><p></p><p>The one called Senior, Xia Anmeng, paused for a moment, then responded quietly,</p><p></p><p>"I did not detect anything."</p><p></p><p>She truly did not notice any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>As a remnant soul at the Sixth Realm, although her strength was not what it once was, her knowledge and insight had not diminished in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>If she couldn't even detect anything unusual, then this little trick must not be that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Ghost walls" are loops, and the MÃ¶bius strip is also a loop - who can say they are simple?</p><p></p><p>"Why not remove that mischievous thing on the wall?" Xia Anmeng asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, haven't you noticed that thing is trapped here just like us?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng paused for a moment, but then Ye Wuyu moved.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a temporary boost in his cultivation level, the operation of the "Formless Heart Sutra" became increasingly smooth.</p><p></p><p>During the three days of silent meditation in this prison, Ye Wuyu had not been idle.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" had been running through his mind and body with complete familiarity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had previously been somewhat puzzled, as this heart sutra only provided a cultivation method, but did not include any techniques.</p><p></p><p>A cultivation method without accompanying techniques, even if cultivated to the peak, would at most be like a warrior with an exaggerated character panel but no actual skills.</p><p></p><p>But as his realm advanced, all the problems dissipated like melting ice and spring water.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" did not need any techniques.</p><p></p><p>There are no perfect techniques in the world, or rather...</p><p></p><p>The best things in the world are always in someone else's hands.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling sword light shone.</p><p></p><p>It was still the same sword, but the one wielding it was not the previous woman.</p><p></p><p>The sword rose.</p><p></p><p>Wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>Exactly the same technique as Lu Caiwi's before, now appearing out of thin air in this corridor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Does the strange thing have intelligence?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu believed it did.</p><p></p><p>At least, it had a certain innate capacity for thought.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, that previous white strange thing would not have repeatedly tested them, even trying to exhaust and kill them.</p><p></p><p>Because Lu Caiwi could not see it, she carelessly observed it up close.</p><p></p><p>Because it thought Ye Wuyu could not see it, it brazenly clung to the wall.</p><p></p><p>When the sword light slashed through, the sharp sword intent shredding it to pieces, leaving only a palm-sized fragment, that white jelly-like substance actually started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>And when Ye Wuyu stepped on it and precisely grabbed it with his hand, its last glimmer of hope was gone.</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng's voice in his mind gradually changed from surprise to an incredulous exclamation.</p><p></p><p>"How can you sense it? Or rather... can you see it?"</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the old woman's exaggerated reaction, Ye Wuyu simply squeezed the jelly-like substance in his hand, feeling its soft texture.</p><p></p><p>Tsk... It's just like the cheap jelly clay I played with as a child.</p><p></p><p>This thing is called a strange entity, or perhaps a remnant of the Dao? Ye Wuyu's gaze was calm as he looked at the thing in his hand, speaking word by word.</p><p></p><p>"You know how to get out of here, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>"Then, lead the way."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Wuyu suddenly flung the strange entity towards the wall.</p><p></p><p>"Slap."</p><p></p><p>The white strange entity collided with the wall, making a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

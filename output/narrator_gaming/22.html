        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The person in charge looked through the window at Ye Wuyou and then at the token in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"This task has already been taken, it's a Class B Group 5... oh, it should be called Class C Group 5 now."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou: "?"</p><p></p><p>Of course he knew the task had been taken, and that they were just missing one person.</p><p></p><p>The task rank was not high, so it wouldn't be too difficult, and the reward was what he needed. It was perfect for him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Wuyou's puzzled look, the person in charge didn't say more, just commented "I see you don't know anything," and returned the token to him.</p><p></p><p>"Go, they are waiting in the third room on the right."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang, formerly of Class B Group 5 but now demoted to Class C Group 5, was pacing back and forth in the small room, looking quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>Sitting beside him were two others - one with a pale, somber expression, currently resting with eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>The other was a woman, Lin Qingqing, wearing a black shirt, resting her face on one hand and looking slightly annoyed at the large man pacing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after Xu Fang had paced back and forth about a hundred times, Lin Qingqing couldn't take it anymore and stood up, pointing at him angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Fang, can you be quiet? You're just causing trouble without doing anything, it's driving me crazy."</p><p></p><p>The large man, as if finding an opponent, sneered and crossed his arms.</p><p></p><p>"I'm causing trouble? I'm trying to figure out a solution. We've had this task for a day and no one is willing to come, our reputation has fallen this low!"</p><p></p><p>"What reputation do you have!" </p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing scolded furiously. "With that pig brain of yours, just being idle is the biggest help to us. Reputation? Do you even have one?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean I don't have a reputation? A month ago, who didn't know the name Xu Fang the Angry Gold Golem!"</p><p></p><p>However, Lin Qingqing seemed to have found his weakness, and immediately put her hands on her hips, laughing mockingly.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're just someone with more fame than ability. You want to know your reputation? It's that your fame exceeds your strength!"</p><p></p><p>"You, you, you..."</p><p></p><p>The burly man's face flushed red with anger, his Qi at the Second Realm involuntarily flaring up, looking furious.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing puffed out her chest, not backing down.</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced man opened his eyes from his meditation, looked at the two, and sighed, as if he was already used to this.</p><p></p><p>Their Class C Group 5... things haven't been going well for them lately.</p><p></p><p>After all, a month ago, they were just promoted to Class B Group 5, and with that monstrous genius girl, they had accomplished remarkable feats.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, sometimes doing too much leads to too many mistakes.</p><p></p><p>A black bear demon disguised as a Fourth Realm injured, but actually a Fifth Realm, pretending to be captured, ultimately led to the incident at the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>And their reputation has become utterly foul.</p><p></p><p>Although the Warden and everyone else said it wasn't their fault, the dead comrades and injured companions were still thorns in many people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>Without Lu Caiwi... they no longer qualified as Class B Group 5, and were demoted to Class C.</p><p></p><p>Who doesn't have a few good friends and companions? Having fallen to this state, they had already anticipated it in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>A knock on the door briefly interrupted the tense atmosphere in the room.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all three turned their heads towards the door.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, is this Class C Group 5 that took the task of capturing a fox demon?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou looked at the room, his expression slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, these three gave him the feeling that they were ready to fight each other even before going on the mission.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the strange words of the colleague who had assigned the task earlier, Ye Wuyou vaguely felt that this team was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the three staring at him without speaking, Ye Wuyou thought for a moment and simply said "Excuse me."</p><p></p><p>But someone quickly...</p><p></p><p>"Bang."</p><p></p><p>The door was closed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing had now regained her composure. She stood in front of Ye Wuyou, leaning against the door with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"That's right, colleague, this is Group 5 of Class C," Lin Qingqing said in a friendly tone, while also displaying her impressive figure as she looked at Ye Wuyu and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"I am Lin Qingqing, a Second Realm Formation Adept. I wonder, sir, who are you..."</p><p></p><p>Her gaze slightly lowered, focusing on the token hanging at Ye Wuyu's waist.</p><p></p><p>There, a lone "Ding" token was hanging.</p><p></p><p>A cold snort came from behind, from the burly man.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, Ding-rank... First Realm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't mind, and directly stated his current cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyu, Ding-rank prison guard, First Realm, not a physician."</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as soon as he spoke, Ye Wuyu felt the woman's smile stiffen slightly.</p><p></p><p>But the stiffness soon dissipated along with the smile, and Lin Qingqing's expression normalized as she said, "No problem, if you're not a physician, then you're not. We few will handle this task, and we won't get injured at all."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Lin Qingqing turned around and cast a glance at her two companions.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu knew that this was because they disliked his low realm and feared he would drag down the team.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't think these three were that strong either. Compared to Lu Caiwi alone, they seemed vastly inferior.</p><p></p><p>[Boring, so boring. Just a few Second Realm brats who can't even see the shadow of a Dao Relic, yet they dare to look down on you.]</p><p></p><p>[You hatch a plan, slaying the three of them during the mission, then kill and loot, creating the illusion of a tragic sacrifice for the task. In this way, the harvest will be plentiful.]</p><p></p><p>"I'm not cultivating the Demonic Dao!" After the exchange of glances, Lin Qingqing finally looked back at Ye Wuyu and said seriously, "Colleague Ye, we are willing to accept this task with you, but since we will be a team afterward, although the task rank is not high, there is still certain danger. There are a few rules we need to discuss with you in advance."</p><p></p><p>"First, since you are Ding-rank and have likely never been on a mission or encountered demonic beasts before, you must follow our commands during this task and cannot act rashly."</p><p></p><p>"Second, if there are differences of opinion during the task, my command will take precedence. If you insist on your own views, you can leave the team on your own, and the team will no longer be responsible for you. This applies to anyone."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing saw that Ye Wuyu's expression was normal and heaved a sigh of relief, hesitating slightly before continuing.</p><p></p><p>"Third, any spoils obtained during the task will not be evenly distributed, but will belong to the individual who acquired them."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lin Qingqing felt a bit guilty and thought for a moment before adding, "However, if there are any surplus gains, you can also choose some."</p><p></p><p>"No need, just divide them up individually," Ye Wuyu interrupted.</p><p></p><p>He came here just to obtain the Jade Soul Flower that could nourish his spiritual sense, and to see what this so-called task was like.</p><p></p><p>As they said, this was his first mission, and he didn't expect any significant gains.</p><p></p><p>As for the command authority? Who would want to command, it's thankless work.</p><p></p><p>Differences of opinion? He'd just listen to them. If there was real danger, the bystanders would bark, and if there were differences of opinion and real danger, it would be safer to leave the team.</p><p></p><p>Spoils? Of course, whatever one obtained would belong to oneself.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing really wanted to say something at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?" Her expression was somewhat incredulous, but she soon smiled and didn't persuade him further.</p><p></p><p>They three were all Second Realm, while the other party was only First Realm. Even if there were any gains along the way, what could the other party get? Or rather, evenly distributing the spoils and gains is what a team should do.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing and the others didn't initially intend to monopolize the gains. They indeed lacked people, as the task required at least four people, and they couldn't be assigned it.</p><p></p><p>But they certainly didn't expect the one who showed up to be Ye Wuyu, a Ding-rank First Realm prison guard.</p><p></p><p>The gap in strength and realm inevitably led to relatively unequal terms and conditions.</p><p></p><p>But this was fair.</p><p></p><p>Ah ha ha ha ha ha, it's all fake, there's no Spring and Autumn Cicada, no Eternal Poison Worm, it's all fake, all fake! Chen Ping'an!! I can't tell the difference anymore aaaaaaaah!!!!!!!!!!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That remnant soul from the four corners was her last resort.</p><p></p><p>The old man in front of her had been bewitched by her, and even though the old man had died, since he was a cultivator at the mid-Qi Condensation stage, his divine soul had been left behind by chance.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, she had sent him to deal with those few people in the celestial prison, but where did he end up going? Ye Wuyou looked at the white fox crouching on the ground and slowly retreating with a calm gaze, especially staring at its tail for a while.</p><p></p><p>A third-stage demonic fox naturally has three tails.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqiu demonic fox clan is different from other demonic beasts, as if they are the darlings of heaven and earth. While other demonic beasts are still rolling in the mud, the demonic foxes can early on awaken their spiritual intelligence, easily transform, and possess innate illusory abilities.</p><p></p><p>Demonic beasts inherit their bloodline, and if it is the royal bloodline of the Qingqiu, the demonic foxes can also have an additional life-saving ability.</p><p></p><p>Severing the tail to survive.</p><p></p><p>The white fox's eyes were filled with terror as it stepped back step by step, with a bloody mess behind it, and only the remaining single tail was trembling uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>It had just been killed by the man in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even see the other party strike, but there was a strange force that tore it apart.</p><p></p><p>And the thing that killed it, the white fox couldn't even see, nor could it even sense it.</p><p></p><p>But he's only at the Qi Condensation stage, right?</p><p></p><p>The other party hadn't been fooled by it at all, and had known from the beginning that it was a demonic fox.</p><p></p><p>Is he even human? The white fox was extremely sensitive and good at grasping human emotions, but it only now realized one thing.</p><p></p><p>The man in front of it, there was not a trace of human emotion on him.</p><p></p><p>Those eyes, cold and indifferent, were now quietly staring at it, as if able to see through everything.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze, the white fox felt the pressure around it like a tidal wave, and it felt as if it was suffocating, with only a lone tail left.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling soon disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Because Ye Wuyou's gaze had passed over it and moved elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>The white fox's heart trembled, and it immediately turned around, wanting to escape with this opportunity, but was suddenly grabbed by someone.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, where did this little fox come from, it's so beautiful, it's just missing a few tails."  A woman's voice rang out like a light bell, with a slight chuckle.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the hand gently caressing its body, the white fox only felt its scalp tingling.</p><p></p><p>This is its sister.</p><p></p><p>"Beast, you made my Qianhuan Gate perish, and now I've finally found you." The man in the brocade robe suddenly appeared beside them, his eyes filled with deep resentment.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the demonic fox? Now it only has one tail left, how am I supposed to use it as my spirit beast? I don't control crippled beasts." The man in plain clothes walked out, looking at the white fox with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's still very useful, let it recuperate for a few years, otherwise where else would you find a demonic fox that has awakened its spiritual intelligence so early?" Bai Lu chuckled lightly, then tossed the white fox in her hand to the other man.</p><p></p><p>"A few years of recuperation? Looks like it'll take a few more years of killing people to nourish it with spirit blood." The man in plain clothes squinted his eyes, but didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>The demonic fox with the Qingqiu royal bloodline, if he could obtain it, would be much stronger than other demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The white fox wanted to open its mouth, it wanted to tell these people.</p><p></p><p>The woman beside you is the demonic fox! Control her, not me!</p><p></p><p>But it couldn't speak, Bai Lu had done something to it, making it unable to even speak at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Look, it doesn't say a word, tsk, Tao brother, quickly take this demonic fox and find out the whereabouts of the Qianhuan Purple Gold Bell, that treasure is not on its body."  The man in the brocade robe said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The treasure of the Qianhuan Gate, as a member of the Qianhuan Gate, he understood it the best. As long as that treasure was there, he could easily rebuild the Qianhuan Gate.</p><p></p><p>I want to speak, I want to speak! I wish I could open my mouth!</p><p></p><p>The white fox's eyes were filled with increasing terror, if it was controlled by the Yushou Sect's methods, then it would completely lose everything and never have a chance to turn the tables, and would forever become a tool of the humans.</p><p></p><p>But it soon was no longer terrified.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A strange force suddenly emanated from the fox, immediately twisting its head in an incredible direction. The light in the fox's eyes instantly dissipated, and it lost its breath in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change startled the three people, but soon, as if realizing something, they looked angrily towards the front.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood calmly in place, his hands hanging by his sides, appearing harmless.</p><p></p><p>But the three knew that he was the one who had killed the demonic fox. The man in the brocade robe was the first to react, and then his expression turned to anger as he moved forward.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know that you killed my shifu... no, you killed this demonic fox, so how can we find the Qianhuan Purple Gold Bell now?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe attacked in anger, not knowing whether it was for the sect's precious treasure or the resentment of his deceased shifu that was raging around him, like a dragon charging towards Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation at the third realm was forcefully revealed.</p><p></p><p>But soon, his figure suddenly trembled, and then his steps became disordered as he fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe looked down in disbelief at the gaping hole in his chest.</p><p></p><p>What had he done? In the man's final vision, he only saw those calm and leisurely footsteps slowly passing by him.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the death of the man in the brocade robe, Bai Lu and the other two were more terrified.</p><p></p><p>Instantaneous kill at the third realm? This young man was only at the first realm of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But despite the terror, the two did not react slowly. Their spiritual energy flowed, and their figures retreated dozens of meters away.</p><p></p><p>There was also visible spiritual energy surrounding their bodies, like a shield enveloping them.</p><p></p><p>When facing an unknown enemy, keep your distance.</p><p></p><p>The two's actions clearly had the desired effect.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood in place, not making any further moves.</p><p></p><p>The range of the "Ghost Hand" had its limits, just like its quantity.</p><p></p><p>Now, his Ghost Hand could extend to about ten or more zhang, but its power would also weaken accordingly.</p><p></p><p>To maintain a certain power, it was best to be within five or three zhang, about ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Within this distance, against those who could not perceive the Ghost Hand, a surprise attack would be very effective.</p><p></p><p>But once the opponent became aware and maintained their distance, adding protective measures, it would become quite useless.</p><p></p><p>A sneak attack technique.</p><p></p><p>From the distance, the woman's slightly solemn voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Are you from the Tianlou? Why did you kill that demonic fox, and moreover, my companion is also the last disciple of Qianhuan Gate. By killing them, don't you want to find the Qianhuan Purple Gold Bell?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood in place, seriously considering the woman's words.</p><p></p><p>"Since you know I am from the Tianlou, why not only hinder my official duties, but also intend to attack and kill? Could it be that you want to rebel?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's beautiful face suddenly turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much the cultivation sects and the Great Flame Dynasty were at odds privately, they were still under the jurisdiction of the dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Bringing up the dynasty...</p><p></p><p>What use would that be? As long as they killed the Tianlou people here, wouldn't everything be over?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's words continued, his gaze turning to Bai Lu, a faint, elusive smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>"Or could it be that you are also an accomplice of this demonic fox, a demonic evil as well?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's expression changed slightly, not knowing if his words were solely directed at her.</p><p></p><p>But just as she was about to respond, an even more violent tremor suddenly came from the depths of the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the mountains collapsed.</p><p></p><p>And accompanying the rumbling sound was a voice.</p><p></p><p>"Ding-a-ling-a-ling..."</p><p></p><p>The clear bell sound echoed through the mountain range for a long time.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

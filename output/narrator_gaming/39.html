        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu got up from the ground, brushing the dust off his sleeves and humming a little tune as he was about to go back inside.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he turned his head and looked behind him, a trace of confusion appearing on his dust-covered face.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu was now following him silently like a ghost, making no sound as she walked.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the usual tranquility and softness on her face had been replaced by unconcealed disgust and anger.</p><p></p><p>The closer she got, the more clearly he could feel the connection between their two bodies.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu hated Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Who would be willing to suddenly become someone else's spirit beast and have a "master" over them? Her mind recalled the fates of her clan members in the past, as well as the warnings from the elders.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but feel a chill in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The fox demons of the Qingqiu royal clan were coveted not because of their combat abilities, but because of their innate spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>One tail in exchange for one life.</p><p></p><p>It was her life that was exchanged.</p><p></p><p>This surpassed any other spiritual powers in the world!</p><p></p><p>It meant that if Ye Wuyu was killed, he would not die, but the fox demon would die in his place once.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely powerful spiritual power, from a human's perspective.</p><p></p><p>But it was also extremely cruel, from a fox demon's perspective.</p><p></p><p>However, Bai Lu could not attack Ye Wuyu, because the internal connection was also a kind of contract, and she was even unable to harm him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the words of the master had a strong restraint on her, as the one who had the contract of the spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you following me?" Ye Wuyu finally noticed her presence and asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu took a deep breath, suppressing the turmoil in her heart, then spoke calmly, "I think we should talk."</p><p></p><p>Talk? Ye Wuyu was completely bewildered by her words. He stared at Bai Lu blankly for a while, then a happy smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>He first closed the dilapidated little door in the house, then walked a few steps to the bed and patted the bedding with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Have a seat."</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu was first taken aback, but then her body seemed to move uncontrollably and she sat down on the edge of the bed.</p><p></p><p>It's fine, it's just a talk, Bai Lu thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, her expression stiffened, and a hint of shame and shyness appeared in her beautiful eyes, and her charming face revealed unwillingness and a slight trembling.</p><p></p><p>She didn't look, but those hands had obviously already reached her back, caressing that upright part, and finally touching the place that made her feel ashamed and shy.</p><p></p><p>[You've realized it, you've finally realized it. Such a beautiful fox demon, the reason why people love her is not just her innate spiritual power, the best use is to have this one person, which is enough to surpass countless people in the world.]</p><p></p><p>[Fox demons can transform into countless appearances in the world, and their seductive techniques are also innate. Whether it's the aloof and proud female emperor, the humiliated and unwilling cold immortal, or the indifferent-looking but actually revealing everything to you obsessive woman, they can all transform, they can all transform haha.]</p><p></p><p>[What's called spiritual power? This is the real spiritual power!]</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu gently closed her eyes, and the trembling and uneasiness were hidden under her eyelids.</p><p></p><p>She recalled the fate of some of her clan members who had been captured by humans in the past. They were not of the royal bloodline and did not have the coveted innate spiritual power like her.</p><p></p><p>Humans captured them, mostly just for a certain purpose.</p><p></p><p>A faint spiritual energy was silently and invisibly coiling around her.</p><p></p><p>She was going to fight for her life, even if it meant dying together.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the discomfort behind her disappeared, and a man's voice with puzzled and helpless tones reached her ears.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, thank you for coming to cooperate with my investigation, but I really can't see the tail."</p><p></p><p>"I won't doubt you in the future."</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous, did he think that just by saying this, I would let him go?</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu opened her eyes, a determined look in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Creak..."</p><p></p><p>The door was opened by Ye Wuyu, and then a voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Go back to your own room."</p><p></p><p>"You've lost a lot of blood, and even though I've saved you, you still need to rest well."</p><p></p><p>The white-robed lady on the bed walked out like a puppet, towards the door.</p><p></p><p>Until the door behind her closed, the cold wind blew, and a fine bead of sweat appeared on Bai Lu's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Her chest was heaving unsteadily, her eyes slightly downcast as she walked towards her own room.</p><p></p><p>Two fox tails peeked out from the hem of her skirt, but quickly retracted.</p><p></p><p>"Lunatic!" she gritted her teeth.</p><p></p><p>Only she knew the inner journey she had just experienced.</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the door of her own room, Bai Lu hesitated for a while, but finally pushed the door and walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Rest for a night, and leave tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>With her memories restored, she quickly made a decision.</p><p></p><p>She had used her innate spiritual power today, causing great damage, and she really needed to rest well.</p><p></p><p>She didn't care what happened to Ye Wuyu, but she had to find an opportunity to leave this strange village.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>It was late at night.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Grumble..."</p><p></p><p>His hungry stomach wouldn't let him sleep.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu got up from the bed, rubbing his head in a daze, then walked out the door.</p><p></p><p>He walked on the silent village road with no one around, carefully observing the surroundings, trying to find something.</p><p></p><p>He had stayed up late yesterday, and this morning he couldn't resist sleeping at the east end of the village. When he was woken up by the commotion around him, it was already afternoon - he had practically gone a whole day without eating.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go take a chicken from the poor boy's house to eat?" Just as Ye Wuyu had this thought, he shook his head, looking quite regretful.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, he's already been beaten until he vomited blood, the poor thing."</p><p></p><p>After wandering around and finding nothing, Ye Wuyu could only go to the well at the east end of the village.</p><p></p><p>He drew a bucket of icy cold water, first wiping the mud off his face, then drinking it in big gulps.</p><p></p><p>The icy well water entering his stomach made Ye Wuyu shiver all over, but it also dispersed his fatigue somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He tossed the water bucket aside and stood by the well, tilting his head up to look at the moon in the sky.</p><p></p><p>The moon was emitting a soft light, illuminating the village road, full and round.</p><p></p><p>As it was almost midnight, Ye Wuyu rested his chin, his expression pensive.</p><p></p><p>"Will there be wolves again tonight..."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe had already been killed by him earlier in the day.</p><p></p><p>What was this all about? Ah yes, Ye Wuyu clapped his hands, having figured it out.</p><p></p><p>The wolf had already self-detonated and killed someone during the day, so that wolf was already out of the picture.</p><p></p><p>Then why hasn't it ended yet...?</p><p></p><p>【Wake up, wake up! You gradually recall everything, the strangeness of this place is not worth mentioning at all!】</p><p></p><p>Something seemed to surge in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was a very familiar memory from the past.</p><p></p><p>"I am Ye Wuyu, I am not a villager, I am not a villager of this village."</p><p></p><p>"Am I a prophet? No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu squatted down, hugging his head.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Prison, Jailer, Demon Fox..."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of clarity appeared in his clouded eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Jailer, Jailer, Jade Foot, Jade Foot, Jailer, Jade Foot..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression became extremely clear and resolute as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Foot!"</p><p></p><p>【???】</p><p></p><p>When people are thinking, their gaze tends to wander unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's unfocused gaze drifted, looking towards the well, seeing the water surface in the well illuminated by the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>The round moon in the sky was now reflected in the well water, looking flattened, no longer as round, just a long curved line.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze was drawn to it.</p><p></p><p>He felt that it didn't look like the moon.</p><p></p><p>In the round well opening, the reflection in the water was an arc, like an eyeball, but a vertical pupil.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu vaguely felt that he had seen this vertical-pupil eyeball somewhere before.</p><p></p><p>"The mountain, the Demon Fox, the bell..."</p><p></p><p>As Ye Wuyu kept muttering, fragments of past events also gradually resurfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"So, there's a Celestial Prison on the mountain, inside which the Demon Fox has Jade Feet, and a bell is hanging on the Jade Feet?"</p><p></p><p>He stared at the well, his gaze transfixed.</p><p></p><p>His transfixed gaze soon became clear.</p><p></p><p>"I remember now, that night, the last thing in the bell was an eye!"</p><p></p><p>"That thing is down there right now! Catch it!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze turned to the well, as if he could sense something.</p><p>A presence very similar to the eighth layer of the Celestial Prison, those eerie things.</p><p></p><p>"Ding-a-ling-a-ling..."</p><p></p><p>The bell sound rang out, drifting through the village.</p><p></p><p>Nothing happened.</p><p></p><p>But behind him, something seemed to have pushed him.</p><p></p><p>A huge force made Ye Wuyu's body lose control and start falling into the well.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, a ghostly blue hand extended from him, grabbing the edge of the well.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't fall in.</p><p></p><p>He struggled to turn around in the well, but then his pupils shrank, as if he had seen something.</p><p></p><p>The ghostly blue hand was being "eaten" away, that force dispersing the spirit hand.</p><p></p><p>This thing can resist the eerie?</p><p></p><p>"Splash."</p><p></p><p>What if he fell into the well? Ye Wuyu's spiritual energy suddenly surged, wanting to step out.</p><p></p><p>But then his spiritual energy slightly congealed, and he looked down into the well, towards the bottom.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the well, it was as if there were countless hands, firmly restraining his body.</p><p></p><p>Sounds of a drowning person's struggle came from the well, the last struggle of a drowning person.</p><p></p><p>But as time passed, the struggle grew weaker and weaker.</p><p></p><p>Until it dissipated.</p><p></p><p>The round moon in the sky still hung there alone, but a dark cloud drifted over, gradually obscuring it.</p><p></p><p>In the last remnants of moonlight, by the empty well, a fox tail could be faintly seen swaying.</p><p></p><p>Overslept in the morning</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

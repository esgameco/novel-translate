        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He truly felt like he was going insane.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, after he had killed all the people in that village that day, the result was that he woke up the next day in a corner of the village.</p><p></p><p>He had been wandering around this village for three days, and then discovered that his former teammates no longer recognized him.</p><p></p><p>Out of wariness, he did not make a move, nor did he show himself, but only observed in secret.</p><p></p><p>During this time, he even tried to leave the village, but three times, he suddenly lost consciousness in the middle of the night, and when he woke up the next day, he was back in the village again.</p><p></p><p>Today was the fourth day.</p><p></p><p>But he could no longer endure it, if this continued, he would go mad.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have all forgotten, then let me help you find your liberation, so that this group of cultivators won't waste their lives in this state of confusion! It will also be a good deed."</p><p></p><p>"All of you must die!"</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Three Realms Cultivator erupted without any mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Plop."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the sound, the man in the brocade robe turned his head, his gaze filled with murderous intent as he looked towards the figure behind him.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu was standing there at the moment, her beautiful and charming face revealing a hint of surprise, the wooden basin full of clothes in her hands falling to the ground, obviously startled by the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Is it you?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe naturally recognized Bai Lu, his former teammate, this woman from the Hehuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>And he had previously felt that the other party was somewhat extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>The aura was rampaging, without even needing to unleash any divine abilities, the man in the brocade robe simply raised a finger.</p><p></p><p>Blood sprayed.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's chest was pierced through, and her figure then collapsed into a pool of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Help, someone has been killed!"</p><p></p><p>A few elderly villagers at the village entrance cried out and ran away.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe did not bother with them, the lives of ordinary people were nothing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about were this group of former cultivators, who were now all living in one area.</p><p></p><p>First, he would deal with them, and then go handle the others.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's gaze swept towards the front.</p><p></p><p>The pale-faced Bai Chang'en, the trembling Lin Qingqing, and... and a madman, his expression joyful as he examined the man, his eyes familiar, as if he was looking at an old friend.</p><p></p><p>He looked at that madman a few more times.</p><p></p><p>That madman... the man in the brocade robe knew, was from the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a madman, after observing him these past few days, the man in the brocade robe actually felt that he was more normal than the rest.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the matter of Tu Su... the man in the brocade robe had actually wanted to secretly contact that madman today, perhaps he might have some information.</p><p></p><p>But, no matter.</p><p></p><p>He would start by taking care of this madman.</p><p></p><p>"You poor wretch in the brocade robe, you've killed someone, this is wrong."</p><p></p><p>"Why did you kill people during the day, wolves can only attack at night!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's gaze faltered, because that madman had actually run towards him enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>What a lunatic? Why is he calling me a poor wretch? Am I really that poor? I was once a disciple of the Thousand Illusions Gate! The man in the brocade robe even glanced down at himself, aside from the slightly faded edges of his robe, his old and worn shoes, and the rolled up cuffs of his pants...</p><p></p><p>Burning with rage!</p><p></p><p>"You madman, I'll let you die a clear death!" The man in the brocade robe roared angrily, his facade that he had struggled to maintain being pierced by the other's words, which infuriated him.</p><p></p><p>He took a step forward, his figure darting towards the madman like a swift shadow, his aura surging like a dragon.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to personally strike, to crush the other with his own body.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he was within ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Creak, creak! The surrounding enveloping aura slightly congealed, and the man in the brocade robe suddenly felt a sense of resistance.</p><p></p><p>The madman in front of him, his face flushed red, seemed to be exerting his full effort to do something.</p><p></p><p>What was he doing? There was nothing there.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's thoughts only lasted for a moment, because in the next instant, he looked down in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>On his own chest, as if pierced by something, a large gaping hole was exposed.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is not...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe felt like he was going insane. </p><p></p><p>It wasn't because he was going to die, nor was it because the other person had pierced his chest.</p><p></p><p>It was because his wound did not bleed a single drop of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe suddenly stiffened and then slowly fell to the ground. </p><p></p><p>There was an absurd smile on his face, as if he had recalled something.</p><p></p><p>When a person's life flashes before their eyes, they will recall their entire life.</p><p></p><p>Entering the village, climbing the mountain, meeting his demise...</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene seemed to flash before his eyes, and the man in the brocade robe seemed to understand everything.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out I was the fake one, every single day, even tomorrow..."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe did not close his eyes, because he was unwilling to.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu crouched down and gently touched him.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's eyes then closed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu crouched there, a sorrowful expression on his face. </p><p></p><p>Because this time, there was only one jade pendant.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the east entrance of the village, a large group of people had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang sat silently to the side, his body covered in blood. Lin Qingqing was bandaging him, but he was still conscious.</p><p></p><p>Tu Su had also sustained serious injuries, and had just regained consciousness before fainting again, but at least his life was spared.</p><p></p><p>Only Bai Lu...</p><p></p><p>"What do we do? Crazy guy, can you save her? You were so amazing just now, surely you have a way to save her, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, yeah, crazy guy, think of something!"</p><p></p><p>"She's one of us from the village, we have to save her if we can."</p><p></p><p>A crowd surrounded Ye Wuyu, obviously impressed by his earlier display, where he had effortlessly dealt with that powerful person.</p><p></p><p>Such an amazing person, taken down by a simple gesture from Ye Wuyu. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps the "crazy guy" still had some powerful techniques that could save a life? Ye Wuyu's expression turned strange, and he patted the pale but beautiful face of the girl lying on the ground, then pinched her cheeks.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Wuyu sat down on the ground, hands spread out.</p><p></p><p>He spoke bluntly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm the crazy guy, are you all idiots? How could I save someone? And this person is already ice cold, how could I save her?"</p><p></p><p>【No matter, the ignorant masses do not know that as a fox demon of the Azure Qiu royal clan, you have a life for each of your tails, you only need to wait a little.】</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu couldn't understand the commentary in his mind at all, nor did he bother to ponder why there was always a voice speaking in his head.</p><p></p><p>Because that was normal.</p><p></p><p>It was perfectly normal for a crazy person to have voices talking in their head.</p><p></p><p>Low sobs began to spread around.</p><p></p><p>When someone dies, crying is appropriate, it doesn't matter who is crying, as long as someone is.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu rolled his eyes, curling up a bit, as he was very uncomfortable with this kind of atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>Staring at the Bai Lu lying on the ground, her chest pierced through, Ye Wuyu tilted his head.</p><p></p><p>Annoyed by the crying sounds, Ye Wuyu couldn't help but shout.</p><p></p><p>"Stop crying, stop crying! Let me try to save her, if I can't revive her, then you can cry."</p><p></p><p>The crying sounds quieted down, and Ye Wuyu recalled the incantation that Tu Su had used the day before.</p><p></p><p>If that half-dead chicken could be revived, then trying to save a person should be possible, right? Ye Wuyu thought for a moment, then his stiff fingers began to move.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a violent spasm in Ye Wuyu's body, everything then became dull and tasteless.</p><p></p><p>An invisible spiritual light shone upon Bai Lu's body.</p><p></p><p>【Yes, this is you, you had already calculated this step, stealing the beast taming inheritance was precisely for this moment, and from now on you will have an Azure Qiu royal clan fox demon as your guardian spirit.】</p><p></p><p>【The world envies you, but in the face of you, they can only mourn in secret.】</p><p></p><p>【The fox demon of the royal clan, each tail is a life.】</p><p></p><p>【And now, the life is yours.】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

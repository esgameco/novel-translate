        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was discovered by Xu Fang, the one who drew water, and was pulled out of the well the next day.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang was initially greatly frightened. Seeing Ye Wuyu's deathly pale complexion and swollen, bloated skin, it was undoubtedly a dead person.</p><p></p><p>But... he had come back to life.</p><p></p><p>Vomiting the accumulated water in his abdomen, the soaked Ye Wuyu sat on the ground, quietly pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing cautiously approached and patted him. "Hey, lunatic, how are you feeling now? Why haven't you said anything for so long?"</p><p></p><p>The one called "lunatic", Ye Wuyu, slowly turned his head, his gaze at the familiar few people, with no more turbidity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The memories of these past days were clearly etched in Ye Wuyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed gone mad before.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was not affected by the strange village, even if he could perceive the abnormalities, but the bell sounds on the mountain earlier, when he recalled them now, still gave him a headache.</p><p></p><p>To use Ye Wuyu's more professional words, his brain was affected, causing its functions to be abnormal, in simple terms, he had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Now that his consciousness had cleared up... it was probably because he had died once last night.</p><p></p><p>"The talent of the Fox Demon of the Qingqiu Royal Clan... truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>One tail in exchange for one life.</p><p></p><p>This life was used on himself.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, Bai Lu's chest was pierced by the man in brocade robe, but when he revived, there was not even a scar left on the injury.</p><p></p><p>And his own abnormalities had all been restored, or rather, his brain had been restored.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the puzzled gazes of the few people around him, Ye Wuyu stood up, thought for a moment, and left without explaining anything.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang, Lin Qingqing and the others' questions, Ye Wuyu couldn't make them understand right now.</p><p></p><p>Combining the situation of the man in brocade robe and Bai Lu yesterday, the only way he could think of to make them understand was to kill them once.</p><p></p><p>Before death, they would most likely remember something.</p><p></p><p>But they couldn't be revived.</p><p></p><p>However, since he had already regained his clarity, everything would be easy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu first went to Bai Lu's house. It was already morning, and there was noise outside, but Bai Lu had not yet gone out.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the faint connection that had emerged within his own body, Ye Wuyu frowned and directly pushed the door and went in.</p><p></p><p>The bed was empty, but a figure was lying on the ground, still breathing, but rather weakly.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyu's eyes now, he naturally saw that the other party only had a white tail left behind.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Bai Lu's attitude yesterday, Ye Wuyu had a headache.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had used up one of her lives, she might go crazy at him again.</p><p></p><p>[Crazy? She's not even qualified. It's her blessing that she could give you a life, let alone one life, if she had nine tails, you should be slitting your throat to play with her without any problem.]</p><p></p><p>Damn, the narrator has started barking again recently.</p><p></p><p>Am I crazy to slit my own throat and play? But anyway, the fact that he didn't die is thanks to Bai Lu, so Ye Wuyu helped the lying Bai Lu up.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of spiritual energy flowed from his fingertips and entered Bai Lu's body, causing her to wake up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her revive, Ye Wuyu was thinking about how to start the conversation.</p><p></p><p>He had to make things clear, lest she harbor resentment, after all, Bai Lu was now the only normal person left in this village.</p><p></p><p>And with the Demon Beast Clan's innate spirit contract, Bai Lu could not attack him, but Ye Wuyu was afraid that she would still try to self-destruct and set traps for him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu now knew how to break this strange deadlock, but having an extra helper would always be better.</p><p></p><p>"Bai Lu, listen well. Earlier turning you into my innate spirit beast was a misunderstanding, but you all also initially wanted to be my enemy. Now that I've used up one of your lives, it's a fair trade..."</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu's words were not finished yet when the person in his arms opened her eyes, her gaze dazed.</p><p></p><p>She saw Ye Wuyu, first hesitating, wanting to move away.</p><p></p><p>But then, sensing the scent on him, or a certain connection, she shrank back.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression was one of shock, his gaze dull as he watched Bai Lu bury her head in his chest, nuzzling back and forth, her two hands clinging to him like claws.</p><p></p><p>Just like... an animal, or a fox.</p><p></p><p>"Master..." a soft voice came from within his embrace, causing Ye Wuyu to drop his jaw in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Your memories? Do you know who you are?" Ye Wuyu quickly pushed Bai Lu away and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Memories, what memories? I only know that I live in this village with the master, I am the master's little..."</p><p></p><p>Sensing that something was amiss, Ye Wuyu threw the woman onto the bed, covered her with the blanket, and commanded sternly, "Sleep."</p><p></p><p>Click.</p><p></p><p>The door was closed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood on the street, his gaze sharp as he scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He gradually understood everything.</p><p></p><p>The bell that rang at midnight would repeatedly erase people's memories, then deepen them again.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu had not left the village yesterday, so after hearing that bell, the memories she had regained were hidden again, replaced by the impression of being a villager.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Wuyu reckoned that if someone left the village, just like the man in the brocade robe, they would be sent back unconscious after being found.</p><p></p><p>Only he was unaffected by that bell.</p><p></p><p>Was it because of the "ghost" within his body?</p><p></p><p>[The sleeping dragon has finally opened its eyes, and now no one can stop you. Those ignorant fools tainted by the Dao aura are utterly powerless.]</p><p></p><p>Dao aura? </p><p></p><p>Not the remnants of the Dao? Ye Wuyu knew that the strange phenomena in this world were referred to as Dao remnants, but what was this Dao aura? He soon recalled.</p><p></p><p>He had seen the "source" that caused all this, the ethereal image in the sky that he had seen before losing consciousness on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was the eyeball of a demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, the aura and the remnants, the remnants must be the heavier factor.</p><p></p><p>Although he had lost Bai Lu's assistance, he no longer had to worry about being tripped up by others.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu already knew what to do.</p><p></p><p>He crouched on the ground, thinking about the information in his mind, and started writing with a tree branch.</p><p></p><p>This action was a bit strange, but everyone in the village knew he was a madman, so no one came to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Saving him a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>1. The source that caused everything is an eyeball inside the Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell.</p><p>2. Killing the source will restore memories, but the midnight bell will erase people's memories, except for his own.</p><p>3. The man in the brocade robe, whom he had killed, still appeared in the village.</p><p>4. Who was the one who pushed him into the well yesterday?</p><p></p><p>After listing these few questions, Ye Wuyu's thoughts became clear. He stood up and completely erased the words on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Commotion was heard again at the village entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Tu Su, snap out of it! Every day raising chickens and ducks, do you really think you're a villager?"</p><p>"What... what are you talking about? I don't know you."</p><p></p><p>The same kind of conversation, obviously the man in the brocade robe grabbing Tu Su and questioning him.</p><p></p><p>Both of them had forgotten yesterday's events.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, only one of them, because the man in the brocade robe was already dead.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu quietly watched them, watching their argument and quarrel.</p><p></p><p>A sinister blue figure gradually merged into his body from behind.</p><p></p><p>Consequently, the entire village took on a different appearance in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Blackened soil, withered trees, dilapidated houses, a deathly stillness.</p><p></p><p>And in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The color of the robe had turned completely black, a body already rotting from top to bottom, the bony white arms reaching out to grab Tu Su and ask him something.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the mountain forest, there were several twisted cracks dozens of meters long on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say? You still want to go up the mountain?" Xu Fang roared.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyou is our teammate, no matter what he did when facing the demonic beast before, even if the mission fails, we have to go back together." Lin Qingqing's expression was grave, but her words were firm.</p><p></p><p>In the previous earthquake, a huge crack had suddenly appeared between the three of them and Ye Wuyou, followed by a landslide, with smoke and sand filling the air, and the two groups had scattered.</p><p></p><p>The three of them had just experienced an "illusion" demonic beast, and had sustained injuries, plus they had been rushing through the night, already exhausted in body and mind.</p><p></p><p>Now it was Xu Fang and Lin Qingqing who were arguing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang thought they should return to the foot of the mountain to rest, while Lin Qingqing thought they should continue to search for the person.</p><p></p><p>The two were in a stalemate, but the usually silent Bai Changzai spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing, I think we should leave this place as soon as possible, rather than go find that newcomer Ye Wuyou. Don't you think all these things are too strange?" </p><p></p><p>The two turned their gaze to Bai Changzai.</p><p></p><p>"From the beginning when we sensed the demonic fox aura, to seeing the smoke and fire on the mountain, and then the sudden appearance of the demonic beast, followed by the earthquake, these things are not normal, don't you find it a bit strange?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai sighed, perhaps the only calm one among the three.</p><p></p><p>"And the most abnormal thing, I didn't notice it before, but look at the injuries on your bodies."</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai extended a hand, revealing a torn wound, but it had already stopped bleeding.</p><p></p><p>"This doesn't look like the injury caused by that demonic beast, but rather like something else..." Bai Changzai said.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing and Xu Fang were both startled, and then began to carefully examine the wounds on their own bodies.</p><p></p><p>These subtle lacerations indeed did not seem to be caused by the huge-mouthed demonic beast...</p><p></p><p>"Ding-a-ling-a-ling..."</p><p></p><p>What sound was that? How could there be the sound of a bell? The three were startled, but then the ground beneath their feet began to shake violently again.</p><p></p><p>"No, we have to go back, to the foot of the mountain, no, to get out of the Cloud Mist Mountain Range!"</p><p></p><p>However, the second bell sound came.</p><p></p><p>"Ding-a-ling-a-ling..."</p><p></p><p>The sound was a little more urgent this time.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, my head suddenly hurts... Xu Fang, what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing reached up to hold her head, the excruciating pain raging in her mind, but out of the corner of her eye, she saw Xu Fang's expression become wooden as he walked towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>"This bell sound... there's something strange about it, it's disturbing the mind." Bai Changzai's voice was slightly trembling with pain, but he still seemed relatively clear-headed.</p><p></p><p>But then the third bell sound came.</p><p></p><p>"Ding-a-ling-a-ling..."</p><p></p><p>This time, even Bai Changzai was instantly plunged into confusion, his body moving uncontrollably towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing, Xu Fang, Bai Changzai, the three figures were now stiff and soulless, walking in the mountains like corpses.</p><p></p><p>If someone could fly above and look down, they would see where the three were heading.</p><p></p><p>The foot of the mountain, Cloud Mist Village.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Another earthquake?</p><p></p><p>The earthquake had disrupted the standoff between Ye Wuyou and Bai Lu's group, but the bell sound that followed had made the few of them pause.</p><p></p><p>Although it was only a slight moment of bewilderment, the three quickly regained their senses, but how could an ordinary bell sound affect the mind of cultivators?</p><p></p><p>"This is... damn, could this be the Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell?" Bai Lu seemed to have thought of something, her voice shrill.</p><p></p><p>She knew her sister had died knowing where the bell was, and the last disciple of the Thousand Illusion Sect who knew how to wield it had also died.</p><p></p><p>So why would the bell be ringing by itself? Her understanding of the Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell was not as much as her sister's, but from these past few days of interacting with the last disciple of the Thousand Illusion Sect, she had picked up some clues.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell, an accidental treasure obtained by the Thousand Illusion Sect, was also the foundation of their sect's establishment.</p><p></p><p>Its origins were unknown, but this treasure, in the hands of the Thousand Illusion Sect, even a Sect Master at the Fourth Realm could contend with those at the Sixth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful treasure, logically, should be something the Sect Master would carry with him. </p><p></p><p>But the Thousand Illusion Sect did not, on the contrary, they seemed to be wary of the thing, keeping it high up and guarded tightly.</p><p></p><p>And combined with her sister's... although she was already dead, her frantic desire to obtain this treasure could only be related to the Demon Fox Clan.</p><p></p><p>Her thoughts flashed in an instant, and the second bell sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>Followed by the third.</p><p></p><p>Ding-a-ling-a-ling...</p><p></p><p>The three-realm cultivators were now as fragile as paper at this moment, no matter how Bai Lu and the remaining commoner tried to resist...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man had no way to resist, unable to stop the piercing sound of the bell.</p><p></p><p>His body was filled with spiritual energy and divine abilities, but even covering his ears was useless. </p><p></p><p>This bell sound was ringing directly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's vision gradually became hazy and finally fell into darkness.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, their figures, just like Lin Qingqing and the others before, stiffly and unconsciously headed down the mountain. The direction they were going was also that village.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying them down the mountain was another figure.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe had already been pierced through the chest, no longer breathing, already a dead man. </p><p></p><p>But at this moment, his form also stiffly stood up and walked towards the Cloud Mist Village.</p><p></p><p>But the bell sound did not stop.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because there was still one person remaining in this place.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Ye Wuyu's figure currently appeared in mid-air, as if walking on air. This was something only those at the mid-Xiantian realm could achieve.</p><p></p><p>At a place imperceptible to the naked eye, a dim blue figure appeared behind Ye Wuyu, and countless azure palms gathered, forming a mass that Ye Wuyu stepped on.</p><p></p><p>The "ghost" thus carried Ye Wuyu, lifting him up by itself.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Ye Wuyu's expression was no longer as lifeless as before, or one could say, there were a few more human emotions on his face.</p><p></p><p>His figure stood in the air, but upon closer inspection, he seemed to be trembling slightly, not fully under control.</p><p></p><p>Yet he still laughed loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, I thought it was something, but it's just a remnant imbued with a bit of the Dao, now refined into an object, barely born with a bit of sentience, not even worthy of being called a corpse, yet it dares to try to influence me?"</p><p></p><p>"It would be better to obediently come forward, and when I subdue that white fox, I'll chain you up and hang you around its neck, at least giving you a place to belong."</p><p></p><p>"Know that to defy the Heavens, there is still a path, but to defy me, there is no hope!"</p><p></p><p>Although the voice was still Ye Wuyu's, the tone was completely different from before - extremely arrogant.</p><p></p><p>The fourth bell sound came again, this time seeming to be a bit heavier.</p><p></p><p>Ding-a-ling-a-ling.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's upper body remained motionless, but his legs were violently trembling uncontrollably, although he still seemed to be trying to maintain some composure.</p><p></p><p>"No, not enough, I do not fear even the sacred sounds of the Dao, how could I be subdued by this little noise?"</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, come again, come again if you dare!"</p><p></p><p>The fifth bell sound thundered in.</p><p></p><p>The sound was no longer crisp, but had changed to a hurried tone.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Wuyu's eyes were bulging, his entire body shaking.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, it was as if a hammer was constantly crashing down, almost driving him to madness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu wanted to say something, but at the same time, the sixth bell sound came, without giving any interval.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Ye Wuyu's behavior had angered it.</p><p></p><p>Although his head was still there, a thunderous roar was transmitted from within, like an electric drill drilling into the brain, about to explode.</p><p></p><p>Consciousness dissipated in an instant, and the thread of reason in his mind let out a crisp hum and then snapped.</p><p></p><p>[Alas, alas, he has already entered the realm of no-self, you who are invincible in the world, are now trapped before this object]</p><p></p><p>[However, you still have a backup plan, the remnants of the Dao are already fused with you, this illusion cannot truly disturb your mind]</p><p></p><p>[This trace of spiritual energy is nothing to be feared, when you regain consciousness, you can easily subdue it with a casual gesture]</p><p></p><p>The voice of the narrator sounded in Ye Wuyu's mind, like a spiritual echo.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, as the narrator in his mind said, the bell sound could disturb the minds of others, but Ye Wuyu, with his strange possession, would not be affected.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite, however, was that Ye Wuyu's mind had to remain clear.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu... he had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound of breaking came from his ear, as if something had shattered.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyu's now blurred vision, he vaguely saw something appear in the sky.</p><p></p><p>It was a bell.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the bell was trembling, its purple-gold exterior gradually crumbling, as if something was bursting out from within.</p><p></p><p>Crack.</p><p></p><p>The shell broke and fell to the ground, revealing a round object inside.</p><p></p><p>In the night sky, that object seemed to overlap with the moon, but obscured all light and shadow.</p><p></p><p>It was an eyeball.</p><p></p><p>That night, there were many more people in the Cloud Mist Village.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the cycle was broken, the path ahead seemed to flicker like an illusory curtain before finally revealing itself.</p><p></p><p>The white jelly-like surface beneath his feet suddenly burst forth, only to vanish without a trace in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"I forgot to slaughter it..." Ye Wuyou murmured.</p><p></p><p>The path ahead materialized, and he could even see the faint, dim candlelight.</p><p></p><p>But it was still just the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>The path behind was shrouded in darkness, pregnant with the unknown.</p><p></p><p>It was still a cycle.</p><p></p><p>"There's no going back."</p><p></p><p>It didn't matter, Ye Wuyou averted his gaze and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Rather than staying in place waiting for an uncertain rescue, it was better to seek out a glimmer of hope himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if he was temporarily free from the eerie corrosion, who could guarantee that there wouldn't be new troubles?</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the impact of the white jelly skin or this bizarre cycle...</p><p></p><p>It all meant that the group of anomalies, those remnants of the Great Dao, didn't seem to be as docile.</p><p></p><p>However, according to Xia Anmeng's explanation, the prison that held those anomalies was a world unto itself, and the interior was absolutely safe.</p><p></p><p>To occupy one of those prison cells, he would have to eliminate the anomalies within.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou recalled the appearances of those he had seen before.</p><p></p><p>The legless man, the child, the white jelly skin...</p><p></p><p>Were these monsters really something he could kill? [The remnants of the Great Dao dare to dream of killing you? Not enough, not nearly enough. You are only at the Second Realm, yet you can easily dispatch them. However, to be on the safe side, you should devour the soul fragment within you to replenish your damaged divine spirit.]</p><p></p><p>Shut up, I have no interest in that old thing hundreds of years old.</p><p></p><p>[Think it over for a moment. That stinky old woman over a hundred years old is indeed not worthy of your palate. So turn your gaze to the other one beside you, the young girl just fifteen or sixteen, the prime age to be plucked. Moreover, you saved her life, her life and death are in your hands. It would not be excessive to have her offer herself to you.]</p><p></p><p>[Right now, you can take the heavens as your blanket, the earth as your bed, and the remnants of the Great Dao as your groomsmen...]</p><p></p><p>Tch...</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the system's vulgar nonsense, Ye Wuyou's heart calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Compared to before, when he saw those "monsters," the system's arrogant and overbearing barking had even actively backed down. This time, however, it had become unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding corridor was slightly brighter, and he could vaguely see the dim candlelight.</p><p></p><p>It seemed they were almost there.</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng's voice came from the depths of his mind.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if you can see the anomalies, but I can sense them. Don't act rashly, they are confined in the prison cells and can't harm us. I'll choose one to eliminate."</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng's voice was somewhat grave. She had been a Sixth Realm cultivator in life and had encountered the anomalies before.</p><p></p><p>The "divine abilities" the anomalies wielded were unavoidable, but some of them were not that dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The familiar prison cells gradually appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Six prison cells, not one less, slowly emerged on both sides of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi had already raised her sword, gently closing her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't see the anomalies, but at times like this, it was better to rely on her senses to carefully perceive them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>A complex expression crossed his face, eventually turning into a somewhat absurd smile.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck off..." he muttered under his breath.</p><p></p><p>What the hell was this?</p><p></p><p>He had thought that this group of creatures called "anomalies" were dangerous, or that they might spawn some other mischief.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Who could have imagined that these anomalies would be out of their cages?!</p><p></p><p>Six prison cells, and three of them were now empty.</p><p></p><p>In the remaining three non-empty cells, perhaps due to his current Second Realm cultivation, Ye Wuyou could see them quite clearly this time.</p><p></p><p>A gnarled tree stump, the same child as before, and the white jelly skin that seemed to be half-crawling out of the prison cell...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I don't know if it's real or not, but that white jelly-like thing seemed to sense Ye Wuyou's arrival and even twitched a bit, as if greeting him excitedly." <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>And the legless man, whom Ye Wuyou had seen for the first time, was now standing in the middle of the corridor, with his back facing Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>This legless man had no legs, but he was indeed standing there, and under the dim candlelight, only the shadows of his legs could be seen on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou remembered that Xia Anmeng had mentioned earlier that some strange creatures had almost lethal supernatural powers, while others did not.</p><p></p><p>So, what kind of creature was this one?</p><p></p><p>And the two empty cages, where were the strange creatures inside them now? "I made a misjudgment, it seems like a strange creature has escaped the cage... We need to get out of here quickly," Xia Anmeng's voice came from within.</p><p></p><p>So you just sensed it, huh!</p><p></p><p>"Can't we just go into their cages directly? They're empty anyway." Ye Wuyou timely proposed the idea.</p><p></p><p>"No, one cage can block other strange creatures, but for the original one, it's wide open. And in this situation..." </p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng didn't finish her words, but Ye Wuyou already understood her meaning.</p><p></p><p>If the strange creatures could get out of the cages, then the previous judgment might not hold true anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Don't make a move, slowly back away." Ye Wuyou reminded, fearing that Lu Caiwi might rashly strike out.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't move.</p><p></p><p>No, neither he nor Lu Caiwi could move backward.</p><p></p><p>Yet the distance between them and the legless man remained the same.</p><p></p><p>A loop?</p><p></p><p>The legless man finally turned around, still completely naked, his expression vacant and devoid of any color.</p><p></p><p>But when he saw Ye Wuyou and Lu Caiwi, a hint of sharpness seemed to flash in his gray-white eyes.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fixed on the two of them, and then he slowly walked towards them.</p><p></p><p>Without legs, his movements were just the shadows cast by the candlelight, yet they seemed to have become his legs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou could only watch helplessly as the distance between them and the man kept shrinking, until he was right in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Ye Wuyou felt like he couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>His body inexplicably stiffened, unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi was also immobilized, and even Xia Anmeng within her was silent as if in a dormant state.</p><p></p><p>The legless man first came to stand before Ye Wuyou, silently bending down and looking at something, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Male feet, won't do."</p><p></p><p>The legless man actually spoke.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou then realized the man was looking at his legs.</p><p></p><p>Next, the man walked around Ye Wuyou and turned his gaze to Lu Caiwi.</p><p></p><p>He bent down and stared at her for a while, seeming quite satisfied as he nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Jade feet, jade feet, acceptable."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he was about to reach out and touch those jade feet.</p><p></p><p>【Jade feet, jade feet, how outrageous! This deformed exhibitionist and ugly monster actually wants to touch what belongs to you. At this moment, you have no more reservations, and you must let this ugly monster experience what male feet are like!】</p><p></p><p>Well said.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Wuyou felt his thoughts were so in sync with the narration.</p><p></p><p>The body that had been stiff and immobile suddenly broke free of the restraints.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he delivered a fierce kick towards the legless man who had just bent down to reach out.</p><p></p><p>A powerful mid-air strike, and the legless man's body was sent sliding on the ground for over ten meters.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou now stood in front of Lu Caiwi, pointing at the strange creature and cursing loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck you, you monster! What the hell do you think you are?"</p><p></p><p>"Jade feet? Like hell!"</p><p></p><p>This last sentence, he said it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

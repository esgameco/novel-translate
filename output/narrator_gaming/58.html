        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu opened the courtyard gate and looked at the little girl in red in front of him. He first frowned, then relaxed his expression.</p><p></p><p>He squatted down and gently tapped her nose with his finger, saying, "It's Cuicui, why did you come to my place?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu recognized Cuicui, she was the neighbor's child. She would usually call him "big brother", they were old neighbors, and he had even received help from her family before.</p><p></p><p>"I saw the ivy on the door had fallen off, so I knew you were back, big brother."</p><p></p><p>"Big brother Ye, where were you before? My mother said there was a prison collapse in the city and you were crushed to death, but I didn't believe it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu gave an embarrassed smile. The incident at the prison seemed to have spread widely, and he had been away for almost a month, so from an outsider's perspective, it would seem like he had died.</p><p></p><p>But coincidentally, he had something he wanted to ask about.</p><p></p><p>"Cuicui, your big brother wants to ask you, before I left to take the imperial examination, do you remember what my father was doing during that time?"</p><p></p><p>The little girl fell into thought, but seemed to recall something, and a trace of fear appeared in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The little girl shook her head and said in a low voice, "I don't know, big brother Ye is a good person, but your father is a bad person, I don't dare to look."</p><p></p><p>"Why is he a bad person?" Ye Wuyu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Because he killed Afu." The little girl's voice was very low.</p><p></p><p>Killed someone? Before Ye Wuyu could say a few more words, another figure of a woman emerged from another house in the alley. She first called out loudly to summon Cuicui back, then looked at the squatting Ye Wuyu with a startled expression on her face.</p><p></p><p>The woman's voice soon floated over, with unconcealed sharpness and bitterness.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ye, are you trying to die? It's dark and you don't even turn on the lights, trying to scare people? Are you pretending to be a ghost when you're alive?"</p><p></p><p>"If you dare to scare our Cuicui, I'll overturn your whole family."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't mind, but instead walked straight towards her.</p><p></p><p>In the night, Ye Wuyu's expression was not visible, he walked over silently, his footsteps light and almost inaudible, looking somewhat eerie.</p><p></p><p>Damn, could this little Ye be a ghost? It's not even the seventh day after death, it's been over a month.</p><p></p><p>The woman hesitated for a moment, then swallowed her saliva and pulled her daughter behind her.</p><p></p><p>"What... what do you want to do? Don't think just because you're wearing this outfit you're an official now."</p><p></p><p>"Your despicable father has been like that all his life... I'm not afraid of you."</p><p></p><p>The woman's words were harsh and vicious, becoming more and more cruel and fierce as Ye Wuyu approached, like a proud old mother hen.</p><p></p><p>The woman's cursing was very unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"You're exaggerating, Mrs. Wang."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu walked up to her and took out some silver from his pocket, handing it to her.</p><p></p><p>"This is what I borrowed from your family before, and now I'm repaying it, the extra can be considered as interest."</p><p></p><p>The cursing words were swallowed back by the woman, she looked at the considerable amount of silver in her hand, then looked at the living Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's time to pay back, otherwise I would have scolded... but you don't need to give so much."</p><p></p><p>Greed and conflict were mixed in the woman's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu shook his head lightly and said, "It's okay, when I went to take the imperial examination before, it was your family that helped my father handle the aftermath, so you should keep it, both emotionally and rationally."</p><p></p><p>As if finding a good excuse, the woman finally smiled and, after a perfunctory refusal, took the silver money with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's words came again, casually, "By the way, Mrs. Wang, it was your family that collected my father's body at the time... what disease did he have?"</p><p></p><p>Mentioning this, the woman's gaze became unpleasant, obviously she was not happy to talk about the dead.</p><p></p><p>But seeing the silver, she still answered Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"How would I know? I just saw that your courtyard didn't have anyone going in and out for several days, so I let my husband go take a look, and then your father was just lying on the bed."</p><p></p><p>"Just like that?" Ye Wuyu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Just like that, as for what kind of illness, I don't know, but he's gone and there's no injury on his body, why bother with so much."</p><p></p><p>"Although your father Ye Changsheng didn't live long... but it seems he passed away in his sleep, not a tragic thing, the neighbor Mrs. Lin's husband got sick and suffered for several months before passing away..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu nodded slightly, declined the woman's invitation to stay for dinner, and headed towards his own home.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he thought of something and asked one last question.</p><p></p><p>"Who is Afu?"</p><p></p><p>"My family's big yellow dog, your father went crazy one day and snatched the dog and killed it, making my daughter cry for three days."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu lit a candle and then sat down calmly.</p><p></p><p>No injuries, died in his sleep.</p><p></p><p>Snatching the neighbor's dog and then killing it? A strange look flashed in Ye Wuyu's eyes. In his memory, his father Ye Changsheng, although having a very bad temper, was not the kind of person who would act without reason.</p><p></p><p>At least he wouldn't go snatch the neighbor's dog. </p><p></p><p>This had nothing to do with illness, unless he had gone mad.</p><p></p><p>Father Ye...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The death of Changsheng was suspicious, and his own previous death also seemed to have issues.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why he had lost his memories of that third young master.</p><p></p><p>No matter, the Tian Yan is activated! After using it just now, Ye Wuyu has already understood the usage of this divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Unraveling the heavenly mechanism, seeing the future, and also...</p><p></p><p>Tracing back in time. A black figurine lightly tapped in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu saw the scene of his own courtyard a few hours ago, everything was normal.</p><p></p><p>Compared to only being able to see the future a few minutes ahead, tracing back in time with this Tian Yan technique seemed a bit easier.</p><p></p><p>After all, the future has not yet happened, while the past cannot be changed.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Lu Qingshan said that even if an ordinary person comprehends this Tian Yan technique, they would have to pay an extremely heavy price to use it..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at his left hand, the blue blood threads gradually climbing up his forearm seemed to have diminished a bit.</p><p></p><p>This divine technique Tian Yan consumes a strange power.</p><p></p><p>But he still felt something within himself being stirred, as if about to be absorbed, only that there was a strange existence that took on this price.</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary person wants to use this Tian Yan technique... do they have to use their spiritual souls? No wonder it's said to have an extremely heavy price, ordinary people can probably only use the Tian Yan a few times before dying or going mad.</p><p></p><p>Even a cultivator at the middle Xian Jie realm, using it a few times would damage their spiritual souls, and they would only have a glimpse of the future in this lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The black figurine tapped a second time.</p><p></p><p>This time, it seemed to have traced back a bit further, but he only saw a corner of the scene from yesterday.</p><p></p><p>The third tap... he saw two days ago.</p><p></p><p>After tapping three times in succession, Ye Wuyu could even clearly feel that the strange invasion of his body had diminished somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it was not that the invasion had diminished, but that the "ghost's" power had weakened.</p><p></p><p>However, even though he had comprehended the Tian Yan through the "Wuxiang Heart Sutra" and the narrator's guidance, this divine technique is different from those easily picked up techniques, he still has to practice it from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>There are also intricacies to how the black figurine taps - tapping three times separately, and tapping three times in succession, are two different concepts.</p><p></p><p>"The Tian Yan technique has nine layers, and upon reaching the deepest, one can tap nine times in succession to glimpse the past, present and future.</p><p></p><p>As a beginner, one can only tap once. If one wants to advance, they need to increase the number of taps to nine, to reach the second layer.</p><p></p><p>At that time, they can tap twice in succession, and the information seen will also be more. If one wants to enter the third layer, they need to tap eighty-one times, in order to tap three times in succession, and so on..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's learning results were not ideal.</p><p></p><p>The eighth power of nine, narrator, please calculate it for me.</p><p></p><p>[Ridiculous, how could such a simple problem stump you? With a moment's thought, you would arrive at the conclusion - six million times.]</p><p></p><p>I don't believe you.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu picked up the pen and calculated it himself.</p><p></p><p>43,046,721 times.</p><p></p><p>Four million times... Ye Wuyu put down the pen and pen and paper, contemplating life.</p><p></p><p>Can anyone really cultivate to the ninth layer of this Tian Yan? What a lunatic, spending their whole life just watching a figurine tap?</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to the strange presence behind him, the azure "ghost" silently floating behind him, without a face, only a human form.</p><p></p><p>Does the strange presence have any intelligence? Probably a little, not much.</p><p></p><p>That white jelly-like thing he saw earlier also had it, although that intelligence was very low, closer to instinct.</p><p></p><p>"Four million times... never mind, think positively, it's not like I'm the one doing the work." Ye Wuyu looked at the "ghost" and muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The ominous strange presence that was once in his eyes had, after he mastered the "Tian Yan", become a free labor force in Ye Wuyu's eyes.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the azure blue figure trembled slightly, then shrank back into his body, to Ye Wuyu's astonished gaze.</p><p></p><p>Forget it, Ye Wuyu shook his head and pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to trace back the river of time through the Tian Yan technique is obviously not very realistic in the short term.</p><p></p><p>After all, the tapping also takes time.</p><p></p><p>And the unraveled scenes, that's not just a day or two, but events from months ago.</p><p></p><p>Let's change the approach.</p><p></p><p>"Why did Ye Changsheng suddenly pass away, and was my own death also due to illness? Any clues will do."</p><p></p><p>Unraveling the heavenly mechanism.</p><p></p><p>The black figurine tapped heavily.</p><p></p><p>This time, Ye Wuyu saw something different.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the free perspective he could see when reversing time earlier, the scene that appeared in Ye Wuyu's eyes this time was very narrow and dim.</p><p></p><p>What he could see was only the little bit of the scene in front of him.</p><p></p><p>It was a painting.</p><p></p><p>In the painting, there was a woman.</p><p></p><p>Lifelike, like a real person.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, she was lying quietly under her own bed.</p><p></p><p>"Can you promise me something?"</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>"Pursue."</p><p></p><p>"...Let's change the request, this one is too difficult."</p><p></p><p>"Then pursue me?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll pursue you!"</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

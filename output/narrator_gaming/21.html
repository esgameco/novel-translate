        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>King Fugui has been very busy lately.</p><p></p><p>As a Level D prison guard in the Heavenly Prison, King Fugui has been muddling through for over thirty years, and he was just about to retire, but then the Heavenly Prison collapsed.</p><p></p><p>With fewer personnel and more tasks, the originally leisurely King Fugui has been forced to become busy.</p><p></p><p>But even so, he is somewhat relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At least, since he is old and weak, he doesn't have to participate in the more dangerous capture activities like the rest.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, hey... Little Ye?" King Fugui rubbed his eyes, looking at a figure wandering around the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle King?" Ye Wuyu smiled and came over.</p><p></p><p>"You little guy... disappeared for more than twenty days, I thought you were dead, hey."</p><p></p><p>Uncle King's words paused slightly, then he leaned in towards Ye Wuyu, reached out and pinched the other's shoulder, with a surprised look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You've broken through a realm?"</p><p></p><p>"It was due to luck."</p><p></p><p>"You little..."</p><p></p><p>Uncle King's gaze was somewhat emotional.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was the one he had brought in, and at first this kid knew nothing about cultivation, but how many days has it been?</p><p></p><p>At most, it's been about a month.</p><p></p><p>Uncle King glanced around, then pulled Ye Wuyu aside and whispered.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, if you broke through a realm, of course it would be a great thing, you could get a Level D prison guard token, get an official identity, and your salary could also go up a bit."</p><p></p><p>"But now... don't make a fuss about it, and don't go register it either, just stay quietly with your Uncle King for this period, and later when things stabilize, you can get the official identity, and Uncle King will help you find a wife..."</p><p></p><p>Uncle King rambled on, but Ye Wuyu's gaze was looking around at the coming and going figures.</p><p></p><p>Those prison guards were weary, with a slightly tired expression on their faces, and there were occasionally traces of blood on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to notice Ye Wuyu's gaze, Uncle King glanced around and explained in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look, previously there was a riot in the Heavenly Prison, and a lot of prisoners escaped, especially from the lower levels, the riot started from there."</p><p></p><p>"Now the internal of the Heavenly Prison has stabilized, of course those escaped prisoners need to be captured, but it's not that easy, those guys who have just escaped can fight to the death with you."</p><p></p><p>"We are just small fry, those things are not for us to meddle in..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>He could feel that at this moment, Uncle King's words were truly from the bottom of his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Uncle King treated him before, at least now he really doesn't want him to get into trouble.</p><p></p><p>But he... has already been arranged perfectly.</p><p></p><p>That Warden clearly said he wanted to take him as a disciple, but he hasn't seen him at all.</p><p></p><p>"The Warden will be back in about half a month, and before that, the Warden hopes that Elder Zhao can teach Young Master Ye well..."</p><p></p><p>And Zhao Changhe, the old man seemed to be a little angry after hearing those words, but he was helpless.</p><p></p><p>He could only throw out a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Come to the Heavenly Prison tomorrow morning, and take the task yourself."</p><p></p><p>[The old scoundrel dares to order me? I deliberately won't go, you look down on me in your heart, but instead you are appraising the Four Sisters of Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter, in the heavy snow, their thin clothes gradually disappearing in your eyes, completely naked...]</p><p></p><p>The official is one level higher, and when under his eaves, one must still listen to the words of the senior Zhao.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu took out a brand new waist token, with a big [D] character engraved on it, then looked at the dazed Uncle King and quietly said.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle King, do you know where to pick up the task?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Wuyu learned that the Heavenly Prison had such a thing as tasks.</p><p></p><p>This is also normal, in the past, only Level C and above had the power to execute tasks, Level D prison guards were basically just guarding the gates and handling miscellaneous affairs.</p><p></p><p>The generous Heavenly Prison, of course, would not be stingy with the treatment of those executing tasks. </p><p></p><p>In addition to the fixed monetary rewards, there were also more cultivation resources provided.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The elixirs, cultivation techniques, rare medicinal materials, and even weapons can all be exchanged through [Contribution Points].</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this is also why a Heavenly Prison can have several Rank A powerhouses like Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Fifth Realm, even in the Fourth Realm, one can easily find a cultivation sect in the outside world and become a revered elder, enjoying the prosperity of the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>However, in those mundane sects, if you come from a poor background without any backing, even if you have made tremendous contributions or possess extraordinary talents, the final opportunities and rewards will most likely still fall upon the sect leader's son...</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that the Heavenly Prison provides far more cultivation resources than those ordinary sects.</p><p></p><p>And all of this comes from the missions and contributions.</p><p></p><p>However, even Rank D prison guards can now take on missions, it seems the Heavenly Prison has indeed lost a lot of manpower...</p><p></p><p>[Rank B Mission: Capture the fugitive criminal, Shen Cang the Drifting Blade... Reward: 10 taels of gold, 3 Jade Realm Elixirs, 1 Mysterious Realm Cultivation Technique, 300 Contribution Points]</p><p></p><p>[Rank C Mission: Capture the fugitive criminal, Mo An the Flying Thief... Reward: 10 taels of gold, 3 Barrier-Breaking Elixirs, 100 Contribution Points]</p><p></p><p>[Rank B Mission: ...]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu looked out the window, this was a room on the second layer of the Heavenly Prison, it seemed to be a temporary structure, and outside the door was a large wooden board covered in densely written mission details.</p><p></p><p>Nine out of ten were about capturing fugitives.</p><p></p><p>And behind these missions, there were occasional annotations.</p><p></p><p>[3/4, the original Rank B Team 3, currently lacking one accompanying cultivating medical practitioner, those interested please come forward...]</p><p></p><p>[1/5, I am a Second Realm Sword Cultivator, welcome fellow colleagues to join, currently lacking Formation Specialists, Medical Practitioners, and Body Refinement Cultivators]</p><p></p><p>[3/4, the original Rank C Team 2, in need of a Medical Practitioner...]</p><p></p><p>Each mission had at least four annotations behind it.</p><p></p><p>It seems that only teams of four are allowed to take on these missions.</p><p></p><p>Combining these annotations, the cultivators within the Heavenly Prison also seem to have different classifications.</p><p></p><p>Reasonable combinations of cultivators in different disciplines can produce synergistic effects greater than the sum of their parts.</p><p></p><p>Tsk... Medical Practitioners are in such high demand, it seems Spring Peach as a Second Realm Medical Practitioner holds a very high status.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu also saw a [Rank A Mission]: Slay the escaped Fifth Realm Black Bear Demon, that demonic beast is extremely cunning... Reward: 1000 Contribution Points.</p><p></p><p>A Black Bear? A demonic beast? Could it be the same Black Bear that was intentionally captured that day? Has that demonic beast not only caused a riot in the Heavenly Prison but also successfully escaped?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu averted his gaze, not looking further, for this was not a task he could complete.</p><p></p><p>Even those Rank B missions were the same, such as the Drifting Blade, which clearly stated the target was a Fourth Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The rewards were very generous, but this was obviously beyond his abilities, to take it on would be suicide.</p><p></p><p>His gaze continued to sweep over, and then paused.</p><p></p><p>[Rank C Mission: Capture the fugitive demonic beast, the Blue Demon Fox from Qiurong Mountain, a Third Realm demonic beast, that Fox Demon's offensive capabilities are relatively low, but it is skilled in illusion arts, making it difficult to capture]</p><p></p><p>[Reward: 5 taels of gold, 4 Jade Spirit Flowers, 100 Contribution Points]</p><p></p><p>Jade Spirit Flowers, Ye Wuyu had heard of them in the cultivation knowledge he had been hastily studying these past few days.</p><p></p><p>Jade Spirit Flowers do not greatly assist in cultivation, but they have decent nourishing effects on the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivators below the Third Realm do not cultivate their spiritual souls, and even those above the Third Realm do not necessarily specialize in spiritual soul cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this reward, while seeming decent, is somewhat mediocre.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about what he had previously done to Xia Anmeng...</p><p></p><p>Those two cultivation techniques he had given her were only because she had made a heart demon oath, which she could not violate...</p><p></p><p>If they were to meet again, Ye Wuyu could imagine the crazed expression on that woman's face.</p><p></p><p>If she had a physical body, she would probably want to pin him down and tear him apart.</p><p></p><p>And Luo Caiwei, that girl, had been on the eighth layer of the Heavenly Prison for so many days, her spiritual soul must have also suffered damage, otherwise, he wouldn't have had to split his soul to save her.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Wuyu had firmly decided to live off others' generosity, if he could enjoy the soft life while also gaining some benefits, that wouldn't be too bad.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he'll take on this mission.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

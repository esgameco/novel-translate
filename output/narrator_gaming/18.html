        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Spring peach, summer pear, autumn melon, winter jujube... How disrespectful to the elderly."</p><p></p><p>While sighing about the declining morals of the world, he wolfed down the food that belonged to him alone. The filling of the food brought a slight sense of contentment to Ye Wuyu's heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was the only one still cultivating his physical body in the entire manor.</p><p></p><p>The rest were all cultivators who had reached a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>For those cultivating their physical body, in addition to the external medicinal baths, they also needed to supplement a large amount of blood food.</p><p></p><p>That's why he came to work at the Heavenly Prison in the first place.</p><p></p><p>With a lamb leg in one hand and a pig trotter in the other, Ye Wuyu felt a bit thirsty, so he picked up the supposedly spring peach-infused medicinal wine and took a sip.</p><p></p><p>The pungent taste went down his throat, but it just right relieved some of the greasiness.</p><p></p><p>Satisfying.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Wuyu was about to continue his hearty meal, his gaze suddenly froze as he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>Since both his hands were holding food, how was he drinking the wine?</p><p></p><p>He focused his gaze and stared at the wine glass floating in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, in the void, Ye Wuyu saw a third hand.</p><p></p><p>A bluish-gray arm, with somewhat dried skin and sharp claws at the fingertips, was now holding the wine glass for him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's mouth twitched, and the unpleasant memories from the Heavenly Prison resurfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Did I eat it... Did I eat this strange, or rather, this remnant of the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had originally thought that "eating" simply meant destroying the other party in a literal sense.</p><p></p><p>But now, the scene unfolding on his own body made him have to ponder the connection between them.</p><p></p><p>Did he become strange? Or rather, did he acquire the abilities of that strange being? [Devouring the remnant of a Dao is no difficult task, let alone just a remnant. Even if it was a true Dao of the past, you could easily consume and make it your own.]</p><p></p><p>The dog's monologue commentary surprisingly proved to be somewhat useful.</p><p></p><p>That strange being... Could it be used by me? Thinking about this, Ye Wuyu's mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>The second hand, the third hand, the fourth hand... </p><p></p><p>They gradually extended out from his chest, but without causing any damage to his skin or clothes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu tried to control them, and these ghostly hands seemed to obey his will, being manipulated freely, and even... extremely dexterous.</p><p></p><p>Just like hands that had grown on his own body... Although they were indeed now a part of his body.</p><p></p><p>Not only from his chest, but these strange hands could also extend out from any part of his body, any part.</p><p></p><p>As for the number, it was linked to the strength.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu walked out of the room, glanced around to ensure no one was there, and then went to a corner of the courtyard, where a stone lock was piled up.</p><p></p><p>The stone lock was already a bit dusty, obviously this thing prepared for the Tempering Body cultivators had not been used for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He first manifested one ghostly hand, and the 100-kilogram stone lock was easily lifted.</p><p></p><p>Then, divide it further.</p><p></p><p>Dividing it until ten ghostly hands appeared simultaneously, the strength of each individual hand gradually became somewhat weak, unable to lift the lock.</p><p></p><p>"I can continue to divide the ghostly hands, but the strength of each individual hand will gradually return to that of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Looks weaker than that monster in the prison cell before, but strength is not the key..."</p><p></p><p>Strength is not the key.</p><p></p><p>Invisibility, near-absolute concealment, that is the key.</p><p></p><p>Imagine, if two cultivators of the same realm were to fight, one's attacks could be seen, while the other's "techniques" could not be observed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu knew little about cultivation, and was unsure if there were any methods for Tempering the Body in this world, but at least for now... <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>without discussing the Intermediate Realm, just the Lower Realm and below.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They all took the path of high offense and low defense.</p><p></p><p>A sudden and unexpected sneak attack often works better than painstaking efforts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stared at his ghostly hand for a long time, finally retracting it back into his body with a thought.</p><p></p><p>While gaining this unexpected power certainly delighted him, he still felt a vague sense of unease about it.</p><p></p><p>Can one tame the bizarre?</p><p></p><p>Or rather, what were these so-called bizarre or remnants of the great dao monsters originally?</p><p></p><p>"Young Master," a soft call interrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>It was Qiugu hurrying over with a plate of melons, her steps and the melons on the plate all trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master has been cultivating so diligently, I'm sure it won't be long before you succeed in tempering your body. Here, have a melon first."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu retracted his uncontrolled gaze and silently picked up a melon from the plate, slowly chewing on it.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Qiugu asked, looking up at him with a beaming smile.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Ye Wuyu gave a thumbs up.</p><p></p><p>"Crisp, refreshing, and juicy."</p><p></p><p>He had been living in this small courtyard for half a month now, and his body tempering practice was nearing its end.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was with the aid of a vast array of medicinal materials and precious ingredients that Ye Wuyu could not have afforded before.</p><p></p><p>Body tempering, the starting point of cultivation, naturally would not be too difficult as long as one was willing to spend. Even a pig could temper its body with enough resources.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe had not shown up again after that first time, and Ye Wuyu had also become quite familiar with the other four.</p><p></p><p>He then learned that apart from Chuntao, the rest were not Zhao Changhe's disciples, and even Chuntao was only a half-disciple.</p><p></p><p>These four were the jailer's maids, sent to take care of him.</p><p></p><p>"The Jailer Lord is often busy, sometimes not returning to the manor for ten days or half a month. We were idle anyway, and that Zhao fellow's temper is too volatile to take care of the Young Master..."</p><p></p><p>Recalling the appearance of that middle-aged Confucian scholar that day, as well as the conversation with his "former self", Ye Wuyu couldn't help but wonder.</p><p></p><p>His former self had been arrogant, only to be slapped in the face by the other party the next moment - a classic villain trope.</p><p></p><p>And the other party seemed to be able to see the "bizarre" as well.</p><p></p><p>So did he realize that I had swallowed that "ghost", and that's why he's taking care of me? Or is this not care, but rather surveillance?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze swept over Qiugu as he casually asked, "Qiugu, you're also at the Second Realm. What cultivation method are you practicing?"</p><p></p><p>Qiugu, who was hugging and eating the melons, paused for a moment, then said with a beaming smile, "I'm cultivating formations... Young Master, why are you suddenly asking about this? Could it be that you're interested in me? But that won't do, I'm the Jailer Lord's maid, you know."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu coughed lightly. "Just curious, like Chuntao. She's already a Second Realm physician, but she's still learning from old man Zhao. Doesn't the Jailer Lord teach you?"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't have a very good impression of the Jailer Lord who had sent him flying with a single punch, his strength was undeniable. In this case, why would they still be learning from Zhao Changhe?</p><p></p><p>As the words left his mouth, a fleeting look of melancholy passed over Qiugu's smiling face.</p><p></p><p>"The things the Jailer Lord learns... we can't learn them."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu blinked, sensing the atmosphere had turned awkward, and didn't pursue the topic further.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt the phrase "can't learn" did not apply to him. With the "Formless Heart Sutra" in hand, the best techniques in the world would always be those in someone else's possession!</p><p></p><p>Qiugu left, carrying the heavy melons. But just as she reached the courtyard gate, she turned back with a slightly coy smile.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, if you have your eye on someone, you can always talk to the Jailer Lord about it later."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

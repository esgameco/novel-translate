        <h1>Chapter 36</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why are you asking this? Are you a lunatic to even think of such things?" The man in the brocade robe was very disdainful and had no intention of paying attention.</p><p></p><p>"You're the idiot, I'm a lunatic but not a fool," Ye Wuyou responded angrily.</p><p></p><p>The words that came from Ye Wuyou's mouth made the man in the brocade robe's eyes darken, and he was just about to give the other party a taste of his own medicine, but then he hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Yes, why was he the only one unaffected?</p><p></p><p>Was he gifted?</p><p></p><p>Was he the child of fortune?</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression became unsettled for a moment, but soon he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, the fact that I'm unaffected must be because I'm the chosen one among thousands, and now I've found the scent of the sect's most precious treasure. How can you guys compare to me? Ye Wuyou didn't look at him, just staring out the window at the sky, muttering a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"The wolf has come."</p><p></p><p>Wolf? What wolf has come?</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe was just about to ask what he meant, but suddenly, a crisp bell sound reached his ears.</p><p></p><p>Ding-a-ling...</p><p></p><p>The bell sound was as if it was engraved directly into his brain.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." The man in the brocade robe was just about to speak, but his gaze suddenly paused, and then his expression became blank.</p><p></p><p>His face turned deathly pale, and the rise and fall of his chest, which had been there before, now fell silent, and his breathing even stopped.</p><p></p><p>Like a dead person.</p><p></p><p>But he... perhaps he had already been dead.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the man in the brocade robe moved.</p><p></p><p>His eyes, now only a pale white, were staring fixedly at Ye Wuyou, and a wisp of aura was emanating from his body.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of a Sanxing cultivator instantly spread throughout the small room.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, his body twisted at the waist, making a creaking sound like the friction of tendons and flesh.</p><p></p><p>Bang.</p><p></p><p>Like a broken bowstring, the man in the brocade robe's body did a 360-degree flip, and his upper body was twisted away by a huge force.</p><p></p><p>The Sanxing cultivator now lay on the ground, as quiet as a dead dog.</p><p></p><p>A huge, faintly blue hand that was invisible to the naked eye slowly withdrew from his body and then entered the body of the dazed Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>There was a hint of fear in Ye Wuyou's eyes, and he muttered a few words.</p><p></p><p>"I killed someone, I killed someone."</p><p></p><p>But his body obediently walked over to the corpse of the man in the brocade robe, and while wailing in pain, he skillfully felt around the man's body.</p><p></p><p>"I'm really sorry, I really didn't want to kill you, the whole village only thought I was a lunatic... but you were so fierce, it looked like you were going to slaughter me." Ye Wuyou cried as he felt around.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be offended, I didn't mean to, but my hands are out of control, why is this habit engraved in my mind, why do I have to come and touch your corpse..." Ye Wuyou didn't understand why he had to kill and touch the corpse.</p><p></p><p>But he felt that this action was as natural as eating and drinking, something he had to do.</p><p></p><p>"No, you're dressed so luxuriously, why are you so poor? Wuwu." Ye Wuyou was now heartbroken and very sad.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Wuyou found nothing on him, and sadly stood up, looking at the jade pendant on the man's waist, grabbing it down.</p><p></p><p>This jade pendant was all he got.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou looked around, then opened the drawer on the table and threw the jade pendant in.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, hehe, another one, this jade pendant must be a treasure."</p><p></p><p>Then he turned around and squatted down, struggling to drag the man's body out of the room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was not worried about being seen.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the others were all sleeping soundly, no matter how much they were called.</p><p></p><p>He had to get rid of the body, he couldn't let anyone know he had killed someone.</p><p></p><p>The night wind blew, and the half-open door of the room creaked.</p><p></p><p>In the drawer that Ye Wuyou had just opened, the jade pendant he had thrown in was there.</p><p></p><p>But at this point, it was no longer clear which one was the real one.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was just now.</p><p></p><p>In the drawer, there were seven identical jade pendants arranged.</p><p></p><p>... "Today is Christmas Eve!" </p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou stood at the east entrance of the village, raising his arms and shouting, as if he was announcing something extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The other people were already used to it and completely ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu came out from the opposite door, holding a basin of clothes. As soon as she came out, she saw Ye Wuyou standing in the middle of the road.</p><p></p><p>She looked at him vigilantly, and seeing that he was just standing there raving, she heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu reached back and rubbed the spot that was still a little sore.</p><p></p><p>A hint of shyness and anger appeared on the woman's face, but then she thought about it and turned back, pressing against the wall, only showing her front to the other party, and left sideways.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou squatted on the ground, looking at Bai Lu's retreating back, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"One, two, three... Finally saw clearly, it's three tails."</p><p></p><p>"Eh, the tails disappeared again, did I see it wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou rubbed his eyes and then fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>He was pondering a very important question.</p><p></p><p>"Why do people have tails?"</p><p></p><p>"The three tails are growing from the butt, how are they growing?"</p><p></p><p>"Do they grow out of the skin? Or are they inserted somewhere?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was completely puzzled, then he touched his head and looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Will that wealthy man in the brocade robe come today? Although he never remembers me... but if he doesn't come, who will keep me company?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou, who had stayed up all night, finally couldn't hold on any longer and fell into a deep sleep in the middle of the east entrance road.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou didn't know how long he had slept.</p><p></p><p>But the disputes and roars around him were what woke him up.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What happened?" Ye Wuyou rubbed his eyes and got up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Not far away, the man in the brocade robe was grabbing Tu Su, asking him something fiercely.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had clearly gotten into an argument.</p><p></p><p>"Tu Su, snap out of it, raising chickens and ducks every day, do you really think you're a villager?"</p><p></p><p>"You... what are you talking about, I don't even know you."</p><p></p><p>The frightened and angry Tu Su was being held by the other party, whose strength was surprisingly great, and just the sight of his gaze made Tu Su feel like he couldn't breathe.</p><p></p><p>"You don't know me? Haha, you know, I've been observing you for three days."</p><p></p><p>"If you were just a villager and didn't notice anything, that would be fine. But why, why?"</p><p></p><p>"Would you take a chicken as your spiritual beast? Are you a pig?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe roared, then kicked Tu Su away.</p><p></p><p>Tu Su let out a muffled groan and passed out on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe snorted angrily, he really didn't understand. After all, Tu Su had once been his teammate, with lofty ambitions.</p><p></p><p>But now he had chosen a chicken as his spiritual beast, isn't that bullshit?</p><p></p><p>So, the one who had been secretly observing finally couldn't hold back and jumped out.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, daring to run wild in the village!"</p><p></p><p>A roar came from behind, and the burly Xu Fang threw a punch, sending the man in the brocade robe flying several meters away before he could even turn around.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... A second-realm cultivator, even without spiritual arts, your physical strength is so strong, I really underestimated you."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe wiped the corner of his mouth, then sneered.</p><p></p><p>Without seeing him do anything, Xu Fang's figure had already left the ground, crashing directly into the nearby house.</p><p></p><p>And the man in the brocade robe, who had caused all this, now had his hands on his head, his eyes filled with ferocity.</p><p></p><p>"I can't take it, I can't take it anymore, this village is going to drive me crazy!"</p><p></p><p>"Since I've already made a move, I might as well just slaughter this village again, I want to see what's so strange about this village!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

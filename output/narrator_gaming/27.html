        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Why is there smoke signal again? But our group right now doesn't even see a single person.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the other team of colleagues has already returned to the foot of the mountain..." Bai Changzai murmured.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, we came up from the foot of the mountain, if they went down, there should be at least some traces along the way, but we didn't find anything," Lin Qingqing denied.</p><p></p><p>Looking around again, there is no trace of anything, not even footprints.</p><p></p><p>Even the small box that lit the smoke signal is nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, where are the people? Could it be that the smoke signal was lit by ghosts?" Xu Fang cursed angrily, but he had no solution.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as the team leader, Lin Qingqing also felt that her brain was not working well enough.</p><p></p><p>Their group saw the smoke signal and came here, but now they can't find any trace of people, and then they see the smoke signal lit at the village at the foot of the mountain again.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>Who lit the smoke signal at the foot of the mountain? And who exactly are they trying to rescue?</p><p></p><p>Her gaze swept across the people around her, trying to seek some help.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang, his mind has become rigid from cultivating his body, discussing with him will only lead them astray.</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai... forget it, he could barely speak normally just now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any ideas?" Lin Qingqing asked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Wuyu was squatting beside, chewing on a weed, his expression very calm.</p><p></p><p>"Ideas? Either we go back the way we came, or we try to wait here and see if another team will come up and find us in half an hour," Ye Wuyu smiled.</p><p></p><p>This situation, Ye Wuyu is a bit familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Loop?</p><p></p><p>That day in the prison, he had also fallen into a loop.</p><p></p><p>Only, that time it was a loop of distance.</p><p></p><p>But now it's not the same.</p><p></p><p>Their group came up the mountain and arrived here, which took about half an hour.</p><p></p><p>If we exclude the possibility of a prank by other colleagues, then the only explanation is that half an hour ago, their past selves saw the smoke signal they lit, and then as they came up the mountain, a new version of themselves appeared at the foot of the mountain and saw the smoke signal they lit.</p><p></p><p>A loop in time? "Wait, do you mean there might be another team coming? The problem is, there can't be anyone else, right?" Lin Qingqing's brain was obviously not working well enough.</p><p></p><p>"Of course there won't be anyone else, if someone does come, it can only be us, do you understand?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu tried to explain, but seeing the still clear and stupid look in her eyes, he gave up.</p><p></p><p>She, born and raised here, cannot understand the concept of a time loop.</p><p></p><p>A loop... Wasn't I here to catch the fox demon?</p><p></p><p>Is this a divine power? Or... something sinister? But Ye Wuyu soon excluded one thing.</p><p></p><p>If it's something sinister, then the dog narrator should have been barking all the way, saying something about the remnants of the great Dao being fragile.</p><p></p><p>Huh? Where's the narrator? Ye Wuyu suddenly woke up, not knowing when the dog narrator had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This is not right!</p><p></p><p>In the past, the dog narrator would even bark at the sight of maggots by the roadside.</p><p></p><p>The narrator is gone! Ye Wuyu suddenly stretched out his hand and waved it, his expression becoming a bit gloomy.</p><p></p><p>His own "ghostly" anomaly is also gone.</p><p></p><p>Is it the influence of other anomalies? If it's an anomaly, it shouldn't be able to affect the dog narrator's barking.</p><p></p><p>Even when there were so many monsters imprisoned in the prison back then, the narrator could still keep barking.</p><p></p><p>And anomalies are inherently corrosive, but right now the other three people's minds are very clear, and there is nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, do you guys feel like there's something different about yourselves?" Ye Wuyu suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"What could be different?" Xu Fang's words were a bit disdainful.</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai did hear Ye Wuyu's words and carefully checked himself, but there was nothing different.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyu, did you discover something?" Lin Qingqing asked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's mind was in a frenzy of thought.</p><p></p><p>Aside from his own narration and the mysterious disappearance, no one else was affected in any way.</p><p></p><p>What was the difference between himself and the other three? Soon, an idea emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This is an illusion." An illusion? Ye Wuyu's statement made the other three ponder for a while, but soon Lin Qingqing frowned and said:</p><p></p><p>"An illusion, I have thought of this possibility before... but as a formation master, I have some understanding of illusions."</p><p></p><p>"The more sophisticated the illusory technique, the more it is like a formation - it cannot be easily deployed with a wave of the hand... But if this was an illusion created by that demonic fox, it could not have covered our entire journey."</p><p></p><p>"And the things within the illusion are false, but... I can't describe it, but I can be certain that we who are standing here, as well as the surrounding scenery, are all real."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing's thoughts were simple and direct.</p><p></p><p>The fact that she could now stand here with a clear mind and even ponder whether this was an illusion already ruled out the possibility of it being an illusion to a large extent.</p><p></p><p>The main thing is... everything around them was too normal.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu couldn't explain it to them.</p><p></p><p>With only a rough understanding of cultivation knowledge, he didn't know anything about the so-called illusory techniques.</p><p></p><p>But this feeling was like having a group chat where someone was constantly spouting nonsense 24/7, and then one day, the group was completely silent.</p><p></p><p>Or like having a Gir that could freely expand and contract, and then one day you wake up to find it's gone, and you can't call it out anymore.</p><p></p><p>In that case, it must be a problem with the world.</p><p></p><p>Absolutely not a problem with me!</p><p></p><p>If Ye Wuyu didn't have that "ghost" in his body and the narration as a reference, he would also be like them, not doubting the existence of any illusion at all.</p><p></p><p>It was too real, too real, so real that there was nothing to doubt.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu gently closed his eyes, and the urgent task was to break free from this illusion.</p><p></p><p>How to break free?</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyu's tightly closed eyes, a hint of hesitation flashed, but it quickly turned into determination.</p><p></p><p>Even if his mind and spirit might not be under his control, he had to escape the predicament first.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" was silently circulating within his body.</p><p></p><p>The first realm - the realm of no-self.</p><p></p><p>All extraneous thoughts instantly dissipated, and the surrounding complexity disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The cloudy mountains in the dark night seemed to have become even darker.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Cloudy Mountains, the village had now turned into a living hell.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe had gone berserk, his cultivation at the third realm surging forth, his movements like a rampaging dragon, leaving a trail of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you bitch, you made me suffer so much!"</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that right, Shimu!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe cursed at the empty space in front of him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side,</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!!!"</p><p></p><p>"For thirty years the river flowed east, and for thirty years it flowed west. Today, I will kill my way into your Yuzhou Sect and reclaim what is rightfully mine."</p><p></p><p>"You, worthy of being my fianc√©e?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the plain clothes was no different from the one in the brocade robe, recklessly venting his anger at the empty space before him.</p><p></p><p>As if the people they hated the most were standing in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Only the woman from the Hehe Sect stood quietly on the eaves, her gaze calmly observing the scene below.</p><p></p><p>The moonlight shone on her, making her look beautiful.</p><p></p><p>In her hand was a blood-stained white fox tail.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful illusion... but useless against me."</p><p></p><p>White Dew casually threw the blood-stained fox tail away, and her gaze never again fell upon the two men below.</p><p></p><p>"I let you get away again, sister."</p><p></p><p>In the reflection of the woman in the moonlight, there were several illusory fox tails.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

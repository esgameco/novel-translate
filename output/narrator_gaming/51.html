        <h1>Chapter 51</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's expression was calm.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" Ye Wuyou frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The Twelve Divine Dao Arts, the one hidden beneath the Celestial Prison, what is written on it is the ability to create an existence that is completely identical to the caster."</p><p></p><p>"He will have all of your memories, even the same realm of cultivation, the same appearance and physique. Of course, the bizarre things about you, he will not possess."</p><p></p><p>"In other words, he is completely the same as you, but without the bizarre affliction."</p><p></p><p>"This is a clone?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou still didn't quite understand, this Divine Dao Art sounded rather flawed.</p><p></p><p>"A clone? " Lü Qingshan shook his head slightly, speaking in a calm tone, "Even a clone art at the Sixth Realm and above cannot create an existence that is completely identical in realm and power."</p><p></p><p>"You have only just begun your cultivation journey, not even a month has passed. Your current realm's progress is considered fast, but it is still too low.</p><p></p><p>You may not be able to comprehend it, but if the mythical Ninth Realm truly exists in this world, one who can comprehend this Divine Dao Art can instantly create another existence with the exact same power."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou nodded, if viewed in that way, this Divine Dao Art does seem quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Then how can this Divine Dao Art solve the problem with my body?"</p><p></p><p>"The moment you cultivate the Divine Dao Art, the problem will be solved."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was first taken aback, then his pupils suddenly constricted.</p><p></p><p>"Are you saying... to let the clone replace me and live on, while letting the bizarre affliction ravage my true self?"</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan shook his head, "No, that is not a clone. A clone cannot do that. It will be you, completely and utterly you. He will have all your memories and cognition, mastering everything you know..."</p><p></p><p>"That won't work either." Ye Wuyou suddenly slammed the table, his eyes looking troubled.</p><p></p><p>A trace of surprise flashed across Lü Qingshan's calm countenance, he did not expect Ye Wuyou to react so strongly. His eyes revealed a contemplative look, and he remained silent for the moment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou took a deep breath, then patted his own forehead, his expression somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>But this daze quickly turned into a wry smile, as if he had finally figured something out.</p><p></p><p>Unrelated to this world, what Lü Qingshan said was correct in Ye Wuyou's previous understanding.</p><p></p><p>Humans, after all, are just biological beings composed of memories and flesh, why bother with other things.</p><p></p><p>But now that this choice was presented before him, Ye Wuyou felt it was different, very different.</p><p></p><p>Overturning his own cognition made Ye Wuyou a bit agitated, but now that he had calmed down, he spoke quite candidly.</p><p></p><p>"This method is not suitable, find another one."</p><p></p><p>He was now speaking to Lü Qingshan rather casually, although the other's cultivation was profound and his status was high, he was ultimately just an old man who liked to look at illustrations.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan was not surprised by Ye Wuyou's response. He pondered for a moment and said,</p><p></p><p>"Then the only option left is the Divine Dao Art in the capital. Coincidentally, that is also the one I cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me like that, the Divine Dao Art cannot be taught, you can only go to the Divine Pillar and comprehend it yourself. But whether you can succeed or not depends entirely on your karmic fortune."</p><p></p><p>"What if I cannot comprehend it?" Ye Wuyou asked casually.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan pointed to Ye Wuyou's left arm and said, "Earlier I said the bizarre affliction is formless and intangible, you must be curious about what you've seen. The bizarre affliction you've witnessed, although its shapes are strange and varied, it does have a physical form after all."</p><p></p><p>"You should have seen that man without feet, I once helped him, but unfortunately, his karmic fortune was a bit lacking."</p><p></p><p>The man without feet, he used to be a human? He was eventually consumed by the bizarre affliction and ended up in that state?</p><p></p><p>A hint of gloom flashed through Ye Wuyou's eyes, but it quickly dissipated, replaced by determination.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Dao Art cannot be taught? Ye Wuyou didn't think there was anything wrong with that statement, but he certainly didn't intend to just accept it.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Believing that he had to go to the capital city in order to learn. With the "Formless Heart Sutra" in hand, he considered himself a dark imitator, copying all the martial arts techniques under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu felt it would be better to ask first, because after careful consideration, he always felt that these techniques were not quite normal.</p><p></p><p>"What is this Heavenly Divination technique in the capital city?"</p><p></p><p>"Tianyan, a simple method of divination and calculation."</p><p></p><p>Tianyan? </p><p></p><p>Looking at Lu Qingshan's casual, indifferent smile, Ye Wuyu felt the name was not simple.</p><p></p><p>"Could you demonstrate this technique, so that I may observe and gain some understanding in advance?" Ye Wuyu asked sincerely.</p><p></p><p>His idea was simple - have Lu Qingshan demonstrate the Tianyan technique, then he could directly copy from the "Formless Heart Sutra". </p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't openly state this. Apart from this useless sidekick, the "Formless Heart Sutra" was his biggest secret.</p><p></p><p>Once he mastered this technique, he could then go find Zhao Changhe and become his apprentice, and thereafter enjoy a carefree life of music and wine.</p><p></p><p>But this wouldn't do, after all, Zhao Changhe was still under Lu Qingshan...</p><p></p><p>But what Ye Wuyu didn't expect was that after hearing his words, Lu Qingshan remained seated without moving, but instead quietly looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Under that somewhat gloomy gaze, Ye Wuyu felt inexplicably strange. </p><p></p><p>This feeling of being seen through everything made him very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan finally responded, standing up to reply.</p><p></p><p>"That works."</p><p></p><p>"However, the Tianyan technique is useless for you to just observe. It would be better for you to participate in person, perhaps then you could gain some understanding."</p><p></p><p>Participate? </p><p></p><p>What am I supposed to participate in? Hand him the brush holder?</p><p></p><p>"No, I just want to see how it's performed..." Ye Wuyu explained.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Qingshan paid no attention to his words, and instead took a small object from the bookshelf nearby.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu saw clearly that it was an hourglass.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan flipped the hourglass over and hung it on himself.</p><p></p><p>He turned around and smiled at Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"This hourglass is set for two quarters of an hour. You have one quarter of an hour to prepare."</p><p></p><p>"Prepare for what?" Ye Wuyu was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"To escape."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the bustling streets of Tianlan City, Ye Wuyu's figure aimlessly darted through the crowd.</p><p></p><p>His mind was still echoing with Lu Qingshan's previous words:</p><p></p><p>"One quarter of an hour, if you can escape from me, I will grant you a condition."</p><p></p><p>"You have three chances."</p><p></p><p>It was absurd.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu couldn't stop it.</p><p></p><p>Because he could feel that the other party was simply acting on a whim.</p><p></p><p>Although it was somewhat inexplicable, being caught three times in one quarter of an hour was too humiliating.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu quickened his pace, turning one street after another, then retreating a few steps and taking another alley.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know where he was going, he was just wandering aimlessly.</p><p></p><p>Tianyan, divination, is it? </p><p></p><p>You want to divine my whereabouts? I don't even know where I'm going, how can you divine it? The crowd around him was bustling, Ye Wuyu scanned the area, but there was nothing unusual.</p><p></p><p>Passing a street stall, the fragrant steamed dumplings had just been served.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at them unintentionally.</p><p></p><p>He saw the middle-aged scholar sitting at the stall, eating the dumplings.</p><p></p><p>The dumplings had already been served, so the scholar had been sitting there for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Would you like to have a bowl?" the scholar smiled.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression darkened as he turned and left without a word.</p><p></p><p>"First time." Lu Qingshan murmured, then continued eating the dumplings in his bowl.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

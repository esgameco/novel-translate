        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He handed Ye Wuyou a jade pendant, which was the key to getting out of the fifth layer of the celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever you want to learn, he can teach you." These were the words left behind by Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing her emotions, Ye Wuyou opened the door and walked into the prison.</p><p></p><p>The locks were useless, at least for the existence of this layer, as the greater restraints came from the various silver needles and specially made chains on them.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing unusual in the prison, and the red-haired man was also sitting quietly on the bed, indifferent to Ye Wuyou's approach.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the other party's calm demeanor, Ye Wuyou simply took the initiative to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Fang, I am Ye Wuyou, and I..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted by the man.</p><p></p><p>"Want to learn something?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou silently nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the wine and meat?" Fang Cunshan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" Ye Wuyou looked at him, but saw the other's serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Where's the wine and meat?" The same words were repeated.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the prison, Ye Wuyou didn't know why, but a nameless resentment arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't bring any wine or meat," he answered directly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Cunshan laughed, revealing his white teeth on his blood-stained face.</p><p></p><p>"No wine and meat? Then get the hell out of here," he said word by word.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Wuyou only felt his vision turn a bloody red, as if the surroundings had turned into a crimson mist, which then surged towards him like waves, and everything around him slowly rotated.</p><p></p><p>While he was at the center of the vortex.</p><p></p><p>His right eye emitted a strange light, and Ye Wuyou's figure trembled slightly, but soon regained his composure.</p><p></p><p>The red mist that ordinary people could not perceive was now slowly contracting and gathering around the red-haired man.</p><p></p><p>What had just disturbed his mind was not an illusion, nor anything strange, and it had nothing to do with his cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>It was like a solidified aura of evil and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Fang Cunshan sat on the bed, his cloudy eyes slightly less so, squinting as he eyed the young man in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, the fact that Ye Wuyou could regain his senses from that situation surprised him a bit.</p><p></p><p>But he's just at the first realm...</p><p></p><p>It's a bit interesting.</p><p></p><p>He was about to ask something, but saw the other had already walked out of the prison cell, and then didn't forget to close the door, his figure disappearing in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Leaving?</p><p></p><p>A trace of confusion and surprise appeared on Fang Cunshan's somewhat ferocious face.</p><p></p><p>He just left? What an unaccomplished thing, that old man Zhao Changhe must have misjudged.</p><p></p><p>He closed his eyes, and the fifth layer of the celestial prison fell into a strange silence again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou walked out layer by layer, and since Zhao Changhe had made arrangements, no one stopped him.</p><p></p><p>He gently touched his right eye, his eyes first pensive, but then slightly angry.</p><p></p><p>From the strange things in the celestial prison, to the fox spirit, the bell, and now this red-haired man, these people... how is it that every time something comes up, they have to disturb his mind?</p><p></p><p>Am I a public bus that anyone can just get on? But perhaps because he has been "boarded" too many times, and with his right eye, Ye Wuyou now has a certain resistance to the invasion of the mind.</p><p></p><p>Or is it just numbness? Ye Wuyou shook his head, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>This person named Fang Cunshan, Ye Wuyou will definitely go find him again, but not today.</p><p></p><p>Today, there are other things to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Walking to the first layer, Ye Wuyou glanced around, but didn't see Uncle Wang.</p><p></p><p>However, there was a note left for him.</p><p></p><p>"The captain is back, I'll introduce you, we've already gotten the things and will divide them later, come have dinner at the Fuman Restaurant."</p><p></p><p>Captain?</p><p></p><p>What do I care about your captain? Ye Wuyou just remembered that Lin Qingqing's trio originally had one more person, who was not there before, otherwise he wouldn't have joined.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he had no interest in their captain.</p><p></p><p>Others have fixed teams, and in the future, there will definitely be no shortage of people to do missions, and his hidden abilities, although many, are only at the first realm, so he will definitely be the one optimized out.</p><p></p><p>"Well, go have dinner, get the Jade Spirit Flower, and then give it to Lu Caiwi, it's also a way to make up for the previous incident with Xia Anmeng."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Flower can restore the spirit, and no matter what, although previously it was for the sake of survival, but by devouring the other's six-tenths of the soul force, causing the other to almost dissipate from the world, it was still somewhat wrong.</p><p></p><p>A private room at the Fuman Restaurant.</p><p></p><p>"Weiwei, you just take this Jade Spirit Flower, I've seen you searching for spiritual medicines to restore the soul, but now that you have it, you don't want it?" </p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing was currently hanging on Lu Caiwi's body, her face buried in the neck and shoulder, greedily sniffing the other's scent.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi sat upright in the main seat, her expression utterly cold, but she did not push away Lin Qingqing.</p><p></p><p>In her mind, she was still recalling the scene on the street just now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou and Lu Qingshan... one after the other went to that place...</p><p></p><p>She knew what that place was, and she also knew that it was normal for the man to go there...</p><p></p><p>But she was inexplicably unhappy.</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzhen's expression remained unchanged as he lightly sipped the tea in his hand and placed it down, saying indifferently, "Although the Jade Spirit Flower is beneficial to the spirit, we still..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the Intermediate Three Realm, it is indeed useless in our hands." Xu Fang sat opposite, the burly man looked at the two teammates and spoke at length, pausing for a moment, then said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm the same."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei looked at the scene in front of her, her eyes slightly lowered, and did not speak, but wrote a line with the paper and pen she was carrying.</p><p></p><p>"The task you just mentioned, there is still one more teammate who has not yet arrived, and you should all have a share in it."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing looked at the words on the paper, got up from Lu Caiwei, leaned on the table and frowned.</p><p></p><p>"But there are only three Jade Spirit Flowers, and it was we who fought for them, because that demonic fox only had a corpse left... The task is like this, the four of us are not enough to divide it."</p><p></p><p>"But he is only at the Realm One, his cultivation has not even touched the divine soul, and we can just supplement him with silver coins later." Bai Changzai proposed a solution.</p><p></p><p>"Old Bai is right." Xu Fang said.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei shook her head and wrote another line in her elegant handwriting.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until he arrives to discuss it, in case the other party also needs this item, we have no right to decide for him."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if it is the Jade Spirit Flower in your hands, I will pay silver coins to purchase it, rather than take it for free."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing was anxious, and lamented, "Why, Captain? Anyway, we can't use this Jade Spirit Flower, you've helped us so much before, oh Caiwei..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei shook her head, her expression cold and firm.</p><p></p><p>She spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>"If... if you keep doing this, I I I don't want it, not even one, not not not one."</p><p></p><p>The three were suddenly silent, when the captain spoke, it usually meant she was serious.</p><p></p><p>"Sit, sit well, someone will come soon... Let's see the joke."</p><p></p><p>The dishes were all served.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps were heard outside the door, and then Ye Wuyu pushed the door open.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the few people in the private room, finally resting on the woman sitting at the main seat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression changed slightly, but then the corner of his mouth curled up into a nice arc.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing was the first to greet him, standing in front of him, smiling brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyu, let's discuss something, there are only three Jade Spirit Flowers, so can you transfer your share to me? I'll pay you silver coins, please."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's response was resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible, I came to do this task just for this pot of vinegar... for this Jade Spirit Flower, how could I give it up."</p><p></p><p>Eh... Lin Qingqing was stunned, the situation was not the same as she had imagined.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, who actually resolved this task, they all knew in their hearts, at least the three of them didn't feel much involvement.</p><p></p><p>But the Jade Spirit Flower is also very important, the one in her hand is supposed to be for the captain, how could she hand it over?</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing lowered her head and thought for a moment, and soon made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>She snatched the Jade Spirit Flower from Xu Fang's hand, ignoring the other's astonished expression, and then handed it to Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this problem solved?</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing felt that she was really a genius.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing! You're really going to die! Why didn't you take the one in your hand!" Xu Fang roared.</p><p></p><p>"None of your business, cultivate the body not the brain, I'm just offering the flower, do you understand the meaning! Do you want to argue or fight? We didn't finish the last one yet, I'll accompany you!" Lin Qingqing retaliated fiercely.</p><p></p><p>A huge argument was about to erupt, but it was abruptly cut off.</p><p></p><p>Because their gaze was now focused on Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was holding the well-preserved Jade Spirit Flower in his hand, and then walked towards Lu Caiwei.</p><p></p><p>What is this guy going to do?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he finds our captain attractive and has ulterior motives?</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing, Xu Fang, and Bai Changzai all had strange smiles on their faces at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Hilarious, they had seen this kind of person many times before, even suddenly rushing out on the street, and even pretending to run into them.</p><p></p><p>But every time, Lu Caiwei had rejected them mercilessly.</p><p></p><p>No, not rejected, ignored.</p><p></p><p>Little Ye Ye, although you're not bad, but the captain is such a celestial being, she's still too far away for you...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't pay attention to the three's strange gazes, he just walked up to Lu Caiwei and then extended the Jade Spirit Flower in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Take it." He said in a flat tone, not allowing any refusal.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei slowly turned her head, looking up at him.</p><p></p><p>Their gazes crossed in the air.</p><p></p><p>But neither of them spoke again.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing's gaze was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang and Bai Changzai also froze in their seats.</p><p></p><p>What's wrong with their captain today? How could she even make eye contact with a stranger? In the past, she wouldn't even look at them.</p><p></p><p>Could it really be that there's something going on? But the next moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph."</p><p></p><p>Under Ye Wuyu's gaze, Lu Caiwei let out a light snort, then turned her head straight, no longer looking at him.</p><p></p><p>The beautiful raven hair of the young lady swayed slightly, Ye Wuyu coughed lightly, feeling the atmosphere was a bit strange, and slowly turned his gaze to the side.</p><p></p><p>Only to see three faces struggling to hold back their laughter.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Can you see it?" </p><p></p><p>The clear voice of the young girl rang out beside his ear.</p><p></p><p>Could she not see that thing? Was that sword strike just based on a feeling? Was it only the white jelly-like skin that she couldn't see, or were all the strange creatures inside the prison invisible to her?</p><p></p><p>Countless thoughts echoed in his mind, and Ye Wuyu was perhaps grateful for the first time that his unpleasant corporate career had trained his quick responses.</p><p></p><p>"See what?" he asked with a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the ability to see those creatures was unrelated to one's cultivation level? Was it because of the so-called "illusion" mentioned by the narrator that he could see them.</p><p></p><p>The young girl did not answer, but her gaze shifted from him to the dark corridor in the distance, then down to the corpse on the ground.</p><p></p><p>She walked over and pulled the long sword out of the ground.</p><p></p><p>Then she returned to Ye Wuyu's side, sat down, and closed her eyes to rest.</p><p></p><p>The aura around her no longer seemed sharp, the oppressive pressure that had bothered Ye Wuyu had disappeared, and she had returned to her cold demeanor.</p><p></p><p>The flickering candlelight cast a faint glow on the two of them, their shadows dancing on the nearby wall.</p><p></p><p>For once, the chaotic narration in his mind did not interrupt. Ye Wuyu thought for a moment and felt he should be the one to start the conversation.</p><p></p><p>"The body on the ground, was he my former colleague... Was he just controlled by something?" Ye Wuyu asked at the appropriate time.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, he needed to find out what exactly was being held in this prison.</p><p></p><p>After all, even though he had the memories of the original owner, he was still not very familiar with this prison.</p><p></p><p>The eight layers of the prison, in the past he had at most only heard about the second layer, where criminals were held, though not lacking in the ruthless and vicious, they seemed a bit lacking compared to this layer.</p><p></p><p>The young girl rested for a while before slowly opening her eyes, a hint of fatigue visible in her gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Ominous... Ominous." </p><p></p><p>Her speech was a bit stuttered again...</p><p></p><p>Was it only when she was killing and wielding the sword that she didn't stutter?</p><p></p><p>From the young girl's response, Ye Wuyu now knew that the creatures were called "ominous" by her.</p><p></p><p>And the narrator called them the "remnants of the Dao".</p><p></p><p>However,</p><p></p><p>"What are these ominous things?" Ye Wuyu still did not understand.</p><p></p><p>"I... I don't know, they've always been here, my master said so," the young girl replied.</p><p></p><p>The young girl's answer was not entirely unhelpful to Ye Wuyu, at least he knew that these creatures called "ominous" had existed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Then, do we have any way to get out of here now?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl's gaze seemed hesitant, as if she was unsure whether she should speak.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's heart sank as he watched this scene.</p><p></p><p>The young girl did not speak, but instead began to draw a grid of simple lines on the ground with the tip of her sword.</p><p></p><p>On the first two layers, she marked a "ding".</p><p></p><p>On the third, fourth, and fifth layers, she marked "bing" and "yi".</p><p></p><p>On the sixth and seventh layers, she marked "jia" and "yi".</p><p></p><p>Four levels.</p><p></p><p>So even the "jia" level guards could only patrol up to the seventh layer?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't know this before, not even the powerful "jia" level experts had he seen.</p><p></p><p>Then there was one more layer?</p><p></p><p>The young girl's sword paused for a moment, then wrote the three characters "Warden" on the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>Oh, no wonder it's the last layer, only the Warden can enter. The ones held there must be really powerful.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...</p><p></p><p>I remember during the prison riot, the Warden was not present, otherwise he wouldn't have temporarily drafted the "ding" level personnel to the front lines...</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be that bad, right? Haha." Ye Wuyu looked at the young girl and forced a smile.</p><p></p><p>The young girl extended her finger, pointing expressionlessly at Ye Wuyu and herself, then tapped the eighth layer with her sword tip.</p><p></p><p>Okay, okay, so that's how it is.</p><p></p><p>[Haha, you who feel manipulated by fate, turn and look at the back wall, where there are strange and wonderful patterns. This is the end of the passage, but could it be the exit to the eighth layer?]</p><p></p><p>Good, the annoying narrator finally provided some useful environmental information.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu dragged his weary body up and leaned against the stone wall behind him.</p><p></p><p>In the dim candlelight, if not for pressing against the wall, one would not be able to see the strange symbols and incomprehensible patterns carved into it.</p><p></p><p>Is this really the exit? Ye Wuyu's eyes lit up as he turned to look at the young girl, only to meet her gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think this is the way out?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>"Then is there a way to get out?"</p><p></p><p>The young girl did not answer, but instead picked up her sword and began writing on the ground again.</p><p></p><p>The meaning was simple, but Ye Wuyu's mood gradually cooled.</p><p></p><p>In the past, even outside the eighth layer prison, only the Warden could enter.</p><p></p><p>This was inside the prison, the patterns and symbols on the wall were formations, trapping the "ominous" creatures here. </p><p></p><p>At least, Ye Wuyu and the young girl could not open it now.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu still knocked on the stone wall a few times, but after hearing no response, he gave up the idea of learning from Andy.</p><p></p><p>Not only could they not dig through it, even if they could, they would probably starve to death here first.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he could sense her anxiety, so the young girl continued drawing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, the problem is not here... The situation inside the Celestial Prison has already been reported to the higher-ups, and the Warden is a great cultivator at the Fifth Realm, so he'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>A great cultivator at the Fifth Realm? Even the prison guards in the Celestial Prison have a certain level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The First Realm is the Hidden Element Realm, the Second Realm is the Penetrating Insight Realm, the Third Realm is the Jade Light Realm, the Fourth Realm is the Opening Yang Realm, and the Fifth Realm, it seems to be called the Jade Balance Realm? Only from the Third Realm and above can one be called a great cultivator.</p><p></p><p>As for himself... He got in through connections, a family business, and he hasn't even reached the First Realm, still in the Tempering Body stage below the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>Damn those with connections.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't continue brooding at the wall, but instead sat back down next to the other person and asked:</p><p></p><p>"The Warden is at the Fifth Realm? Then what about you, what realm are you at?"</p><p></p><p>"Th-Three... Third Realm."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu felt a bit ashamed.</p><p></p><p>The young girl in front of him looked to be only fifteen or sixteen years old? Yet her realm was much higher than his own.</p><p></p><p>People surpassing others can be so frustrating.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu thought for a moment, then took a deep breath and exhaled.</p><p></p><p>One must strive to make a name for oneself in this life.</p><p></p><p>He leaned back slightly and said:</p><p></p><p>"Your name."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?" The young girl was a bit surprised and confused, pausing for a moment before stammering out:</p><p></p><p>"Lu... Lu Caiwei."</p><p></p><p>"Is cultivation difficult? Any tips?"</p><p></p><p>"It depends on one's natural talent... and aptitude," the young girl said softly.</p><p></p><p>"You cultivated so quickly, is it because your aptitude is very good?"</p><p></p><p>"Or or or... perhaps, but but but I didn't cultivate quickly... That's why I was expelled from my clan."</p><p></p><p>Ah? Fifteen or sixteen years old, already at the Third Realm, and has been expelled from her clan?</p><p></p><p>This would make the fifty-year-old Uncle Wang, who is still at the First Realm, feel terrible. Ye Wuyu didn't understand, so he continued asking.</p><p></p><p>"Why were you expelled from your sect?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei hesitated for a while, not speaking again, but instead using the sword tip to carve words into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I advanced to the First Realm very quickly at first, but later I contracted a strange illness, and my inner qi dissipated for no reason, no matter how I cultivated, to no avail, wasting several years."</p><p></p><p>The sword tip paused in the young girl's carving, and for some reason, she furrowed her brow in apparent pain.</p><p></p><p>"Then what happened?"</p><p></p><p>"After leaving the clan... the illness got better, and I also joined the Celestial Prison."</p><p></p><p>Hearing such a tragic and winding experience, Ye Wuyu felt deeply inspired.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment, then turned and said:</p><p></p><p>"Can you take a look at my aptitude?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei hesitated for a moment, then carved:</p><p></p><p>"I can give you a rough idea, extend your hand."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Lu Caiwei also extended her hand.</p><p></p><p>The interlocked fingers scene Ye Wuyu had imagined did not appear, as the other party only lightly tapped his wrist, as if taking his pulse.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Ye Wuyu noticed that the other party's hand was slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>Why was her hand shaking? Parkinson's? And what was that shiny thing on her hand? Ye Wuyu looked up at the frowning Lu Caiwei, who looked like an old Chinese doctor taking a pulse, then at her slender fingers, and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Are you married?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah... No, no I'm not." Lu Caiwei was startled by this question.</p><p></p><p>"Then what's that ring on your finger?" Ye Wuyu pointed to the other party's ring finger.</p><p></p><p>"Decoration." Lu Caiwei's reply was strangely weak.</p><p></p><p>[Bullshit, this woman is talking nonsense!]</p><p></p><p>[No matter, it's just a broken soul-sealing ring, with the remnant soul of a Sixth Realm cultivator attached to it. Even if she's just a remnant soul, as long as she's still alive, you need not fear, you can easily make her play the flute, sing, play the zither, and compose music for you.]</p><p></p><p>The usual dog barking...</p><p></p><p>But this makes sense now.</p><p></p><p>A genius young girl at the start, then her cultivation mysteriously declined, causing her clan to mock and expel her, and then her realm skyrocketed...</p><p></p><p>Such a strong sense of déjà vu!</p><p></p><p>Ah... I should have realized it earlier! I have a system, and you also have a system, your system is better than mine! If only that ring was my own good fortune, it would be much more useful than just this dog barking!</p><p></p><p>The young girl's brow was furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu looked at her expression, feeling somewhat troubled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"How's my aptitude?"</p><p></p><p>"It's, it's alright." Lu Caiwei said softly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright" is what kind of answer? How is that any different from "so-so"?</p><p></p><p>"How does it compare to yours?" Ye Wuyu asked again, not giving up.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei paused, closed her eyes and opened them again, then raised her hand and gestured.</p><p></p><p>"It's, it's alright... Just, just a little bit behind."</p><p></p><p>A little bit?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was just about to speak when his gaze swept across the other party's cheeks.</p><p></p><p>The originally cool and calm eyes had now melted, shrouded in a layer of mist, and a clear tear slowly slid down the corner of her eye.</p><p></p><p>The young girl seemed to have zoned out for some reason.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was slightly taken aback, with a puzzled look on his face as he waved his hand in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you crying?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the dim light, the man lying on the bed let out a weak cry.</p><p></p><p>Through his blurred vision, he saw a figure in white approaching him, reaching out to gently pour a sweet liquid into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Am I still in the prison dungeon? How many days has it been?</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought crossed his mind, his vision gradually became clearer, the blurriness dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu suddenly sat up with a start, the abrupt movement causing the tea bowl in front of him to be knocked over, eliciting an annoyed complaint from the woman beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh dear, young master, I was kindly trying to give you some water to drink, and look at what you've done."</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry," he automatically replied, his gaze sweeping around the unfamiliar environment - a clean room with sunlight streaming in through the window.</p><p></p><p>"Where am I?" he murmured unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>The woman, who was crouching on the floor picking up the shattered tea bowl, replied impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"This is Lord Zhao's residence. Aren't you one of the prisoners from the dungeon? Don't tell me you don't know that."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu did not continue the conversation.</p><p></p><p>Lord Zhao? Who is that? I'm not familiar with him at all.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't I in the eighth level of the prison dungeon before, and then managed to escape into the cell, only to encounter a mysterious, stealthy azure-colored entity? </p><p></p><p>Did it consume me? Ye Wuyu suddenly pressed his hand to his forehead as the series of events unfolded in his mind like a movie.</p><p></p><p>Devouring Xia An's spiritual power, the strange dialogue with that entity, and then his escape from the cell...</p><p></p><p>Finally, the conversation with that prison warden.</p><p></p><p>Did I really fight with him? Ye Wuyu held his head, his gaze bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Is this really me?</p><p></p><p>But he was certain that it was indeed himself, as all these events were still vividly imprinted in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it felt like another person. </p><p></p><p>The personality, the way of thinking, the manner of speech - all had undergone a drastic change.</p><p></p><p>"I have entered the realm of the formless, seeking my true self."</p><p></p><p>His own words were still echoing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he had been more like the "him" described by the dog's inner monologue - arrogant to the extreme, utterly self-assured, and indifferent to everything.</p><p></p><p>The "Sutra of the Formless Heart"... What kind of cultivation technique is this, and why has it so unsettled his mind? Ye Wuyu felt a slight unease, with a hint of worry deep within.</p><p></p><p>If that prison warden had not appeared, what else might he have done? Would he have maintained that state of being?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu waved his hand, and his inner qi flowed weakly.</p><p></p><p>Despite having expected this, Ye Wuyu couldn't help but smile bitterly after a simple self-examination.</p><p></p><p>Without Xia An's spiritual power to support him, his cultivation level had returned to the starting point, with only a trace of residual qi remaining.</p><p></p><p>Still at the body-refining stage...</p><p></p><p>Oh right, Xia An and Lu Caiwei, what about them? "Oh, since you're awake now, let me tell you - a woman came to visit you a couple of days ago, but you were still unconscious, so she left something for you."</p><p></p><p>"Was her name Lu Caiwei?"</p><p></p><p>The woman, who had just finished cleaning up the broken tea bowl shards, leaned against the doorframe and replied.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, so her name is Lu Caiwei? Hehe, I didn't know that, but she's quite pretty." Ye Wuyu turned to look at her.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She was dressed quite simply, wearing just an ordinary white training outfit, the faded edges of which showed it was quite old, but it was very clean. Her hair was tied back in a neat, high ponytail, and her eyes were full of liveliness. At the moment, she was standing by the doorframe, her lips curled in a slight, amused smile.</p><p></p><p>The sunlight fell upon her, exuding vitality.</p><p></p><p>[After surviving great adversity, one must have good fortune to come. You miraculously escaped from that perilous celestial prison, which was the great adversity, and now this woman is your good fortune.]</p><p></p><p>[A mere woman, with a bed prepared in the room. At this moment, you should just scoop her up in your arms and shamelessly enjoy this gift.]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu quickly averted his gaze, silent for a moment, then gave himself a punch on the head.</p><p></p><p>"Woof, woof, woof!" This action startled the woman by the door, her voice trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Young master... Even if you had a falling out with Miss Lu, you shouldn't hurt yourself. Perhaps you should first look at what she left for you? Don't be hasty, let me go get it for you."</p><p></p><p>With that, the woman quickly ran off.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, she returned, handing Ye Wuyu two sealed books and a letter.</p><p></p><p>"Here, it's all here. I didn't look at anything. Besides these, there's also a pile of medicinal herbs that I left in the courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu nodded and thanked her, and the considerate woman then left the room, leaving him alone.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Ye Wuyu first opened the two books.</p><p></p><p>These were... cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>Two cultivation techniques that could cultivate one to the sixth realm, and clearly not the kind of cheap, mass-produced ones.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because Xia Anmeng knew that Ye Wuyu's spiritual sense was innately stronger than ordinary people, one of the techniques was specifically for cultivating the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>However, after a quick glance, Ye Wuyu simply tossed them aside.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't understand them at all.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to just let them be absorbed as advancement for the "Formless Heart Sutra".</p><p></p><p>The two cultivation techniques, with one of them being converted into the "Formless Heart Sutra", allowed the sutra to be cultivated up to the third realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the future, Ye Wuyu sensed that he needed to cultivate to the third realm himself in order to unlock the next stage.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>A cultivation technique that could cultivate one to the sixth realm only added two layers to the "Formless Heart Sutra"? That seemed a bit too harsh.</p><p></p><p>Going forward, how many cultivation techniques would be needed to exchange for just one "Formless Heart Sutra"? Even so, having experienced the profound mysteries of the "Formless Heart Sutra", Ye Wuyu had no intention of cultivating other techniques.</p><p></p><p>Unfolding the letter, Ye Wuyu read the first line, breaking out in a cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>(Ye Wuyu, my master is very angry and says she wants to kill you.)</p><p></p><p>(Did you perhaps anger her? But my master is now very weak and can't kill you.) (But don't worry, I won't let you die.) (I have to go on a mission now and will be away for a while. You should rest and recover well.)  (Thank you for saving me, I still owe you a favor.)</p><p></p><p>(The cultivation techniques are what my master said she wanted to give you. I'm quite puzzled, as she was so angry, but she said 'one matter is one matter'.) (I don't know what you need right now, but I bought some medicinal herbs that can help you cultivate your body.)</p><p></p><p>(Lu Caiwi)</p><p>Ye Wuyu read it for quite a while.</p><p>This girl, her speech was a bit stuttering, but her written emotions were much more expressive than her spoken words.</p><p>So she had to go on a mission again. </p><p>Well, a lot did happen in the celestial prison...</p><p>Speaking of the celestial prison,</p><p>Ye Wuyu thought hard for a moment, then recalled his conversation with the warden at the time.</p><p>Back then, he had been a bit arrogant without bounds.</p><p>Oh no, I won't lose my job, will I?

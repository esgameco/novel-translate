        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The corpses of the colleagues that Ye Wuyou had previously seen had no injuries on their bodies, but their minds had been mysteriously eroded, either going insane or dying in agony.</p><p></p><p>This was the intelligence that Lu Caiwei had informed him about.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's cultivation had reached the third realm, and they had the "Grandpa" protecting them, so they could resist this erosion to some extent, but only to a certain degree.</p><p></p><p>However, for Ye Wuyou himself, this could be summed up in a single sentence:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was unaffected.</p><p></p><p>[You mere remnants of the Great Dao actually dare to try and erode you...]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou painfully patted his forehead, well, the dog was barking again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei, who had wiped away her tears, looked at Ye Wuyou, "You... have you also felt the influence?"</p><p></p><p>"No."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou shook his head, he was just annoyed by the dog's barking.</p><p></p><p>Compared to himself, Ye Wuyou was more concerned about the other's situation.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was the only "surviving" teammate at the moment, and possessed considerable combat power.</p><p></p><p>If something happened to the other, then he would not be far from death here.</p><p></p><p>"Has the situation affected you?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei shook her head, indicating that she was unharmed.</p><p></p><p>Unharmed, huh...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou leaned against the stone wall, the dim and flickering candlelight now seemed like a lulling melody in his eyes. After experiencing a series of events, his eyelids were now trembling, and he eventually fell into a deep sleep, not knowing how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>The first day trapped in the Celestial Prison had ended.</p><p></p><p>The second day? In the Celestial Prison, without a sense of time, Ye Wuyou did not know how long had passed.</p><p></p><p>When he opened his eyes from his sleep and shifted his body, the same white-robed figure greeted his vision.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's gaze was now looking at him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou felt a bit awkward, that in such a dangerous place, he had unknowingly fallen asleep. Just as he was about to speak, only a hoarse voice came out.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators can go for days without eating, but...</p><p></p><p>He was still just an ordinary person after all, having gone almost a day without food, and being exhausted after the intense activity.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei seemed to have noticed his predicament, and gently waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the water and dry rations appear out of thin air, Ye Wuyou was stunned for a moment, so she had a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou did not dwell on it, and accepted the food from her hand.</p><p></p><p>"How long have I been asleep?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei averted her gaze, closing her eyes and suppressing the emotions in them, and said,</p><p></p><p>"About... about four hours."</p><p></p><p>"That long!" Ye Wuyou was startled, looking around, there were no new traces.</p><p></p><p>It seems that nothing had happened while he was asleep.</p><p></p><p>Counting the days, it should be the second day now.</p><p></p><p>The stone door behind them, engraved with seals, remained motionless, and the Warden that Lu Caiwei had mentioned seemed to not have returned yet.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze swept around, finally resting on Lu Caiwei.</p><p></p><p>He did not open his mouth to urge her to rest, after all, someone had to keep watch in this haunted place.</p><p></p><p>His combat power was practically zero, so he could only let her stand guard.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou glanced at her wrist.</p><p></p><p>There, just like yesterday, was a deep crimson, and the color was becoming even more vivid.</p><p></p><p>"Your hand, it's bleeding."</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, Ye Wuyou finally heard her slightly weary response.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing... I, I, I did it myself."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei seemed unwilling to explain further, her tightly closed eyes did not open, but the beautiful face had a slight frown.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Wuyou fell silent.</p><p></p><p>[What a ruthless woman, casually self-harming, this kind of behavior can't help but arouse your interest. Since she's using the pain of self-harm to maintain her alertness, why not lend her a hand personally...]</p><p></p><p>Fuck! The dog system is useless, full of perverted nonsense.</p><p></p><p>The second day passed quietly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Third day.</p><p></p><p>The stone door behind them still stood there, without any sense of movement, not even a single sound heard.</p><p></p><p>Does this prison have soundproofing? The complete silence made Ye Wuyu wonder if all the people in the prison had already died.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei was still sitting cross-legged in meditation, her eyelids not even opening once.</p><p></p><p>There was just another wound on her arm.</p><p></p><p>This strange corrosion, could it really disturb one's mind so much? Ye Wuyu was pondering this in confusion when suddenly there was movement beside him.</p><p></p><p>The young woman stood up, stepping forward and holding her sword upright.</p><p></p><p>The light in her eyes had dimmed, tinged with a hint of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, still not understanding what was happening, suddenly looked intently towards the front.</p><p></p><p>At the other end of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>Under the dim candlelight, several shadowy figures could be vaguely discerned in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Wuyu was very clear that apart from him and Lu Caiwei, there was no one else here.</p><p></p><p>They could no longer be called human.</p><p></p><p>His former colleagues were now stumbling, their emaciated bodies, their eyes only a lifeless, pale white.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei took a light breath, then raised her long sword horizontally in front of her, the hem of her bloodstained dress fluttering as if moved by an invisible wind.</p><p></p><p>The sharp pressure he had felt before once again surrounded Ye Wuyu, making his whole body tense up.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the white-robed figure vanished from her spot, and a dazzling light appeared in the gloomy prison.</p><p></p><p>The sword rose with the wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>How powerful are the cultivators of the Three Realms?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had not truly stepped into cultivation, so he had no clear concept of "strength".</p><p></p><p>But this did not prevent him from recognizing "power".</p><p></p><p>That group of stumbling former "colleagues" looked dazed, but their movements still seemed to retain the consciousness of their former selves, their techniques and martial arts still intact.</p><p></p><p>At least, Ye Wuyu could not defeat them.</p><p></p><p>So now he could only tap his fingers, silently calculating in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Sixteen breaths...</p><p></p><p>From the moment Lu Caiwei struck, to when she returned with her clothes stained in blood, only sixteen breaths had passed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze lingered briefly on the corpses, but then quickly turned away.</p><p></p><p>Chunks of white jelly-like substance emerged from the corpses, finally coalescing into a creature the size of a child.</p><p></p><p>Bigger than the one from that day.</p><p></p><p>The creature had no eyes, but perhaps because Ye Wuyu could see it, he could feel it scrutinizing the two of them.</p><p></p><p>As if hesitating? Finally, when Lu Caiwei raised her sword again by instinct, the white jelly-like monster quietly retreated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Wuyu's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>These monsters indeed possessed intelligence.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that it was wary of Lu Caiwei, wary of the sword in her hand.</p><p></p><p>And that monster knew that the longer they stayed here, the deeper the strange corrosion would affect them, and the weaker they would become.</p><p></p><p>This time, the monster's arrival seemed more like a test.</p><p></p><p>What about the next time? And the time after that?</p><p></p><p>If the Warden did not come to open the door, would the two of them truly be trapped here until they died?</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>The sound of metal clashing echoed in Ye Wuyu's ears.</p><p></p><p>Turning his head, he saw Lu Caiwei stumbling back a few steps, her long sword falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>She supported her forehead with one hand, slowly curling up and sitting down, her originally cold eyes now only open to a slit, seeming to suppress a myriad of complex emotions, her beautiful face bearing a hint of pain.</p><p></p><p>She reached out her hand, trying to pick up the fallen sword, but her body could not take a single step, unable to reach it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei's gaze narrowed slightly as she looked at Ye Wuyu, her silver teeth gritting, seeming to have gained a bit more clarity.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, stab me."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There is now a very big doubt in his small head.</p><p></p><p>Why did he make a contract with a little chick as his spirit beast? "Chirp, peep!"</p><p></p><p>Tusu stretched out his trembling hand, picked up the chick, looked at it again and again, and finally confirmed that it was indeed a chick.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhhh!"</p><p></p><p>He was almost about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator of the Yuzhou Sect, his cultivation had naturally reached the level of spirit beast control. The spirit beast he contracts with largely determines his strength.</p><p></p><p>"It's over, it's over..."</p><p></p><p>"There's no chance anymore."</p><p></p><p>"It's not about 'east for thirty years, west for thirty years, don't underestimate the poor young man'... now only the dead have the final say."</p><p></p><p>Compared to Tusu's grief, the three people from Tianlou seemed much calmer, but their expressions were still solemn as they surveyed their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The village in front of them had regained its true appearance, and it was now a scene of desolation and ruin.</p><p></p><p>They had regained their memories.</p><p></p><p>But regarding the events that had occurred in the village, they seemed completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>In their memories, they had only passed out and slept for a while, but somehow ended up in this situation.</p><p></p><p>However, when they saw the injuries on Ye Wuyu's face, they vaguely sensed something.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu threw a rotten and decaying demonic fox corpse to Lin Qingqing, and then briefly explained the general events that had occurred.</p><p></p><p>But in the narration, he omitted the information about the "Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell", and also concealed White Luo's identity.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after glancing at the grief-stricken Tusu hugging the chick, Ye Wuyu fell silent for a while and ultimately did not speak up.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing looked at the demonic fox corpse in her hand, her expression complex.</p><p></p><p>They only knew that they had previously fallen into an illusion, and now it had been resolved.</p><p></p><p>But as for how it was resolved and what had happened in between, they were completely ignorant and seemed very bewildered.</p><p></p><p>However, among them, there was one person whose expression was not quite calm.</p><p></p><p>White Luo stood alone at the village entrance. A light breeze blew, diluting the stale and decaying smell a bit, and her expression eased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because she had died once, she remembered everything that had happened in this village.</p><p></p><p>It's just that her aura was now much weaker than before, and under her skirt, a fluffy white thing flashed briefly.</p><p></p><p>White Luo gently raised her head, her captivating eyes gazing at the man in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The black clothes were stained with indelible splotches of blood, his hair still disheveled and scattered, the dirt on his face had been wiped clean, but there was a wound on his right eye that couldn't be erased, now wrapped in some unknown material covering half his handsome face, making it look a bit ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Furrowing her brows slightly, White Luo felt a hint of hesitation in her heart.</p><p></p><p>How should she face this person in front of her? Hatred? Resentment? Dependence? Or...</p><p></p><p>White Luo didn't know what the future held. Could she still hide in the human world like before? Or would she have to live the rest of her life watching this person's face?</p><p></p><p>Although they had experienced these events together, their initial relationship was not that of companions, but adversaries.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, White Luo's life was in Ye Wuyu's hands.</p><p></p><p>A light cough interrupted White Luo's thoughts, and Ye Wuyu's gaze did not look at her, but drifted into the distance, casually saying:</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough, you may not be too familiar with the techniques of the Yuzhou Sect. They are different from other spirit beast cultivation methods. Since you are so close to me, I can hear some of the thoughts in your heart..."</p><p></p><p>The inherited techniques of the Yuzhou Sect were naturally more exquisite than other sects.</p><p></p><p>This "exquisite" refers, of course, to the human perspective.</p><p></p><p>Compared to other sects, which may have to share the joys and sorrows with their spirit beasts, the Yuzhou Sect does not need to.</p><p></p><p>That is, they have almost complete control over the words and actions of their spirit beasts, and as time passes, this control will only deepen.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The control was becoming increasingly complete.</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the bewitching face of Bai Lu suddenly turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>The hatred and suspicions she had just harbored towards Ye Wuyu - had he really seen through them all? Then... would he no longer spare her? At this moment, Ye Wuyu's gaze fell upon her face, as if he was examining something.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's beautiful fox-like eyes suddenly trembled. During her solo cultivation in the sect, she had often heard her fellow disciples mention those perverted human sexual interests down the mountain...</p><p></p><p>Whips and red wax, ropes and bindings, the Jade Dragon's Bewitching Soul... </p><p></p><p>And the stories her demonic clan elders had told her about their kind being captured by humans also vaguely resurfaced in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about being pinned down and harshly punished by him, Bai Lu couldn't help but tremble with fear. </p><p></p><p>Rather than ending up in such a miserable fate, it would be better to submit to him... to let him rest assured, so that she could live safely in the future.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Bai Lu walked up to Ye Wuyu, her body pressing close to his chest.</p><p></p><p>But then she was suddenly pushed away by Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Bai... I haven't told them about your identity, and I don't need you to follow me. Forming the Innate Spirit Contract with you was just an accidental move.</p><p></p><p>But I can't deny that your extraordinary abilities did help me. Otherwise, I would have died long ago. And in return, I also saved you from your predicament, so I suppose we're even.</p><p></p><p>You can just go back to living your life as before, I won't make any demands of you.</p><p></p><p>After all, in a sense, we have a life-and-death bond, don't we?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu explained all this in one breath, then looked at the dazed Bai Lu and asked, "By the way, which sect are you from? I'll visit it if I have the chance."</p><p></p><p>"Hehe Sect," Bai Lu replied flatly.</p><p></p><p>Hehe Sect? Ye Wuyu paused, then began to examine the woman in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu didn't feel anything at first, but as she sensed Ye Wuyu's strange gaze, she immediately reacted.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly influenced by Ye Wuyu's previous words, her fox-like eyes now glared viciously at him.</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? Do you humans think that everyone from the Hehe Sect is... that kind of person?"</p><p></p><p>Isn't that the case...? Ye Wuyu looked bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"Those are just the businesses of the Hehe Sect. The outer disciples with average talents are responsible for them, and they cultivate the Hehe techniques while at it," Bai Lu explained angrily. </p><p></p><p>"After all, I'm a royal demonic fox. How could I cultivate those? Even my sister who has fallen to the Demonic Dao only uses illusory realms to extract human essence."</p><p></p><p>"The techniques I cultivate are about controlling human emotions and desires, and understanding the ten sufferings and eight afflictions. Only the human sects have similar methods to my fox clan."</p><p></p><p>"Hey, are you listening?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu watched the indignant Bai Lu and found it somewhat amusing.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you explaining all this to me?"</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I don't want you to misunderstand..."</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's words were interrupted as she suddenly stiffened, her expression turning cold. She took a few steps back, her eyes revealing undisguised resentment, which soon faded into indifference, as if she had been stripped of all emotions.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps were heard from behind, the remaining survivors were also about to leave the village.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu looked at Ye Wuyu, her eyes now devoid of any emotion, as cold as ice.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, my life is in your hands. You used my life."</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to die."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>"So, you're not allowed to die." The woman's tone was icy.</p><p></p><p>"You too." Ye Wuyu chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

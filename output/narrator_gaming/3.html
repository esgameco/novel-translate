        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the group of people descended from the second floor, the cold atmosphere on the first floor gradually dissipated, and the few prison guards scattered again, occasionally heard in low-key discussions.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Wang, do you mean that even we, the guards of the Heavenly Prison, need to personally go and capture the criminals?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, but... there are exceptions."</p><p></p><p>As an old man who had been a prison guard in the Heavenly Prison for a lifetime, in terms of information, Uncle Wang still considered himself quite capable.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Yan Dynasty has been established for more than 700 years, and the group of nobles at the top have long been deeply rooted. Some people are difficult to catch in the various prefectures and counties, and they don't dare to catch them either."</p><p></p><p>"And then there are the cultivator sects. Haven't you noticed the attitude of the court towards those sects in recent years? Some people are important in their eyes, but they are thorns in the eyes of the court. But the officials have too many procedures, by the time they act, the opportunity has passed. Some matters, we just help to take care of them."</p><p></p><p>"And then there's the Tianlan City, located on the border of the Qingzhou Province, some demons... I won't tell you about these."</p><p></p><p>"After all, who doesn't know the relationship between our warden and the current emperor... In short, we catch the people the court doesn't dare to catch, and we handle the matters the court doesn't dare to handle. This is the Heavenly Prison."</p><p></p><p>After Uncle Wang finished speaking, he cast a satisfied glance at the focused Ye Wuyu, the corners of his mouth curling up with a proud smile of successful revelation.</p><p></p><p>Although Uncle Wang knew that the true secrets of the Heavenly Prison had nothing to do with a small prison guard like him, the words that came out of his mouth were still extremely satisfying.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu heard the gist of it, but he didn't have the same sense of pride and honor as Uncle Wang as a Heavenly Prison guard. He only felt that the complex web of relationships in the Great Yan Dynasty would inevitably lead to hidden dangers sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking about the words of the system in his mind, Ye Wuyu hesitated and asked cautiously:</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Wang, is it possible that some criminals are deliberately caught and sent here? And then..."</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible!" Uncle Wang's words were decisive and unequivocal.</p><p></p><p>He replied with a smile: "You want to say that someone has sinister intentions, deliberately getting caught and then trying to cause trouble by infiltrating the Heavenly Prison? This has happened before, but the final outcome is always tragic."</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Prison is impregnable."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Prison collapsed.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Wuyu had a choice again, he would rather starve to death outside than find connections to enter the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>What kind of situation was this?</p><p></p><p>He was just on duty, and fell asleep in a daze late at night, only to be awakened by a loud noise.</p><p></p><p>When he looked back, he saw the huge blue stone gate, which was never closed, suddenly crashing down, sealing the entire Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, a rumbling sound came from beneath his feet, the ground trembling, and the falling dust and smoke enveloped the entire prison.</p><p></p><p>The emergency situation that Uncle Wang said had not occurred for thirty years had just happened.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Prison was in turmoil, and as a small prison guard, Ye Wuyu was suddenly drafted into the second floor. As soon as he entered, he was knocked unconscious by the collapsing stones from above and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>What was in front of him? Six huge cages were distributed on both sides of the corridor, but the prison cells were empty, with no inmates in sight.</p><p></p><p>Where were his teammates? Where was Uncle Wang?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu struggled to get up, but his hand hesitated slightly, and he looked back at the cages again, his eyes filled with horror.</p><p></p><p>In the dim candlelight, he hadn't noticed before, but on both sides of the cage corridor, there were several figures lying horizontally and vertically.</p><p></p><p>They were wearing the same uniform as him.</p><p></p><p>Among them were some of his colleagues who had entered the second floor with him, as well as some faces he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>One of them even had a "Grade C" identity tag, which meant his cultivation was at least at the Qi Boundary level.</p><p></p><p>But now they were lying on the ground peacefully, without any injuries, but no longer breathing.</p><p></p><p>[Looking at the bodies of these colleagues, and you are unharmed, you can't help but smile calmly, marveling at the wondrous Wuxiang Heart Sutra.]</p><p></p><p>Smile? Who the hell can smile at a time like this? Ye Wuyu stood up, his body swaying unsteadily.</p><p></p><p>He silently examined his inner self, and the faint spiritual energy he had cultivated according to the "Wuxiang Heart Sutra" had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>His entire spiritual sea was withered, occasionally twitching a bit of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what his body had experienced during the unconsciousness, and where that bit of spiritual energy had been mysteriously used.</p><p></p><p>At least his life was spared.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu estimated his current condition, which was similar to when he had just "died and revived". He could barely walk.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Ye Wuyu was carefully examining the surrounding cages.</p><p></p><p>The cages showed no signs of being opened, and even the strange-looking chains were still coiled on the cages, without any traces of being dismantled.</p><p></p><p>Empty prison cells?</p><p></p><p>But this place, no matter how he looked at it, did not seem to be the second floor of the Heavenly Prison that Uncle Wang had described.</p><p></p><p>[These are just the remnants of the Great Dao, how dare they show off in front of you! This little illusion trick, let me break it!]</p><p></p><p>The sarcastic words in his mind made Ye Wuyu pause, but the subsequent scene could only make him utter two words full of emotion:</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Words.</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyou's gaze, the six massive cages suddenly rippled, as if the mist on the mirror surface had been wiped away, revealing the scene in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>He saw it.</p><p></p><p>A naked man without legs was sitting and observing himself.</p><p></p><p>A creature wrapped in something like white jelly was clinging to the entire cage.</p><p></p><p>A child curled up in the corner of the cage, occasionally glancing this way.</p><p></p><p>And there were three more cages, a little further away, the candlelight was dim, and they couldn't be seen clearly.</p><p></p><p>Remnants of the Great Dao? What is that? Ye Wuyou didn't understand, but it was obvious that this was not the second layer of the prison. Because at least the second layer was holding people! [These remnants of the Great Dao are nothing but chickens and dogs in your eyes, they are not worth a fight, it's just a pity that you are not at your peak now, you can only sigh and leave gracefully, as for these trash, we'll talk about it later.]</p><p></p><p>Huh? A hint of surprise flashed in Ye Wuyou's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The scum would also admit defeat?</p><p></p><p>No.</p><p></p><p>Realizing something, Ye Wuyou took a few steps back.</p><p></p><p>In his line of sight, the monsters in the cages seemed to be getting closer to him.</p><p></p><p>Especially the child with white eyes, who at some point had stopped peeking at him and turned his entire head towards him.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of gazes converging on him made Ye Wuyou's scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>Run! Can't stay here! Shakily standing up, he then ran towards the other end of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what the so-called remnants of the Great Dao were, but in any case, he couldn't die again.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know the way out, but at least he could try to get as far away from these cage monsters as possible.</p><p></p><p>His legs felt as heavy as lead, but Ye Wuyou was now using all his strength, running as fast as he could.</p><p></p><p>As Ye Wuyou ran, the already long corridor seemed to grow even darker, and the sparse candle lights along the way were not enough to illuminate this prison.</p><p></p><p>His already exhausted body now seemed to have reached its limit, and both his legs no longer felt like his own.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou braced his hands on his knees, panting.</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, the corridor seemed to have reached its end.</p><p></p><p>Just as he sat down with a thud, leaning against the stone wall and panting heavily, Ye Wuyou suddenly felt a chill in his heart, and he couldn't help but look to the side.</p><p></p><p>He happened to meet a bright pair of eyes.</p><p></p><p>A young woman in white clothes was sitting cross-legged on the ground, a long sword resting horizontally in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Her long black hair cascaded down her back like a waterfall, and the faint candlelight cast a reflection on the wall, outlining her graceful figure.</p><p></p><p>But on her wrist was a crimson stain, soaking through the white clothes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was looking at him, her gaze cold and icy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou felt that she looked familiar.</p><p></p><p>[Darkness, danger, strangeness, an injured woman]</p><p></p><p>[All the elements are there, a dark and windy night, a dark and secluded room, and now a lone man and woman in the same cell, and she is injured, so she must be very weak. This is the perfect opportunity for a handsome and caring man to take advantage of the situation and refine her into a furnace...]</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In an instant, the figure in white was standing in front of Ye Wuyou, sword in hand.</p><p></p><p>When the icy sword edge was less than 0.01 centimeters from his throat, Ye Wuyou couldn't even react in time.</p><p></p><p>The girl's fleeting murderous intent momentarily stunned Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>You call this very weak? You want me to take advantage of the situation?</p><p></p><p>"Miss knight, please wait, I am your colleague, and there may be some misunderstanding here."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou finished this sentence in one breath, his gaze fixed on the specially made prison token on the girl's waist.</p><p></p><p>[乙]</p><p></p><p>The prison guards are divided into four levels, from high to low: Jia, Yi, Bing, Ding. As a Ding-level nobody, Ye Wuyou was undoubtedly a small fry.</p><p></p><p>But Yi-level, at least here and now, was undoubtedly a big shot.</p><p></p><p>The girl's fleeting murderous intent came quickly and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>But the sword edge never left Ye Wuyou's throat.</p><p></p><p>The frost-faced girl spoke slowly, her expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"I... I know."</p><p></p><p>There was something strange in the girl's words, her beautiful eyes staring intently at Ye Wuyou, her mouth opening and closing.</p><p></p><p>Hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>If you know we're colleagues, then why don't you quickly put away your sword? </p><p></p><p>Is there something else wrong?</p><p></p><p>Girl, speak up quickly! Seeing the girl's hesitant expression, Ye Wuyou couldn't help it.</p><p></p><p>"Miss knight, do you have any other questions?"</p><p></p><p>The girl frowned, the frost-like beauty on her face now tinged with a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Her cold voice came again, but it was broken and stuttering.</p><p></p><p>"This layer, layer after layer... of people, I've all checked."</p><p></p><p>"Including you, you're all... all dead."</p><p></p><p>"Then, then, then... what are you?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

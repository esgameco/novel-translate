        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You kindly gave her a gift, but not only did this stammering girl not appreciate it, she even dared to mock you? It seems she has a death wish, so you immediately became furious, tearing off her clothes and pinning her down on the table..."</p><p></p><p>"Get out of here! Can't you be a decent person!"</p><p></p><p>The narrator was silent for a while, but the voice soon sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"You've been through the flower-filled garden, not a single petal sticking to you. There have been countless beautiful women throwing themselves at you, and you could slay them all with a single sword, captivate them all with a single finger. But now, years have passed, and you have become aloof and indifferent to the world. What you see from the balcony is not the endless fireworks, but the boundless loneliness like snow."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? How did the tone change?"</p><p></p><p>"Until one day, you, who are tired of everything, set out to wander the rivers and lakes again, and you meet this woman. Faced with your kindness, she dares to refuse..."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, woman, you have successfully piqued my interest."</p><p></p><p>"Damn, I'm so awkward."</p><p></p><p>Faced with Lü Caiwi's indifference, Ye Wuyu didn't really mind.</p><p></p><p>This girl still seems to be angry, because I went to the brothel? </p><p></p><p>What's the big deal, it's not your money I spent.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it seems to be her money after all...</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the other three's strange gazes, Ye Wuyu sat down next to Lü Caiwi, resting his head on one hand and wearing a faint smile, admiring her beautiful profile.</p><p></p><p>"Little girl, you naive and foolish stammerer, let me see how I can get a hold of you."</p><p></p><p>"Taming this girl is a piece of cake. You just need to say three sentences to warm her up all day long."</p><p></p><p>"Are you there?"</p><p>"Are you free?"</p><p>"Have you eaten?"</p><p></p><p>Alright, alright, if there's a next time, this narrator system should go to Gotham instead.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the stubbornly silent Lü Caiwi, Ye Wuyu cleared his throat and then tapped the table with his fingertips.</p><p></p><p>"Lü Caiwi, turn around, let's talk properly."</p><p></p><p>The woman in front of him hesitated, her earlobe twitching slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, don't worry about the others for now, just take that thing, okay?"</p><p></p><p>Summer An Meng silently persuaded in her heart. Although the Jade Soul Flower was not a top-tier medicinal material, it would still greatly benefit her in her current weakened state.</p><p></p><p>"Master... it was you who told me not to talk to him anymore."  Lü Caiwi responded in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, my disciple, you're so silly. Just take it, and after I regain my strength, I'll help you beat him up, won't that feel great!" Summer An Meng instigated.</p><p></p><p>Lü Caiwi hesitated for a moment, "No, no need to beat him up, I'll just take it."</p><p></p><p>Lü Caiwi silently turned around, her lowered gaze slowly lifting to look at the man in front of her who was watching her with a smile.</p><p></p><p>But the smile disappeared the moment she turned around, replaced by a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Here." Ye Wuyu handed her the Jade Soul Flower again.</p><p></p><p>Lü Caiwi softly said, "I-I-I... can't take it for free, I'll buy it with money."</p><p></p><p>She was about to reach for her purse, but realized she had already given all her money to Ye Wuyu. Seeing the stammering girl's helpless and confused expression as she searched her body, Ye Wuyu suppressed his laughter and spoke in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"Lü Caiwi, haven't you forgotten the condition you promised me? Just take it, don't hesitate."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lü Caiwi no longer resisted and obediently took the Jade Soul Flower from Ye Wuyu's hand.</p><p></p><p>So easy to manipulate.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Ye Wuyu stood up and reached out to the three men who were already gaping in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Three Jade Soul Flowers were handed over to them by Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, a faint aura was released from the Jade Soul Flowers, and although the flowers remained the same, their internal potency had been completely drained.</p><p></p><p>"Mmm~" An ancient remnant soul over a hundred years old let out a subtle sound, then rested peacefully, feeling refreshed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the exquisite little flowers in her hand, Lü Caiwi seemed to realize something and asked, "Th-Th-This... is this your condition?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, who had already started to eat, gave her a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, when did I ever say that was a condition?" He continued eating, ignoring Lü Caiwi's bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Ridiculous, I give you something and you want to take advantage of me? That's a condition?</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Wuyu looked up, puffing out his cheeks and shouting at the three dumbfounded men, "Eat, why aren't you eating?"</p><p></p><p>Then he turned around, his gaze examining the silent girl sitting alone, her head lowered. Seeing her eyes, which were no longer cold but gradually becoming a bit glossy, he sighed.</p><p></p><p>He leaned close to Lü Caiwi's ear and whispered something to her.</p><p></p><p>It was nothing much, just telling her about the relationship between Lü Qingshan and himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Shishu recounted a bit, of course omitting a part of it.</p><p></p><p>These words could only be said to Lu Caiwei. As the two who had survived from the eighth layer, even though Ye Wuyou didn't say it afterwards, Lu Caiwei should also have a vague sense that she was likely tainted by something strange.</p><p></p><p>The girl's eyes gradually brightened. "Really, really, really?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou didn't speak, but instead picked up the empty bowl in front of the other party, and naturally poured a bowl of chicken soup, then took a set of tableware and filled a full bowl of dishes.</p><p></p><p>"Eat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was not aware, and of course did not care, what kind of impact his behavior had brought to the other people in the private room.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang looked at the scene in front of him, mechanically chewed a few times, spat out the meat, and swallowed the bones.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>So he turned his head to look at Bai Changzai.</p><p></p><p>"Old Bai, although you don't talk much, you are the smartest. What's going on with the captain and that kid? I don't understand."</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai's expression was quite calm and serene as he replied, "It's not that I don't want to tell you, it's just that with your way of thinking, it would be difficult for me to explain it to you."</p><p></p><p>Hmph, Xu Fang disdained, turning his head to look at Lin Qingqing.</p><p></p><p>"Little sister Qingqing..."</p><p></p><p>"Scram."</p><p></p><p>The simple meal was briefly quiet for a while, but as time passed, it soon became lively again.</p><p></p><p>Although it was mixed with Lin Qingqing and Xu Fang's scolding, everything seemed to blend in harmoniously.</p><p></p><p>"It turns out that Brother Ye previously fell into the eighth layer of the Heavenly Prison, no wonder he is acquainted with the captain."</p><p></p><p>"It was just lucky to survive, all thanks to the captain's powerful strength."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou tentatively probed, Lin Qingqing and the other three did not know about the existence of the strange, so naturally he would not reveal more.</p><p></p><p>The meal was coming to an end, perhaps the volume was too loud, or perhaps the private room was not very soundproof.</p><p></p><p>The door was pushed open, and a surprised voice immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Miss Qingqing is here?"</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Wuyou could see the newcomer clearly, with a bang, Lin Qingqing had thrown the bowl and chopsticks onto the table, expressing her utter disgust.</p><p></p><p>"I'm really jinxed today, I can't even have a meal without running into you, you rotten person."</p><p></p><p>The figure had not even entered the door, but was scared back a step, then cautiously poked his head in to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Miss Caiwei is here too, do you still remember me..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lin Qingqing had already thrown the bowl out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou had thought there would be a classic meal-disrupting scene, but when he looked around, Xu Fang and Bai Changzai were quietly eating, even curiously observing the unfolding developments.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>Voices came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to... to the Third Young Master..." The tone was a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing stood up, and a faint aura even rippled around her.</p><p></p><p>A weak voice came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing... don't be so outrageous, my father is the prefect..."</p><p></p><p>"Still not leaving? Want to get beaten up like last time?" Lin Qingqing directly interrupted his words, her momentum formidable.</p><p></p><p>Wu Zuolong retreated his steps, not daring to peek again, his gloomy eyes swept a glance at the side, pointing to his underling Ma Liu, and said,</p><p></p><p>"This young master doesn't bother with them, you, go and deal with them."</p><p></p><p>The still-in-Tempering-Body-Realm Ma Liu hesitated for a moment, pointing to himself, "Me?"</p><p></p><p>But the Prefect's third young master had already walked away, not even turning his head as he went downstairs.</p><p></p><p>In the private room, Ye Wuyou looked at the unsurprised group and asked,</p><p></p><p>"Is this really the young master of the Prefect's family?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong, are you worried about this?" Lin Qingqing said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou shook his head, he was just very puzzled, was the Prefect's son really so incompetent? To put it bluntly, if he, Ye Wuyou, had started out as the young master of a Prefect's family, he should have already become a big profligate, strutting around Tianlan City...</p><p></p><p>"Don't mind it, that Prefect has three sons, and this one is the most useless, with no real abilities, just wandering around all day, greedy and licentious, notorious for years, a well-known figure in Tianlan City."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, Lin Qingqing's gaze became a bit strange, and she looked at Ye Wuyou, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"You've been living in Tianlan City all along, right? This guy is well-known in Tianlan City, how come you don't know about him?"</p><p></p><p>Know what, know about that Prefect's profligate son? Ye Wuyou was just about to shake his head, but then he paused.</p><p></p><p>Memories in his mind kept surging, but he still had no impression...</p><p></p><p>That's right, how could I not know?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The scene before him was no different from before, the mountain forest under the night sky remained the same, with no changes.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu turned around and looked back, Lin Qingqing, Bai Changzai, and Xu Fang were still standing beside him, but their eyes were vacant and dazed, motionless.</p><p></p><p>He calmly shifted his gaze forward again.</p><p></p><p>There, an old man with white hair and beard was looking at him with a smile in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>A murderous intent gradually arose.</p><p></p><p>But the old man's expression was gentle, and he spoke unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sect Master of the Qianxuan Gate, Mao Rong. My young friend, do not be hasty. Before you make a move, why don't you first evaluate this illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression remained calm, his eyes slightly lowered, but the corners of his mouth gradually curved into a slight smile.</p><p></p><p>The Qianxuan Gate...</p><p></p><p>So, it's like this...</p><p></p><p>"Both real and false, but it's absurd and laughable," he said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Elder Mao Rong did not seem to be in a hurry either, and a contemplative look flashed across his eyes, then he nodded.</p><p></p><p>"A description of both real and false, absurd and laughable - your evaluation is quite apt. No wonder you were able to detect my techniques, I must have underestimated you."</p><p></p><p>But then, a look of excitement appeared in Mao Rong's eyes as he gazed at Ye Wuyu, as if looking at a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's every detail was laid bare before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Both real and false, absurd and laughable.</p><p></p><p>Just a cultivator who had just stepped into this realm, yet he could perceive Mao Rong's illusion and have such a deep understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>Such talent, how could Mao Rong not be excited.</p><p></p><p>He felt a sense of cherishing this talent, and he wanted to bring the other back to the Qianxuan Gate and cultivate him without holding back...</p><p></p><p>Huh? Is there something wrong?</p><p></p><p>The Qianxuan Gate...</p><p></p><p>Mao Rong's eyes lowered slightly, but the doubt in his mind only flashed by, and he soon raised his head again.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, do you know the different realms of illusion art?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's eyes held a smile, his hands hanging by his sides, looking at the other calmly and patiently.</p><p></p><p>But the smile held a hint of mockery and coldness.</p><p></p><p>As if he was looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>Mao Rong took it as the other being curious about his words, and his tone became more enthusiastic.</p><p></p><p>"I have cultivated the path of cultivation for a long time and have delved into the art of illusion for many years. I believe there are three realms of illusion art.</p><p></p><p>The first realm, I call it the Pursuit of Truth."</p><p></p><p>Mao Rong waved his hand, and in the fluttering of his sleeve, a fierce-looking three-star demonic beast, a giant wolf, emerged from the dense forest and charged towards Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>But strangely, the giant wolf passed through Ye Wuyu's body and headed straight for the other three people.</p><p></p><p>The three of them trembled slightly, but their expressions remained dazed, and with a wave of their hands, they had already taken up a formation, with wind and thunder intertwining, their spiritual energy flickering, fighting against the giant wolf.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Wuyu...</p><p></p><p>He stood beside the three, but it was as if they were separated by a great distance.</p><p></p><p>The two sides seemed to be on different planes, no matter how much they moved, Ye Wuyu was not disturbed in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"This demonic beast is false, but the caster wants those trapped in the illusion to believe it is real. I call this the Pursuit of Truth."</p><p></p><p>Mao Rong smiled and continued, "As for the second realm, I originally called it Nine Truths and One Falsehood, but I suddenly feel that your description is more apt - both real and false."</p><p></p><p>What is Nine Truths and One Falsehood? Like a lie deceiving people, a common lie would be full of loopholes if examined closely, but if among ten words, nine were true and one was false, intertwined, how could one discern it? Illusion art is the same.</p><p></p><p>To create a magnificent illusory realm, meticulously crafted, striving for it to be lifelike, not only is it painstaking, but it is also easily found to have loopholes.</p><p></p><p>This is the inferior way.</p><p></p><p>Using the scenery before one's eyes as the canvas, to create a truly realistic illusion.</p><p></p><p>The mountain wind blew, howling as it passed.</p><p></p><p>The fallen leaves in the forest were swept up, fluttering and scattering like rain.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there were a few bloody marks on the bodies of the three people.</p><p></p><p>Mao Rong casually waved his hand, stopping the subsequent changes.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the silent Ye Wuyu and spoke lightly.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, the art of illusion has endless variations, and even I have not fully grasped all of it. Therefore, this third realm, I can only speculate."</p><p></p><p>"In this realm, the distinction between true and false no longer matters. Everything you see before you may be false, or it may be true."</p><p></p><p>"Even if you have already realized that it is an illusion, you are powerless to do anything about it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ultimately, there is no distinction between reality and illusion."</p><p></p><p>The previously silent Ye Wuyou suddenly spoke, his words carrying a tone of inquiry.</p><p></p><p>"As you said, in the third realm, does life and death no longer have any meaning?"</p><p></p><p>Murong Xuanyi's expression momentarily faltered, but then a hint of joy appeared in his heart. Good, his words had not been wasted.</p><p></p><p>The young man before him had clearly been swayed by his words and was now actively discussing the issue with him. Murong Xuanyi was always very patient with the talents he valued.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, he murmured in response, "Under the ultimate illusion, those who have died do not know they are dead, and the living cannot discern the true from the false. So it seems that life and death have indeed become meaningless..."</p><p></p><p>Murong Xuanyi's eyes suddenly gleamed, as if he had realized something.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful, my young friend! Thank you, I have enlightened myself! Haha, I have enlightened myself! In at most ten years, I will be able to master the ultimate of this illusion realm."</p><p></p><p>"My young friend, why don't you come back to the Qianhuan Gate with me? You can be my disciple, and everything in the sect will be yours to take."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze shifted from the old man to the three people still struggling in the illusion.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he shook his head, a hint of regret in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Why do you refuse, and why do you feel regret?" Murong Xuanyi asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Regret?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's expression remained calm as he stepped towards the old man.</p><p></p><p>"My young friend, even though you have some talent, do you really think your single realm of cultivation can match up to me?" Murong Xuanyi chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>He allowed Ye Wuyou to approach step by step.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator of a single realm, he could kill him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>His smile quickly turned rigid.</p><p></p><p>Before him, Ye Wuyou's figure stood dozens of meters away, his hands hanging loosely, without any movement.</p><p></p><p>What... was that?</p><p></p><p>Murong Xuanyi's gaze shifted downward, and there was a circular hole in his chest, as if he had been pierced through.</p><p></p><p>But he saw nothing.</p><p></p><p>Not even a single drop of blood had flowed out.</p><p></p><p>Murong Xuanyi's eyes held a hint of confusion.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's voice came from in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"How pitiful, a lifetime of cultivation, yet trapped in an illusion without knowing it. Reduced to a mere remnant soul, unaware of life and death, toyed with in the palm of another's hand."</p><p></p><p>A ghostly blue hand slowly emerged from Murong Xuanyi's chest.</p><p></p><p>Although invisible, the aura it emanated made Murong Xuanyi's heart tighten.</p><p></p><p>Pain, trembling.</p><p></p><p>The eerie possessed the power to erode, especially when facing the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>In the dungeon, even the Sixth Realm remnant soul Xia Anmeng had been tormented and tortured by the eerie, let alone Murong Xuanyi, who was in such close proximity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was only in the First Realm, and even a Fourth Realm remnant soul would be unable to match him.</p><p></p><p>But the eerie was different.</p><p></p><p>It specialized in attacking the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>That Fourth Realm remnant soul began to dissipate, but it did not disappear into the heavens and earth. Instead, it was gradually absorbed into the invisible ghostly hand.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps in his final moments, a hint of clarity appeared in Murong Xuanyi's eyes, and he seemed to realize something.</p><p></p><p>The Qianhuan Gate, the fox demon, the grand wedding, the disciple...</p><p></p><p>The treasures had been stolen, the sect destroyed...</p><p></p><p>Where was the Qianhuan Gate in this world? </p><p></p><p>All of this was nothing more than the illusion of his own remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Murong Xuanyi opened his mouth and let out a scream.</p><p></p><p>"My young friend, hold your hand! Do not let it fall into the hands of the demonic..."</p><p></p><p>"Qianhuan... Purple Gold Bell!"</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyou could no longer hear any of this.</p><p></p><p>The ghostly blue eerie behind him erupted, and countless ghostly blue hands enveloped Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the abundant spiritual power flowing into the eerie behind him, Ye Wuyou couldn't help but tilt his head back, a look of contentment on his face.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still a hint of regret in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps it was better described as a sense of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, just a mere Fourth Realm remnant soul. The taste is ultimately too bland."</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng...</p><p></p><p>Recalling the taste of that woman, Ye Wuyou's eyes lowered, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>"Next time we meet, I shall devour her."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

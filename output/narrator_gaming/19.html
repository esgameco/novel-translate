        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the night, a figure stood silently in the wind and snow within the small courtyard, as motionless as an old monk in deep meditation.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's figure was soon covered by the heavy snow.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was the efficacy of the medicinal herbs, or perhaps the profound mysteries of the "Formless Heart Sutra", but in just twenty-one days, his originally somewhat frail physique had visibly become much more robust.</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds...</p><p></p><p>Soundlessly, only the melting of the ice and snow could be heard echoing in Ye Wuyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>Warm air began to rise from his body as the snowflakes gradually melted.</p><p></p><p>Even though Ye Wuyu had previously been completely ignorant of cultivation, he knew that tempering the body was the beginning of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"So this is what tempering the body is like?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stretched out his hand, trying to grasp the swirling snowflakes.</p><p></p><p>His blood qi surged, and his strength seemed to have doubled compared to before. Most importantly, the circulation of his inner qi seemed to have become much smoother.</p><p></p><p>That was all.</p><p></p><p>Normally, after successfully tempering the body, most people would then focus on cultivating the elusive inner qi within.</p><p></p><p>The younger, the better. As time passed, the abundant qi and blood that filled the body after tempering would gradually decline.</p><p></p><p>It would take as little as a few months, or as long as a few years or even decades, to cultivate the inner qi, and then find a cultivation method to diligently practice, eventually reaching the realm of the Hidden Origin.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu didn't need that. The "Formless Heart Sutra" within him, which could self-cultivate, had already refined his inner qi and circulated it throughout his meridians.</p><p></p><p>"This method is quite different from what I initially imagined, it's more akin to... martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had never eaten pork, he had at least seen pigs running around. Moreover, over these past few days, the four seasonal teachers had also provided him with a lot of theoretical knowledge about cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods in this world were not the same as what Ye Wuyu had initially theorized, at least not about things like the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, primal energy, or elemental forces.</p><p></p><p>There were no concepts like foundation building or elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>It was more about cultivating oneself, only using the materials of the world as tools.</p><p></p><p>But this world also had cultivation methods that focused on the spiritual soul... Ye Wuyu's mind recalled the incomprehensible cultivation method that Summer An Meng had previously given him.</p><p></p><p>Even Summer An Meng, a Sixth Realm cultivator from who knows how long ago, could maintain her remnant soul to this day.</p><p></p><p>All these things gave Ye Wuyu a sense that the cultivation methods of this world had been artificially divided and separated.</p><p></p><p>And on top of that, there was the completely foreign and "bizarre" thing, also known as the remnants of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps, only by reaching the Middle Third Realm could one gradually understand its profundity.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu closed his eyes, his inner qi and blood boiling without end, his inner qi abundant and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>In the heavy snowfall, in a side room nearby, four beautiful figures huddled together, silently watching the scene outside the window.</p><p></p><p>Chun Tao, Xia Li, Qiu Gua, and Dong Zao.</p><p></p><p>Four figures, each of a different size.</p><p></p><p>"The young master has succeeded in tempering his body, why is he still outside?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, perhaps the young master has other thoughts. What do you think, Chun Tao?"</p><p></p><p>Chun Tao, who was leaning by the window, fixed her beautiful eyes on the figure in the wind and snow, and her expression suddenly changed, revealing surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Is the young master... trying to break through a realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Eh, he's already cultivated his inner qi?"</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" was indeed a profound cultivation method recognized by the system. Even just the "Qi Guidance Chapter", the introductory part of the cultivation, would be enough to drive countless people crazy if it were released to the public.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, the tiny bit of inner qi cultivated solely through the "Qi Guidance Chapter" would not be enough to support Ye Wuyu's realm advancement.</p><p></p><p>In the wind and snow, a blue human figure that the naked eye could not perceive emerged from Ye Wuyu, with countless blue arms spreading out from it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu could sense the "bizarre" presence behind him, the "ghostly" bizarreness that felt like a part of his own body.</p><p></p><p>"So, this is where Summer An Meng's soul power resides," Ye Wuyu murmured with a slight smile on his lips.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He hung up with a light smile.</p><p></p><p>That day, he had consumed nearly 60% of Xia Anmeng's spiritual power. With that power, he entered the first realm of the "Formless Heart Sutra" - the Formless.</p><p></p><p>But afterwards... he hardly used it, and was quickly punched back to his original state by the Warden.</p><p></p><p>At first, Ye Wuyu felt a bit regretful, thinking that Senior Xia had painstakingly accumulated that power over many years, only to have it squandered by himself, and he didn't even get to enjoy it.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seems that the power is still there.</p><p></p><p>It is still the familiar spiritual power, flowing into his body along the eerie azure path, and finally transforming into a mighty spiritual force.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was Xia Anmeng's, so Ye Wuyu was very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>Using it was simply too smooth.</p><p></p><p>Even smoother than his own.</p><p></p><p>After a moment...</p><p></p><p>The raging blizzard suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The first realm - the Hidden Origin Realm - had been attained.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu was not at all satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Previously, in the eighth layer of the Heavenly Prison, he had briefly reached the second realm of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his physical weakness back then, Ye Wuyu reckoned he could have even advanced to the third realm.</p><p></p><p>Just the first realm? What a pitiful achievement.</p><p></p><p>[Finally realizing the importance of power, you can only regret letting that remnant soul slip away. Such a rich and nourishing supplement is not something you can encounter everywhere. But the days ahead are long, and when you meet it again, swallowing it whole will not be too late.]</p><p></p><p>That's enough...</p><p></p><p>[Breaking through a realm in a single night, sweeping through Tianlan City the next day, subduing the Great Yan Empire on the third day - in less than a week, you would be invincible under the heavens, shattering the void, with your legend echoing throughout the jianghu, but your physical presence nowhere to be found.]</p><p></p><p>This... Ye Wuyu felt a surge of emotion.</p><p></p><p>He still had plenty of spiritual power left, so he immediately began to gather his spiritual force, intending to advance to the second realm.</p><p></p><p>"I advise you not to do that."</p><p></p><p>Footsteps crunched on the icy snow.</p><p></p><p>A figure emerged from the snowy night.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe, in a straw raincoat, his sharp and harsh eyes visible under the hat brim.</p><p></p><p>"The Warden once told me you were special, but at first I didn't understand, thinking your talent and foundation were just average. Now I see, you're special in your fearlessness of death."</p><p></p><p>With a gentle wave of his hand, the blizzard instantly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Your spiritual force has dispersed. Take a deep breath, and let the cold air calm your hot-blooded impulses."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu took a deep breath, and the frigid air entering his abdomen cooled his heated blood.</p><p></p><p>He realized he had indeed gone a bit crazy just now.</p><p></p><p>"Just because you've broken through the first realm doesn't mean you can get cocky. After all, you already had the foundation of cultivating spiritual force. Consider it a unique opportunity in your cultivation method. </p><p></p><p>"I was just wondering why you were still standing there, and then you actually tried to charge into the second realm in the blink of an eye. Do you think your meridians and sea of qi are expendable?"</p><p></p><p>"There have been people who broke through realms in a single day. Centuries ago, in the Leiyang Kingdom, there was a scholar who became the number one under the heavens in the time it takes to burn a stick of incense. But what happened to him? His soul left in the afternoon, and his body was struck by lightning and disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu rubbed his head, listening to Zhao Changhe's scolding without a word.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had been somewhat bewitched by that voiceover.</p><p></p><p>Why? Had he been unstable in mind and spirit lately? He usually didn't pay much attention to those voiceovers.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, Zhao Changhe's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"Pull yourself together. I'll teach you a final technique."</p><p></p><p>"It's just right for someone like you who doesn't value your life."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

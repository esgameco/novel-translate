        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There is an inner river in Tianlan City.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the river lacks everything, but it certainly does not lack the air force's fishing enthusiasts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was fishing.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he was watching his "illusion" fishing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu crouched beside it, covering his eyes, and carefully felt it.</p><p></p><p>Confirming that his right eye did not feel any discomfort and his body was not being eroded, he let out a slight sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Ye Wuyu on the shore was created by him using the strange power of his right eye, but he could not perform illusion techniques to create such a grand illusory realm.</p><p></p><p>This illusion also could not be maintained for long, but a quarter of an hour was no problem.</p><p></p><p>Using the "ghost" too much would increase the erosion on himself, so Ye Wuyu did not plan to use it as recklessly as before, and instead focused on his strange right eye that contained a trace of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The narrator's words were not wrong - this "ghost eye" was completely on a different level compared to his own "ghost hand".</p><p></p><p>After all, it was something that could be used as a bell by the Qianxuan Gate in the past, and its practicality and convenience were obviously much better than the "ghost hand" within his body.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, he could only perform simple illusions, and as for the grand and magnificent illusory realms or the ability to alter people's memories and perceptions, he could not even attempt them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu guessed that this was related to the level of his cultivation and the cultivation of illusion techniques.</p><p></p><p>If he did not cultivate illusion techniques, he would not be able to fully unleash the power of this eye.</p><p></p><p>But the advantage was that there were no side effects.</p><p></p><p>After laying down this deceptive illusion, Ye Wuyu gently stroked his own face with his right hand, and his appearance changed.</p><p></p><p>He did not leave the area, but wandered around nearby.</p><p></p><p>Since the Tianyan technique could know his location, Ye Wuyu would be discovered no matter where he went, so it would be better to stay in place and see if he could deceive the other party.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu did not expect this little trick to be able to interfere with Lu Qingshan, but combining the two, it should not be a problem to waste a few minutes of his time.</p><p></p><p>A clamor of shouts came from the riverbank, but it was not an abnormal situation, just a group of people gathered around playing chess.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have reached the most exciting and intense stage.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu thought about it and walked into the crowd, then heard a few words of regret and surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Old Liu, who has always boasted of being unbeatable at fast chess, has met his match. This fast chess is too ruthless."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, but it's too fast, isn't it? He's lost so many pieces in just a few minutes... Look at this move, he's even lost his horse."</p><p></p><p>"With this level, I think I can take him on too..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu looked at the chessboard, he did not know this Old Liu, but he recognized him at a glance.</p><p></p><p>That sweating man was him.</p><p></p><p>"Clack."</p><p></p><p>The chess piece fell on the board, making a crisp sound.</p><p></p><p>"Checkmate."</p><p></p><p>A gentle voice sounded, and the sweat on Old Liu's forehead became even denser, but he finally sighed helplessly and slumped down in the chair.</p><p></p><p>"I lost." Old Liu closed his eyes, looking ashen-faced, his morale shattered, and he had no desire to analyze the game.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me."</p><p></p><p>Old Liu looked ashen-faced, but someone else looked even more unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze fixed on the middle-aged scholar sitting beside him, smiling at him, then looked at the chessboard that had clearly been played for a while, and left without turning back.</p><p></p><p>His figure became faster and faster, disappearing into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had only one thought in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He must learn this "Tianyan" technique.</p><p></p><p>Since he entered the cultivation path, there were many divine abilities that made him feel mysterious and surprising, but the only one that made him feel this shocked was the technique in front of him.</p><p></p><p>The divination technique could predict where he would be, which did not surprise Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>But to know his destination in advance, even arriving before him, eating a bowl of dumplings and playing a game of chess.</p><p></p><p>I don't even know where I'm going myself!</p><p></p><p>"Is this the divine technique of the previous era, so strange and mysterious."</p><p></p><p>The dog narrator didn't say anything?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu cried out in his heart, you useless thing, come and be of some use!</p><p></p><p>{Hmph, you sneer, what kind of thing dares to try to analyze the actions of this Venerable One? With the sky as the formation and the earth as the chessboard, you manipulate the living beings as chess pieces, reverse the heavenly mechanism, and give that poor rotten Confucian scholar a good lesson.}</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's eyes shone brightly, oh, there's a chance?</p><p></p><p>{Tsk, to think that this ordinary mortal could foresee everything without leaving any loopholes, rendering the layout useless. Such an opponent, well, it's fine, I'll just leave him with his life for now, let the world wait and see what happens.}</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu: "???"</p><p></p><p>Useless thing! Ye Wuyu cursed in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>{No matter, a fifty-year-old Confucian scholar without a wife or home, who can only hug illustrations and critique all day, such a person, even if he wins...}</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You haven't lost either!" </p><p></p><p>"I see, winning with just words, huh." Ye Wuyu sneered coldly, shaking his head, already not counting on this useless thing.</p><p></p><p>A faint fragrance wafted towards him.</p><p></p><p>But this fragrance was just incense, and it was very strong.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, come and play, it's a festival today, the young ladies are all waiting."</p><p></p><p>A melodious voice rang out, and Ye Wuyu looked up to see a magnificent red building, with lanterns and red satin hanging all over it, and the soft laughter of women constantly coming from within.</p><p></p><p>Is the brothel open during the day? Or are they holding an event? Habitually, Ye Wuyu glanced at the woman in front of the building, finding that she was not as good-looking as Lu Caiwi, nor as beautiful as Bai Lu.</p><p></p><p>Not even as good as Lin Qingqing.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't in the mood right now, so he was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>His steps paused slightly, and Ye Wuyu's tightly knitted brows suddenly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged, old scholar, no wife, likes to watch the imperial uncle...</p><p></p><p>He had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to turn and enter the building, but when he felt his purse, it was empty.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was trying hard to think of a solution, the corner of his eye caught sight of a familiar figure.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Er'er was a beggar.</p><p></p><p>In the past, she had always followed her mother begging on the streets. Her father had passed away, her mother was missing a hand, and the family could no longer make ends meet.</p><p></p><p>Begging also requires skill. Begging at the entrance of the vegetable market is definitely not as profitable as begging in front of the brothel.</p><p></p><p>After all, the people who come here are either rich or noble, and a few coins as a tip after a few drinks is a small matter, although they are sometimes driven away, but they still stubbornly kneel here.</p><p></p><p>The thin little girl swallowed her saliva, nervously looking at the white-robed lady in front of her.</p><p></p><p>The white-robed lady had a cold and aloof expression, a graceful bearing, and a slender sword hanging at her waist. Under her delicate and refined face, there was a faint sense of pride.</p><p></p><p>She stood there, a beautiful scenery in the bustling street, making the big sisters in the building, who wore little clothing, lose their luster.</p><p></p><p>"How beautiful." This was Er'er's thought.</p><p></p><p>The lady bent down, and a few silver coins were carefully placed in the broken bowl in front of her. Er'er's eyes lit up, these silver coins were more than she had begged for in a few months.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, sister." Before she could finish speaking, she was pressed down by her mother, who only had one hand, and kept kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Bodhisattva, thank you, great benefactor, Miss, you truly have a Bodhisattva's heart, may you..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi shook her head and slowly stood up, without a word.</p><p></p><p>Er'er raised her head and secretly stared at her.</p><p></p><p>A male figure suddenly appeared from somewhere, oh, he's quite good-looking too... Is he here to find that beautiful sister?</p><p></p><p>"Lu Caiwi, do you have any money on you? Lend me some first." Ye Wuyu looked at the travel-worn Lu Caiwi and directly asked to borrow money.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi's cold expression seemed to soften a bit, with a touch of joy, but hearing these words, she was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Ah... Yes, yes, how much do you need? What are you going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"No time to explain, lend me as much as you have."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi took out her purse and handed it all to Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at it, and there were actually a few taels of gold inside.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I have other matters to attend to. Are you going back to the prison? I'll come find you later."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, apologize to your master for me, I'll compensate her."</p><p></p><p>With that, Ye Wuyu strode into the brothel right in front of Lu Caiwi's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi stood there dumbfounded, looking at the magnificent red building in front of her, and listening to the constant soft laughter of women.</p><p></p><p>That sound was very grating.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, disciple, I tell you, these dog men are all no good." Xia Anmeng's words echoed in her heart, with a touch of mockery.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, the smile that had just hung on Lu Caiwi's face immediately dimmed, her eyes slightly downcast, not knowing why she felt a little lost.</p><p></p><p>Seeing her disciple saddened, Xia Anmeng thought for a moment and comforted her.</p><p></p><p>"It's okay, that Warden is your relative, right? Go talk to him later and have him expel this guy, so he'll never appear in front of you again."</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words fell.</p><p></p><p>A white figure descended from the sky, but it did not attract anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>Except for Lu Caiwi.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Lu Qingshan calmly adjusting his sleeves, still with a trace of nonchalance on his face.</p><p></p><p>Then, he rushed into the brothel.</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng paused for a moment, then her words sounded faintly.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, maybe you shouldn't stay in that prison anymore..."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

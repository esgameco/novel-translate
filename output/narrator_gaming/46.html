        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu suddenly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, a feeling of palpitation was transmitted from his heart, making him very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>So he stood up from the ground, stretched out his claws, and scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>Claws?</p><p></p><p>And why am I crouching down? Noticing something was amiss, Ye Wuyu turned his head to look at the fluffy white fox paws, then at his own body, with nine fox tails swaying behind him.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, it should be nine, but the ninth tail was somewhat illusory, hovering between existence and non-existence, as if it had not yet fully formed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's mind buzzed with confusion, and then, as if possessed by a spirit, he tried to sway his tail.</p><p></p><p>The nine fox tails swayed gently.</p><p></p><p>Ah, you know, it's quite interesting...</p><p></p><p>Interesting? How is this interesting?! Why have I turned into a fox? The palpitation in his heart grew stronger, and then Ye Wuyu felt his body unconsciously walking forward.</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the cave, and before his eyes was a vast grassland full of vitality and greenery.</p><p></p><p>The wind rose, and the boundless sea of grass rippled like waves.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu did not look at this beautiful scenery, his gaze unconsciously lifted upward, upward, until his two emerald-green eyes gazed at the sky.</p><p></p><p>The sky suddenly darkened, accompanied by rumbling thunder, and the sky changed to an increasingly terrifying state.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying and gloomy sky was now like a grand painting, but it had been torn open, revealing a scarlet glow.</p><p></p><p>The fox stared fixedly at the sky, its nine tails swaying behind it, emanating a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>But its form became increasingly restless, and it let out a shrill cry, as if trying to intimidate something.</p><p></p><p>But ultimately, that scarlet glow in the sky became clearer and clearer, gradually revealing its full form.</p><p></p><p>Finally, that scarlet glow was reflected in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, Brother Ye..."</p><p></p><p>The voice sounded in Ye Wuyu's ear, now distant, now near.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu opened his eyes, looking somewhat dazed at the side.</p><p></p><p>A man in brocade robes was squatting beside him, holding a piece of cloth to bandage his own head, and the once pristine brocade robe now had a torn and tattered crack.</p><p></p><p>"You're awake? The treatment was very successful, although you've lost one eye, but we're still alive." The man in brocade robes grinned hoarsely.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was first confused, but as he felt the narrowing of his vision and realized what had happened, he immediately disregarded his injuries and jumped up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, first seeing that the "resurrected" cultivators had all turned to skeletons, and he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Looks like the matter has been resolved?</p><p></p><p>But when he looked at the man in brocade robes, his gaze paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>Why is he still here?</p><p></p><p>A terrible thought flashed through his mind, could it be that the evil thing in this place is still here? But after carefully sensing it, he found that the eerie aura was no longer detectable, and Ye Wuyu's expression finally calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why the man in brocade robes, as a "dead person", could still exist, but he didn't have time to worry about him now, there were more important things.</p><p></p><p>He carefully checked his own body, the rot had disappeared, and he hadn't lost any limbs.</p><p></p><p>Except...</p><p></p><p>He touched the tattered silk wrapped around his face, feeling the darkness in his right eye, and sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>So, I must not have died just now.</p><p></p><p>If I had died, my eyes should have been able to recover.</p><p></p><p>Well, at least I don't have to waste a life.</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, Ye Wuyu glanced at the man in brocade robes and immediately turned around and headed towards the water well without looking back.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes was stunned, then got up from the ground and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>His expression was full of the joy of surviving, and he couldn't stop expressing his thoughts on the short journey.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, you were truly terrifying just now. I was lying on the ground waiting to die, and you don't know how you suddenly jumped up high and swallowed that eyeball alive."</p><p></p><p>"Is there anything wrong with your body now? Like a stomachache wanting to defecate... Don't look at me like that, I just want to know if that thing can be pulled out by you."</p><p></p><p>"Disgusting? Well, what can we do? After all, that thing is the Qian Xuan Gate's most precious treasure..."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, forget it, just being able to survive this ordeal is good enough, the treasure is gone, so..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe rambled on, but Ye Wuyu walked calmly, as if he had heard but not heard.</p><p></p><p>They soon arrived at the edge of the well. </p><p></p><p>Jumping down from here, they would be able to return.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at the man in the brocade robe, who was about to leap down, and suddenly spoke up, his expression solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any wishes after getting out?"</p><p></p><p>"Wishes?" The man in the brocade robe scratched his head, then rested his chin in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Not really, the treasures are gone, and it's impossible to quickly rebuild the Qianxuan Gate in the short term. I'll just find some mountain or wilderness to stay in and cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"After we get out, I'll treat you, Brother Ye, and tell you about my past."</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, I was really despicable in the past, did a lot of beastly things... But heaven is like this, people like me who have done so much evil still survived, while the good people died. Isn't that absurd..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu listened to the man's rambling without interrupting, just nodding silently, then leaped into the well.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me." The man in the brocade robe immediately followed.</p><p></p><p>Their forms slowly sank, but this time Ye Wuyu felt a thin membrane-like barrier, which he easily passed through.</p><p></p><p>This barrier seemed to only separate the living from the dead.</p><p></p><p>In the silent water, the man in the brocade robe stood on the other side, frantically pounding on the invisible barrier, trying to break through, but to no avail.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? Why can't I get through?"</p><p></p><p>He eventually realized that he was already dead. The once-grand brocade robe was now stained with mud and blood. </p><p></p><p>Trembling, he reached out his rotting hands and wrote an address on the barrier, then pointed to Ye Wuyu, his expression a mix of resentment and acceptance.</p><p></p><p>Then he died, just like the other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu calmly looked at the address, committing it to memory. He didn't know what was there, or if he would have the chance to go. </p><p></p><p>Finally, he nodded lightly at the decaying remains, then turned and left, heading towards the faint but brilliant light.</p>

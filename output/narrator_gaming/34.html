        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tu Su had a somewhat smug expression on his face as he stood up, hands on his hips, looking quite self-assured.</p><p></p><p>He had a vague feeling that he was different from ordinary people, and seemed to have a familiarity and closeness with all kinds of beasts.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes at night when he slept, he would dream of a scene where he had a fianc√©e and many people congratulating him...</p><p></p><p>Now, being able to control the ants inexplicably, Tu Su felt that he might be the reincarnation of some great expert.</p><p></p><p>"But what use is this?" Ye Wuyou's subsequent words extinguished his smugness.</p><p></p><p>Yes, what use is this? "Jiji"</p><p></p><p>A faint voice came, and the two looked over to see a small chick, not knowing from where it had emerged.</p><p></p><p>But this chick could barely stand steadily, wobbling about.</p><p></p><p>"Whose chicken is this? It looks beyond saving, might as well roast and eat it," Ye Wuyou said without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense." Tu Su walked over and held the chick in his arms.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why, but he had an inexplicable closeness to all kinds of beasts.</p><p></p><p>"It won't taste good if it's dead, I want to eat it fresh," Ye Wuyou said.</p><p></p><p>"You're the one who's going to die!" Tu Su coldly responded, then looked at the chick in his arms that was barely breathing, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>In his dreams, he seemed to be able to control very powerful beasts...</p><p></p><p>"Steamed, braised, or stewed... but one is not enough to eat."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's voice continued to sound beside him, making Tu Su feel irritated and troubled.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, his expression revealing a hint of determination and ruthlessness, as if he had made some decision.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?" Ye Wuyou was playing with the chick and saw Tu Su's expression, causing him to be taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Don't make noise, another imprint technique just popped up in my mind, you step back, let me try it," Tu Su said.</p><p></p><p>Tu Su didn't know where these strange imprint techniques in his mind came from, but he was a loner and didn't ask others about it.</p><p></p><p>Now, Ye Wuyou was a lunatic, and didn't really care why Tu Su had these things.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could do something interesting.</p><p></p><p>With this imprint technique, the chick's body trembled, and then it was actually able to walk on its own.</p><p></p><p>Tu Su successfully controlled the chick in front of him and brought it back to life.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, success!" Tu Su was sweating profusely, looking at the chick with some amazement.</p><p></p><p>Different from before, this time he could even sense what the chick was trying to express...</p><p></p><p>"I really am extraordinary." Tu Su's expression revealed a smug smile.</p><p></p><p>[Truly worthy of you, with just a few words, you've provoked a Qi Condensation cultivator, allowing him to take this little chick as his spirit beast. Such a vicious and cunning method, who in this world can match you...]</p><p></p><p>"Impressive, impressive." Ye Wuyou scratched his head, feeling that it was not very interesting, and got up to leave.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he encountered two people.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyou, reading makes one wise, you wander aimlessly every day, why not learn from me and read more books," said a pale-faced man named Bai Changzai, holding a well-worn book in his arms.</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste words with him, this wooden-headed fool definitely can't read books, why not learn from me, do more work for the village, better than wandering around aimlessly all day," said Xu Fang, carrying a shoulder pole with four buckets of water hanging from it, but his expression was still relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou glanced at them without saying anything.</p><p></p><p>He knew that this guy was physically powerful, strong as an ox, not like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The main thing was that he couldn't beat him.</p><p></p><p>The lunatic was not stupid.</p><p></p><p>[They are just Foundation Establishment cultivators, apart from their physical strength, they are utterly useless.]</p><p></p><p>The two figures disappeared into the distance, heading towards a wooden house. From afar, Xu Fang's rough voice could still be heard.</p><p></p><p>"Little Blue, look, I carried eight buckets of water all by myself, isn't that impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"Impressive? I think you look like an idiot!"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou still stood in the same spot, his gaze wandering and confused as he looked around.</p><p></p><p>In the village, everything was peaceful, the houses were orderly, and the surrounding vegetation was lush and vibrant, full of vitality.</p><p></p><p>But all this, reflected in his pupils, seemed to have taken on a different meaning.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the village, the once-amiable scene had somehow changed.</p><p></p><p>The soil was desolate and parched, the houses dilapidated, the trees withered and yellow...</p><p></p><p>"Fake, all of it is fake, haha haha haha."</p><p></p><p>He suddenly burst out laughing.</p><p></p><p>[You have seen through the illusion, realizing the true nature of your current surroundings...]</p><p></p><p>The cold wind blew, causing Ye Wuyu to shiver a bit, feeling a chill.</p><p></p><p>He patted his forehead, his gaze somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Before his eyes, everything still appeared lush and vibrant.</p><p></p><p>"What did you see?" The voice came from beside his ear, making Ye Wuyu start.</p><p></p><p>As he turned his head, he saw a cold, grim face almost pressed against his own.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell? What are you doing?" Ye Wuyu was startled and quickly stepped back, glaring at the other person.</p><p></p><p>Before him was a man in brocade robes, his expression gloomy, but with an air of nobility, a jade pendant hanging at his waist. </p><p></p><p>It was clear he was not from this village.</p><p></p><p>Seemingly concerned that others might notice the situation, the man in brocade robes remained silent, but he abruptly pulled Ye Wuyu to the side, into a small alley.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, hey, hey, what are you doing? We're both men, don't get handsy!" The man had immense strength, and Ye Wuyu could only be dragged along.</p><p></p><p>Once they were in a secluded area, the man in brocade robes slowly turned his gaze towards Ye Wuyu, the "madman" before him.</p><p></p><p>"I've been observing for a long time, and this village is not right."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" Ye Wuyu became interested.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes spoke in a calm tone.</p><p></p><p>"Don't speak, just listen quietly. I'm not from your village, and of course, you're not either - I'm sure you've realized that by now."</p><p></p><p>"I've been observing for a long time, and I've even seen a few familiar faces... but they no longer recognize me. You're the only normal person in this village."</p><p></p><p>"These past few days, whenever I try to leave the village, I unexpectedly lose consciousness in the middle of the night. When I wake up the next morning, I'm back in the village again. Otherwise, I wouldn't have come to find you, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Now you can ask any questions you have."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu held back for a while, his gaze somewhat bewildered.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, the things the man in brocade robes said - the beginning was forgotten, the middle was forgotten, the end was forgotten.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu only remembered that the other person said he was the only normal person in the village.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, a kindred spirit! You've finally come to find me."</p><p></p><p>"I know I'm not the madman, they're all the madmen! But they don't believe me." Ye Wuyu's expression became excited.</p><p></p><p>"But you're different, you've always known I'm not crazy. I've also felt for a long time that something is off with the village. Every night, they sleep so deeply, and I'm always terrified!"</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes' mouth twitched. It seemed he realized the other person hadn't really listened to anything he said.</p><p></p><p>But what did he mean by "you've finally come to find me"? Did he come looking for Ye Wuyu before? The man in brocade robes wanted to ask, but the "madman" before him digressed.</p><p></p><p>The ramblings of a madman? He could only give up.</p><p></p><p>But he had indeed been secretly observing for a long time. Previously, his own teammates, whether the White Dew from the Harmony Sect or the Painted Slave from the Beast Taming Sect, no longer recognized him.</p><p></p><p>And they seemed to have no awareness of the abnormality, just living peacefully in this strange village like ordinary villagers.</p><p></p><p>The one called Ye Wuyu, he knew this person was from the Divine Prison.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Wuyu was behaving like a madman, his occasional remarks hinted at an awareness of the wrongness of this place.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes' expression darkened, one hand on his forehead, his eyes filled with a sense of bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>His memory had gaps.</p><p></p><p>He only remembered that he and White Dew's group had come to this village and encountered the demonic fox.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he had fallen into the fox's illusion and slaughtered the entire village.</p><p></p><p>As for what happened afterwards, the man in brocade robes vaguely felt there were still some things he couldn't recall.</p><p></p><p>His memory ended there.</p><p></p><p>That night, he had acted, and blood had flowed like a river.</p><p></p><p>But the village before him now was full of vitality, without a trace of danger.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

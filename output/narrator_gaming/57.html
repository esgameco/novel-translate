        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>West of Tianlan City.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the bustling areas, this place is relatively quiet and secluded, and it is indeed the impoverished district of the west of the city.</p><p></p><p>The broken stone pavement, the long and tranquil alleys, the walls covered with green vines.</p><p></p><p>The abandoned small courtyards, the dilapidated shacks, the courtyard gate slowly pushed open, emitting an old creaking sound.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu walked in, looking at the dust covering the ground, only then realizing that he had not been back for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He had been staying and living in the Heavenly Prison before, then went to stay at Zhao Changhe's place for half a month, and then went to Mount Yunwu.</p><p></p><p>But now he had no mood to clean up, he walked straight into the room, lit three sticks of incense in front of the ancestral tablet, and then sat quietly at the desk where he used to study.</p><p></p><p>He had asked quite a few people.</p><p></p><p>The answers were all the same, the name of the profligate Wu Zuolong was known to everyone in Tianlan City, he was an infamous profligate.</p><p></p><p>But as a local who had been in Tianlan City since birth, why did he have no impression of this person?</p><p></p><p>If it was just a simple lack of impression, a memory lapse, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu clearly remembered the deeds of that prefect, and even remembered that he had two sons, both very successful, one was a general in the border army, and the other was an official in the capital, this was a heartwarming story that the people of Tianlan City occasionally mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Why was it a heartwarming story? Because it was in contrast to that third young master.</p><p></p><p>But the more it was like this, the more Ye Wuyu could not remember the existence of such a person, he only heard this name today.</p><p></p><p>"Has my memory been tampered with?" Ye Wuyu frowned.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu closed his eyes and carefully thought about the scenes from a few months ago, from almost starving to death at home, to joining the Heavenly Prison and up to now.</p><p></p><p>The conclusion he drew was that his memory had no problem.</p><p></p><p>"Problem? In your eyes, nothing is a problem, if there is a problem, it must be the world that is wrong."</p><p></p><p>Yes! The one who is wrong is not me, it is the world! Ye Wuyu did not believe that anything could silently tamper with his memory, after going through so much, his spiritual sensitivity had risen sharply, and ordinary illusions or strange erosion could not deceive him.</p><p></p><p>At least he would not be unaware of it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Ye Wuyu knew that he was not affected by strange auras.</p><p></p><p>So, all this must be caused by some strange thing, creating an identity out of thin air and deceiving the entire city.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to draw a conclusion, but he hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Were all the people in Tianlan City influenced?</p><p></p><p>And at least from what he saw, that Wu Zuolong was indeed a normal person, his aura was weak and his realm was also scattered, as if he was on drugs.</p><p></p><p>If it was a strange thing, or a cultivator of an extremely high realm that caused all this, what was the purpose? Ye Wuyu's gaze suddenly turned to the room next door, where three sticks of incense were inserted and an ancestral tablet was placed.</p><p></p><p>It was the spirit tablet of Lord Ye Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>The name Ye Changsheng sounded very impressive, and "Lord" also sounded very powerful.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Changsheng lived a short life, and "Lord" was just a title for his father, without any other meaning.</p><p></p><p>Ye Changsheng died three months before Ye Wuyu, passing away peacefully at home, and at that time Ye Wuyu was about to take the imperial examination, the academy had even opened a training session, and after the training, he went directly to the examination.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had to pay money for that.</p><p></p><p>When he returned home after the exam, he only saw the coffin.</p><p></p><p>And he, too, died of a wind-cold disease a few months later, and then...</p><p></p><p>"No, my memory must not have a problem, otherwise I would have noticed it long ago, but there is another explanation for all this."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze shifted from the ancestral tablet to the gradually darkening sky outside the window, and he said quietly.</p><p></p><p>"Unless the original owner's memory was altered before his death, only then would I not have noticed."</p><p></p><p>How did he die? Died of illness.</p><p>How did his father Ye Changsheng die? He did not witness it, but the answer in his memory was also that he died of illness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu did not think much of it at first, but now when he thought about it, there was something suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Changsheng used to be a prison guard in the Heavenly Prison, even if he made no further progress later, but his realm was a real Realm One cultivator.</p><p></p><p>A Realm One cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It may not be able to extend one's lifespan, but the physique and vitality are much stronger than ordinary people, and there is also a spiritual mechanism within. In this world, it is not uncommon to live over a hundred years, and even seventy or eighty years old is considered normal. How could one easily die of illness?</p><p></p><p>As for himself?</p><p></p><p>Although he had not delved into cultivation before, he was still a young man. How could he have just died so easily? But the past is like smoke, how to investigate it?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu pondered for a long time, and the sky had already darkened. He did not light a candle, but just watched the silent darkness gradually envelop the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out a hand, spreading it open. A small black figure slowly condensed in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Shendao technique - Tian Yan.</p><p></p><p>The black figure in his palm bowed slightly towards him.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>A scene appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A dilapidated small courtyard without a trace of light, a shabby wooden house, the corners of the walls covered in dust and cobwebs...</p><p></p><p>So the Tian Yan shendao technique can directly show the scene, truly mysterious and profound.</p><p></p><p>These familiar scenes made Ye Wuyu realize that this was his own home.</p><p></p><p>But when was this? Ye Wuyu was a little puzzled, as this was the first time he used Tian Yan, and he was not familiar with this divine ability, using it completely instinctively.</p><p></p><p>But this scene should not be the past, but the future, or even the present some time later.</p><p></p><p>Because his courtyard had never been so dirty and messy before.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze slowly moved within the scene, and suddenly, his pupils contracted slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the courtyard gate, a small figure stood in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>A little girl in red clothes, holding a worn-out cloth doll, standing outside the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>"Knock, knock, knock..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The luxurious carriage slowly stopped in front of a mansion, and Ma Liu immediately ran to the side, kneeling down, allowing the person in the carriage to step on him.</p><p></p><p>Wu Zuolong's face was gloomy as he was about to enter the mansion.</p><p></p><p>"Third Young Master, are you not keeping the woman in the carriage?" Ma Liu reminded cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"This young master is not in the mood right now, get rid of her."</p><p></p><p>A somewhat hurried voice came from the carriage, and a graceful woman poked her head out, "Third Young Master, we had an agreement..."</p><p></p><p>Before she could finish, Wu Zuolong threw a few silver coins, "Take the money and get lost."</p><p></p><p>He then walked into the mansion.</p><p></p><p>Ma Liu stood in place, taking half of the silver coins and putting them in his own pocket, then glaring fiercely at the woman until she left.</p><p></p><p>His eyes then revealed a contemplative look.</p><p></p><p>This Third Young Master, why has he been gloomy ever since he came back from a meal, and even didn't want the woman anymore.</p><p></p><p>Could it be because of those few people in the next compartment? I also dealt with them, scolding them through the door, and then being caught by a burly man who came out, and helped them settle the bill.</p><p></p><p>But at least I did something, right?</p><p></p><p>Wu Zuolong had no mood to care about other matters at the moment. He walked quickly through the spacious courtyard towards his own room.</p><p></p><p>He was very irritable now, with countless questions in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Because he had encountered a person.</p><p></p><p>A person who should have already died.</p><p></p><p>He walked very fast, not even noticing the figure coming towards him.</p><p></p><p>His footsteps paused slightly, and Wu Zuolong looked up slightly, meeting that stern gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Father." He lowered his head, his eyes flashing with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Slap."</p><p></p><p>The response was a merciless slap.</p><p></p><p>The bright red handprint was imprinted on his face, even causing him to stagger.</p><p></p><p>"You should be grateful that you didn't bring that woman into the house, otherwise it wouldn't just be this one slap, but breaking your legs."</p><p></p><p>"Useless good-for-nothing."</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate Wu waved his sleeve and walked past him, not even looking at him again.</p><p></p><p>Only Wu Zuolong was left standing there, head lowered.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes were fear, terror, humiliation and resentment.</p><p></p><p>As well as a trace of madness hidden beneath all the emotions.</p><p></p><p>Please see the author's note in the next chapter.

        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The duck was able to swim, so it wasn't too panicked in the well, only quacking a few times.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe and Ye Wuyou were both standing by the well.</p><p></p><p>The impression left on Ye Wuyou's mind was very deep.</p><p></p><p>When he fell into this well, there was something at the bottom pulling him, otherwise even if he had fallen down, he wouldn't have drowned here.</p><p></p><p>This was intelligence obtained at the cost of his life.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, are you sure this well is the place where that thing is?"</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the well was very normal, without any sense of abnormality.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze swept around the surroundings, finally resting on the well, and he nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had already looked around the entire village, apart from the desolate decay, there were only this group of living people left.</p><p></p><p>But within the desolation, this well was actually very normal.</p><p></p><p>Yet this was the biggest abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Quack... Quack!"</p><p></p><p>Under the frightened gaze of the man in the brocade robe, the duck that had been swimming in the well was suddenly grabbed by something and directly submerged into the water.</p><p></p><p>The water in the well gradually became calm after some splashing.</p><p></p><p>They pulled up the rope, but the duck's corpse did not reappear, instead, the rope was broken.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change made the man in the brocade robe's gaze tremble, but he soon calmed down. He now held up his hand, with his spiritual energy coiling, and shouted loudly:</p><p></p><p>"No matter what's in there, let me try the water first!"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy hung out like a rainbow and directly plunged into the water.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's gaze faltered, and then he withdrew his hand, the spiritual energy dissipating.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, the bottom is empty, does this well have no bottom?"</p><p></p><p>No bottom? Then how was he pulled up before?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's eyes revealed a complex expression, but after thinking about the strange thing within him, he felt that anything was possible.</p><p></p><p>The strange thing had also divided territories in the celestial prison before, and would not make contact without necessity.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because he had a "ghost" in his body that the well couldn't do anything to him?</p><p></p><p>"I think we should go down and take a look," Ye Wuyou pointed to the well.</p><p></p><p>He originally wanted to directly dismantle the well to see if there was anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>But since he found that there was still space in the well, even if the well was destroyed, it would be useless.</p><p>And that "eyeball" that couldn't be found anywhere in the village could only be in the well.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe thought for a while, he actually didn't want to go down the well in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps after not finding any abnormalities in the village for a few days, the only hope now was in this well.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let's go down and take a look."</p><p></p><p>He was about to jump down, but was grabbed by Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hold onto you, we'll go down together, otherwise I'm afraid we'll get separated."</p><p></p><p>"Okay." The man in the brocade robe felt this was right.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou said this because he was worried that if the man jumped down alone, he would just end up at the bottom of the well like before.</p><p></p><p>The two of them leaned against each other and jumped down.</p><p></p><p>"Splash, splash."</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the well, Ye Wuyou found that there were things in the water wrapping around his body.</p><p></p><p>It was the same way he had drowned before.</p><p></p><p>The same mistake, he wouldn't make it a second time.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to act, but the things wrapping around him were instantly severed, as the man in the brocade robe had taken action.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator at the Third Realm, whether in the solidification and control of spiritual energy, he was much stronger than Ye Wuyou. Even though the water was splashing violently in the well due to the man's techniques, Ye Wuyou was not accidentally injured.</p><p></p><p>The two of them continued sinking downward, until at a certain point, the man in the brocade robe stopped.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, the man in the brocade robe didn't stop, it was Ye Wuyou who was forced to stop.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was tightly grabbing the man's leg, and when he opened his eyes underwater, in the pitch-black water, half of the man's body had already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>It was not that he was severed, nor was the man in the brocade robe killed, but rather his upper body seemed to have entered the space at the bottom of the well, while his legs were still being held by Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou stretched out his other hand, but he felt a thin membrane-like barrier, and it was this barrier that prevented him from entering.</p><p></p><p>As if this thin membrane was rejecting him.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Ye Wuyou could sense a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>That was the aura that could be felt on the eighth layer of the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>But it was very weak, just a tiny bit.</p><p></p><p>Xia An's previous words echoed in Ye Wuyou's mind - between the mysterious and the mysterious, they would not come into contact with each other without special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>Was it because of the mystery on his own body? Ye Wuyou steeled his heart, and his entire spiritual mechanism began to circulate along a certain path, his fist imbued with a powerful aura, and the surrounding water surface seemed to have formed a vacuum.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts that Zhao Changhe had taught him were manifested at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He slammed his fist heavily against that membrane.</p><p></p><p>There was no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's tightly grasped leg moved slightly, and continued to tremble, as if something had happened to his upper body on the other side? Never mind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's mind moved, and the "ghost" on his body revealed itself, then condensed into an arm and slammed heavily against that membrane.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>That membrane was finally broken through by Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after entering, Ye Wuyou felt a huge suction force.</p><p></p><p>No, not a suction force, but a gravitational force.</p><p></p><p>Everything was upside down.</p><p></p><p>Two figures emerged from the other side of the well, or rather, they were spat out by the well.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's figure fell from midair, and the ghost behind him stretched out a giant hand to support him, landing steadily on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe was not so lucky, although his spiritual mechanism formed a protective barrier around his body, he still crashed heavily onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>He spat out some saliva, and with great difficulty got up from the ground, looking around as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the bottom of this well? This, this..."</p><p></p><p>This was still a village.</p><p></p><p>However, in contrast to the other side of the well, it was a dilapidated and blackened village.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the man in the brocade robe's surprise, Ye Wuyou was quite calm in accepting all this, because he had already seen the true appearance of the village earlier.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou knew that the "eyeball" must be in this place.</p><p></p><p>Because he could feel that strange aura.</p><p></p><p>"Let me ask you first, can your method really temporarily seal that thing?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe snapped out of his surprise and nodded. "Don't worry, that thing has no hands or feet, no matter how terrifying it is, it can't move. As long as we find it, everything will be fine."</p><p></p><p>The two walked slowly through the village, carefully observing everything around them.</p><p></p><p>Faint footsteps sounded, causing the two to turn their heads.</p><p></p><p>A decayed figure emerged, wearing a Taoist robe, but the entire person was like a mummy, without the slightest sign of life, obviously having been dead for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze fell on the face that had only a vague outline, and found that the person resembled an old man from the village on the other side of the well.</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Wuyou could act, the man in the brocade robe raised his hand and pointed, and his spiritual mechanism was like a sharp invisible knife, cutting off the mummy's head.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a trivial trick."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou felt that bringing this man in the brocade robe was the right decision, at least along the way, the other party acted very proactively.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe waved his slightly whitened sleeve, looking at the decaying Taoist priest slowly falling, just about to speak.</p><p></p><p>A black shadow shot over, and the two of them dodged to the side, the black shadow was a mass of viscous liquid, falling on the stones behind them, emitting a sizzling corrosive sound.</p><p></p><p>"There are more people?"</p><p></p><p>These people should have all been cultivators in life... Ye Wuyou thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe looked disdainful, as for these fellows, he would kill as many as came.</p><p></p><p>His Qi at the Third Realm manifested, his spiritual mechanism rampant, severing the head of the one who had sneak attacked them.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's aura was chilling and oppressive.</p><p></p><p>"Who else is there!" he roared.</p><p></p><p>However, as if answering his voice, one figure after another emerged from the corners of the village streets, slowly surrounding the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Those people's bodies were all decayed, obviously they were all dead.</p><p></p><p>But gradually, threads of spiritual mechanism began to appear on their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were even those with Third Realm auras...</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression suddenly fell.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

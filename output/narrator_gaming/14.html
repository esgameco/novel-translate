        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every anomaly has and only has one "divine ability".</p><p></p><p>According to the differences in anomalies, the divine abilities also vary. Some anomalies possess strong offensive capabilities, while others are generally harmless as long as you don't actively provoke them.</p><p></p><p>At least, that's how Xia Anmeng described it.</p><p></p><p>As countless blue-colored arms spread out and firmly grasped Ye Wuyou, an overwhelming sense of life-and-death suffocation swept over him.</p><p></p><p>The compression, the restraint, the oppressive sensations coursing through his entire body caused Ye Wuyou's bones to crackle.</p><p></p><p>The eerie blue-colored terrifying face drew closer and grew larger, gradually transforming from a normal human face into a gaping, blood-red maw before Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>At the brink of life and death, Ye Wuyou could only feel the pain coursing through his body, nearly causing him to faint.</p><p></p><p>"The pain, it's too painful. In the face of life and death, you've tried everything you could, but ultimately failed due to your own weakness and inability."</p><p></p><p>"But the heavens do not abandon the people. You start to crave power, and finally discover that the key lies within yourself."</p><p></p><p>"Completely devour and assimilate the remnant soul of the Sixth Realm within you. Not only will the thing before you pose no obstacle, even the remnants of the great Dao in this place will no longer be able to hinder your steps."</p><p></p><p>The narration - what is that dog barking about? Can't hear it, the voice is too soft.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing? Stop, stop it quickly!"</p><p>"You're insane! If this continues, my soul will be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>Huh? Whose voice is that? Xia Anmeng? That annoying woman is still yelling about something, can't she see I'm about to die here?</p><p></p><p>Get out of me, scram.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a faint glimmer of light burst out from within Ye Wuyou's body and hastily burrowed into the ring on Lu Caiwai's finger, as the latter lay unconscious on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"A relic from the bygone era. You harbored kind intentions, so I shall spare its life and only take six-tenths of its soul, which should be sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Tired, let destruction reign.</p><p></p><p>With his body crushed and distorted, black blood oozing from his seven orifices, the light in Ye Wuyou's eyes gradually faded.</p><p></p><p>Finally, at the weakest moment, everything seemed to come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>The massive soul power transformed into abundant vital energy, spreading and ravaging throughout his body. Aided by the spontaneous operation of the "Formless Heart Sutra", it gradually eroded everything.</p><p></p><p>What is "formless"?</p><p></p><p>Formless is to be detached from form.</p><p>Formless is to be detached from the self, to return to one's true nature.</p><p>Formless can become the form of all beings.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the first realm of the "Formless Heart Sutra" - the realm of no-self - has been attained.</p><p></p><p>The light in his eyes dimmed once more, and the next moment, the gaping blue maw swallowed him whole.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, this scene would appear as Ye Wuyou, who had been floating in the air, suddenly vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The world is a sea of blue.</p><p></p><p>The man walks through this world, unable to find any land.</p><p></p><p>The deep blue ocean seems to be the entirety of this world.</p><p></p><p>So he can only stand on the surface of the sea, his gaze gradually retracting from the distance until it falls upon his own feet.</p><p></p><p>The deep blue seawater reflects his face back at him.</p><p></p><p>Familiar, yet strangely unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>"Who am I?" This simple and natural question arises in his mind.</p><p></p><p>But soon, the question transforms within his thoughts - it no longer matters who I am, but rather, who can I become? His contemplation does not last long.</p><p></p><p>Ripples begin to spread across the azure surface of the sea.</p><p></p><p>The ripples disrupt his reflection and shatter his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The ripples grow more and more rapid, until a terrifying, deep vortex forms on the sea, and from its center, a colossal, illusory figure suddenly surges forth.</p><p></p><p>A huge, violet-colored face, with countless arms extending from it.</p><p></p><p>It rises from the surface of the sea, like a demonic deity, towering and gazing down upon the wavering, precarious human figure.</p><p></p><p>The man is soaked through, the seawater dripping down his wet, disheveled hair, but his eyes are fixed on the sight before him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The light in his eyes was indeed becoming clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>"I remember now," he said.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his hand, pointing to the azure-blue monster in front of him, and said, "It was you who ate me."</p><p></p><p>Then, after a moment of thought, he opened his mouth with interest, as if inquiring.</p><p></p><p>"Since you wanted to eat me, then being eaten by me in the end wouldn't be too unsatisfactory, would it?"</p><p></p><p>The huge, violet-blue human face showed no trace of emotion, with a lifeless gaze, only the same terrifying strangeness as before.</p><p></p><p>But soon, its gaze changed.</p><p></p><p>It shifted in position.</p><p></p><p>From the previous high above looking down, it gradually became level, and then looked up.</p><p></p><p>The human face with the lifeless gaze now opened its mouth, without a sound, but the countless hands waving continuously, it seemed to be issuing a roar?</p><p></p><p>Or was it a threat?</p><p></p><p>"Splash."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu removed his foot from the ground.</p><p></p><p>There was only a small pool of blue liquid and a small puddle of water left there.</p><p></p><p>Around the puddle was an endless expanse of land.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu continued on, walking steadily on the land, and the small puddle behind him gradually receded and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the prison cell, it was unusually quiet at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The mute woman and the legless man's standoff seemed to have ended, but now they were still standing apart, opposing each other.</p><p></p><p>The white jelly-like creature had been trying to crawl out of the cell for a long time, but it seemed that its body was too fat, and it still couldn't get out after a long time.</p><p></p><p>The remaining small child and the wooden stake were still quietly staying in the cell, appearing very well-behaved.</p><p></p><p>However, at the moment, the gaze of this group of strange beings, whether they had eyes or not, were all focused on one cell.</p><p></p><p>Just as his previous mysterious disappearance, Ye Wuyu mysteriously reappeared in the cell again.</p><p></p><p>There was no aura rippling around him, nor any cultivation level revealed, but he still attracted the gaze of all the strange beings present.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's figure floated down lightly from the suspension, one hand behind his back, calmly walking towards the front, towards the cell door.</p><p></p><p>His steps were neither hurried nor slow, unhurried and unruffled.</p><p></p><p>"Creak..."</p><p></p><p>The cell door was gently pushed open, and Ye Wuyu in a deep black prison guard uniform walked towards a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The legless man's gaze was still empty, and after about a few seconds, he also walked towards Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>On the side, all the strange beings were silently observing this scene.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the two figures met.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu did not speak, but the legless man shook his head, as if expressing something.</p><p></p><p>Then, he calmly reached out his hand and gently placed it on the legless man's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>With a tinge of sarcasm in his words, he said, "You are just the remnants of the great Dao, why are you standing here talking to me?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The legless man's figure involuntarily knelt down.</p><p></p><p>In the candlelight, only the shadow of his legs gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And in the cell, the woman's reflection gradually had her legs restored.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu withdrew his gaze, no longer looking at the legless man, and turned to walk towards the mute woman behind him.</p><p></p><p>The gray-robed mute woman, seeing Ye Wuyu approaching, seemed to have a somewhat humanized "excitement", turning around a few times in her original spot.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the mute woman knelt down in front of Ye Wuyu, her body close to his thigh.</p><p></p><p>Then she took his hand, threading it through her long, disheveled hair, greedily caressing it.</p><p></p><p>The fingertips felt cold and lifeless, and Ye Wuyu gently closed his eyes, his expression serene and content.</p><p></p><p>He stretched out his other hand, stroking the mute woman's hair, feeling the slight trembling of her cold body due to excitement, and murmured,</p><p></p><p>"Today I know that I am myself."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The figure of the Legless Man seemed a bit sluggish.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he lacked legs, and simply getting up from the ground required great effort.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Wuyou would not give the other party a chance to rise.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Lu Caiwei had already rushed in front of the opponent.</p><p></p><p>She could not see, but Ye Wuyou created such a commotion that she could clearly sense the location of the other party.</p><p></p><p>The sword energy poured down like rain.</p><p></p><p>On the sword edge, a three-foot azure qi visibly erupted, something only cultivators at the Third Realm could produce.</p><p></p><p>A close-range full-power strike from a Third Realm cultivator should be enough to kill this strange being, right? After all, the supernatural abilities displayed by the Legless Man did not seem to be offensive in nature, but more focused on restricting movement.</p><p></p><p>The sword finally descended.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A thunderous sound erupted in the dim corridor, and a pit over a zhang wide cracked open on the dust-covered ground, kicking up a swirling cloud of dirt.</p><p></p><p>That familiar feeling assailed him again.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Wuyou found himself trapped in the loop once more, his movements restricted.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei's expression was somewhat bewildered. She had fallen to the ground, not quite understanding what had happened.</p><p></p><p>Her sword strike seemed to have... missed? She tightened her grip on the long sword and used it to prop herself up, trying to stand.</p><p></p><p>But no matter how many times she tried, she could not get up.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, she became flustered, her usually calm expression now tinged with panic.</p><p></p><p>What's happening to me? As the swirling dust settled, the original appearance of the corridor was revealed.</p><p></p><p>The candle flames flickered, never extinguishing.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyou's vision, the Legless Man had now risen from the ground, with no visible damage.</p><p></p><p>The Legless Man was still legless, his ghostly form in the candlelight still only having two feet.</p><p></p><p>But... it seemed more substantial than before? And beside him, Lu Caiwei sat on the ground in a daze, repeatedly trying to get up, but her legs behind her seemed to no longer obey her.</p><p></p><p>The candlelight cast her shadow on the wall.</p><p></p><p>The shadow of the woman had no legs.</p><p></p><p>The Legless Man now slowly approached Ye Wuyou, no longer sparing a glance at Lu Caiwei, the initial fervor in his eyes now mostly gone.</p><p></p><p>So this is the strangeness? </p><p></p><p>Perhaps as a strange being, the Legless Man indeed lacks strong offensive capabilities...</p><p></p><p>He merely "took" the legs of a person.</p><p></p><p>But in this ghostly place, what difference is there between being legless and being dead? Ye Wuyou was now immobilized, and the earlier coherent narration in his mind had fallen silent, as if he had cultivated the Silence Meditation, not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>Everything around seemed to have quieted down, only the sound of the Legless Man's footsteps echoing through the corridor, clear and distinct.</p><p></p><p>The footsteps suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>The Legless Man's form halted a few meters away from Ye Wuyou, his dim, hollow gaze facing forward, but without any reflection.</p><p></p><p>"Watch your back," Xia Anmeng's voice came from within.</p><p></p><p>But it lacked any conviction.</p><p></p><p>If she were still a Sixth Realm cultivator, she would be confident in turning the tide.</p><p></p><p>But now she was just a lingering soul, barely able to cling to the other person, observing this absurd scene.</p><p></p><p>His back, huh? Ye Wuyou smiled. He didn't know what the Legless Man had done, but right now he couldn't even turn his head.</p><p></p><p>Yet even so, he still knew what was happening behind him.</p><p></p><p>A cold breath sounded in Ye Wuyou's ear, then spread across the back of his neck.</p><p></p><p>Human breath is warm.</p><p>But this icy breath... do strange beings need to breathe as well?</p><p>He could even hear that almost greedy, frenzied inhalation, like a starving dog sniffing at food.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou felt a bit helpless. Did he look that delicious in the other's eyes?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a frigid body lightly pressed against his back.</p><p>A strand of hair fell onto his shoulder, and the two faint touches on his spine made Ye Wuyou's expression change slightly.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Stunned.</p><p></p><p>Eerie... are there females as well?</p><p></p><p>Or rather, these beings referred to as the remnants of the Great Dao, called eerie, do they even have a gender?</p><p></p><p>"...You seem to have a way with women?" Even in this terrifying situation, Xia Anmeng couldn't help but say a sentence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression was somewhat numb, and upon hearing this, he even managed a stiff smile.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, but I feel like I'm about to be bitten to death by her."</p><p></p><p>The imagined being bitten to death did not happen...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't know how long the other party had been sniffing him, but he felt like it had been a century.</p><p></p><p>Until the figure behind him left, Ye Wuyu finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>But he soon tensed up again, in his vision that could not turn his head, a figure slowly emerged from behind him.</p><p></p><p>A gray-white floor-length dress, nearly floor-length hair, which now fell in front of her, obscuring her face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the other party only left him a back view, and then stood in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, she let out a series of incomprehensible notes towards the footless man standing in front.</p><p></p><p>"Sha... Aba Aba... Ah."</p><p></p><p>What is this? A mute?</p><p></p><p>This eerie woman, is she a mute?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't understand, but the footless man might have understood.</p><p></p><p>The hollow gray-white eyes seemed to focus for a moment, then the footless man shook his head, seemingly rejecting the other's proposal.</p><p></p><p>"Ah..."</p><p></p><p>The footless man's figure finally continued to move forward.</p><p></p><p>Only a few meters away.</p><p></p><p>The mute woman finally stopped speaking, or rather, she couldn't speak in the first place.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>A sharp buzzing sound rang out, and at this moment Ye Wuyu only felt like there was an electric current passing through his brain, with constant ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>But immediately, he was surprised to find that his body had regained control.</p><p></p><p>The cycle had been broken again.</p><p></p><p>The mute woman's figure was slightly bent, and her nearly floor-length hair was now flying all over the place.</p><p></p><p>It seems she is shouting.</p><p></p><p>But it is silent.</p><p></p><p>Even so, a tuft of long hair still covered her face.</p><p></p><p>And the footless man finally stopped, unable to take another step, and unable to move at all.</p><p></p><p>Between the eerie and the eerie, unless there are special circumstances, the two eerie will not interfere with each other.</p><p></p><p>But obviously, this is a special situation.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up, find a cage to go in first, they are in a state of collision between two eerie now, and once this happens, the two eerie will be in a long stalemate." Xia Anmeng reminded.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu reacted quickly, without waiting for Xia Anmeng to finish speaking, he went to Lu Caiwei's side and lifted her up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Six cages, three with eerie, three empty.</p><p></p><p>Each cage is a separate domain, and the eerie in different cages cannot enter each other's cages.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze swept over the child with evil aura, the white jelly skin, and he directly gave up.</p><p></p><p>As for the huge tree root... it doesn't seem to be that dangerous.</p><p></p><p>But after experiencing so much, Ye Wuyu felt that the eerie might possess such supernatural powers, and whether they have the ability to kill cannot be judged by appearance.</p><p></p><p>So, there are only three empty cages left.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu remembered which cage the footless man was in, and he definitely wouldn't choose that one.</p><p></p><p>So the options are now down to two empty cages.</p><p></p><p>One is the mute woman's, and the other is empty, and he doesn't know what eerie is inside, or where that eerie has gone...</p><p></p><p>If he has to choose, Ye Wuyu thinks the mute woman's cage is better.</p><p></p><p>After all, the mute woman can fight with the footless man for him.</p><p></p><p>At worst, he can just use his good looks.</p><p></p><p>So now it's down to a choice between the two.</p><p></p><p>Which one should it be?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

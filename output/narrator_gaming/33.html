        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the Yunwu Mountain Range, there was a village called Yunwu Village.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was cultivators honing their skills or outsiders coming to the mountain to gather herbs, they would all pass through this village.</p><p></p><p>But how long this village had existed, and who exactly lived within it, were mysteries to most.</p><p></p><p>Some had pondered a question - with the existence of demonic beasts in the Yunwu Mountains, and countless cultivators coming and going, surely there must be some fugitives taking refuge here, yet the village remained unharmed. But these questions had gradually been forgotten over time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the world is bustling with activity, who would pay any mind to a simple wayside village?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Wang at the village entrance was silently walking towards the eastern end of the village, leaning on his cane. Seeing the scene unfolding before him, the wrinkles on his face cracked into a slight smile as he sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the vigor of youth."</p><p></p><p>At the eastern end of the village, on an open space, a group of figures had gathered.</p><p></p><p>A young man, his long hair disheveled behind him, had dark circles under his eyes and a somewhat haggard appearance, his spirit seeming a bit unstable. He was currently standing on a wooden crate, so that the surrounding people could see him better.</p><p></p><p>He was shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling you, I'm not a villager, my identity is definitely not that of a villager! Can't you see that clearly?"</p><p></p><p>[Ah yes, you are not truly a villager, this is but an illusion, a dream-like realm of Sumeru, yet the common folk are too dull to see through this haze...]</p><p></p><p>The man took a deep breath and shouted again.</p><p></p><p>"My true identity is that of a seer, definitely not a villager!"</p><p></p><p>[A seer... no no no, you have already seen through it all, you are not a mere seer, but one destined to shatter the celestial prisons and awe the world, looking down upon all under heaven.]</p><p></p><p>His words did not gain any understanding from the surrounding people, but instead elicited cheerful laughter.</p><p></p><p>Among them, a woman with a resolute bearing chuckled and pointed at him.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyu, why don't you tell everyone what a 'seer' is?"</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing, why bother with this lunatic?" A burly man standing nearby crossed his arms, his expression disdainful.</p><p></p><p>The man being called a lunatic was Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>His mental state seemed a bit unstable, but his voice was clear.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu looked at the crowd below, sweeping his gaze, then pointed a sharp look at a figure.</p><p></p><p>"I am a seer, and I will execute you, you wicked woman, you are not human, you are a wolf!"</p><p></p><p>[Yes, you have long since seen that the foul woman is not human, but a demonic fox, one of the three-tailed foxes remaining in the Great Yan Empire. If she were to be captured, though it may be considered unethical, she would surpass all other women in the world...]</p><p></p><p>The woman Ye Wuyu pointed at was dressed in white, with smooth blue-black hair cascading down her shoulders, her face alluringly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Being pointed at by Ye Wuyu, she momentarily faltered, but then quickly scoffed and made to leave.</p><p></p><p>After all, who would bother arguing with a lunatic?</p><p></p><p>"Demon, where do you think you're going!" Ye Wuyu shouted, then leaped towards the woman.</p><p></p><p>He reached out, trying to grab her, but grasped only empty air.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, he had grabbed at the air behind her.</p><p></p><p>Baiyu was stunned, seemingly not understanding what he was trying to do.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, that's strange, I could have sworn I saw a tail just now." Ye Wuyu muttered, his two dark eye sockets staring.</p><p></p><p>He had clearly seen a long, fluffy tail behind her just now, but now there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Something must be wrong!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Ye Wuyu, to the shock of the onlookers, slapped the woman's round, pert buttocks.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by the woman's cry, Ye Wuyu was quickly pinned to the ground by the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Listen to me, she's not human, she has a tail!" Ye Wuyu pleaded.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you lunatic, if you keep acting crazy we'll kick you out of the village!" the surrounding people scolded.</p><p></p><p>"You're the lunatics, your whole family are lunatics, I'm warning you not to hit me, I'm a student, I have depression!" Ye Wuyu angrily raised his fist and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"A student? You can't even handle being a newborn!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old man, I'll beat you to death." </p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing was currently supporting Bai Luo Yan to the side, constantly comforting her.</p><p></p><p>"Sister Bai, don't mind this lunatic, you know what kind of person he is, all these years he's never been normal..."</p><p>"It's fine, I don't mind..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd soon dispersed.</p><p></p><p>This was just an everyday farce in the village, and the people just treated it as entertainment.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu patted the dust off his clothes, then spat out a few times, expelling the mud from his mouth, then looked around with a dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>【Heaven is about to bestow a great mission upon this person, but first it must temper their will, labor their sinews and bones, and starve their flesh... This is merely an obstacle on your path forward, and upon realizing this, you have awakened from this illusion.】</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression remained unmoved, he reached out and dug in his ear, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>How annoying, why do you have to speak in my head.</p><p></p><p>And why does this "Heaven bestowing a great mission" have to involve suffering? </p><p>Whoever wants to suffer, let them suffer.</p><p></p><p>The lunatic's bewilderment was only temporary, Ye Wuyu quickly composed himself and strolled forward.</p><p></p><p>Like a village rascal.</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Wang, you're still alive? Your body is really sturdy, shall I go mooch a meal off you later?"</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Liu, what are you carrying? What, it's not food? I think you should try it first before deciding if it's edible or not."</p><p></p><p>"Hey... what are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu walked over, where a man in cloth clothes was squatting, his expression somewhat gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had an impression of this person in his mind, the cloth-clad man was named Tu Su, who normally liked to keep company with livestock, and didn't like to interact with people.</p><p></p><p>Livestock refers to chickens, ducks, cattle, and sheep.</p><p></p><p>At the moment he was squatting on the ground, staring intently at an ant nest in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, are you... herding? Do ants also need herding?" Ye Wuyu also squatted down.</p><p></p><p>"Shh."</p><p></p><p>Tu Su gestured for silence, then with a solemn expression, crossed his hands in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?" Ye Wuyu asked.</p><p></p><p>"I feel... my identity may be a bit unusual." Tu Su said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Unusual?" Ye Wuyu's expression faltered, then he realized something and looked around warily.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu then whispered softly.</p><p></p><p>"You've realized it too?"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Tu Su nodded, his eyes fixed on the ants, his expression extremely serious.</p><p></p><p>"Then what's your identity? I'm a fortune-teller, let's exchange information."</p><p></p><p>"I'm... fuck, it's you." Tu Su just opened his mouth, but then looked beside him and saw it was Ye Wuyu, the disgust in his expression completely disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu chuckled, then reached out his dirty hand to pat Tu Su's sleeve, laughing mischievously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't leave it half-said, what's unusual about you? We're both just normal people after all."</p><p></p><p>Normal people... you're a lunatic, okay? Tu Su shook his head, but didn't drive Ye Wuyu away.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a while, Tu Su pointed at the ants on the ground and said quietly.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like I can control these ants."</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's that supposed to be?" Ye Wuyu said.</p><p></p><p>"You... sigh, even if I tell you, you won't understand, you lunatic."</p><p></p><p>"Say so much, just show me then." Ye Wuyu said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Tu Su was silent for a while, then stretched out his hands, making difficult gestures in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>Primitive yet chaotic mudra appeared between his fingers, but they were very uncoordinated, and Tu Su tried many times.</p><p></p><p>Finally, after the tenth time arranging the mudra, a miraculous thing happened.</p><p></p><p>The scattered ants on the ground were now neatly lined up in rows, and were standing still without moving.</p><p></p><p>"It really... worked." Tu Su's expression was dazed, as if he couldn't quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression was surprised, just about to exclaim, but a voice suddenly echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【With a small trick, you have stolen the inheritance techniques of the Beast Taming Sect, and from now on your methods will rise to a higher level, controlling dragons soaring in the nine heavens will be no difficult task.】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In her dream, she was running happily across the vast grasslands of Qingqiu, surrounded by her tribesmen, her younger sister, and her elder brother. </p><p></p><p>The fox was free.</p><p></p><p>As a member of the royal bloodline, she only needed to quietly consume the essence of the sun and moon, and she would become a great demon after a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Until that day, when the skies over Qingqiu changed.</p><p></p><p>The elders on the throne and her own siblings fought against each other.</p><p></p><p>The lush and vibrant Qingqiu instantly turned into a barren, blood-soaked land.</p><p></p><p>As young as they were, they could only flee.</p><p></p><p>The tribesmen around them grew fewer and fewer, either dying on the road or being captured...</p><p></p><p>In the end, only she and her sister crossed the endless mountains, arriving at a remote human domain, the Great Yan.</p><p></p><p>She and her sister got into an argument.</p><p></p><p>She wanted to live peacefully, cultivate quietly, and perhaps one day return to Qingqiu, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>Her sister did not want that. She wanted power, she wanted to go back to Qingqiu and kill all those who had brought them to this state.</p><p></p><p>For this, her sister did not hesitate to kill people and take their essence, so that her cultivation could advance faster.</p><p></p><p>"Humans kill us, so we'll eat humans. What's wrong with that?"</p><p></p><p>"Sister, I think you've lost your mind. If that's your mindset, I might as well eat you now, rather than let you be tormented by humans later."</p><p></p><p>Bailu could feel her sister's sincere murderous intent, so the two went their separate ways.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to the illusionary techniques of the fox demons, as well as her own diligence, she joined a human sect to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>At first, Bailu thought humans were afraid of demons because demons ate people.</p><p></p><p>But after these years in the Great Yan, she found that some humans were more terrifying than demons.</p><p></p><p>Bailu began to crave power.</p><p></p><p>Images flashed through her mind, and in the end, she found her sister in the Yunwu Mountains.</p><p></p><p>Their relationship was no longer as it was before. What Bailu wanted was an opportunity, the Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell.</p><p></p><p>Bailu didn't actually want to kill her, but later, she was killed by a prison guard from the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she heard the sound of the bell.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, wake up, wake up."</p><p></p><p>"Look, her flesh... it's growing back, and her wounds have healed."</p><p></p><p>"You crazy bastard, you actually managed to revive her even after she died."</p><p></p><p>So noisy.</p><p></p><p>The dream dissipated, and Bailu's consciousness gradually became clear.</p><p></p><p>She felt that she was missing a tail...</p><p></p><p>She knew what this meant.</p><p></p><p>"So I died once... was that a near-death experience?" Bailu thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>She then slowly got up from the ground, her gaze somewhat weary as she looked around.</p><p></p><p>The village...</p><p></p><p>The memories from earlier were also in her mind, and she was surprised and fearful.</p><p></p><p>Weren't all the people in this village killed that night? Why was she here, thinking she was a villager? It was as if her entire perception had been altered.</p><p></p><p>If she hadn't died once, she truly wouldn't have remembered those things.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the people around her, Bailu pondered for a moment, then made up her mind.</p><p></p><p>Since she had regained her memories, she would now try to find a way to leave this place. As for this mysterious village, it would be best not to stir up any trouble.</p><p></p><p>For now, she would just pretend that everything was normal.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, she forced a weak smile onto her face and gently said to the people around her, "Thank you all for your concern, but I'm fine now. You can all go."</p><p></p><p>Xurang's rough voice came from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Little Bailu, I'm glad you're okay, but you should thank that crazy guy. If it weren't for him, you wouldn't be alive."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, you should really thank the crazy guy."</p><p></p><p>The crazy guy? Was that the strange and erratic prison guard? And his methods were quite bizarre before.</p><p></p><p>Now that the person is a lunatic, should she take the opportunity to kill him and then leave the village?</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Her gaze turned towards Ye Wuyou, who was standing beside her at the moment, and judging by his expression, he seemed to be intently gazing at her.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, a madman... What are you looking at, is it really that good-looking?</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu was very confident in her own appearance. As a fox demon from the royal clan, whether as a demon or as a human, she was the most dazzling beauty in the world.</p><p></p><p>However, just as she was thinking this to herself, the person in front of her suddenly opened his mouth and responded.</p><p></p><p>"I'm looking at your tail, at first there were three, tsk, now there are only two, hey, what happened to the other one, did I see it wrong?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou rubbed his eyes and then walked closer, squatting down. </p><p></p><p>His gaze was directed towards the edge of the white dress, as if he wanted to see where the tail was and how it grew out.</p><p></p><p>A fierce gust of wind passed by his ear, but then abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>"You madman, what are you trying to do to the young lady of the Bai family? Even if you saved someone else, it won't work."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou turned his head, and there was a palm in front of his face. </p><p></p><p>It had stopped right next to his cheek, seemingly about to slap him.</p><p></p><p>But for some reason, it had stopped.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept across the hem of the dress, across the palm, and then up to the towering mountains, finally resting on the angry yet still beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you really don't have a tail..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, a shrill scream came from the woman.</p><p></p><p>Her voice was full of anger and bewilderment!</p><p></p><p>"Why, why do you have the techniques of the Demon Beast Sect? </p><p></p><p>Why! Why am I your spirit beast?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's eyes revealed a trace of desolation, her expression filled with deep confusion.</p><p></p><p>She and the Ye Wuyou in front of her, for some unknown reason, had developed a connection.</p><p></p><p>As a fox demon, she was very clear about the origin of this connection.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Bai Lu so agitated, the nearby Lin Qingqing hurriedly supported her, and then the surrounding people started discussing in a clamor.</p><p></p><p>"What was Bai Miss just saying? I didn't understand at all."</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, could it be that after being saved by the madman, she's also become a madwoman?"</p><p></p><p>"Bai Miss, don't be angry, calm down first. Just now you even stopped breathing, it was the madman who saved you."</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's figure almost started trembling, and a tear glistened at the corner of her beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>Saved me?</p><p></p><p>This is an innate divine ability of the fox demons of the Qingqiu royal clan, one tail for one life.</p><p></p><p>What does this have to do with him? And isn't he a prison guard of the Heavenly Prison? Why does he have the inheritance of the Demon Beast Sect's spirit beast techniques?</p><p></p><p>I would have just slept for a while after dying once, but now I've woken up and become someone else's spirit beast?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou just glanced at her, not seeming to understand the meaning of her words, and then buried his head again, carefully examining the dress.</p><p></p><p>Tail, tail...</p><p></p><p>Then he was forcibly separated by someone.</p><p></p><p>"That's enough, madman. Although saving a life means the other person should offer themselves in return, in your case, you can only be a beast of burden in your next life..."</p><p></p><p>But then, Lin Qingqing covered her chin and looked Ye Wuyou up and down, letting out a soft exclamation.</p><p></p><p>"But if you can cure your madness, and you look not bad, the Miss might consider offering herself to you."</p><p></p><p>The usually silent Bai Changzhen, who was holding a book, added a finishing blow from the side.</p><p></p><p>"No way."</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze turned to him, with puzzlement in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You see, the Miss of the Bai family is also mad, and Ye Wuyou is a madman too. I think they... are quite well-matched."</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's figure trembled, still immersed in this reality that she could not accept.</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, her eyes darkened even more, and she angrily retorted.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a madwoman, you all, you villagers who can't see the truth, you are the madmen!"</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as she said these words, the gazes of the crowd suddenly paused, and then they all turned to look at Ye Wuyou, silently nodding to each other.</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzhen, who was holding a book bag, shook his head slightly and sighed with deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>"See, she's still saying she's not a madwoman, even her words are the same."</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the Heavenly Prison, Lu Qingshan and Ye Wuyou walked together for a stretch.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Qingshan, if I learn that divine art, what's the point of becoming your disciple?" </p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou had already mastered the Heavenly Transformation Art, but he had not revealed it.</p><p></p><p>If others did not know the value of the divine art, how could Lu Qingshan not know? </p><p></p><p>To just take a glance and learn such a divine technique - if he were to openly admit to it, how would the other party think of him?</p><p></p><p>He knew Lu Qingshan might have some guesses, but as the latter had said, everyone has their secrets, and Lu Qingshan would not pry.</p><p></p><p>But the human heart is hard to fathom, who could guarantee anything?</p><p></p><p>Even if Lu Qingshan had no intentions towards him, what if others found out?</p><p></p><p>So he could only conceal this fact, and honestly prepare to go to the capital city later.</p><p></p><p>But for now, having learned the Heavenly Transformation Art, at least he no longer had to worry about the eerie corruption, and his life was not in danger.</p><p></p><p>Shouldn't he seize the opportunity to discuss the conditions?</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan softly said, "Not a disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>"A successor."</p><p></p><p>Aren't disciple and successor the same thing?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou pondered, but soon realized the other had diverted the topic.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Qingshan, you have to give me some hope, right? When old man Zhao wanted to take me as a disciple, he really made a big show of it, one good thing after another."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan had his hands behind his back, walking slowly, while Ye Wuyou walked in front, occasionally stopping to urge him on.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ye Wuyou's words, Lu Qingshan naturally knew what he meant, but his expression was only one of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"If you truly can become my successor, I have the most complete library in the Great Yan for you to study..."</p><p></p><p>"No need, I don't like those things, I read the Spring and Autumn Annals."</p><p></p><p>What is the Spring and Autumn Annals? Lu Qingshan was slightly taken aback, but after thinking about it, he didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>This kid, how dare he negotiate conditions with me? But for some reason, he didn't feel averse to it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's hand slowly opened within his wide sleeve, and a small black figure gradually materialized, then bowed deeply three times in succession.</p><p></p><p>Not just once like before, but three times in a row.</p><p></p><p>Huh... Lu Qingshan's expression became slightly surprised, then turned solemn and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He had used the Heavenly Transformation to calculate Ye Wuyou's destiny.</p><p></p><p>The final scene was that Ye Wuyou would be unable to comprehend the divine art of the Heavenly Transformation, and ultimately settle for the divine art beneath the Heavenly Prison, but in doing so, he would also shed the eerie aura, living out his life as an ordinary Heavenly Prison guard.</p><p></p><p>So he had previously prevented Ye Wuyou from becoming his disciple, and actively asked if he was willing to accept another version of himself.</p><p></p><p>This was Ye Wuyou's destiny, and Lu Qingshan did not want to change it, for a normal cultivator to live peacefully in this relatively stable world would be a fortunate life.</p><p></p><p>But now, the previously clear destiny seemed to have undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>His steps came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Qingshan, why did you stop? I need to get back to the Heavenly Prison to complete my duties, and as my superior, you're the one slacking off here."</p><p></p><p>What is "slacking off"? The hand in the sleeve clenched slightly, and Lu Qingshan's face once again wore that carefree smile as he continued walking forward.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyou, if you truly can master the Heavenly Transformation and become my successor, then you will be free to do as you please in this Great Yan."</p><p></p><p>This time it was Ye Wuyou's turn to stop in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>But he stopped not because of anything else, solely because Lu Qingshan's words had left him dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Do whatever I want?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever you want," Lu Qingshan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>This was really going overboard... Looks like Lu Qingshan was the real narrator here.</p><p></p><p>[Arrogant, there is actually such an arrogant person in this world, you sneer and directly mock him that you want to kill all under heaven, let's see if he dares to spout such nonsense.]</p><p></p><p>"Then what if I want to kill people?" Ye Wuyou's eyes flashed with a hint of coldness. He didn't mean anything by this, he just wanted to see how the other would respond to such a heretical statement.</p><p></p><p>"You can." Lu Qingshan's tone was serene, as if the words "kill people" were no different to him than stepping on an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Can I kill anyone?" Ye Wuyou asked, laughing bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan nodded slightly, as if he had seriously considered Ye Wuyou's question.</p><p></p><p>"Except the one sitting in that chair, the rest are fair game," Lu Qingshan answered.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou: "..."</p><p></p><p>[...]</p><p></p><p>"Lu Qingshan, aren't you afraid that I'll become your successor and then run amok, killing the innocent?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid," Lu Qingshan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"You trust me that much?" Ye Wuyou was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan glanced at him, his footsteps uninterrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Well, not exactly, but..."</p><p></p><p>As if recalling something, Lu Qingshan joked.</p><p></p><p>"At most it's just a punch."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was stunned for a moment, although he was reluctant to admit it, but the other seemed to be telling the truth.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's expression became pensive, then he chuckled lightly and spoke in a level tone.</p><p></p><p>"A gentleman has his principles, and the word 'principles' is the dimension in which one acts. Kept in the heart, it becomes 'righteousness'. Ye Wuyou, I believe you will not become such a person."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou had nothing more to say.</p><p></p><p>Arguing with a scholar was not a wise thing to do.</p><p></p><p>The two fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Until they reached a fork in the road just before the Heavenly Prison, Lu Qingshan stopped.</p><p></p><p>"After this month, I'll be going to the capital city again. You should come along, whether or not you can ultimately learn the Heavenly Transformation, comprehending the Twelve Divine Pillars will greatly benefit you..."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lu Qingshan was about to leave first, Ye Wuyou thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I want to quickly improve my cultivation level and learn divine techniques, is there any way?"</p><p></p><p>The eerie matter had been temporarily resolved, but Ye Wuyou had not forgotten that he was still just a novice at the first realm.</p><p></p><p>Although he had previously been able to slay even third-realm cultivators, that was while relying on the "Ghost" power. And most of the time it was through sneak attacks.</p><p></p><p>Without the unrestricted use of the "Ghost" spirit hand, Ye Wuyou, though reluctant to admit it, was indeed somewhat weak in his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The last desperate move of the man in the brocade robe had really opened Ye Wuyou's eyes, and he knew that every cultivator in this world had some hidden trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lu Qingshan shook his head slightly, his expression calm as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyou, you've asked the wrong person, I don't fight."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's expression was a bit strange. He found that he could always hear some incredibly absurd words from Lu Qingshan's mouth.</p><p></p><p>You don't fight? Who was it that punched me into the wall in the Heavenly Prison before? But Lu Qingshan still pointed him in the right direction.</p><p></p><p>"Go find Zhao Changhe, he can teach you."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"That's how it is, the Warden sent me to find you," Ye Wuyou said, shrugging his shoulders at the stern-faced Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired and bearded Zhao Changhe's expression was not good. He let out a heavy grunt, then carefully scanned the area around them, making sure there was no one else present.</p><p></p><p>When Ye Wuyou wondered what he was looking at, he saw Zhao Changhe angrily cursing the empty air.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Qingshan, Lu Qingshan, how dare you dump your trash on me every day!"</p><p></p><p>After venting, Zhao Changhe's expression eased a bit, then he turned back to Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing, young Ye, not directed at you."</p><p></p><p>"No worries, no worries..."</p><p></p><p>[You continue to endure, but ultimately can no longer tolerate it. There's no need to hold back anymore. This old fool dares to mock you, you immediately strike, even if his realm is far beyond yours, so what? We cultivators do not hesitate to kill across realms, transcending boundaries to slay the enemy is nothing.]</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe stroked his beard, his eyes narrowing slightly as he scrutinized Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the first realm in body cultivation, he...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I watched this kid complete the task from start to finish, and I also know his talent.</p><p></p><p>Although I spoke some foul words, Zhao Changhe did not casually dismiss him.</p><p></p><p>Although his hair was all white, Zhao Changhe's gaze was still sharp, and he could see the slight changes in Ye Wuyu's behavior and mentality after this trip.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on the corner of Zhao Changhe's mouth, and then he turned and walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Old man has no time to teach you."</p><p></p><p>Before Ye Wuyu could ask, Zhao Changhe's words came again.</p><p></p><p>"Follow the old man, there is a person who is particularly suitable to train you, this fearless crazy kid."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Except for the mysterious eighth floor, this was the first time Ye Wuyu had stepped into the deeper part of the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>The [Ding] level guards could only go down to the second floor at most.</p><p></p><p>The first floor of the Heavenly Prison was just for outsiders to see, and there were many prisoners with high status in the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The second floor was still human, but there were a few faint cultivator auras.</p><p></p><p>The third floor, still human... Although those people had their realms sealed, Ye Wuyu could still feel their auras, which were not weaker than Lu Caiwei's.</p><p></p><p>But these people looked at him with fear.</p><p></p><p>But then Ye Wuyu realized that they were not afraid of him, but of Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>The fourth floor finally changed.</p><p></p><p>Because this floor housed demons, demons that had not transformed.</p><p></p><p>But most of these demons had wounds, and their spirits were depressed. Seeing Ye Wuyu and the two of them come, they remained silent and kept shrinking back.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't these demons kill?" Ye Wuyu asked the question in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The previous floors were for humans, and Ye Wuyu knew that some people in the outside world were hot potatoes, officials, or even elders of some sects.</p><p></p><p>Just keeping them imprisoned, Ye Wuyu could understand.</p><p></p><p>But for demons, just killing them directly would be enough, right?</p><p></p><p>"Kill them? These beasts have eaten people and committed sins to come here, killing them directly would be too easy for them." </p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, you think our Heavenly Prison has so many cultivation resources, pills, and precious things like demon hearts, where do they come from?"</p><p></p><p>"Ordinary demons can't even enter the Heavenly Prison, these beasts, even if they die one day, their corpses thrown outside can still be fought over by a group of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu understood and didn't ask any more.</p><p></p><p>This floor had fewer guards, but Ye Wuyu glanced casually and saw that they had a [乙] badge on their waists.</p><p></p><p>A figure came to meet them. "Lord Zhao, which floor are we going to... and who is this person beside you?"</p><p></p><p>"Go to the fifth floor, no problem, this kid is not afraid of death." Zhao Changhe's tone was calm.</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Wuyu saw the guard holding a compass in one hand, making hand seals with the other, and chanting something.</p><p></p><p>A spirit master? Soon, a door made of ink appeared on the wall, emitting a hazy glow.</p><p></p><p>The two of them walked in, and Ye Wuyu found that this was a luminous passage.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was a little surprised, it seems that going to the fifth floor was not just a simple staircase.</p><p></p><p>As they walked, Zhao Changhe explained.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, there was a beast that snuck in and brought an Easttian Treasure Mirror, which could confuse the floors of this Heavenly Prison. As a result, the reinforcements originally wanted to go to the fourth floor, but ended up on the fifth floor, and those who wanted to go to the fifth floor went back to the first floor."</p><p></p><p>"So later, Lord Cai personally rearranged this place, and as for the previous floors, it doesn't matter, those things are useless even if they escape."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu finally understood why he had to go to the second floor, but ended up directly on the eighth floor.</p><p></p><p>Luck... seems to be a bit unlucky.</p><p></p><p>"So the Easttian Treasure Mirror is really that amazing, I wonder if it's still here?" Ye Wuyu asked.</p><p></p><p>"Still here? It was directly shattered, the demon clan is willing to sacrifice it, that treasure was used as a one-time thing here." Zhao Changhe's expression darkened, as if he was thinking of something unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, by the way, you've been to the eighth floor and survived, so you should know about something called Ominous, right? That mirror contained a trace of Ominous power." Zhao Changhe said.</p><p></p><p>A mirror containing Ominous power?</p><p></p><p>In that case, that thing and his right eye seem to have the same origin.</p><p></p><p>This kind of thing containing a trace of the Dao, even in Zhao Changhe's eyes, is a treasure? [Treasure? What kind of crap can be called a treasure, you should just explode right now and take out the Ominous and your eyeball for this old man to take a look!]</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the inner monologue, Ye Wuyu silently walked forward.</p><p></p><p>They finally reached the fifth floor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu quietly looked at the scene in front of him, feeling his body slightly uncomfortable, and his breathing slightly difficult.</p><p></p><p>This was not because he was sick, but because the prison on this floor was filled with blood qi, killing intent, and evil qi.</p><p></p><p>This floor housed transformed great demons.</p><p></p><p>Demons that do not have the natural talent of demons like the fox demon need to reach the third realm before they can transform, and their transformation is mostly just maintaining a human form, with obvious demonic features.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, those demonic beings were looking at the two of them, their eyes towards Zhao Changhe filled with fear, but their eyes towards Ye Wuyu were filled with undisguised cruelty.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression became increasingly strange.</p><p></p><p>Could the person they said would teach him be a demon? That would be too ominous...</p><p></p><p>"We're here." With Zhao Changhe's words, Ye Wuyu stopped.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the cell in front of him.</p><p></p><p>An even more ominous thing happened.</p><p></p><p>Among the cells filled with great demons, there was a single human cell, mixed in with these demons.</p><p></p><p>It was a man, with no aura displayed on his body, and if it weren't for his current appearance, he would be an ordinary middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>But his appearance was not ordinary at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The red prison uniform... or rather, the white prison uniform had been dyed red by blood, and his messy hair was also dyed red by blood.</p><p></p><p>Several chains tightly bound his four limbs, and even pierced through his pelvis, binding him in the cell.</p><p></p><p>And he was currently chewing on a bloody piece of raw meat.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu could tell that the meat was very chewy, perhaps beef.</p><p></p><p>But where did this beef come from?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu soon found out where the beef came from.</p><p></p><p>Next to it, a transformed bull-headed demon was kowtowing to Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Zhao, please be kind and give me a new cell, I don't want to be this gentleman's neighbor anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Look at my old bull body, the meat has been eaten by him in these past few days, there's not a good piece left, I beg you, old bull is going crazy."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe originally didn't care, but seeing the pitiful appearance of the bull-headed demon, he snorted and then said to the man in the cell.</p><p></p><p>"Fangcun Mountain, you can't just eat your cellmates without saying anything, why do you have to eat the prison guards?"</p><p></p><p>These words fell on Ye Wuyu's ears, feeling very abnormal, but in front of his eyes, it was completely reasonable.</p><p></p><p>The man called Fangcun Mountain slowly raised his head, his eyes under the few strands of red hair were a bit hazy, but there was no trace of cruelty.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain spat out a mouthful, then threw the beef he was holding aside.</p><p></p><p>"I don't eat beef."</p><p></p><p>He stretched out a hand, the chains making a crisp sound as they scraped the ground.</p><p></p><p>Pointing to the trembling bull-headed demon beside him.</p><p></p><p>"This beast originally tried to get close to me and escape, but I found out that this beast came in because he killed people in a town, and he liked to rape wives in front of their husbands, relishing in it."</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain suddenly laughed, the blood on the corners of his mouth still remaining.</p><p></p><p>He sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Beasts like this bull-headed demon should die!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

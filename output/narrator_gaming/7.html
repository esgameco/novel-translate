        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei's lips pursed slightly, the emotions in her eyes becoming increasingly chaotic, and she could only gritted her teeth and spat out two words.</p><p></p><p>"Use... force."</p><p></p><p>The sword in her hand paused, and soon blood stained the white robe.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the gradually stabilizing breathing of the person in front of him, Ye Wuyo thought for a moment, he should not need to go deeper.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on the pain of self-harm to maintain a clear mind, how long could it last? At this moment, the other party was leaning against the steps, half-asleep and half-awake, her disheveled hair covering the side of her face, peaceful and delicate.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the previous actions of the woman, Ye Wuyo couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>"What a lunatic."</p><p></p><p>His self-mutterings received a response.</p><p></p><p>"You're not wrong, my disciple is indeed like this."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwei had somehow sat up, and the previously disheveled hair was now casually draped on both sides. At this moment, she was staring intently at Ye Wuyo, her eyes filled with deep interest.</p><p></p><p>Is it the remnant soul in the opponent's ring that has reached the sixth realm?</p><p></p><p>After waiting for three days, it finally couldn't help but appear, huh? [Well, well, I didn't expect this woman to actually be the master of this little girl. Now the master and disciple are both in front of you, a single body with two souls, and the other party is even a Yin body. Your mind is gradually becoming clearer, and countless ways to play are gradually emerging...]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo suddenly understood the concept of the sinister invasion of the mind.</p><p></p><p>If there were a hundred such asides constantly murmuring in his mind, he too would go insane.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment...</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Wuyo had already known about the matter of the remnant soul, he now put on a look of panic and took a few steps back. "You, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng was very satisfied with Ye Wuyo's reaction, looking at that handsome face, her heart, which had not seen a man for hundreds of years, was now stirring.</p><p></p><p>A toe quietly stepped forward, accompanied by the half-hanging bloody red long skirt, reflecting a different kind of charming grace under the dim candlelight.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo was stunned.</p><p></p><p>I'll just pretend, but senior, are you playing like this?</p><p></p><p>The toe lightly brushed against him and then quickly withdrew, and the one who did this, Xia Anmeng, let out a series of silvery laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, sorry, after all, this is the body of my disciple, as her master, I can't just hand her over to you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo sat cross-legged on the ground, relieved in his heart, but a trace of regret inexplicably crossed his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you have any orders, or is it just to say these tricks to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Lu Caiwei," or rather Xia Anmeng, now stood up on tiptoe from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the movement had aggravated the wound, "Lu Caiwei" frowned slightly, looked down at the wounds on her body, and then looked towards the passage ahead.</p><p></p><p>"After hundreds of years... are there still so many bizarre things?" </p><p></p><p>She sighed, with a slight sense of grievance, "I was still hoping that the Warden could arrive in time, but now it seems that the cabbage has already wilted."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo's gaze followed her every move until she crouched down in front of him, her beautiful eyes examining him.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, do you want to live?" She smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo did not respond, only calmly looking at her.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to live, just obediently listen to me." Xia Anmeng smiled and stretched out her hand, her fingertips lightly swaying in front of him, gently tapping on his chest.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo suddenly felt a hint of dizziness in front of his eyes, and his mind was filled with an inexplicable trust in the woman's words.</p><p></p><p>As if he was about to agree to her request the next moment.</p><p></p><p>[Boring, really boring, this so-called charm technique has no effect on you at all. Looking at the foolish woman in front of you, preening and posturing, it's really a pity that she has lived for so many years. Instead of being coy, it would be better to have a direct confrontation. Oh well, with the Yin energy of a thousand-year-old woman, how could she possibly display the true charm?]</p><p></p><p>The voice echoing in his mind made Ye Wuyo's consciousness suddenly become clear.</p><p></p><p>He lowered his head slightly, hiding the gloom in his eyes very well.</p><p></p><p>The words of the aside revealed an extremely important piece of information.</p><p></p><p>That the person in front of him is a thousand-year-old virgin... no, no, no.</p><p></p><p>Just now, was she trying to control me?</p><p></p><p>[The arrogant bitch, this invasion is aimed at the soul, compared to the flesh. Now that your soul is in pain, you're still pretending. You sneer three times, and after another stick of incense, the master and disciple will all be yours to manipulate.]</p><p></p><p>Fine beads of sweat appeared on "Lu Caiwei's" forehead, and although she still had a forced smile, the slight trembling in her eyes due to the pain was undisguisable.</p><p></p><p>Even the remnant soul at the sixth realm could not resist the invasion? Or was the quality of this remnant soul too low? After a long while, he calmly said,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, there's no need to test me, after all, you don't want to be completely dissipated here, do you?"</p><p></p><p>The smile on the face of the "Lu Caiwei" gradually faded away, and she wiped the sweat on her forehead, her voice clear and cold.</p><p></p><p>"Junior, hand over the body to me, I won't guarantee that you'll definitely live, but at least it'll be better than sitting here waiting to die."</p><p></p><p>"Possession?" After the previous experience, Ye Wuyo simply asked directly.</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng's eyes flashed with a strange look, and then she shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"I have no interest in a man's body, nor do I deign to do such a thing. I'll just temporarily possess it."</p><p></p><p>"My true self?" The tone was quite arrogant. Could this woman have been an extraordinary figure in her lifetime?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyo was still pondering, but "Lu Caiwei" seemed a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>Although...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He knew the reason, but the fact was that this man was not affected by this place.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious erosion was more damaging to the spirit than the flesh. Just by coming out for a while, Xia Anmeng could no longer bear it.</p><p></p><p>Only by possessing Ye Wuyou's body could there be a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>Two souls, three lives.</p><p></p><p>The three of them were like locusts on the same rope. If they were not careful, they would perish.</p><p></p><p>She really didn't intend to usurp Ye Wuyou, but she wanted to take the leading position. Ye Wuyou, a person who had no cultivation in his eyes, could not bear their fate.</p><p></p><p>To ensure that everything was under her control, she used some small tricks that she had never encountered before in her lifetime.</p><p></p><p>But how come they didn't work on him at all?</p><p></p><p>Damn, doesn't he like women?</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng gritted her teeth and said, "My lord, what I said is all true. If I wanted to usurp you, I could have done so earlier."</p><p></p><p>"If you don't trust me, I can take the Demon Heart Oath," she said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Anxious, anxious.</p><p></p><p>[The Demon Heart has little use, not even half a hair of the Lust Demon. This stinky woman is truly laughable, daring to covet your body.]</p><p></p><p>The narrator, are you the moderator? Ye Wuyou took a deep breath and silently suppressed the noise in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not affected by this place, he could not resist the danger of this cursed place.</p><p></p><p>As for the "Lu Caiwei" possessed by the remnant soul in front of him, she seemed to be quite powerful, but she was affected by the erosion of this place.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Ye Wuyou's impression of this remnant soul "teacher" was not very good.</p><p></p><p>He was grateful to Lu Caiwei, but this remnant soul "teacher", well.</p><p></p><p>Never mind, after all, she is so old.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she doesn't seem to have lied.</p><p></p><p>Tsk...</p><p></p><p>In a moment, Ye Wuyou finally raised his head and said calmly, "Okay, but I also have a condition. In addition to this, I need two sets of cultivation methods sufficient to reach the middle third realm."</p><p></p><p>The subsequent cultivation methods of the "Formless Heart Sutra" require other cultivation methods as a foundation.</p><p></p><p>Condition? "My disciple saved your life in a life-and-death situation, and now you're putting conditions on me?" Xia Anmeng was angrily amused.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou nodded, not denying it.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple did indeed save me. If it weren't for her, I would have become a corpse." </p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, his tone suddenly became heavier.</p><p></p><p>"If Lu Caiwei has any requests, I will naturally help and support her. That is what I owe her."</p><p></p><p>"But I don't owe you, just a sixth-realm remnant soul. Now that your spiritual soul is about to dissipate, you're still putting on airs?"</p><p></p><p>A rare trace of anger appeared on Ye Wuyou's face.</p><p></p><p>He was indeed not affected by the strangeness of this place.</p><p></p><p>But... his mind was really noisy.</p><p></p><p>After the life-and-death crisis of the past few days, he had long been irritated. And with the narrator's occasional vulgar nonsense in his mind, it would be too hypocritical to say he was calm.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, he met this remnant soul. If the other party had just talked to him properly, it would have been fine. But as soon as she came out, she started to tease him and use her charms. Now she was still in a high and mighty pose.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Wuyou didn't mind revealing something. He bluntly pointed out the other party's situation.</p><p></p><p>His current state could still support him for a few more days, maybe he could wait for the warden's rescue.</p><p></p><p>But the other party couldn't wait a moment longer.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, upon hearing Ye Wuyou's words, the "Lu Caiwei" figure suddenly became somewhat stiff standing in place.</p><p></p><p>How could her realm and her disguise be seen through by this little guy who hadn't even reached the first realm?</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I agree." </p><p></p><p>She ultimately didn't have time to think.</p><p></p><p>"Take the oath," Ye Wuyou reminded.</p><p></p><p>[You instantly grasped the Lust Demon Oath and personally taught it to the other party, allowing her to perform it in front of you...]</p><p></p><p>Stop barking, please! "You..."</p><p></p><p>Even though Xia Anmeng was unwilling, she could only obediently follow Ye Wuyou's requirements and complete all the tasks.</p><p></p><p>As a wisp of illusory light flew into Ye Wuyou's body, Lu Caiwei's body leaned and was caught by Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>And with Xia Anmeng's possession, the aura within Ye Wuyou's body suddenly rose, with waves of spiritual power constantly circulating from his dantian.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was the sixth realm, even if it was just a remnant soul, the boost it brought was far more than that.</p><p></p><p>First realm hidden element, second realm clear understanding, third realm radiant light...</p><p></p><p>Blood seeped from the corners of Ye Wuyou's mouth, and the surging mighty power in his body suddenly paused, then gradually receded.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it stabilized at the second realm of clear understanding.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the blood vessels all over Ye Wuyou's body became clearly visible, and the blue veins on his arms were particularly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Your foundation is really too poor. How did you even enter the Heavenly Prison?" Xia Anmeng's questioning voice came from his mind. Her tone was much more relaxed now, as if the erosion had been isolated after the possession.</p><p></p><p>"I went through the back door."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou, who had truly grasped power for the first time, did not care about the mighty power in his body, nor did he rejoice. Instead, he looked at the sleeping woman in his arms with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"Then, what about her?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

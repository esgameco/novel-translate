        <h1>Chapter 60</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method he practiced was related to killing intent and murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>It was a skill he had honed amidst the piles of corpses on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation method that refines killing intent and murderous aura was later found to be able to assist in one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It's somewhat similar to the awe-inspiring pressure of high-level cultivators. If constantly unleashed, it can also play a role in tempering one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But no one would do that, it would be too wasteful. Cultivation is, after all, a long process.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's one's own son, a great cultivator with supreme abilities cannot withstand such consumption.</p><p></p><p>However, killing intent and murderous aura do not require high realms or any consumption, as long as one is willing to spend the time.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain, who was imprisoned, had plenty of time.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding area was enveloped in a solidified red murderous aura and killing intent, like a cocoon.</p><p></p><p>As long as one can endure this murderous aura and killing intent, one day of cultivation would be equivalent to ten days, which is not an exaggeration.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain, having let out a burp, tossed the leg bone in his hand aside, then gulped down a bottle of wine, and finally squinted his eyes to look ahead.</p><p></p><p>How many days had it been? The fifth day or the sixth? He had thought the boy would give up after he had provoked him that day.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the boy came back the next day, or even the same night.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you leave that time?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Weren't you supposed to bring wine and meat?" Ye Wuyu looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain had no words. He subconsciously believed that anyone Zhao Changhe brought before him must be a person of exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>The more talented a person is, the more arrogant they tend to be.</p><p></p><p>He had been in the celestial prison for nearly ten years, and Zhao Changhe had brought many people before him.</p><p></p><p>Without exception, they were all geniuses, without exception they were all arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Only that girl surnamed Lu had a somewhat decent temperament, but as for the one in front of him...</p><p></p><p>Hard to evaluate, but he felt the person was different from all the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>Seemed a bit shameless.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the murderous aura is fading, add some more," Ye Wuyu's voice came from within the cocoon.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain paused, then the murderous aura condensed even more.</p><p></p><p>But after doing this, Fangcun Mountain felt quite annoyed. He frowned and said, "Little Ye, are you treating me like a furnace to add firewood? Do you know how much it costs me in spiritual focus?"</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to eat tomorrow?" the voice came from within the cocoon.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, it doesn't matter what to eat, but help me get a bottle of the peach blossom wine from Cuiyue Residence, and make sure it's brewed by that beautiful peach blossom lady herself..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu no longer paid attention to Fangcun Mountain's words, quietly refining his own spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The first realm is Hidden Origin, the second realm is Profound Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>There are not many cultivators at the first realm, nor are there many. But the second realm is rare.</p><p></p><p>After all, the first realm can be slowly cultivated over time, but the second realm is different.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Enlightenment realm, opening the meridian acupoints, clear vision, and extending lifespan by thirty years.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to Tuoxia's blessing, when he forcibly advanced to the second realm that time, his twelve major meridians were forcibly opened by the spiritual energy, and then she used her divine soul to wrap him. Afterwards, he also spent half a month recuperating in Zhao Changhe's medicinal bath, otherwise he would have died back then.</p><p></p><p>Finding the seventy-two acupoint holes among the over seven hundred acupoints in the human body is not difficult, as the locations are recorded in the books.</p><p></p><p>"If your spiritual energy is sufficient, you can already try to advance to the second realm. With my murderous aura pressure, you can transform the qi in your dantian into liquid. Since you're stuck here, what else do you want to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you want to find those forty-six extraordinary acupoints outside the meridians?"</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain's voice was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The extraordinary acupoints outside the meridians do not have fixed locations in each person's body.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the seventy-two major acupoints, there are forty-six extraordinary acupoints outside the meridians. These extraordinary acupoints have the same effects as the acupoints, but they are not easy to find.</p><p></p><p>Although having more acupoints means more power, the time consumed is not to be mentioned, and the worst-case scenario is that time is wasted without finding them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, not many people will focus on researching them, but instead directly break through to the second realm. If they can find one or two, it's considered a gain.</p><p></p><p>But this is Ye Wuyu's goal.</p><p></p><p>Because he found them quite easily, and has already broken through thirteen of them.</p><p></p><p>This is thanks to the narrator's assistance, and Ye Wuyu feels the narrator is quite useful.</p><p></p><p>[The human body is not such an inconvenient thing. Even if your talent is unparalleled, you can only find forty-six extraordinary acupoints outside the meridians, so few... After much consideration, you decide to create eighty-two more acupoints for yourself, making a total of one hundred and twenty-eight extraordinary acupoints.]</p><p></p><p>Huh? Can it be further improved?</p><p></p><p>How to open them?</p><p></p><p>[You just do it. Form your fingers into a sword, first pierce three inches below your heart and lungs, penetrate your own body, then condense your spiritual energy. The flesh and blood will coagulate, forcibly creating the acupoint.]</p><p></p><p>Okay, okay, this time let's just do it this way. Next time there's a chance, I'll do it again.</p><p></p><p>At most three days, or perhaps only two days, and he should be able to break through the remaining extraordinary acupoints outside the meridians and advance to the second realm.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding murderous aura pressure suddenly dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu looked up and gazed at the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, that's enough for today. Come back tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu got up and left without saying another word.</p><p></p><p>But Fangcun Mountain called out to him.</p><p></p><p>"Little boy, how many extraordinary acupoints outside the meridians have you found?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how many did you find back then?" Ye Wuyu asked in return.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain coughed lightly and said, "On the battlefield back then, there was no time to slowly search. I only found seven, and then broke through to the second realm. After all, realm is more important than acupoints."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then senior, I have more than you now."</p><p></p><p>Before Fangcun Mountain could speak again, Ye Wuyu had already left.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Wuyu heard Fangcun Mountain talk about his past.</p><p></p><p>Battlefield? So he used to be a military man?</p><p></p><p>No wonder he has such a thick murderous aura and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The fifth realm, it seems he used to be an official. With such dense murderous aura, he must have killed a lot of people. How did he end up in the celestial prison?</p><p></p><p>The contemplation was only brief, and Ye Wuyu soon left the celestial prison.</p><p></p><p>Fangcun Mountain remained in the prison, watching Ye Wuyu's retreating back, then finished the last of the wine and tossed the bottle aside.</p><p></p><p>"This kid, his heart is not calm," he muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"His heart is not calm."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Either he's thinking about women, or he's thinking about killing someone, but this kid doesn't look like the type who's lacking in women." </p><p></p><p>"So he must be thinking about killing someone then?"</p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>"But with an unsettled heart, one will overlook many things, and end up like me in the end..."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, he was a good seedling, don't let him die."</p><p></p><p>He said, letting out a burp, and then fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu felt very calm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have already charged into that manor.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, at the Tianyan Pavilion, he had witnessed a scene with two figures.</p><p></p><p>At the time, he was sitting at the table reading, and one of them pointed at him, and the two of them then casually walked into the room, took away that painting.</p><p></p><p>And, they placed a new painting in the box, to cover everything up.</p><p></p><p>And at that time, he had already fainted.</p><p></p><p>The scene was blurry, Ye Wuyu couldn't see who the other person was, but the other person, although the face couldn't be seen clearly, just by the figure, he already knew it was that Wu Zuolong.</p><p></p><p>He did indeed die from an illness, but this illness now seems to have been inflicted upon him by the other party.</p><p></p><p>Including the loss of his memories.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had to admit, the other party was very meticulous and careful in their actions.</p><p></p><p>They didn't directly kill him, but used supernatural means to make him die from an illness, and even let it last for a few days, so that others would see him sick.</p><p></p><p>Switching the paintings was out of concern that his father's action of buying the painting before his death would be known, and then the painting would disappear, causing suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Erasing his memories was to prevent him from realizing, and even going further, in case someone wanted to search his soul. So many methods and considerations, used on him who was just an ordinary person at the time, Ye Wuyu could only admire.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Tianyan Pavilion, even if he realized his memories were lost, he would have been completely clueless.</p><p></p><p>But now Ye Wuyu knows who to find.</p><p></p><p>With such a clear target, and an extremely conspicuous one at that, Ye Wuyu had originally wanted to find an opportunity when Wu Zuolong went out, capture him first, interrogate him, and then give him a final blow.</p><p></p><p>But that guy hasn't gone out for a full four or five days.</p><p></p><p>As for the manor.</p><p></p><p>Contrary to Ye Wuyu's imagination, the manor where the Prefect was located, was unexpectedly heavily guarded.</p><p></p><p>The patrolling soldiers and yamen runners seemed to have made that manor a key target, with non-stop patrols.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were many guards in the manor, and just from a rough sense, they were all cultivators at the same level, with some even at higher realms.</p><p></p><p>It's not realistic to sneak in silently.</p><p></p><p>He walked on the street, and then found a tea stall to sit down, and then looked towards the street while sipping his tea.</p><p></p><p>A figure that was not too familiar to him walked down the street, but he was alone, without the luxurious carriage he usually had.</p><p></p><p>Ma Liu was strutting down the street, casually picking up things from the stalls on the side.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the stall owners' faces full of resentment but only able to smile apologetically, Ma Liu felt extremely pleased.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a lackey in front of that Third Young Master, walking on the streets of Tianlan City, he was the boss.</p><p></p><p>The government couldn't do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>He ate and drank his way along, then turned and entered a shop, shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>But no one around him paid any attention.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, you guys don't even treat me, the old master, with any respect!"  Ma Liu slammed his hand on the table, but suddenly felt a sharp pain in his hand.</p><p></p><p>How could the wooden table be so hard?</p><p></p><p>But immediately, everything in front of him changed.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer in the shop, but in a small alley.</p><p></p><p>That slap just now, he had actually hit the wall.</p><p></p><p>Ma Liu panicked, had he been bewitched?</p><p></p><p>A hoarse voice came from behind him, "Don't worry, it's just a little trick. Now, answer whatever I ask."</p><p></p><p>Ma Liu trembled as he turned around, only to see a withered old man.</p><p></p><p>"Senior... I'm Ma Liu, if I've offended you in any way, I'll pay you money."</p><p></p><p>"I ask, you answer."</p><p></p><p>A tentacle emerged from behind him, wrapping around Ma Liu, scaring him to the point of crying for his mother.</p><p></p><p>The old man was Ye Wuyu, this was just a simple illusion, even an ordinary cultivator could see through it, but Ma Liu was obviously not among them.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, senior, please ask."</p><p></p><p>"I ask you, where is the one you usually follow?"</p><p></p><p>Ma Liu paused, but quickly realized the senior was referring to the Third Young Master.</p><p></p><p>So this senior was not looking for him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had thought the other party would resist for a while, but Ma Liu's loyalty was obviously not as high as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>"You mean the Third Young Master? He's been staying in the manor these past few days, he hasn't gone out."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Ye Wuyu to ask further, Ma Liu continued.</p><p></p><p>"I heard, I heard he's been grounded by the Prefect, their father-son relationship isn't very good..."</p><p></p><p>"Grounded?" Ye Wuyu frowned.</p><p></p><p>"But I have a way to see him." Ma Liu said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What way?" Ye Wuyu asked in a lowered voice.</p><p></p><p>But the response he got was Ma Liu's gradually rampant and cold laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Wait till I capture you, then you'll be able to see the Third Young Master."</p><p></p><p>Ma Liu took a step, and a strange talisman was stuck on his body, his figure quickly fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Haha haha, the Third Young Master was right, there must be someone looking for him these days! So he had me wander the streets all day, I was already getting tired of it!"</p><p></p><p>"You think you're the only one observing in the dark? Do you think we're stupid pigs? It's hilarious, we've actually been waiting for you to take the bait all along!"</p><p></p><p>As Ma Liu's words faded, his life also came to an end.</p><p></p><p>That strange talisman had made his speed very fast, but not faster than Ye Wuyu's ghostly hand.</p><p></p><p>"Thud."</p><p></p><p>The corpse fell from the air, kicking up a cloud of dust.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu turned his head, looking around.</p><p></p><p>In the alley, dozens of figures slowly gathered.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Previously, this group of people in the prison had four members, one of whom was a woman...</p><p></p><p>Previously, it had indeed gone down the mountain to the village, not for any other reason, but because it had sensed a familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>The fool of the Qian Xuan Gate, that guy who was easily infatuated by a little trick.</p><p></p><p>At the time, the white fox was quite relieved, thinking that guy was probably the only remaining seedling of the Qian Xuan Gate, never expecting to encounter him again.</p><p></p><p>If he could be subdued, the chances of obtaining the true Qian Xuan Purple Gold Bell would increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the mantis stalking the cicada, with the yellow bird behind, his own sister also came, hiding her aura and learning the mystical techniques of humans.</p><p></p><p>The Qian Xuan Purple Gold Bell, what it wanted was not the bell itself, that was just a restraint set up by the Qian Xuan Gate people through mystical means.</p><p></p><p>What it truly wanted was the thing inside the bell.</p><p></p><p>The white fox had pondered for a long time, unable to break the restraint, so it had to hide it here, allowing the thing inside to quietly absorb the essence of the sun and moon.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Qian Xuan Gate did not dare to do this, keeping the bell securely locked up in a high place, obviously knowing that there was something extraordinary inside the bell.</p><p></p><p>This was a slow and steady process, the lifespan of a demon beast is very long, the white fox was in no hurry, wanting to quietly wait for the ancestral relic to be fully nourished, then the seal would naturally be broken.</p><p></p><p>But later on, everything became clear, the fox was mischievous, went down the mountain to gather and replenish, but was caught by someone in the brothel...</p><p></p><p>The white fox transformed, becoming a graceful and beautiful body, the black hair flowing down from the shoulders and neck, covering the slightly damaged area in the front.</p><p></p><p>The woman's expression was resolute, but at the moment, there was a hint of pain in her eyes, the hem of her pants was slightly rolled up, revealing a slender and pale leg bathed in moonlight, but with a few spots of crimson.</p><p></p><p>The white fox thought for a moment, deliberately adding a few more tears to the clothes, the damaged areas revealing a bit of skin, and a few fresh red lines.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing" finished these changes, then leaned back, half-leaning weakly against the tree, tilting her head slightly, with her hair covering half of her face.</p><p></p><p>The series of transformative actions were smooth and skillful, almost indistinguishable from the real Lin Qingqing.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it was even more graceful than the real Lin Qingqing.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, flawless."</p><p></p><p>This was the fox demon's signature skill, the bread and butter of its livelihood.</p><p></p><p>Unless one surpassed the fox demon by several realms, even at the mid-Xian realm, they would not be able to see through the fox demon's disguise.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu parted the withered branches, calmly gazing at the woman lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing" now had her eyes slightly closed, as if she had sensed someone approaching, and looked up with a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ye Wuyu, her expression first showed surprise, then quickly shifted to an appropriate look of delight.</p><p></p><p>She was truly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, she was too far away, and it was too dark in the mountain, so she couldn't see clearly.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was closer, she could see that this was a very handsome young man.</p><p></p><p>With such a handsome young man, the replenishment would be even quicker.</p><p></p><p>"It's you..." she said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>But that was all she could say.</p><p></p><p>She didn't know what Ye Wuyu's name was, and she didn't know what had happened to her earlier.</p><p></p><p>So she could only wait for Ye Wuyu to speak.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu didn't say anything, just standing in front of her, quietly looking at her.</p><p></p><p>Hey, this is not what she had imagined. In the night forest, with an injured and beautiful woman and a young cultivator, shouldn't there be a thousand topics to pour out their hearts?</p><p></p><p>In her gaze, the man's eyes were as calm as a dead pool of water, not even looking at the areas she had deliberately revealed.</p><p></p><p>But what hadn't she seen before?</p><p></p><p>I see, he's pretending, just keep up the act.</p><p></p><p>This must be the "innocent young scholar meets injured big sister" scenario.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing wanted to get up, but after struggling a few times, a look of apology mixed with pain appeared on her face, and she said helplessly,</p><p></p><p>"Just now, I was careless and got injured, I'm afraid I can't walk anymore. Can you help me?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay." Ye Wuyu said.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing" seemed not to have expected Ye Wuyu to answer so decisively, and before she could react, she was suddenly embraced by him and then carried on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Hmm... this development.</p><p></p><p>She looked at the man's sturdy back, somewhat silent.</p><p></p><p>This is not normal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She should first offer support, then pretend to still be unable to get up, and finally do a full princess carry.</p><p></p><p>And she could freely tease the other party on his chest and heart, coupled with her own bewitching techniques, not afraid that the other party would not be moved. Although the current conditions are a bit harsh, but... it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>"Down the mountain," Ye Wuyou said.</p><p></p><p>"Down the mountain..."</p><p></p><p>Going down the mountain would mean encountering her damned sister, that woman who has now joined a human sect and is living a prosperous life.</p><p></p><p>Demon foxes don't talk about sisterly affection, the initial chaos in Qingqiu was caused by a fight between the mother fox and her own sisters.</p><p></p><p>Her sister coming at this time, also bringing a remnant of the Qianxuan Gate, is nothing more than wanting that purple gold bell, and also taking her life.</p><p></p><p>"No, don't go down the mountain yet, I just saw that demon fox going up the mountain," Lin Qingqing hurriedly patted the man's back and said.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You can't even walk the path now, and you still want to catch the demon fox?" Ye Wuyou's pace did not stop.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>She was pondering how to persuade Ye Wuyou not to go down the mountain, when suddenly there was a strange sensation from behind her, and her cheeks flushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Okay, okay, this young man has been pretending for so long, it's so hard, but he couldn't help but make a move? From the front, Ye Wuyou's calm voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Your butt is bleeding."</p><p></p><p>?</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing" was stunned, and only then did she realize that the wound from her severed tail had not been fully treated.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh... Earlier, Diming was injured, no, it's nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so? Then it's good, I thought you had some other hidden illness, which would be quite disgusting," Ye Wuyou said.</p><p></p><p>Deep breath, deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing could no longer hold back at this moment.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person is this! Why must she use the charm of a demon fox to bewitch the heart?</p><p></p><p>This guy is only at the Boundary realm, while she is a third-stage demon fox. Even if she is not good at fighting, she can still pin this guy down and grind him hard.</p><p></p><p>Yes, just use brute force.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Lin Qingqing's expression changed, her aura no longer concealed, but revealed.</p><p></p><p>Third-stage demon fox.</p><p></p><p>Two fox tails suddenly sprang out from behind her, and with a light flick, they wrapped around Ye Wuyou, causing him and the figure to fall to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing" rolled over, lying on the man's chest.</p><p></p><p>Her two arms gently roamed in front of her, her legs closed together, a lush and round moon slightly raised, and two white fox tails extended from behind her.</p><p></p><p>The woman's figure was like a fox, her jade neck slightly tilted back, her eyes shining with a dangerous light.</p><p></p><p>A faint pink aura emanated from "Lin Qingqing's" body, barely perceptible, but permeating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Okay, just wait for this young man to fall into the illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep, sleep... Sink into the sweet dream, this will be the most extreme experience of your life."</p><p></p><p>"In exchange, let me eat you..."</p><p></p><p>"Lin Qingqing" extended her finger, gently caressing the man's chest, a look of obsession on her face.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>"Why are you still awake?" "Lin Qingqing" had a strange expression on her face, her eyes fixed intently on the man beneath her.</p><p></p><p>Facing the question, Ye Wuyou thought about it and then asked with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"You demon foxes use the technique of supplementing, is it all done with this kind of false illusory method?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah? What else?" The demon fox was taken aback, as if she hadn't reacted, and even nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Ye Wuyou sighed regretfully.</p><p></p><p>He had still wanted to personally experience the signature technique of the demon foxes, but was told it was just an illusion, what a waste of time...</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a piercing wail echoed through the mountains, like the resentful roar of a wild beast.</p><p></p><p>The demon fox, who had lost another tail, now lay weakly on the ground, her gaze fearful, no longer human.</p><p></p><p>"How disappointing."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

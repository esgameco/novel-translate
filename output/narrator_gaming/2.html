        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were no new inmates, nor were there any inmates being sent to execution.</p><p></p><p>At least, that was the case on this level.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, dressed in a black prison guard uniform, walked through the prison corridor, distributing the meals to the inmates one by one.</p><p></p><p>Over the past few days, Ye Wuyu had thoroughly familiarized himself with his work, and his previous work experience also allowed him to blend in seamlessly with his colleagues.</p><p></p><p>He had even reached the stage of proactively requesting overtime and helping his colleagues switch shifts.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Wuyu was not willing to become a so-called "work thief."</p><p></p><p>It's just that the overtime at the Celestial Prison really pays well! And it's double pay! Overtime with pay, I'm crying, they could have just exploited us for free.</p><p></p><p>Two days on, two days off, double pay for overtime, three meals provided, indoor work, management-level (brainwashing: responsible for managing dozens of prisons), no risk of being fired due to old age.</p><p></p><p>In the past, Ye Wuyu would have thought that this kind of job was something out of a novel.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was currently quite short on money.</p><p></p><p>Because he had not yet reached the First Realm, and before that, he needed to complete his Body Tempering.</p><p></p><p>And for Body Tempering, he needed a large amount of blood food and medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>All of these required money.</p><p></p><p>By taking on the identity of a prison guard at the Celestial Prison, Ye Wuyu had finally obtained something he had been looking forward to.</p><p></p><p>The "Great River Qi Cultivation Technique."</p><p></p><p>Although he had heard that this was considered a common technique in the outside world, it was still a genuine cultivation method, and ordinary people still could not access it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was sufficient to support one's cultivation to the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>During his rest time, Ye Wuyu began to study this cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Although he was currently in the state of incomplete Body Tempering, and even if he cultivated the technique, he would not be able to truly enter the First Realm, but cultivating the Qi Sense in advance would still be excellent.</p><p></p><p>[Incomprehensible, simply incomprehensible, how can this be called the Great River Qi Cultivation Technique? It's just a Urination Qi Cultivation Technique. You snort disdainfully, thinking that such a trash technique does not deserve to be in your eyes, and you tear it to shreds, trampling it underfoot.]</p><p></p><p>The dog is barking again...</p><p></p><p>If you tear this thing to shreds, where am I supposed to find a new one?</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the complex thoughts in his mind, Ye Wuyu immediately calmed his mind and tried to find the so-called Qi Sense according to the incantation in the technique.</p><p></p><p>[No, no, no, the body... the body is not clean enough, the Qi generated by cultivating this trash technique is simply polluted.]</p><p></p><p>[To avoid this from happening, with a thought, you integrate your entire being.]</p><p></p><p>[Haha, haha, I've got it, I've got it, the Dao Patriarch has attained enlightenment. You laugh three times, and in an instant, you've comprehended a brand-new cultivation technique. From now on, my life is in my own hands, not at the mercy of heaven.]</p><p></p><p>The complex and trivial words in his mind gradually faded away.</p><p></p><p>The characters in the Great River Qi Cultivation Technique one by one jumped out of the book and then dissipated and distorted, only to be reorganized into a completely new text in Ye Wuyu's mind.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra."</p><p></p><p>Without the need to understand or even observe, the entire cultivation method was firmly imprinted in Ye Wuyu's mind, every word and sentence crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>His Qi Sea surged, and Ye Wuyu could even feel his inner Qi circulating unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu hurriedly calmed down, wanting to stop the circulation of Qi.</p><p></p><p>Being able to cultivate the heart method in advance without completing the Body Tempering? Don't overdo it! But he soon discovered the difference of this "Formless Heart Sutra."</p><p></p><p>"I see, there's also a guiding chapter."</p><p></p><p>A full-fledged "Great River Qi Cultivation Technique" that could cultivate to the Third Realm, has now transformed into the "Formless Heart Sutra," but it has only evolved into two texts.</p><p></p><p>One is a guiding chapter, and the other is a chapter that can only allow one to cultivate to the First Realm.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of the guiding chapter is to allow one to cultivate in advance during the Body Tempering period, without having to wait until the Body Tempering is complete to cultivate the so-called heart method.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had heard the storyteller in the teahouse mention this before, that generally only those with distinguished family backgrounds and cultivating geniuses would have such techniques, as they had laid a solid foundation and saved time.</p><p></p><p>Reduced content, but increased quality?</p><p></p><p>And it can even cultivate automatically...</p><p></p><p>This aspect really opened Ye Wuyu's eyes, and he thought that this dog narrator had finally done something useful.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the "Great River Qi Cultivation Technique" in his hand...</p><p></p><p>The originally obscure and difficult technique had now changed its appearance in Ye Wuyu's eyes. With his current understanding, it was truly just a "Urination Qi Cultivation Technique."</p><p></p><p>"Wuyu."</p><p></p><p>The voice reaching his ear pulled Ye Wuyu out of his immersion, and it was Uncle Wang, carrying his ever-unchanging large ceramic jar filled with tea leaves, glancing at the book in Ye Wuyu's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating?"</p><p></p><p>"Just looking at it for fun, Uncle Wang, I'm still in the Body Tempering stage."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang spat out a mouthful of tea and said,</p><p></p><p>"You're on duty again today, are you short on money lately?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, a bit... I'm in a hurry to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The prison guards in the Celestial Prison, apart from those like Ye Wuyu who have special connections, must at least possess Qi Realm cultivation at the bare minimum.</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Wuyu, although he was able to get a job in the Celestial Prison through backdoor connections, this was still considered an unspoken rule within the prison.</p><p></p><p>Strictly speaking, Ye Wuyu is currently at most considered an "intern" or a temporary worker in the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>And the duration of this "internship" is three years.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, if you cannot advance to the Qi Realm within these three years, then you won't be able to officially stay in the Celestial Prison. Nowadays, finding such a stable job is not easy."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang chuckled, feeling around the back of the chair for a moment, then took something out from his bosom and tossed it to Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Huh? This is the money pouch I previously gave him? It has now returned to my hands intact? "Uncle Wang, what is this?" Ye Wuyu stood up, his expression puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang crossed his legs, acting nonchalantly. "Take it and buy some medicinal herbs... What's with that look? Do you really think Uncle Wang covets your measly money? Take it, take it."</p><p></p><p>The prison guards of the Celestial Prison, while not exactly wealthy, have enough to live a carefree life with surplus. </p><p></p><p>For someone like Uncle Wang, who has been in the Celestial Prison for decades, money is not an issue.</p><p></p><p>This is something Ye Wuyu has come to realize after working in the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>The silver taels in this money pouch of his are truly just a small sum.</p><p></p><p>So why did he accept this money pouch back then? To ease his mind?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was silent for a moment, and after confirming that there was no hidden meaning in the other's words, he clasped his hands and bowed.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang, sipping his tea, took in the changes in Ye Wuyu's expression and the bow, and the wrinkles at the corners of his eyes slightly smoothed out.</p><p></p><p>Ye Liang, you've raised a good son, haven't you...</p><p></p><p>Huh? Was it Ye Liang or Ye Xiangsheng? Nevermind, it doesn't matter.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang shook his head and said casually, </p><p></p><p>"But you don't need to worry too much. There are quite a few people in your situation. That old Cai on the first floor, his talent is quite poor. Initially, just like you, he spent two and a half years before finally stepping into the Qi Realm, and yet even after more than ten years, he's still stuck at the Qi Realm."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang laughed heartily, completely forgetting that he himself was also a Qi Realm cultivator for decades.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation in this world is divided into nine realms.</p><p>Qi Realm, Profound Realm, Radiant Realm, Illumination Realm, Celestial Realm...</p><p></p><p>In the Great Flame Nation, the population is vast, and cultivation sects are numerous. Those who have reached the Qi Realm are not considered rare, but they are not exactly common either.</p><p></p><p>After all, there are many people in their thirties and forties who persist in cultivation, and those who reach the Qi Realm by the age of sixty are also frequently seen.</p><p></p><p>But for the vast majority of people, they can only remain at the Qi Realm for the rest of their lives, as the subsequent realm barriers are like an unbridgeable chasm to them.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Wuyu and Uncle Wang were chatting casually, suddenly a cold wind came from outside the Celestial Prison's large stone gate.</p><p></p><p>Several figures stepped through the swirling snowstorm, their expressions solemn and their steps in perfect unison.</p><p>Yet strangely, they made not a single sound.</p><p></p><p>These figures were all dressed in the Celestial Prison's black uniform, except for the one leading them, who wore a white robe and a face veil, obscuring their features.</p><p></p><p>"They seem to be Rank 3 colleagues, and the one in the lead appears to be Rank 2?" </p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang whispered, quickly standing up from the corridor to make way.</p><p></p><p>Rank 2?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at the waist of Uncle Wang, where a token with the character "Rank 4" was hanging.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, Ye Wuyu had learned a bit about the rules of the Celestial Prison.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Prison has eight levels, one above ground and seven underground.</p><p>The prison guards are also divided into corresponding ranks, with Uncle Wang being a Rank 4, who is usually only allowed to go up to the second level.</p><p></p><p>As for Rank 3 and Rank 2, they must be responsible for the deeper areas, right?</p><p></p><p>As for Ye Wuyu, he's just an intern without any rank.</p><p></p><p>All the prison guards on the first level of the Celestial Prison stood up and stepped aside, silently waiting for the group to pass.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like they've brought in some new 'merchandise'. That big guy in the middle is it."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Uncle Wang's whispered remark, Ye Wuyu's gaze followed the group, and he saw the so-called "big guy".</p><p></p><p>The "big guy" was completely covered in a black cloth, as if they didn't want others to see his appearance.</p><p>His stature towered over the others, and several iron chains tightly bound him, with drips of fresh blood seeping along the chains as they walked.</p><p></p><p>This person is really tall, must be over two meters... Ye Wuyu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>[But this is merely a fifth-rank shape-shifting bear demon, though it may be deliberately feigning weakness and pretending to be captured, it cannot deceive your discerning eyes.]</p><p></p><p>[If this were in the past, would you have even spared it a glance? But with the arrival of winter, stripping its bear paws to make food would be an excellent idea.]</p><p></p><p>A demon?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

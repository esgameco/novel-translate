        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sky was gloomy, the village deathly silent, the ground littered with decaying corpses.</p><p></p><p>And there was the man in the brocade robe, his words still lingering.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was suddenly overcome by a sense of foreboding. He stood up and leaped towards the man in the brocade robe.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, I'm telling you the truth. Do you really want to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>"Bring out that bell! There's something wrong with it!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression darkened, and he began to retreat.</p><p></p><p>But a huge hand blocked him, and then a small ghostly hand lightly brushed across his chest.</p><p></p><p>The bell was then lifted up and suspended in midair.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that Ye Wuyou couldn't grab it, but rather... he couldn't.</p><p></p><p>The ghostly hand that could lift a ton of rock, at this moment, could not move the small bell.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye! You..." The man in the brocade robe roared angrily, about to lash out, but when he saw the scene before him, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't anything else, but because the bell that was brought to seal the "eyeball" had a crack on it.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say you could contain it?" Ye Wuyou's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>"I... I didn't expect the bell to break so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression was unsightly, but this was not the time for arguing. He clasped his hands and was about to perform a divine technique.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack... Boom!</p><p></p><p>Before the man in the brocade robe could complete his reinforcement technique, the bell that had been temporarily used as a container completely shattered, to the shock of the two men.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts plummeted at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Without a container, the man in the brocade robe could not perform the sealing technique, so how could he handle this thing that could casually disturb one's mind?</p><p></p><p>A white glow emerged from the broken bell, but it did not leave, instead remaining suspended in the air.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Wuyou clearly saw the appearance of the thing.</p><p></p><p>An eyeball, an extremely strange eyeball.</p><p></p><p>Unlike a human's, this one had no white, only a pure black, and within the black, a vertical red pupil.</p><p></p><p>Extremely ominous.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's mind was racing, clearly listing out the many good and bad news.</p><p></p><p>The bad news was that this ominous ghostly thing had broken free.</p><p></p><p>The good news was that the eyeball didn't look at him first.</p><p></p><p>The bad news was that the pressure from the eyeball's gaze rendered him immobile.</p><p></p><p>The good news was that he could have the "ghost" grab him and run.</p><p></p><p>The ominous eyeball, having escaped from the bell, first looked towards the distant Cloud Mist Mountain, then swept its gaze around, looking down at the village below.</p><p></p><p>And as its gaze fell upon them, the decapitated corpses that the man in the brocade robe had previously slain began to rise from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, one by one, they were regaining their vitality, their flesh and blood regenerating.</p><p></p><p>A huge blue ghostly hand grabbed Ye Wuyou, and the "ghost" ran off with him.</p><p></p><p>As for the man in the brocade robe, he had somehow managed to break free from the immense pressure, his body erupting in a bloody mist as he flew up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the scene below, the fleeing man in the brocade robe was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The dead can be revived?"</p><p></p><p>"It's fake, an illusion. Can't you tell, you from the Qianxuan Sect?" Ye Wuyou responded from the ghostly hand.</p><p></p><p>The blood-soaked man in the brocade robe snapped out of his daze and shouted towards the rapidly fleeing Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, let's not talk about the past. Now, you and I are in the same boat. Don't hold back any of your abilities."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was slightly taken aback, looking at the man's urgent gaze, then silently nodded his head before turning away, his expression somber.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe still did not know the truth about his own demise.</p><p></p><p>The two of them quickly and in perfect sync arrived at the well where they had started.</p><p></p><p>The plan had failed, so they had no choice but to leave.</p><p></p><p>But around the well, more than ten figures had gathered, emanating various colorful spiritual energies - these were the former cultivators, already dead and reduced to mere remains, but now having regained their physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou easily concluded that without a sneak attack, he had no chance of defeating this group.</p><p></p><p>"Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!" </p><p></p><p>A roar came from beside him, and Ye Wuyou turned to see the man in the brocade robe charging forward.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he was fighting for his life.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying blood mist enveloped every revived cultivator below, accompanied by the man in the brocade robe's agonized roar. The bloody energy surged out like a dragon, slaughtering everything around.</p><p></p><p>After this, the blood-soaked man in the brocade robe leaned against the well, barely able to stand.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, a bunch of dead people trying to stop the living? Wanting to kill me? I still need to rebuild the Qianxuan Sect!" The man in the brocade robe sneered, then prepared to jump into the well.</p><p></p><p>But as he leaped, he crashed heavily onto the tiles, his face making intimate contact with the bricks and tiles.</p><p></p><p>Tiles? Why were there tiles? The man in the brocade robe rubbed his face, trying to get up, but as his gaze lifted, he first saw Ye Wuyou's grim expression, then looked up.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, hehe..." He let out a bitter laugh, the strength that had just supported him to get up now dissipating, and he collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The eyeball had turned its gaze towards them at some point.</p><p></p><p>Everything that had just happened was fake, all an illusion.</p><p></p><p>He had been on this rooftop the entire time, never having moved.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou didn't have the time to worry about the other man. He didn't look up, but could still clearly feel the eyeball's gaze.</p><p></p><p>Why! He had already reached the well, but in the blink of an eye...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His eyes returned to the rooftop. "Didn't I say I wouldn't be disturbed by this thing? Was what just happened an illusion?"</p><p></p><p>[No, the illusory realm of the Dao Qi Essence cannot affect you. What just happened was all real, and everything now is also real.]</p><p></p><p>"What nonsense is this! It's all real, so how was I pulled back?"[The Dao Qi Essence is not something to be feared, because what struck out was not it. It merely borrowed the power of another remnant in this place.]</p><p></p><p>Another remnant? Is there more strangeness in this place? Ye Wuyu suddenly recalled where his eye had first looked when it was released.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Cloud Mist Mountain, or perhaps... even further back in the mountain range behind the Cloud Mist Mountain? What should I do now? This time the narrator did not respond, not even a dog's bark.</p><p></p><p>But after a moment, the familiar voice sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[No need to worry, these old-fashioned fleshbags are not worth a single blow. Just activate the "Formless Heart Sutra" and return to the realm of no-self...]</p><p></p><p>Hmph.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu no longer paid any heed to the voice in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Having entered the first realm of no-self in the "Formless Heart Sutra" twice now, Ye Wuyu had already realized that it was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the "no-self" seemed to subtly influence his thinking, making him increasingly closer to the arrogant self described by the narrator.</p><p></p><p>But most crucially, even after reaching that realm, his strength was indeed enhanced, but that did not mean he could win.</p><p></p><p>Entering that realm twice, he was defeated both times, and the one defeated was his own arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu kept his head down, not looking at the eye in the sky.</p><p></p><p>But he suddenly felt his body was sticky and slimy.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and touched his cheek.</p><p></p><p>Only to feel a sticky, rotten, fleshy substance.</p><p></p><p>Was he rotting? Was this an illusion or reality?</p><p></p><p>He finally stopped avoiding it, raising his head to meet the gaze of the eye.</p><p></p><p>The eerie, crimson-colored pupils emitted a sinister light.</p><p></p><p>Countless azure-blue ghostly hands surged towards the eye, but they all stopped a dozen or so feet away, unable to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu found that he could not move at all, not even avert his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Bang."</p><p></p><p>A slight cracking sound.</p><p></p><p>As if unable to withstand the gaze, one of Ye Wuyu's eyes suddenly burst open.</p><p></p><p>Blood spattered everywhere, and excruciating pain coursed through every nerve in his body.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu could not move, but through this intense pain, he let out a agonizing scream, and the eerie azure-blue aura behind him slightly sank down, enveloping Ye Wuyu's entire body.</p><p></p><p>It was like protection, yet also like an embrace that would kill.</p><p></p><p>"Swallow, swallow it for me!" Ye Wuyu gritted his teeth, spitting out a blood-flecked sentence.</p><p></p><p>Countless spiritual powers flowed from the eerie aura behind him, merging into his body.</p><p></p><p>All the remaining spiritual powers of Summer An Meng, and all the spiritual powers he had previously obtained by killing the remnant souls of the Qianhuan Gate's four realms.</p><p></p><p>These spiritual powers had originally been stored within the eerie aura, because Ye Wuyu could not bear the immense power, so he had simply used the eerie aura as a power bank.</p><p></p><p>But now, Ye Wuyu no longer cared about such things.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was being rotted to death by the gaze of that eye, or being burst open alive, or being killed by the "resurrected" cultivators below - it didn't matter, it didn't matter at all! The oppressive pressure of that gaze had now weakened considerably along with the strengthening of his own aura.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu raised his head, his remaining eye staring fixatedly at the eye in mid-air, opening his mouth and letting out a hoarse, savage laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know why I'm not afraid of death?"</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the countless azure-blue ghostly hands still could not approach within a dozen feet of the eye.</p><p></p><p>But behind Ye Wuyu, the azure-blue figure extended its largest ghostly hand, firmly grasping his waist.</p><p></p><p>The eye in the sky did not seem to understand Ye Wuyu's words, but it continued to gaze silently at Ye Wuyu, as if waiting for his next sentence.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu laughed, and he let out an extremely arrogant, loud laugh towards the eye.</p><p></p><p>"Because it's not me who's going to die! Didn't expect that, did you? I still have another life!"</p><p></p><p>With that, the giant azure-blue hand flung him out forcefully, sending him hurtling straight towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Powered by the frenzied circulation of all the spiritual powers within his body, and the immense strength of the "ghost", Ye Wuyu broke through the dozen-foot barrier.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the crimson-colored pupils now revealed a hint of human-like confusion and surprise.</p><p></p><p>That crimson glow flickered, as if it wanted to unleash something else, but then, in the eye's line of sight, it was plunged into darkness.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu tightly covered his mouth, constantly chewing inside.</p><p></p><p>Blood trickled from the corners of his mouth, the red blood mixed with other colors.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with a gulp, Ye Wuyu opened his mouth, which was now empty except for the blood traces.</p><p></p><p>He had eaten the eye.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Ye Wuyu's figure plummeted from the sky, crashing to the ground, unconscious.</p><p></p><p>But as he slipped into a daze, the voice in his mind spoke up again, though this time Ye Wuyu did not hear it.</p><p></p><p>[I see, this is the mindset you should have. What is the life of a demonic fox worth? If it dies, then so be it.]</p><p></p><p>[Destroy everything, kill everything, sacrifice everything, and ultimately gain everything.]</p><p></p><p>[This is the true you, this is your true self. You have taken another step closer to true formlessness and no-self.]</p><p></p><p>The voice fell silent for a while, then spoke again.</p><p></p><p>[It was just a remnant of the Dao Qi Essence. Swallowing it is no big deal...]</p><p></p><p>The plot is about to end here.</p><p>The fox hasn't died yet. And please, I beg you, vote and continue reading. (End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's main questions now boiled down to two.</p><p></p><p>"You ask me what is 'Gui Yi' (Anomalous/Bizarre)?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's expression was serene, not at all surprised by this question. Instead, he first poured himself a cup of tea, then poured another and gestured for Ye Wuyou to sit down.</p><p></p><p>The tea was good, but Ye Wuyou had no mood to savor it, as he was quite anxious. However, facing this warden who seemed amiable but could easily punch him to death, Ye Wuyou still had the patience to wait.</p><p></p><p>After all, since he had come this far, he might as well get a clear answer. A gentle breeze flipped a few book pages, and Ye Wuyou couldn't help glancing over - he saw some exquisite illustrations with a hint of spring charm.</p><p></p><p>The wind died down, and Ye Wuyou looked at the book cover - "The Annals of Tianya Fenghua - The Luo Yu Chapter".</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou quickly averted his gaze, took a sip of tea, and thought about the rumors that this warden, despite being in his forties or fifties, was still unmarried and had no children... An old scholar still reading such books? No wonder he couldn't find a wife.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's expression remained calm, seemingly unperturbed by this embarrassing scene. He moved the book aside and slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Your question has two meanings - one is about the origin of 'Gui Yi', and the other is about what exactly 'Gui Yi' is."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou hadn't really thought that deeply, but he nodded slightly and continued listening.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan nodded slightly, paused for a moment, and then said:</p><p></p><p>"'Gui Yi' is just a term we use in the Great Yan, but in other places, they may call it 'Heavenly Demon Remnant', or even 'Immortal Anomaly'. In the distant Kingdom of Anxi, they have a special name for it - 'Siming', meaning 'Dead Siming'. But in my view, based on the Twelve Divine Dao Pillars, 'Gui Yi' is merely the remnant of a certain entity."</p><p></p><p>"These things have a characteristic - they are formless and bodiless, invisible to the naked eye, and untouchable by ordinary people. They are immortal and indestructible, and each 'Gui Yi' possesses extraordinary supernatural talents that common people cannot match. Even if I personally annihilate some that seem not so powerful, they will only be reborn elsewhere."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Wuyou understood a bit more, but still felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>Formless and bodiless?</p><p></p><p>How could these ghostly things be formless and bodiless? At least in Ye Wuyou's and Lu Qingshan's eyes, these entities were not without form.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's speech was slow, but he seemed to have noticed Ye Wuyou's thoughts and just smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't rush, let me finish."</p><p></p><p>"As for the origin of these 'Gui Yi', various countries and dynasties have many different theories, with no definitive conclusion. But I have managed to glimpse some information from the Twelve Divine Dao Pillars, though the information is too complex to describe in words. You can go and see for yourself later, perhaps you can gain some insights from it."</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, I forgot to tell you, the Twelve Divine Dao Pillars are a remnant from the previous era. Since I was able to glimpse some information from them, I've also deduced a conclusion."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless of what these 'Gui Yi' are called - remnants, heavenly demons, or dead Siming - they, like the Twelve Divine Dao Pillars, are leftovers from the previous era."</p><p></p><p>"In my view, the origin of 'Gui Yi' dates back to the previous era, and they are the remnants left behind after something was destroyed. Due to their unique nature, they are immortal and indestructible, and have persisted to this day."</p><p></p><p>"This is the origin of 'Gui Yi', Ye Wuyou. What do you think of this answer?"</p><p></p><p>What to think?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou nodded slightly, recalling the narrator's fragmentary remarks. The narrator had referred to these 'Gui Yi' as the remnants of the Great Dao, relics of the previous era - and now everything seemed to fit together.</p><p></p><p>"How long ago was the previous era?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan shook his head slightly. "The Great Yan has been established for over 700 years. Before the Great Yan, there was the Great Qin, spanning over 2,100 years. Before that was Nanzhao, over 1,400 years... Just based on the historical records, it has been over 8,000 years. The 'Gui Yi' have existed since that time."</p><p></p><p>So the previous era must be traced back thousands of years? Ye Wuyou was deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>I couldn't think of any useful information.</p><p></p><p>And Lu Qingshan was still talking, but he didn't know much about the history from thousands of years ago.</p><p></p><p>It seems to be just unofficial history now, talking about a female figure who was possessed by something sinister while in the bed of an emperor from 8,000 years ago.</p><p></p><p>His voice was flat and slow, just like a schoolteacher. Ye Wuyu was sitting in the chair, and he was starting to feel sleepy listening to it.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, Mr. Lu, I don't care about that emperor and the sinister thing... I just want to know if my situation can be resolved?"</p><p></p><p>The origin of the sinister thing was just an aside, the key was his own problem at hand.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu could even feel that the corrosion on his body was gradually deepening. The change was originally only below his forearm, but after a day, he noticed the eerie blue color had crept up further.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in a year? No, at most half a year, or even a few months, he would be completely taken over by this sinister thing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he could only face the situation described by the narrator, and simply explode.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's words abruptly stopped, as if he was a bit discouraged that no one was discussing with him.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ye Wuyu and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it can."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was decisive in character, and he immediately bowed down.</p><p></p><p>What do you rely on when you're out there? You rely on your background and power.</p><p></p><p>Having such a powerful figure from within the system, and one who can solve his problem, there's nothing wrong with becoming his disciple.</p><p></p><p>But he was stopped by Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>"You want to become my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Damn, wasn't it you who said you wanted to take me as a disciple before? Otherwise, I would have already gone to Fenglailu with Elder Zhao to drink tea and listen to music.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's eyes were filled with surprise, but Lu Qingshan's expression remained calm.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, earlier, that girl Spring Tao got a bit anxious seeing Zhao Changhe's actions, and didn't explain things clearly. I do have the idea of taking on disciples, but the prerequisite is..."</p><p></p><p>"That you survive."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu quickly understood the meaning behind his words.</p><p></p><p>The method to solve his own problem doesn't seem easy.</p><p></p><p>"The Twelve Divine Dao Techniques." Lu Qingshan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Great Flame is located on the border, it has two pillars of the Twelve Divine Dao. Each one records a divine dao technique."</p><p></p><p>"These divine pillars are the remnants of the previous era. What is recorded on them are naturally the techniques of that era as well."</p><p></p><p>"The inheritance on them is difficult for outsiders to cultivate, and even to understand. Even those with exceptional talent who grasp a bit of it have to pay an enormous price to use it. For most people in the world, they are just abandoned hard pillars."</p><p></p><p>"But for us, it's different. If you can master one of the divine dao techniques, the price you have to pay will not be borne by you, but by that thing behind you."</p><p></p><p>"After all, they are both relics from the previous era."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ye Wuyu understood.</p><p></p><p>Using the divine dao technique to weaken the sinister thing within him, so as to achieve a balance.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask where these divine pillars are located?"</p><p></p><p>"One divine pillar is in the capital city, and the other is here, in Tianlan City, at the deepest part of the Heavenly Prison."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He had prepared himself to rush to some unknown mountain valley to find the pillar, but it turned out to be this simple.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, who had been on hard mode since birth, now vaguely felt that this seemed... a bit too easy?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Ye Wuyu slowly spoke up and asked:</p><p></p><p>"What divine technique is recorded on the divine pillar in the Heavenly Prison?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan smiled, leaning back slightly. His somewhat gloomy gaze looked out the window at the silent, empty street.</p><p></p><p>Then he slowly spoke a sentence.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyu, can you accept that there is another 'you' in this world?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

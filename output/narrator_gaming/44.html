        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>These words were not just spoken by Zhao Changhe, Ye Wuyu could truly feel the surging qi and blood within himself, unable to suppress the urge to vent it.</p><p></p><p>"I've got you."</p><p></p><p>Soaring through the sky, Ye Wuyu's figure leaped high up, then came crashing down heavily towards the already featherless white fox.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The dilapidated house could not withstand such turbulence, a crack appeared from top to bottom, and it collapsed.</p><p></p><p>A dark shadow jumped out from the ruins, then landed on a roof eave.</p><p></p><p>The already miserable-looking demonic fox now looked even more horrifying, with bare bones visible on its body.</p><p></p><p>But its movements were not affected at all. It glanced down below, then attempted to flee.</p><p></p><p>How could Ye Wuyu let the other party escape? Amid the billowing dust, his figure directly leaped out from the ruins, landing in front of the demonic fox.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have much time left, only three minutes, and half of it had already passed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing its path blocked, the demonic fox did not seem panicked, but instead stood there and opened its mouth that was no longer covered by flesh.</p><p></p><p>The demonic fox tilted its head slightly and let out a shrill howl.</p><p></p><p>But it was not the voice of a demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Instead, a sound of bells came from within it.</p><p></p><p>"Ding... Ling ling."</p><p></p><p>The bell sound was muffled, as if obstructed by something.</p><p></p><p>But this was enough.</p><p></p><p>Because this bell sound could affect one's mind and spirit, especially at such close range.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe who had just rushed over trembled in his gaze, then stood rooted to the spot, completely stiff.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze also faltered, and he remained motionless, as if trapped in a confused and chaotic state.</p><p></p><p>[Hmph, it's just a faint sharp edge of the Dao aura, how could it make you fall into confusion? You should immediately wake up and deliver a fatal blow to this worthless ointment.]</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu still remained motionless, not waking up.</p><p></p><p>[You have never woken up, it seems this thing has something unusual, you are constantly pondering in your heart...]</p><p></p><p>The demonic fox raised its paw to scratch the roof eave, its head that no longer resembled a fox shook, seemingly very disdainful.</p><p></p><p>It stepped lightly, leaping high up, about to leave this place.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, the airborne demonic fox suddenly trembled, then its limbs flailed and struggled wildly in the air.</p><p></p><p>"Creak."</p><p></p><p>A crisp sound, and the demonic fox's limbs instantly stopped struggling, hanging limply.</p><p></p><p>This does not mean the demonic fox is dead, after all, the current "demonic fox" is no longer a living being.</p><p></p><p>Its limbs have simply been forcibly snapped off.</p><p></p><p>The azure-blue invisible giant hand gently took the fox down from the air, then grabbed it and brought it in front of Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>With his clothes already tattered and his hair still disheveled, Ye Wuyu's appearance was like that of a madman, but his gaze was sharp.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the demonic fox that was now unable to move, held in front of him, and a beautiful arc appeared at the corner of his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The arc grew wider and the smile became more intense, and he finally burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"You thought I was controlled by the bell sound? Hahaha, I was faking it!"</p><p></p><p>He was laughing.</p><p></p><p>He was not laughing at the demonic fox.</p><p></p><p>He was laughing at the dog-barking thing in his head.</p><p></p><p>[I see, everything was within your plan, you, with your exceptional mind, capturing this evil creature was a foregone conclusion.]</p><p></p><p>Oh? The narrator didn't bark back at me? Ye Wuyu's gaze swept over the demonic fox, then calmly looked at the man in the brocade robe who had rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe was now clutching his head, muttering.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, what happened just now? I felt like I was about to faint, but something helped block it."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze briefly swept over the man's shoulder, the spiritual imprint belonging to himself had almost disappeared. It was this thing that had obstructed the bell sound.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, with the current situation, this man in the brocade robe being "subverted" by the demonic fox would not be easy for him to handle.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This thing, how do you want to handle it, Ye Wuyou? Just kill it and take it out directly?" Ye Wuyou raised the helplessly struggling demonic fox in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, Brother Ye, you can rest. I have a way to deal with it." </p><p></p><p>Although he said that, Ye Wuyou didn't dare to truly rest. He stood to the side, maintaining a distance of about ten meters, and the huge azure hand remained outstretched, ready to immediately annihilate if anything unexpected happened.</p><p></p><p>Watching the man in the brocade robe performing his mystical techniques, Ye Wuyou glanced at the giant hand hovering above him, inwardly marveling. </p><p></p><p>This "ghost" was indeed very useful. Just the fact that others couldn't see it was already far superior to that sidekick that could only bark like a dog.</p><p></p><p>[Bullshit, this broken Dao relic is useless. It's just a sticking plaster that won't come off once it's on someone, and it'll occasionally even cause... ] </p><p></p><p>Huh? Cause what? Ye Wuyou seemed to have heard something, but the inner monologue had already switched to a different topic, directly descending into madness.</p><p></p><p>[As an artifact from the old era, the fact that you can use it is already its greatest honor. You are the giant of the new era, destined to stand atop the world as the one true god.]</p><p></p><p>Tsk.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was disdainful, but he didn't think about anything else, his gaze fixed ahead with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>As the last disciple of the Qianhuan Sect, the man in the brocade robe should have mastered all the sect's supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>The bell borrowed from Lin Qingqing was now floating above the demonic fox, and the skinned furry corpse trembled slightly, then a flash of light emerged from within.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou watched closely, and it was an eyeball... no, a fleshy ball the size of a baby's fist that flew up and was then drawn into the small bell.</p><p></p><p>The bell trembled slightly, as if wanting to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat appeared on the brocade-robed man's forehead, his hands constantly making seals, and finally the bell gradually calmed down amid the trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Phew." The brocade-robed man let out a long sigh, then grabbed the bell with one hand and placed it in his bosom, his eyes filled with solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"This container won't hold for long, it needs to be replaced soon."</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, the brocade-robed man's gaze turned to Ye Wuyou, silently retreating a few steps.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's methods, the brocade-robed man had just witnessed.</p><p></p><p>Although the other party was only at the Boundary realm, his mystical techniques were even more bizarre than Ye Wuyou's, so he had to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou smiled, "Are you afraid I'll snatch it?"</p><p></p><p>A trace of embarrassment flashed across the brocade-robed man's face, but he quickly concealed it and spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This object is the most precious treasure of our Qianhuan Sect. As the last disciple of the sect, I naturally have to retrieve it..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou stood in place, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>Of course he understood that the treasure was precious. But why would he snatch something that was already his? </p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, this brocade-robed man should dissipate soon and become a corpse. After all, from the beginning, he was just a dead man trapped in the illusion of this object.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ye Wuyou remained silent, the brocade-robed man felt somewhat embarrassed, and a complex expression could not be hidden in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment, then solemnly bowed to Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, I know this object is precious, and your Tianlao is also investigating it, but I hope Brother Ye can be magnanimous and let me have it."</p><p></p><p>"In my youth, I was deceived by the demonic fox and made a grave mistake. I only regretted it deeply when I woke up from the dream. The Qianhuan Sect is the pain of my life!"</p><p></p><p>"With this object, I can rebuild the Qianhuan Sect within ten years and make it one of the top sects in the Great Flame. </p><p></p><p>"Whatever you need, Brother Ye, you can take it freely. All the treasures of the Qianhuan Sect will be yours as long as I have a share."</p><p></p><p>The brocade-robed man's expression was sincere, his words earnest and not false.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou could feel that at least at this moment, the other party's words were true.</p><p></p><p>But now he had a question in his heart, and this question was becoming increasingly unsettling.</p><p></p><p>Why hasn't the other party dissipated yet...?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

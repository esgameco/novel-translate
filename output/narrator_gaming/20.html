        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Refining the fist into a cannon."</p><p></p><p>In the snowy courtyard, a thunderous explosion shook the place.</p><p></p><p>The white-haired Zhao Changhe, his figure showing no signs of age, moved like a ghostly apparition.</p><p></p><p>Yet each of his moves was incredibly heavy, filled with swiftness and power.</p><p></p><p>The combination of stillness and motion was truly perfect.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe did not wield a sword, nor was he equipped with any weapons.</p><p></p><p>As a cultivator who had attained the Five Boundaries of Great Spiritual Attainments, he relied solely on his iron fists.</p><p></p><p>The snowfall had ceased in the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The accumulated snow in the entire courtyard had been dispersed and vanished under the fierce punching winds.</p><p></p><p>"What cultivators cultivate are the mystical arts."</p><p></p><p>"In my view, these mystical arts are merely means to defeat one's enemies."</p><p></p><p>"In my younger days, I was just an ordinary martial artist. By chance, I obtained a cultivation method, but I found those complex mystical arts quite daunting."</p><p></p><p>"So I simply made my martial techniques my own mystical arts."</p><p></p><p>His words echoed through the courtyard, but then his momentum paused.</p><p></p><p>"Hah!"</p><p></p><p>The old man let out a thunderous roar, his ghostly figure emerging from the flowing dragon-like movements, assuming a fighting stance. Immediately, the skin on his body began to flush red.</p><p></p><p>Even a common person untrained in cultivation could sense the gradual rise in his aura.</p><p></p><p>"This is called 'Igniting the Blood'. It requires drawing the qi from the dantian and storing it in specific meridians. When facing an enemy, the boiling blood energy can be utilized..."</p><p></p><p>"This provides a temporary boost to one's strength without harming oneself, but it has its limits, lasting around three minutes..."</p><p></p><p>"It's quite suitable for you reckless youngsters to use."</p><p></p><p>The old man suddenly leaped high into the air, letting out another roar as he brought his foot down.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu observed clearly that this move did not involve any qi manipulation, but was merely a demonstration of a regular technique.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A pit over a meter wide was created in the courtyard floor.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe's figure slowly settled back to the ground, and after a long while, the falling snow once again blanketed the courtyard in white.</p><p></p><p>The old man glanced at the focused Ye Wuyu and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"My fist techniques are grand and expansive, forged from a lifetime of martial arts. I've only shown you this once, so you probably couldn't comprehend the intricacies within. Nevermind, let me..."</p><p></p><p>"I've memorized it."</p><p></p><p>What nonsense is this kid spouting? Zhao Changhe furrowed his brow slightly.</p><p></p><p>To a common person, this set of fist techniques would appear to be nothing more than the crude punches and kicks of a martial artist, impressive in power but lacking in elegance.</p><p></p><p>The changes within, such as the flow of qi in the punch he had just demonstrated, the precise focus of force in the palm - and how, when facing a distant opponent, he could transform the qi into a powerful strike through footwork and body positioning - all of these nuances would be lost on a casual observer.</p><p></p><p>Yet this kid claimed to have memorized it after just a single viewing? But soon, when Ye Wuyu stood in the courtyard and executed techniques identical to Zhao Changhe's previous display, the old man's weathered face betrayed a subtle change.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, could this kid be a genius?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was no genius.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" silently circulated within him, and his qi naturally found the most optimal paths along the meridians, activating the techniques at the perfect moments.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had effortlessly learned Lu Caiwei's sword techniques earlier, this time Ye Wuyu also quickly mastered Zhao Changhe's fist methods.</p><p></p><p>And through his own practice, he could now appreciate the intricacies of the old man's techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I see, this punch may appear simple, but the qi flows in a reverse direction through the meridians, layering and accumulating, effectively multiplying its power tenfold."</p><p></p><p>"As for the 'Igniting the Blood', it's quite profound, and there must be more to it that Zhao Changhe didn't demonstrate."</p><p></p><p>"He likely didn't showcase the technique to its fullest, where the accumulated qi in the punching wind can cause even greater destruction and explosive power. But of course, he was just demonstrating it."</p><p></p><p>In the end, to avoid unnecessary discussion, Ye Wuyu intentionally executed a few key steps incorrectly, then pretended his qi circulation was improper, barely managing to complete the technique.</p><p></p><p>Good, this should be enough to pass as a somewhat normal genius.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze calmly looked towards Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>"The old fellow must have been greatly shocked!" However, what he saw was the calm and composed Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe stroked his beard, his eyes indifferently surveying Ye Wuyou, and sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all? I can only say that you have some talent, but that's about it. Not as good as I was in my prime..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou felt that the old fellow had gone mad. Didn't he just say that this was the culmination of a lifetime of martial arts cultivation? Shouldn't it have taken him a lifetime to reach this level? </p><p></p><p>Or was he really just that mediocre? Was the Wuxiang Heart Sutra not that impressive after all? Were there too many geniuses in this world? Ye Wuyou fell into deep self-doubt.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Zhao Changhe revealed his true intentions.</p><p></p><p>The old man had one hand behind his back, his gaze slightly tilted upwards at a 45-degree angle, trying to portray the image of a supreme immortal in the midst of the falling snow.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is only this much... Well, since I'm fated to meet you, kneel down and kowtow three times, and I'll take you as my disciple..."</p><p></p><p>By the end, his tone had even become slightly excited.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou: "?"</p><p></p><p>The old fellow's scheme was ringing louder than a bronze bell... </p><p></p><p>Trying to act like an immortal to lure me in, huh? </p><p></p><p>Does he think I'm a fool? After some thought, Ye Wuyou's expression turned to one of distress and dejection.</p><p></p><p>"I'm grateful for the master's appreciation, but... I'm aware that my talents are lacking, and the path of cultivation will be arduous. I'm afraid I may tarnish the master's reputation in the future, so I must decline..."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe, who had been calmly stroking his beard, changed his expression upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"No, the world is vast, and everyone has the potential to be a dragon. Cultivation does not require looking at one's talents."</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid of tarnishing the master's reputation..."</p><p></p><p>"That's just a name. You just focus on moving forward, regardless of the winds from the east, west, south, or north."</p><p></p><p>"I was born poor, and my willpower in cultivation is weak. The alluring world has captivated me..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, who doesn't love the alluring world? I have VIP memberships at the White Jade Pavilion and the Phoenix Pavilion. In the future, you can use my account."</p><p></p><p>"Young man, young man... Ah?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was stunned.</p><p></p><p>After Zhao Changhe finished this sentence, even the old man's face seemed a bit embarrassed. After a brief pause, he slowly continued.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I don't care what cultivation method you're practicing now or what opportunities you have, but..."</p><p></p><p>"Become my disciple, and I can give you the best elixirs, the best cultivation techniques and divine abilities, the best divine weapons and blades."</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Great Yan Empire, I, Zhao, still have a certain reputation. If you have your eye on a cultivator maiden from any sect, just find a way to snatch her, and I'll help you settle the aftermath."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Zhao Changhe even appropriately exerted his fifth-realm aura.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou quietly watched this scene, his expression wavering.</p><p></p><p>Damn it.</p><p>He was tempted.</p><p></p><p>In these past few days, when chatting with the Four Seasons Sisters, he had gained a general understanding of the current state of the Great Yan Empire.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Great Yan Empire, there were only a handful of cultivators at the sixth realm of great divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe, a fifth-realm expert, was already considered a peerless supreme master in this Great Yan Empire, in this Tianlan City.</p><p></p><p>He was alone in this world, without any support. Having a powerful master like this wouldn't be too bad, would it?</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Wuyou was gradually about to have his inner defenses breached by the offer of VIP memberships at the brothels, a clear voice suddenly came from the small house nearby.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Senior, this cannot be."</p><p></p><p>Turning back, he saw the four beautiful figures of Chuntao, Xialie, Qiugua, and Dongzao emerge from the small house.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe frowned slightly, his gaze sweeping over the four, and he said indifferently, "I only wanted to take on a disciple. What's the problem with that?"</p><p></p><p>The four looked at each other, and in the end, it was Chuntao, who was Zhao Changhe's half-disciple, who stepped forward and apologetically said, "I'm sorry, Master, but you don't know about this..."</p><p></p><p>"The Warden has already said that he wants to take Ye Gongzi as his disciple."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

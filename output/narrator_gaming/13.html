        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Anyway, both prison cells are empty now, so he can just enter one of them randomly.</p><p></p><p>Soon, if the two mysterious beings outside finish their standoff, unless one of them is completely gone, the mute girl and the man without feet will likely come to find him again.</p><p></p><p>If the mute girl can enter his cell, it means this cell belongs to her. If not, then it's not.</p><p></p><p>If neither the mute girl nor the man without feet can get in, it means he has ended up in another unknown mysterious cell.</p><p></p><p>But since the mysterious being is not inside, the one that escaped the cell probably doesn't want to return, right?</p><p></p><p>Just like prisoners, once they've caused a ruckus in the prison and escaped their cell, would they willingly go back?</p><p></p><p>So Ye Wuyu carried Luo Caiwi and chose the cell closest to him.</p><p></p><p>Next to this cell is the one holding the wooden stake, but they are still separated by a sufficient distance.</p><p></p><p>After carrying Luo Caiwi into the cell and closing the door, the pressure brought by the two mysterious beings outside immediately dissipated.</p><p></p><p>And surprisingly, this cell seems to be enhanced by some kind of mystical technique, as the space inside appears much larger than the outside.</p><p></p><p>The length and width are both over 10 meters, and the height is close to 7 meters.</p><p></p><p>A truly remarkable mystical technique.</p><p></p><p>Out in the corridor, the standoff between the mute girl and the man without feet was still ongoing. </p><p></p><p>One staring with hollow, gray-white eyes, the other whipping his long hair.</p><p></p><p>The two mysterious beings were now motionless, like they had frozen.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at them briefly, then turned his gaze to Luo Caiwi.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's legs were still there, but she could not stand. She was now sitting on the ground, her cold face devoid of expression.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu squatted down, glancing sideways at the corner reflection.</p><p>There was no shadow of legs.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu thought for a moment, then squatted in front of her, waving his hand in front of her eyes and seeing no reaction, before gently slapping her cheek.</p><p></p><p>The girl's eyes finally regained some focus, looking at Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>"I will help you get your legs back," Ye Wuyu said seriously, without any comforting words.</p><p></p><p>Then he pointed outside the cell, indicating the man without feet.</p><p></p><p>"That man without feet is out there. When they are done fighting each other, I will intervene."</p><p></p><p>Luo Caiwi's gaze followed the direction of Ye Wuyu's finger, but of course she could see nothing. She could only vaguely sense it through her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, she nodded slightly, opened her mouth, but seemed unsure of what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Th-thank you," she finally managed.</p><p></p><p>After saying that, the girl turned her head away, appearing somewhat conflicted, then spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"You, you saved me. I, I don't know how to properly thank you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu raised an eyebrow, thinking to himself that this was no big deal. If Luo Caiwi hadn't been there to guard him a few days ago, he would have died long ago. Without the water and food provided by her storage ring, he would have starved to death.</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng's voice echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, although she may seem a bit simple-minded, she's actually not that smart, but she has a bit of pride and doesn't like to owe others favors."</p><p></p><p>"But she saved me before too," Ye Wuyu felt the other's words were not quite right. This was about equality between men and women, he didn't want to be a freeloader.</p><p></p><p>Xia Anmeng was silent for a while, then sighed and slowly said, "She saved you... because she felt it was a normal and easy thing for a stronger person to help the weak. Of course, my disciple doesn't look down on you."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression faltered a bit.</p><p></p><p>"But of course, this is just my disciple's view. If you happen to get out of here, don't think everyone thinks the same way, or it might end up harming you," Xia Anmeng warned.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu smiled. Of course, he knew this.</p><p></p><p>In this world where individuals cultivate their own power, the strong must ruthlessly humiliate the weak - perhaps this is the notion held by most people? If the Heavenly Father has placed the spoon at one's mouth, is it not ungrateful to not eat it?</p><p></p><p>Fuck it, I'll just eat it!</p><p></p><p>So, his gaze turned to Lu Caiwai, whose expression was conflicted and head slightly lowered. After thinking it over, he said,</p><p></p><p>"Lu Caiwai, if you feel uneasy about it, how about you agree to a condition of mine after we get out of here?"</p><p></p><p>"And that includes getting your leg back." Ye Wuyu gestured towards Lu Caiwei's legs.</p><p></p><p>"It's... it's two legs." Lu Caiwai murmured softly, then added.</p><p></p><p>"What condition is it?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu waved his hand, "I haven't decided yet, I'll tell you after we get out."</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwai let out an "oh" sound, raising her head slightly, her expression seeming a bit more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze turned towards Ye Wuyu, just about to speak, but her expression suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Lu Caiwai's entire body was swept up by a great force, her form directly floating to the other end of the cage, suspended in midair.</p><p></p><p>As if she had been grasped by something.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change caused Ye Wuyu to instantly rise, picking up Lu Caiwai's saber from the ground, his aura bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>There's still something sinister in this cage? But how could I not see it? A single oversight, and it turns out to be a hidden, stealthy anomaly. Even though you are invincible in the world, at this moment you can only exclaim in this way. But no matter, the timing is not too late. Realizing all this, you will be able to see through the other's trajectory.</p><p></p><p>The illusory blue spectral arms gradually solidified in Ye Wuyu's eyes, just as the dog's monologue had said, he seemed to be able to see it now.</p><p></p><p>In his sight, there was a blue creature occupying nearly half the size of the cage. </p><p></p><p>The anomaly had no physical body, but a distorted human face, from which countless azure blue arms extended, currently grasping Lu Caiwai.</p><p></p><p>It turns out, this cage did not lack an anomaly, nor had the anomaly left. </p><p></p><p>It had been here all along, patiently watching them converse.</p><p></p><p>But it could not be detected!</p><p></p><p>Just like a ghost! "Let her go! If you have the guts, come at me!" Ye Wuyu roared, holding the saber.</p><p></p><p>That was his meal ticket after all! He had just made up his mind to claim his soft meal, but hadn't even taken a bite yet! The "ghost" seemed to have heard Ye Wuyu's words, the blue face wavering, and it carelessly tossed the captured Lu Caiwai away, then countless blue giant hands lunged towards Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Fuck.</p><p></p><p>So you really came!</p><p></p><p>Although that was the case, Ye Wuyu still raised his saber to meet the attack.</p><p></p><p>Sword Qi Thunderstorm! Thunderstorm! Thunderstorm!</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive Sword Qi Thunderstorms slashed through dozens of blue arms, also bringing Summer An Meng's slightly hurried words.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening... I can't sense anything, don't keep using that technique, my spiritual power isn't enough for you to consume like this."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu ignored her.</p><p></p><p>Summer An Meng couldn't sense it, but Ye Wuyu could see it very clearly.</p><p></p><p>The blue arms were endless, even though he had slashed away dozens of them, there were still many left.</p><p></p><p>As for why he kept using that one technique - </p><p>because that was the only one Ye Wuyu knew!</p><p></p><p>Before long, after two more Sword Qi Thunderstorms, the endless blue arms completely enveloped and restrained Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>It wants to eat me! This ghostly anomaly is clearly different from the others.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Legless Man who only took people's legs, or the Mute Woman who only craved their bodies.</p><p></p><p>This one is truly lethal.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

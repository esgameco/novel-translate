        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How many days have you been in this village?"</p><p></p><p>"What exactly do you find unusual? What are you referring to?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you tried confirming the identities of your previous cellmates?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe kept asking question after question, his gaze heavy with seriousness.</p><p></p><p>He stared intently at Ye Wuyu before him.</p><p></p><p>Even though he knew the other party was not quite normal, the man in the brocade robe was still desperately trying to extract even the slightest bit of information from Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu nodded, his expression also becoming more serious. He tilted his head and widened his eyes, as if deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The madman's contemplation did not last long.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu furrowed his brows and said earnestly,</p><p></p><p>"It's been around seven or eight days, I'm not sure. But it's been peaceful every night, the werewolves haven't attacked.</p><p></p><p>As for what's not right, there are too many things that are off.</p><p></p><p>I've been asking about their identities, but they just won't admit it! I'm the only one claiming to be the seer, and no one's backing me up, so it's hard to lead the team."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe initially listened attentively, but by the end, his expression fell.</p><p></p><p>A hint of murderous intent suddenly flashed across his gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly calmed down.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what might happen if he were to kill someone in this bizarre village.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe felt a twinge of regret. Could it be that the other's unusual behavior was simply due to him being a madman?</p><p></p><p>"It's getting dark."</p><p></p><p>A voice came from the front, interrupting the man's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stared at him and then whispered softly,</p><p></p><p>"I told you, when it gets dark, there will be a bell sound."</p><p></p><p>Bell sound?</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe was taken aback, then grabbed Ye Wuyu and asked,</p><p></p><p>"When will the bell sound? What kind of bell sound? Has anything happened?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps his voice was too loud, as footsteps could be heard approaching. Ye Wuyu slapped his hand away and then pulled him to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go back to my place. Those people are all mad, it's tiring to talk to them."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe did not refuse, and a few minutes later, they arrived at Ye Wuyu's residence.</p><p></p><p>In the eastern part of the village, a simple adobe house.</p><p></p><p>The sky was gradually darkening, and there were fewer people around, as they had all likely returned to their homes.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe noticed that the surrounding residents were all part of the group that had come to Cloud Mist Mountain.</p><p></p><p>For example, across the small path from Ye Wuyu's place was the Hehuan Sect woman, Bai Lu.</p><p></p><p>Next to her were the people from the Heavenly Prison, and then Tushu from the Beast Taming Sect.</p><p></p><p>Intentionally or not, this group of people were all living in the same area.</p><p></p><p>Except for Ye Wuyu, they all believed themselves to be true villagers.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this young man in front of him might just be a madman after all.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe entered the house. It was very simple, with a bed, a dilapidated wooden table with a drawer, and nothing else.</p><p></p><p>"Come, come, have a seat, don't be a stranger, make yourself at home here," Ye Wuyu plopped down on the bed, not caring whether the other had a chair to sit on.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe naturally would not sit on the bed with a madman, but since there were no other chairs in the room, he simply stood.</p><p></p><p>"So, what's this bell sound about?"</p><p></p><p>"Bell sound? Hmm, let me think." Ye Wuyu paused, seeming to have forgotten what he had just said.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe sighed inwardly, but could only wait patiently for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a cultivator at the Third Realm, a former disciple of the Sect Master of Qian Xuan Gate. He couldn't afford to get angry at this madman.</p><p></p><p>As long as the other could provide some information to help him find a way to leave this village, that would be enough. As for what happens to these people afterwards, whether they end up trapped here, it had nothing to do with him.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, I remember now, every midnight I hear a bell sound, but whenever I ask the others, they haven't heard it and just laugh at me instead," Ye Wuyu said.</p><p></p><p>Midnight bell sound? The Qian Xuan Purple Gold Bell? The man in the brocade robe suddenly recalled that the three times he had previously tried to leave the village, it had also been around midnight.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He lost consciousness and appeared in the village the next day.</p><p></p><p>But he never heard the bell sound. The man in the brocade robe looked thoughtful. His memory was very clear - he had only been in this village for three days, but Ye Wuyu's initial answer was that it had been at least seven or eight days.</p><p></p><p>Who was mistaken? Hmph, it was definitely that lunatic who was mistaken.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's eyes suddenly became sharp as he looked at Ye Wuyu and slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"After hearing the bell, did you feel anything unusual? Or did you have any abnormalities yourself?"</p><p></p><p>"No, everything was normal except that I felt a bit sleepy." </p><p></p><p>"But the others couldn't be woken up no matter how much we called them, and at night I couldn't even find anyone to have a party with," Ye Wuyu said blankly.</p><p></p><p>Sleepy? Couldn't be woken up? If this was truly the Qianxuan Purple Gold Bell, the precious treasure of his former sect, how could it just make people feel sleepy after hearing it? The man in the brocade robe looked at the dark circles under Ye Wuyu's eyes and furrowed his brow.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know about this? Were you not sleeping at night?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was taken aback, then responded.</p><p></p><p>"Sleep? Sleep at my age? Who can sleep?"</p><p></p><p>Then Ye Wuyu leaned in and whispered secretly:</p><p></p><p>"Every night when it gets dark, I don't sleep. You know why? Because I have to keep my eyes open to catch the werewolf."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's gaze darkened, and with a slight movement of his fingertips, Ye Wuyu was knocked to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Although he was a lunatic, he had still provided some information.</p><p></p><p>He turned to leave, but a call came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe was about to respond, but then remembered this was a lunatic, so he just smiled and made to leave.</p><p></p><p>"It's dark outside now, it's dangerous. Maybe you should stay here with me tonight. It may not be a peaceful night."</p><p></p><p>The lunatic's gaze was sincere, and the man in the brocade robe thought about it and didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>He had no plans to leave this mysterious village tonight.</p><p></p><p>He would stay and listen for the bell sound at midnight.</p><p></p><p>By staying with the lunatic, he could also verify the truthfulness of the other's words.</p><p></p><p>If there was no bell sound...</p><p></p><p>Then he would kill this lunatic and try to escape the village.</p><p></p><p>The two of them quietly waited for the sky to darken in the house.</p><p></p><p>During that time, they also had a few casual conversations.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe hesitated a bit, and also mentioned that he knew White Dew and Tu Su, trying to get some information from the other.</p><p></p><p>However, the other's responses were irrelevant, so he had to give up.</p><p></p><p>"Slurp, slurp."</p><p></p><p>After finishing the last of the meat soup, Ye Wuyu wiped his mouth and turned to look at the man in the brocade robe standing at the door.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you going to eat?"</p><p></p><p>"Dare you eat the things here?" the man in the brocade robe sneered.</p><p></p><p>Who knows what kind of things these "foods" would turn out to be once they were in your stomach? Ye Wuyu shook his head and said proudly:</p><p></p><p>"I haven't eaten the food here either. This chicken is from the peasant boy. He raises a lot of chickens and ducks, so I helped lighten his burden a bit."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression twitched, but he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Soon, it was midnight.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression became solemn. If this lunatic wasn't lying, the bell sound should appear now.</p><p></p><p>After eating and drinking his fill, Ye Wuyu sat on the bed, let out a burp, and tilted his head.</p><p></p><p>As if recalling something, he said to the man in the brocade robe:</p><p></p><p>"Hey, you rich man in the robe, you said earlier that you know that fox-like woman and the peasant boy next door, that you all came together and didn't separate midway."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe frowned, not knowing why the other was saying this.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu patted his belly, then looked very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"You said they've all gone mad, thinking they are villagers here..."</p><p></p><p>"Then why... are you the only one not in the village?"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

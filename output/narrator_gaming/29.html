        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood in place, his expression calm, as he recalled the information about the demonic fox he had previously read in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-four years ago, the Qingqiu Demonic Fox had transformed into a beautiful woman and infiltrated the cultivation sect Qianxuan Gate, using her fox charms to bewitch the sect master, and then stole the sect's most precious treasure, ultimately causing the downfall of Qianxuan Gate.</p><p></p><p>That Murong Huan's scattered soul had now dissipated like smoke, leaving nothing behind.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the "ghost" behind Ye Wuyu seemed to have solidified slightly.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" within him was still self-operating.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu closed his eyes and opened them again, a hint of confusion flashing in his gaze.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of the "Formless Heart Sutra" - the realm of no-self, what exactly was it?</p><p></p><p>When he first entered this realm in the celestial prison, he had devoured the massive soul force of Xia Anmeng, and inadvertently devoured a "strange" one as well.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know the exact level of the realm, his spiritual energy at the time had been overwhelmingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Back then, it seemed that even some of the ambitions in his heart had gradually been amplified by this powerful force.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, the only feeling left in Ye Wuyu's heart at that time was:</p><p></p><p>No self, invincible.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering this realm, his eyes seemed to be able to see through all illusions.</p><p></p><p>No matter what the opponent was or what divine abilities they possessed, he could clearly perceive it in his mind.</p><p></p><p>It was as if... the narration had completely merged into his own body.</p><p></p><p>But now, was he still himself? The bewilderment in his eyes seemed to have deepened.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's figure stood motionless on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, Ye Wuyu, are you alright?" Lin Qingqing's breathing was somewhat chaotic as she stood beside him, with a few bloodstains visible through her clothes on her delicate figure.</p><p></p><p>Murong Huan had disappeared, and the illusion had dissipated as well.</p><p></p><p>However... for Lin Qingqing and the others, that experience might not have been an illusion.</p><p></p><p>A reality-blurring illusion, even if the illusion had dispersed, for those who had not realized this, the events that had occurred in their perception were still real.</p><p></p><p>They had truly fought against a monstrous giant wolf, then drove it away, and were also inexplicably wounded by its strange abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Are you alright? Why are you spacing out?" Lin Qingqing walked up to him and gently patted him, a hint of bewilderment in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine," came the familiar voice, calm and devoid of any emotion.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu gently took her hand away, the confusion in his eyes now gone.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the three standing beside him, their injuries varying in severity, and after a moment, revealed a benevolent smile.</p><p></p><p>Yes, should he smile now?</p><p></p><p>"You've all worked hard. Now, should we return to rest, or go capture the demonic fox?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's words were spoken with a smile, but his tone was exceptionally calm, without any trace of laughter.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing stood in front of him, her brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>She felt that the Ye Wuyu before her seemed a bit strange, but she couldn't quite put her finger on what was different.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he had become a different person.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing didn't say anything, but Xu spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The burly man's injuries were the most severe, but his spirit and energy were the strongest, after all, he was a cultivator who had refined his body, so the physical injuries were not enough to threaten his life.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, we haven't asked you yet - when that demonic beast attacked, you suddenly disappeared. Where did you go?"</p><p></p><p>"We were fighting for our lives, and you didn't have a single injury. Don't you know that if there had been one more person to hold it back, we could have slain that demonic beast on the spot instead of just driving it away!"</p><p></p><p>Slay the demonic beast?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the illusion, how could they have slain the monstrous creature? Was it by dreaming?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu lowered his gaze slightly, not arguing with him, but simply apologizing in a light tone.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu's anger did not subside at all, and he was not appeased by Ye Wuyu's casual apology.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the fact that Ye Wuyu had "fled the battlefield" unharmed while the three of them faced danger had made him extremely furious.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, I can't stand your attitude. Either give me an explanation, or be a man and fight it out with me fair and square. If an apology is enough, what's the use of fists!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Ye Wuyu's expression remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The words were like air, not stirring him in the least.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>Ah, this martial artist is truly foolish. How can I explain this to him? It is already a false illusion, why must he argue with me? It's so noisy, should I just kill him?</p><p></p><p>No, what am I thinking?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu shook his head slightly. Why would he have such a stupid idea? There are still two others nearby, how could he think of killing the other?</p><p></p><p>He should kill them all.</p><p></p><p>Three at the Second Realm, and all injured. If he seriously attacked, it wouldn't take long...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu lifted his head, his gaze towards the front, his eyes cold and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>A ghostly blue hand extended out from behind him, followed by a second, a third...</p><p></p><p>Not only could the naked eye not detect it, even Summer An Meng, an experienced Sixth Realm remnant soul, could not sense it at all.</p><p></p><p>Hum...</p><p></p><p>A mysterious tremor seemed to be spreading through the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The trees swayed, the birds fled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a massive crack burst forth from the ground, quickly splitting into countless fissures.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This is... an earth rumble?"</p><p></p><p>A white fox was swiftly darting through the forest, feeling the violent tremors, and then lay down motionless on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The fox's two eyes rolled, its intelligent gaze contemplating something.</p><p></p><p>It had three tails behind it... or rather, it had originally had three tails.</p><p></p><p>Blood was dripping from the severed tail, the pain causing this white fox to bare its teeth in a rather human-like expression.</p><p></p><p>This was the demonic fox that Ye Wuyu's group had been searching for.</p><p></p><p>"Not only did that pack from the Celestial Prison come, but that woman showed up too." </p><p></p><p>The "that woman" the white fox referred to was of course Bai Lu, the woman from the Harmony Sect.</p><p></p><p>She was also the white fox's half-sister of the same clan.</p><p></p><p>Demonic beasts below the Fourth Realm, though intelligent, had not yet awakened their spirits and could not transform.</p><p></p><p>But the fox clan could.</p><p></p><p>Thirty-six years ago, during the chaos in Qingqiu, they had fled together, crossing the ten-thousand-mile mountains and the Cloud Mist Mountain Range, arriving in the remote Great Yan.</p><p></p><p>She and her sister went their separate ways, wandering the human world.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the unique talents of the fox clan, she beguiled people's hearts and advanced her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for her sister, it seemed she had joined a human sect.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when she reached the Third Realm, she encountered the Sect Master of the Thousand Illusion Gate.</p><p></p><p>In him, she sensed a familiar aura - the aura of her ancestor.</p><p></p><p>To understand this further, she transformed and made contact with him, entering the Thousand Illusion Gate, and finally discovered the source of that familiar aura.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Gate's precious treasure, the Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell.</p><p></p><p>But that was no treasure of the Thousand Illusion Gate, it was clearly an heirloom of her fox clan ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In the way of illusions, who could match the fox clan? Taking back her ancestor's relic, what was wrong with that? In just a few more years, with the ancestral item, she could easily break through to the Fourth Realm and become a great demon.</p><p></p><p>But during a harvesting trip, she encountered a terrifying old man!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of that guy, the white fox's teeth itched with anger.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, she had not brought the treasure with her, but had hidden it in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Prison bunch not killing her was clearly for the sake of this treasure.</p><p></p><p>Now with the Celestial Prison collapsing, it had given her a new opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Leaving that treasure in this mountain range for so long, it has already absorbed enough of the essence of the sun and moon. Now I just need to retrieve it."</p><p></p><p>A glimmer of liveliness flashed in the white fox's eyes, mixed with ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>Once she recovered the ancestral relic, she would immediately leave Great Yan. </p><p></p><p>By then, she would be a Fourth Realm great demon, and even if she returned to Qingqiu, she could carve out her own domain.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The white fox's eyes darted, its vision was extremely keen.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the crumbling mountain, it saw a figure.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Prison's lackey! The white fox's heart trembled, about to turn and flee, but then it calmed down and observed carefully.</p><p></p><p>It was just a First Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The white fox licked its lips, its tail swaying gently behind it.</p><p></p><p>Since it was injured... it would just thoroughly drain this man's essence blood.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, I wouldn't have been stuck at the same level for so many years. Now I can only rely on the last few connections of my late father to try to find a job for myself in this prison.</p><p></p><p>[Fuck your mother, I won't take a job with a monthly salary of only a few taels of silver, even a dog wouldn't do it. How could a lowly prison guard position be worthy of someone of my status? Working here is just like being imprisoned, and going off duty is just like taking a stroll. Extremely dissatisfied with this, you turn around and leave in a stylish manner, and then wander freely in the jianghu afterwards.]</p><p></p><p>Don't bark like a dog, I'm just a commoner without any special abilities. Working two days on, two days off without having to toil under the sun and wind, I'm quite satisfied with it, okay...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu suppressed the clamorous voices in his mind and carefully scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The room was a bit dim, the simple wooden table stained with uncleaned oil stains, bearing the marks of time.</p><p></p><p>The man sitting in front of him was about forty years old, with a knife scar running from his eyebrow to his nose bridge. At this moment, he stretched out his finger, licked it, then opened the yellowed envelope in his hand, occasionally glancing sideways at Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>His uniform indicated his identity - a prison guard of the Tian Lao (Celestial Prison).</p><p></p><p>Time trickled by, the man kept licking the hand holding the letter.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the man's furrowed brows, Ye Wuyu felt a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that he was worried about other things, after all, he had already had someone communicate with the man beforehand.</p><p></p><p>He was mainly worried that the man couldn't read.</p><p></p><p>He had opened and read the letter his father left before he died, it was very short, not even taking a minute to read.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at it again.</p><p></p><p>Goodness, it seems the man was holding the letter upside down.</p><p></p><p>Finally, accompanied by a light cough, the man put down the letter and picked up a cup of hot tea on the oily table, slowly taking a sip.</p><p></p><p>"Ptui!"</p><p></p><p>After spitting out a mouthful of tea foam into the cup, the man finally spoke, his tone carrying a subtle hint of amusement.</p><p></p><p>"So you're Ye Wuyu, come, come, have a seat, don't be so stiff."</p><p></p><p>But there's only one chair under your ass.</p><p></p><p>"Your father, Ye Xiangsheng, was once my dear friend and sworn brother."</p><p></p><p>My father's name is not Ye Xiangsheng... it's Ye Changsheng, although he had a short life.</p><p></p><p>"Wuyu, do you understand what I mean?"</p><p></p><p>[Facing the man's ambiguous questioning, you let out a cold laugh, your eyes gleaming with a chill, and shout loudly, "Fuck your mother, how dare you provoke me with just a measly realm? Today, I, Ye Wuyu, shall defeat you in your mortal form!"]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu skillfully ignored the voice in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Of course I understand, how could I not? Just need to add more money.</p><p></p><p>Facing the man's question, Ye Wuyu timely plastered on a smile, then painfully rummaged in his bosom, pulling out a small money pouch, handing it to the other party with both hands.</p><p></p><p>"This is a small token of my appreciation, please don't refuse, esteemed sir."</p><p></p><p>As the money pouch was accepted, the man's smile became more genuine.</p><p></p><p>"Wuyu, your father and I were brothers, and I also treat you as my nephew. From now on, you can just call me Uncle Wang."</p><p></p><p>"Let me tell you, Uncle Wang is not being stingy, but some things are really hard to do, especially for someone like you who is good-looking but has not yet reached the first realm at nearly twenty years old. It's not easy to make an exception."</p><p></p><p>"I'm just taking your money to help you with your matter, don't hold it against me."</p><p></p><p>[This old fellow actually mocks your realm, how outrageous! So what if you haven't reached the first realm at twenty? The river flows east for thirty years, then west for thirty years, don't bully the young and poor. In the past, there were chat group leaders who became emperors in two years, and Riding Ox Taoist who ascended to the heavens in one step. Today, I, Ye Wuyu, shall ascend in broad daylight, entering the Profound Mysteries at dawn and mastering my Destiny by dusk.]</p><p></p><p>Enough, enough... so embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>By the time Ye Wuyu received the prison guard uniform, half a day had passed.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the murky copper mirror, seeing himself dressed in the prison guard attire, Ye Wuyu scratched his head, feeling that it didn't look too bad?</p><p></p><p>But even so, he still felt a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>From now on, would he have to spend the rest of his life in this celestial prison?</p><p></p><p>No, this is just a temporary placement, he will plan for the future later.</p><p></p><p>At worst, I'll just go copy some poems...</p><p></p><p>[Copy? That's the work of scholars, how can you call that copying? You laugh three times, turn around, and write a masterpiece that will stand the test of time, making the fellow in front of you kneel and kowtow in admiration.]</p><p></p><p>Writing? The other party can't even read.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was not a "local" but a transmigrator, having arrived here a few months ago.</p><p></p><p>Unavoidable, as his previous self unfortunately passed away from a serious illness, his father's name was Changsheng but he had a short life, and his mother had also left this world early.</p><p></p><p>After learning that this was a world with cultivators, and that he had transmigrated here, his heart was naturally filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>But after a few months, aside from his own handsome yet useless face and his mighty but unused second brother, he had accomplished nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although his natural talent or family conditions were not outstanding,</p><p></p><p>Of course, the key issue is that this so-called system can only bark like a dog.</p><p></p><p>No martial arts? No wealth? No talent? <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>None of that.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Wuyu considered his mentality to be quite good, and he was not the kind of person who cried out to the system's "father" every day.</p><p></p><p>Whether there is or not, it doesn't matter, but one thing is important.</p><p></p><p>If a person doesn't eat, they will die.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of his previous life was really too poor, not to mention that he couldn't do anything.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's father, who had been a prison guard all his life, had always wanted Ye Wuyu to enter officialdom, and in his father's words, those who wield the pen will always be better than those who fight.</p><p></p><p>He had taken the imperial examination for three years, but had not passed, and did not have any special skills. He had died of illness before Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>So Ye Wuyu did not hesitate or struggle any further, and before he starved to death, he found this job for himself, the one who couldn't do anything.</p><p></p><p>Great Yan Empire, Tianlan City.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Prison Guard.</p><p></p><p>"Wuyu, come out here, let me first familiarize you with the Heavenly Prison, I don't know if your father has told you about it or not?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu shook his head at Uncle Wang.</p><p></p><p>His father didn't seem to think being a prison guard was a good job, and had never mentioned it.</p><p></p><p>Walking from the small room to the outside, Ye Wuyu's expression became slightly tense, as this was the first time he had seriously looked at the so-called Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>In the long and narrow corridor, the candles were plentiful, but the gloom of the prison cells could not be completely suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Not far behind him was the entrance to the Heavenly Prison, which was usually not closed, but there was a weathered blue stone gate at the top.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu just glanced at it casually, feeling that it must weigh at least a thousand catties, almost as heavy as the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Heavenly Prison, the prison cells were distributed on both sides of the corridor. To Ye Wuyu's surprise, the prisoners in these cells seemed quite different from the ones he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>There were a few cells that were exceptionally clean and tidy, and the people inside were mostly calm, not even raising their eyelids when Ye Wuyu and Uncle Wang came.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was used to it, but he also knew that Ye Wuyu had doubts in his heart, so he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the difference between the Heavenly Prison and the regular prison cells in the yamen?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu thought for a moment and replied with some confusion.</p><p></p><p>"The entire Great Yan Empire, only the Imperial Capital and Tianlan City have the Heavenly Prison, while the other prefectures and counties do not have such a place... I only know this much from books, as my learning is limited."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. The Heavenly Prison, ordinary criminals can't even get in, the small thieves and such are handled by the local officials, they don't need to be sent to the Heavenly Prison."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang smiled and then led Ye Wuyu to a side a little further from the cells, pointing to those cells.</p><p></p><p>"The ones locked up on this floor, they used to be out there, many of them are officials or wealthy people. Some cases are not easy to judge, so they can't be released either, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I understand." Ye Wuyu thought for a moment and then asked in a low voice, "Are there any imperial relatives here?"</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was taken aback for a moment, then laughed heartily and said, "Boy, you're quite thoughtful, but for now, there aren't any."</p><p></p><p>Then Uncle Wang led Ye Wuyu and pushed open a stone door in the wall in front of them.</p><p></p><p>The prison guard at the door looked at the two of them, frowned slightly when he saw Ye Wuyu, but did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, when Ye Wuyu saw Uncle Wang easily push open that huge stone door, he was truly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Ye Wuyu soon realized that the stone door was not completely closed, just slightly ajar, and there was a mechanism on one side.</p><p></p><p>"The second floor is down there, I won't take you down. The ones locked up there are the real criminals, some of them are even cultivators with murderous tendencies."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, your area of responsibility will only be on the first floor. Unless there is an emergency situation, you won't go to the other floors."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu listened with doubt and asked, "What is an emergency situation?"</p><p></p><p>"Emergency situation? Jailbreak, riot, or if the prisoners escape. If you really want to say, even if the Heavenly Prison collapses would count, haha."</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang was in a good mood and even made a joke.</p><p></p><p>After hearing these words, Ye Wuyu's expression became a little tense.</p><p></p><p>Uncle Wang patted his shoulder and said cheerfully, "Don't worry, it's very safe here. I've been doing this for over thirty years and nothing has ever happened."</p><p></p><p>With that, Uncle Wang walked alone towards the second floor.</p><p></p><p>The stone door slowly closed, and his figure disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>[Tsk tsk tsk, what a pity, this girl is so good-looking, but she's a stutterer?]</p><p></p><p>The useless sidekick's voice in his mind surprisingly aligned with his own thoughts for once.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts wavered only for a moment, as if he had noticed Ye Wuyu's reaction, and a trace of inexplicable gloom flashed across the young lady's eyes, her fingertips gently reaching out a little.</p><p></p><p>The icy cold sword edge at his neck quickly made Ye Wuyu realize his current predicament.</p><p></p><p>For example, he needed to answer the other party's question.</p><p></p><p>What am I? I'm not a fucking thing.</p><p></p><p>I'm a person.</p><p></p><p>Based on the other party's words, it was obvious that she had also been dragged into this heavenly prison.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, she seemed to have some real skills, having survived here.</p><p></p><p>Finally, apart from the two of them, there should be no other living people here...</p><p></p><p>And the other party, she must have seen him lying on the ground unconscious at the time.</p><p></p><p>And from the young lady's perspective, had he already died? What exactly happened during the time he was unconscious? Ye Wuyu wanted to hear if the system's sidekick had any information.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the sidekick was as useless as ever, only barking like a dog.</p><p></p><p>[Ridiculous, this bitch is nothing but a big-breasted fool! How dare she even dream of fathoming the mysteries of the Formless Heart Sutra?]</p><p></p><p>[Even though the sword is pointed at you, you need not fear. Just a slight move of your hand, and this woman will be executed on the spot, becoming your cauldron...]</p><p></p><p>The useless sidekick was of no use, not only failing to provide direct assistance, but also not even giving any information.</p><p></p><p>Well, it did provide some help after all.</p><p></p><p>For example, the fact that he had survived thanks to the help of the "Formless Heart Sutra", which he had just obtained a day ago. But what mysteries could this broken sutra hold, Ye Wuyu couldn't even see it himself! Ye Wuyu cried out in his heart, you damn thing, give me some information! Like the environmental information he might have overlooked?</p><p></p><p>The voice in his mind sounded again.</p><p></p><p>[Height 167cm, weight 48kg, bust-waist-hip 92-60-88]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu looked up at the young lady in front of him, but his vision was blocked and he couldn't see her face clearly.</p><p></p><p>So it's really like that, huh.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Did the sidekick provide any information?</p><p></p><p>Yes, it did! Was it useful? Yes, it was!</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu gave up.</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu finally tried to respond with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Miss knight, I am right here in front of you, yet you say I am dead. Is this reasonable?"</p><p></p><p>Is this reasonable? </p><p></p><p>This is completely unreasonable! Ridiculous, to make a living person prove that he is not dead, how can he prove it?</p><p></p><p>The young lady gritted her teeth and spoke quietly, her voice still a little stuttering, but full of doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Then... how did you survive?"</p><p></p><p>The young lady's question made Ye Wuyu pause for a while.</p><p></p><p>Yes, so many people had died, including not a few at the Boundary, or even the Second Boundary, of his colleagues.</p><p></p><p>How did he survive? Relying on the "Formless Heart Sutra" that he had just cultivated for a day?</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu soon dismissed this thought.</p><p></p><p>There was no reason, it was just an instinct that made him no longer doubt.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" in his mind was becoming increasingly clear, and the feeling of it was becoming more and more profound.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu really wanted to say "who claims, who provides evidence", but after feeling the icy and sharp sword edge suspended at his neck, he ultimately didn't say it out loud.</p><p></p><p>The matter of the "Formless Heart Sutra" could not be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't know how valuable this sutra was compared to those top-tier cultivation methods, but in any case, the fact that a small prison guard like him could possess such a cultivation method was already unreasonable enough.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his qi was completely depleted at the moment, even if he said it, the other party wouldn't believe it anyway.</p><p></p><p>The silence had lasted a bit too long, and the white-robed young lady's expression became increasingly cold.</p><p></p><p>"I can tell you, but you have to promise not to tell anyone else."</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the words, Ye Wuyu's fingers lightly touched the sword edge at his neck, gradually moving it to the side, his body leaning back slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just enough to see over the mountain peak and glimpse the young lady's clear eyes.</p><p></p><p>To tell the truth directly, to reveal that he was a transmigrator? That he had a system?</p><p></p><p>No way, in a game of werewolf, would you self-destruct on the first round?</p><p></p><p>If others self-destruct, it's killing others, but if Ye Wuyu self-destructs now, it's suicide. He'd probably be immediately slashed by the young lady, who would take him for some kind of demonic possession.</p><p></p><p>The young lady in front of him, although her entire person was as cold as ice, had a kind of... very clear stupidity in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>This kind of stupidity, Ye Wuyu had once seen in the eyes of the students who had just left campus and entered the devil's den of capital.</p><p></p><p>After getting the young lady's nod of approval, Ye Wuyu began to fabricate a story, coaxing and deceiving.</p><p></p><p>"In the past..."</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the memories in his mind were still there, and Ye Wuyu started from his family's three generations of good citizens, and he himself was continuing the family business, emphasizing that he was an outstanding and upright person.</p><p></p><p>The young lady had a blank look on her face, not knowing what the other party was saying all this for.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu glanced at the young lady's expression, the prelude seemed to be about right, paused for a moment, and then continued to speak.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"My father once had an extraordinary encounter and was granted a secret technique to avoid death... which was later passed down to me."</p><p></p><p>The memories in his mind provided him with a sufficient worldview and maximized his limited imagination.</p><p></p><p>Since this is a fantasy world, there's no problem with me hyping myself up as the protagonist, right?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu carefully observed the expression on the young lady's face. There was nothing unusual about it; on the contrary, her clear and naive gaze held a bit more curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of... secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Ye Wuyu's words had piqued her interest.</p><p></p><p>Her response was just as Ye Wuyu had expected - everything was going according to plan.</p><p></p><p>"The technique is single-use," Ye Wuyu said decisively.</p><p></p><p>The young lady in white fell silent, but soon asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Then your... your father who was granted the favor of a high person?"</p><p></p><p>"My father passed away in his early years," Ye Wuyu answered firmly, having already laid the groundwork.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then..."</p><p></p><p>The young lady began to speak, but suddenly didn't know what else to say.</p><p></p><p>A hint of perplexity and confusion appeared on her cold countenance, her mind racing, feeling that something was off but unable to pinpoint it.</p><p></p><p>After struggling for a while, the young lady could only murmur:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then... my condolences."</p><p></p><p>"I appreciate it."</p><p></p><p>Easy as pie!</p><p></p><p>[How shameless, truly shameless, deceiving an underage girl, how beastly!]</p><p></p><p>[Hehe, but since I've already deceived her this far, why not push a little further and lure her to my home...]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu ignored the noise in his mind, shifting his gaze to meet the young lady's clear eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Can you remove it?" he gestured to the sword blade still resting against his neck.</p><p></p><p>The young lady hesitated for a moment, then nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the icy chill gradually recede from his neck, Ye Wuyu let out a sigh of relief and gently massaged his slightly aching knees as he slowly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's crisp and cold voice rang out beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Kneel down."</p><p></p><p>This time, her words were spoken without a stutter.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyu's eyes, the reflection of the young lady's indifferent gaze and the gleaming sword in her hand was captured.</p><p></p><p>The sword's brilliance illuminated the dimly lit corridor.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was puzzled and didn't have time to react.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he only felt a hand on his head, forcefully pushing him down.</p><p></p><p>"Thud."</p><p></p><p>Kneeling on the ground, the already physically exhausted Ye Wuyu instinctively clung to the support in front of him.</p><p></p><p>What was this? His face touched something warm and moist.</p><p></p><p>And from behind, a warm, dripping sensation was also felt.</p><p></p><p>Drip, drip, dripping.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu subconsciously turned around to look.</p><p></p><p>Behind him was a severed body, the lower half standing upright behind Ye Wuyu, the upper half lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was the young lady's cold countenance and the bloodstained, icy long sword in her hand.</p><p></p><p>The blood had splattered all over Ye Wuyu's back and also stained the young lady's dress.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's hands holding the other person trembled slightly, not out of fear, but because the sight of the blood flying had stirred his blood and psyche in a strange way.</p><p></p><p>A white, jelly-like thing crawled out from the remains, pausing for a moment, seemingly observing the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu felt that it was probably examining the young lady beside him.</p><p></p><p>The young lady now gave him a different impression compared to before.</p><p></p><p>If the previous young lady had exuded an aura of icy coldness that kept people at a distance, then the current one was like a sharp, unsheathed sword, her presence exerting an inexplicable pressure.</p><p></p><p>As for the white jelly-like thing and the remains...</p><p></p><p>The remains were his previous "colleague," whom he had seen when he first woke up.</p><p></p><p>However, at that time, his "colleague" was already dead.</p><p></p><p>And the position of the fallen body seemed to be quite close to the white jelly-like capsule.</p><p></p><p>As for the white jelly, Ye Wuyu remembered it, it was similar to the one he had seen in the previous cage.</p><p></p><p>But now it was only a small trace, not even one percent of the previous size.</p><p></p><p>"Shing!"</p><p></p><p>The young lady's long sword let out a sound of cutting through the air, flashing like a beam of light as it thrust towards the ground.</p><p></p><p>But it struck empty space.</p><p></p><p>The white jelly remained motionless, the sword merely missing it.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the white jelly-like skin quietly slithered along the ground, retreating towards the other end of the corridor.</p><p></p><p>The young lady's expression darkened.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?" Ye Wuyu stared wide-eyed and asked.</p><p></p><p>A hint of surprise flashed in the young lady's eyes, and she spoke in a clear, uninterrupted voice.</p><p></p><p>"You can see it?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

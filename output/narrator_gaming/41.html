        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe fell to the ground, his gaze first gloomy, but quickly turning to surprise and delight.</p><p></p><p>He quickly got up, no longer paying attention to the fallen Tusu, but instead excitedly pointed at Ye Wuyou, who had just acted.</p><p></p><p>"You, you just used your spiritual energy, are you also awake?"</p><p></p><p>After seeing Ye Wuyou nod, the always gloomy eyes of the man in the brocade robe finally gleamed with a hint of light, and he couldn't help but laugh heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, I knew there had to be someone who hadn't fallen into it, this is good, this is good, at least I'm not the only one."</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk in private."</p><p></p><p>The two turned into a small alley, and Ye Wuyou finally stopped, turning to look at the man in the brocade robe.</p><p></p><p>His gaze had already shifted, after all, the sight of a rotting corpse was unpleasant to the eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this close distance, as long as Ye Wuyou willed it, even though the other party was a cultivator at the Third Realm, the "Ghost" could instantly kill him.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyou had other ideas.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe did not know that he had died, and before he heard the bell, he was still a cultivator with perfectly normal behavior and logic, and he was at the Third Realm.</p><p></p><p>Since the "root" of this place, that demonic beast's eyeball, could control him, why couldn't he use him to get closer to that mysterious eyeball? Compared to the previously weak Bai Lu, at least this lively man in the brocade robe was more suitable as an assistant.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, this was utilization.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyou had no qualms about utilizing a dead person who had previously attacked him.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to make some small preparations.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou briefly told the man in the brocade robe about his recent discoveries, and covered up the issue of time, because he knew that the man's own memory of the village was only three days.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ye, are you saying that you have already found a way to leave this place?" The man in the brocade robe's expression was excited.</p><p></p><p>"More or less, but to be precise, I only know what caused this cursed place."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou explained to the man and mentioned the "Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell" item.</p><p></p><p>As expected, when this item was mentioned, the man in the brocade robe's expression changed slightly, as if he had some secret.</p><p></p><p>But soon, driven by the strong desire to leave this place, and mainly because he saw Ye Wuyou as only a First Realm cultivator whom he could easily subdue, the man in the brocade robe revealed some information.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I also guessed that all this is related to the Thousand Illusion Purple Gold Bell. To be honest, I am the last disciple of the Thousand Illusion Sect, and I have some understanding of this item."</p><p></p><p>"This purple gold bell is not actually a bell, the bell is just a vessel, in normal circumstances it can't even be rung, and if an outsider tries to ring it, they will instantly lose their mind and, if lucky, lose their memory and become a fool, if unlucky, they will die."</p><p></p><p>"If you must use it, you need to use the exclusive incantation of my Thousand Illusion Sect, but I can't tell you that incantation."</p><p></p><p>[Incantation? You need to tell me? This broken bell is only fit to be hung on a dog, and you people are just a bunch of useless trash.]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou listened quietly, and then timely raised a question.</p><p></p><p>"What if the bell is shattered?"</p><p></p><p>"Shattered?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you said the bell is just a vessel, right? Is there something inside it?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, when I was unconscious before, I accidentally saw an eyeball."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's expression suddenly turned ugly, he realized the implication of Ye Wuyou's words, and he paced back and forth, seemingly thinking about something.</p><p></p><p>But as the last disciple of the Thousand Illusion Sect, the Sect Master's disciple, the man in the brocade robe seemed to have some knowledge, and he slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The purple gold bell is just a vessel, even if it's shattered, I still have a way to seal that thing, but I need a container."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of container?"</p><p></p><p>"It needs to be above the Mysterious Realm..." The man in the brocade robe paused, then glanced around, looking for something.</p><p></p><p>But this village obviously didn't have what he wanted, and he was also a pauper, so he changed his words, "Never mind, at least it needs to be something with some spirituality, not an ordinary object."</p><p></p><p>Something with spirituality?</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou thought...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, I found that I and the rest of the people in the Sky Prison all seemed a bit poor.</p><p></p><p>We didn't have any magical treasures. "No, wait," Ye Wuyu said to the man in the brocade robe, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Ye Wuyu returned, with a red handprint on his face.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that Lin Qingqing had been keeping this thing in her bosom, and it was a bit embarrassing for him to take it.</p><p></p><p>He tossed out a bell, whose demonic fox aura had already been erased.</p><p></p><p>"Take a look, can this be used?"</p><p></p><p>"This item is what you people in the Sky Prison use to track the aura of demonic creatures, right... Well, with a trace of spirituality, it can be barely used, but this thing can't be sealed for long, and will eventually need to be replaced."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe took the bell and sighed silently.</p><p></p><p>"Precious treasures are hard to find, even the Sky Prison is this poor."</p><p></p><p>【You stingy bastard, you even know how to use "even", I've killed you seven times but you still can't drop a single coin, you poor wretch】</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu patted his shoulder, and the man in the brocade robe was somewhat puzzled, but Ye Wuyu had already walked out of the alley.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, we're going to find that thing."</p><p></p><p>Standing there and thinking for a while, the man in the brocade robe, not detecting anything unusual, followed Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>【How boring, what's the point of wasting your spiritual energy on this already dead person, that ignorant thing is not your opponent at all, it's just a trace of the Dao, you can easily suppress it with a wave of your hand】</p><p></p><p>Hehe, Ye Wuyu completely ignored the barking of the narrator.</p><p></p><p>Not my opponent? </p><p></p><p>At the time, he had even risked entering the first realm of the Wuxiang Heart Sutra, the realm of no-self, but he was still easily crushed and became a madman. If he believed everything the narrator said, Ye Wuyu would have died many times over.</p><p></p><p>The method of dividing the soul was taught to him by the remnant soul of Xia Anmeng, and later improved by the narrator into the "Domination of Souls Sutra" that even he could use.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu left a trace of his spiritual energy on the man in the brocade robe.</p><p></p><p>It was just a trace, compared to the part he had given to Lu Caiwai before, it was like a drop in the ocean. So Ye Wuyu didn't suffer much.</p><p></p><p>And this trace of spiritual energy was not deeply embedded, just lightly attached to the surface, the other party couldn't detect it since he wasn't a cultivator of spiritual souls, and Ye Wuyu couldn't control him either.</p><p></p><p>But his spiritual energy could block the invasion of the strange force, so even if it was just a trace, it might be of some use against the "eyeball" that was not even a remnant of the Dao, right?</p><p></p><p>Of course, Ye Wuyu didn't do this to protect the other party, but to reserve a buffer reaction time for himself.</p><p></p><p>Even if the man in the brocade robe had his memories erased by that thing, he could still kill him in time.</p><p></p><p>They came to the water well at the east end of the village.</p><p></p><p>This well, which had been terrifying at night, now showed no sign of anything unusual, and there were even traces of villagers drawing water around it.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu knew that the key was in this well.</p><p></p><p>People gradually gathered around, after all, the man in the brocade robe was an outsider, and he had also been unkind to Tu Su before.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu sighed lightly, "Wait a moment, I'll go disperse them."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's aura was just about to manifest, but hearing Ye Wuyu's words, he had a strange expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You still care about these people? Oh, that's right, there are also your comrades from the Sky Prison among them."</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe thought for a moment, then waved his sleeve towards the crowd, "Don't bother, Brother Ye, I'll take care of it for you."</p><p></p><p>The people around suddenly had a dazed look on their faces, then walked back to their own houses in a confused manner.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the puzzled look on Ye Wuyu's face, the man in the brocade robe smiled and said, "Brother Ye, why are you so surprised? As a disciple of the Thousand Illusions Sect, using illusion arts, what's so strange about that?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu withdrew his gaze, a hint of confusion rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this already an illusion world? Could illusion arts still be used within an illusion world? What was this? Could it really be done this way? 【Such a simple question, if you just think about it a little, you'll understand everything. Illusion worlds are just flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water, but nine are true and one is false, the flowers in the mirror and the moon in the water that are real to you, are the true reality of others】</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

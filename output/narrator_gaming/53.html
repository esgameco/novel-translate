        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's expression was a bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the heavily made-up and scantily dressed woman in front of him, and made a fist salute.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I've come here only to find someone." Lü Qingshan spoke very seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Find someone, find someone, good! Sir, which young lady are you looking for? Just tell me, and I'll call her over."</p><p></p><p>The madam smiled at this moment, not caring at all about the meaning of Lü Qingshan's words, and instead waved her hand, and two young ladies came forward.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no... I really just came to find someone, and I don't have any money on me." Lü Qingshan's always calm and indifferent expression finally revealed a slight trace of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>"No money?"</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the young ladies changed instantly, and the madam's previously fawning smile immediately fell, her shrill voice expressing displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, do you know what kind of place this is? You come here to find someone without any money, are you joking?"</p><p></p><p>The madam carefully scrutinized the middle-aged scholar in front of her.</p><p></p><p>His clothes were simple, his appearance ordinary. Although his demeanor was quite good, it was clear at a glance that he was just an ordinary scholar, at most a teacher.</p><p></p><p>It was not strange for a scholar to come to a brothel, but most were young men full of vigor, seeking romantic adventures. This middle-aged scholar was still so upright...</p><p></p><p>Hmph, find someone? In this place, if we let you just randomly find someone, who would guarantee the privacy of the clients? How could I still run this business?</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan sighed inwardly, seeing the few women about to drive him out, and shook his head slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry."</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly disappeared from the spot, and the next moment he was already outside a door on the third floor.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan knew that Ye Wuyu was in there.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to push the door open when he heard some alluring sounds from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, don't do this... you're so naughty."</p><p>"What's wrong? Your heart is still pounding..."</p><p>"Young master, don't touch me, let me play you a tune on the zither instead..."</p><p>"Sir, sir, you can't get any closer..."</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's expression paused slightly, and his movement to open the door also stopped.</p><p></p><p>But he soon chuckled, his eyes clear.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, Ye Wuyu, do you think this can stop me? He pushed the door open.</p><p></p><p>But he only saw a woman in a thin robe flirting with the empty air.</p><p></p><p>Oh? Taking advantage of the moment I was hesitating? Lü Qingshan ignored the strange gaze of the woman in the room and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he turned around, four or five women surrounded him and without a word dragged him into the side room.</p><p></p><p>"What is the meaning of this, ladies?" Lü Qingshan's eyes were clear, but a slight blush still appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, sir, what are you saying? Earlier, a handsome young master gave us some silver and said that an important guest would be stopping by his door, and asked us to serve you well."</p><p></p><p>"Sisters, the sir is shy, let's liven things up for him a bit."</p><p></p><p>Sleeves were loosened, skirts half-undone.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan's face first flushed red, then turned extremely unsightly, and he quickly withdrew and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Er'er knelt on the street, the broken silver in the bowl already collected by her. She didn't dare to leave it out.</p><p></p><p>She was still thinking about that beautiful sister from earlier, what a nice person.</p><p></p><p>Her mother's nagging came from the side.</p><p></p><p>"Er'er, did you see? Such a beautiful young lady was right in front of you, but that man took her money and went to that filthy place. In the future, you must keep your eyes open and never find a man like that..."</p><p></p><p>Er'er hummed in response without saying anything, but her gaze suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, look, the young master is coming out."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's been just a few minutes, he's come out so quickly, sigh..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood at the street corner, carefully scanning the crowd on the street.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't see that handsome figure again.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>That Lü Caiwei, could it be that she misunderstood me? I'll have to explain it to her properly later...</p><p></p><p>Pata.</p><p></p><p>A hand patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu turned around and saw the familiar middle-aged scholar, his expression not at all surprised.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he plotted, even if he was sure that Lü Qingshan would not touch the mundane, it was still only a delay of a few minutes.</p><p></p><p>But that was enough.</p><p></p><p>In Lü Qingshan's calm expression, Ye Wuyu raised a hand and pointed to his waist.</p><p></p><p>The hourglass had run out.</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan looked at this scene, first frowning slightly, but then relaxing.</p><p></p><p>He laughed, no longer the faint smile that had always been on his face, but a cheerful laugh.</p><p></p><p>The laughter was not very hearty, but cheerful enough.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was stunned, then seeing the strange gazes around him, silently pushed the hand on his shoulder away, disdainfully saying,</p><p></p><p>"On the street... don't go crazy here."</p><p></p><p>Lü Qingshan suppressed his laughter, his expression calm. "I have a condition for you, you can think about it carefully..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His response was Ye Wuyou's resolute voice.</p><p></p><p>"No need, just demonstrate the Tian Yan (Heavenly Unfolding) in front of me, don't give me any sense of participation."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's eyes flashed with a hint of confusion, but Ye Wuyou's expression was calm, as if he didn't care about anything.</p><p></p><p>He knew that using this condition to make the other party demonstrate the Tian Yan would arouse Lu Qingshan's suspicion.</p><p></p><p>But so what?</p><p></p><p>The worst-case scenario was just the exposure of the "Wuxiang Heart Sutra".</p><p></p><p>Learn it first, and you'll have a better chance of staying alive. Otherwise, you'll have to go all the way to the distant capital city to learn it, right? What if you get robbed on the way, who are you going to reason with?</p><p></p><p>In the end, Lu Qingshan didn't refute again. He extended one hand, spreading it out in front of him, and said calmly:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know what the meaning is for you to ask for this technique over and over again, but I won't pursue it, because everyone has their secrets."</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, a hazy mist of black and gray began to emerge in the palm of Lu Qingshan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze was instantly drawn to it, staring intently at the other party's hand.</p><p></p><p>Unclear, blurred... What was in that mist? Ye Wuyou covered his left eye with his hand, using only his right eye, which contained a trace of the Dao, to look.</p><p></p><p>He saw it.</p><p></p><p>A black little figure, now kneeling in the palm of Lu Qingshan's hand, then gently bowed to Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>A strange force that Ye Wuyou could not understand emanated from that black figure, and then it dissipated like a bubble.</p><p></p><p>That's it?</p><p></p><p>【The Shen Dao technique is indeed mysterious. You have carefully studied it and finally grasped the Tian Yan technique, but you know the result without understanding the reason, and you still can't master it, as if you're just one step away.】</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou withdrew his gaze and frowned tightly.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he encountered a technique he could not imitate and learn.</p><p></p><p>Is this Shen Dao technique so strange? What is the one step he's missing? He looked at Lu Qingshan and asked, "When you performed the Tian Yan technique, what did you see?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's gaze turned to the street, where an ox was pulling a cart.</p><p></p><p>The cart was already empty, and an old man with a slightly hunched back, but a smile that couldn't be hidden on his face, was walking beside the cart.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the goods had been sold, making him very happy.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan's gaze shifted, looking at the beggar girl, Er Ya, on the opposite side of the street.</p><p></p><p>The little girl seemed to be peeking at them, and when she saw his gaze, she quickly bowed her head, not daring to look again.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan looked at this scene and said softly:</p><p></p><p>"In a moment, the ox will be startled and then trample the beggar on the side of the road to death."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was stunned, and then his face showed confusion.</p><p></p><p>"How long is 'in a moment'?"</p><p></p><p>"Three."</p><p></p><p>Oh, three minutes?</p><p></p><p>"Two."</p><p></p><p>???</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's gaze turned to Lu Qingshan, with a hint of anger, and then he stepped heavily on the stone steps, his figure rushing out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The sound of gongs and drums, accompanied by a startled bell, rang out from the outside of the brothel, followed by a series of firecrackers.</p><p></p><p>"Hey! Be careful, quickly move away, this beast is startled!" The old man's heart-wrenching cry came from the street.</p><p></p><p>But it was covered by the continuous sound of firecrackers and music from the brothel.</p><p></p><p>Er Ya knelt on the side of the road, and when she saw the crowd inexplicably panicking and scattering, her mind realized something, but the raging ox was already at her feet.</p><p></p><p>The little girl's eyes were filled with terror, and she finally let out a cry and closed her eyes.</p><p></p><p>The expected pain did not come, but instead a loud collision sound reached her ears.</p><p></p><p>Er Ya cautiously opened her eyes and saw a solid back standing in front of her, his clothes fluttering in the force of the wind.</p><p></p><p>The raging ox was now lying on the side, moaning weakly.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou didn't kill the ox, as if it could still be saved by a veterinarian.</p><p></p><p>After all, it might be the old man's family's source of income.</p><p></p><p>The hunched old man limped over and knelt on the ground, repeatedly expressing his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Er Ya's mother, trembling, brought Er Ya to the man, muttering words of gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou looked at this scene, his expression complex, but in the end, he only slightly cupped his fist and then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say any nonsense about not allowing them to kneel. He simply felt that he did not deserve others' worship.</p><p></p><p>And at the moment he turned around, a voice sounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【The fortune has arrived, and by chance you have taken this step, finally grasping the true meaning of the Tian Yan technique.】</p><p></p><p>【Calculating everything, yet changing everything.】</p><p></p><p>【The world is ever-changing, why can the heavenly secrets not be changed?】</p><p></p><p>【At this point, you have mastered the Shen Dao technique - Tian Yan.】</p><p></p><p>If you think this is still good, you can hope to continue reading to the end.</p><p>The recommendation didn't make it, so you can only wait for the next update to see if it can be revived.</p><p>The writing style is not a traditional action-packed one, so it may not attract a large audience.</p><p>I'll think more about the follow-up.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

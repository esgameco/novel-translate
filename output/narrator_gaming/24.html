        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>What exactly did the pangolin say? No one knows, but the pangolin is indeed very delicious.</p><p></p><p>This beast that resembles a pangolin is only a second-tier demonic beast. After Ye Wuyou dragged it out, the four of them rushed up, and it didn't take long before the iron armor was completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time Ye Wuyou had seen real cultivators fighting.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous scene where Lu Caiwi alone wielded a sword to slay the possessed corpses.</p><p></p><p>This time, the scene was Xu Fang standing in the front, using his powerful physique to withstand the demonic beast's assault, while Bai Chang stood behind, conjuring several talismans accompanied by a mix of thunder and fire.</p><p></p><p>When the demonic beast tried to flee underground, the originally loose and muddy ground seemed to have an extra thin membrane, not budging even when it tried to break through with its head.</p><p></p><p>The cooperation between the cultivators seemed to have made the powerful enemy much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing crouched by the roadside, her expression somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This place was still dozens of miles away from the Yunwu Mountain Range, and in the past, demonic beasts could only be found within the mountain range itself.</p><p></p><p>How could a demonic beast come all the way here to attack their group? </p><p></p><p>This didn't make sense.</p><p></p><p>Second-tier demonic beasts, while not yet as intelligent as humans, still possess a certain level of intelligence. Even fierce beasts know to observe their prey before hunting, let alone a second-tier demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing sighed. Despite the analysis, the events had indeed unfolded this way. </p><p></p><p>There was still a lingering fear in her eyes... </p><p></p><p>She had not detected the demonic beast's presence earlier. If she had walked on without any precautions, and the beast had targeted her, she might not have died, but would have suffered some torment.</p><p></p><p>"We cannot stay here."</p><p></p><p>This was Lin Qingqing's decision.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The sky gradually darkened, and a crescent moon gradually rose above the branches, casting a veil over the mountains.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain cliff, a cold wind blew.</p><p></p><p>Three figures gradually emerged.</p><p></p><p>"The test is over, these four are indeed the jailers of the Heavenly Prison. Coming here at this time, they must be after that demonic fox."</p><p></p><p>The leader wore a golden brocade robe. </p><p></p><p>Although it looked extraordinary, if not for the night, a closer look would reveal the slightly frayed edges.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the gradually receding figures below and softly chanted.</p><p></p><p>"That autumn night was the day of my master's wedding."</p><p></p><p>The man and woman beside him had puzzled expressions, as if question marks were floating above their heads.</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe paid them no mind and continued speaking, as if delivering the most heartfelt soliloquy to the empty mountain valley.</p><p></p><p>"I fell deeply in love with the woman I shouldn't have loved, and my master's wife also loved me deeply."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these wolf-like words, the two who had intended to interrupt the man's strange monologue paused, then withdrew their hands, listening quietly and excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I know she did not love my master, but as the patriarch of the Qianhuan Sect, with his high status and power, she had no choice but to submit to him."</p><p></p><p>"In my dreams, I could still hear her call, begging me to save her..."</p><p></p><p>"I made a pact with her that to save her, I would kill my master, but she... never appeared again."</p><p></p><p>"It was only later that I learned, she was nothing more than a demonic fox. She lured me and my master away, and stole our sect's most precious treasure, the Qianhuan Purple Gold Bell."</p><p></p><p>"It hurts, it hurts so much... I lost everything, and without the patriarch and the treasure, the Qianhuan Sect crumbled in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>Pausing briefly, the man in the brocade robe pointed towards the distant Yunwu Mountain Range and exclaimed excitedly, "Now..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The celestial prison collapsed, and that demonic fox actually escaped! Wonderful, simply wonderful! I have investigated in many ways, and the supreme treasure of the Thousand Illusion Gate is not in the hands of the celestial prison, so it must have been hidden by that demonic fox somewhere.</p><p></p><p>"Now the opportunity is right in front of me, and I must consider whether this is the only chance I will have in my life! I must win back everything. As long as I follow the people of the celestial prison, I will definitely find that demonic fox."</p><p></p><p>"To restore the glory of my Thousand Illusion Gate, it is my bounden duty!"</p><p></p><p>The two who had gotten the big news stood in silence. One of the men also seemed to be affected by the atmosphere and took a step forward.</p><p></p><p>The remaining woman twitched the corners of her mouth and looked at the two with a strange gaze.</p><p></p><p>That man was dressed in coarse linen clothes, and his hair seemed a bit messy, looking quite poor.</p><p></p><p>He stood on the cliff and recited in the most resolute tone.</p><p></p><p>"That year at eighteen, the Taming Beast Gate celebrated joyfully, but I was standing in the street corner, like a lackey."</p><p></p><p>"The laughter and joy were theirs, the rewards and honors were also theirs. Even my childhood sweetheart, my fiancée, was now sitting in someone else's arms and smiling."</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly realized that human happiness is not shared. I only felt that they were noisy, and in the endless night, there was only loneliness and desolation, which belonged to me alone."</p><p></p><p>The woman rubbed her shoulders, feeling goosebumps all over her body.</p><p></p><p>The former Taming Beast Gate youth, without caring about the gaze of others, slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"Those things originally all belonged to me. I was the genius of the sect, I had shed blood for the sect and suffered for the sect, but because I had a dispute with the incompetent son of the sect master, I was everywhere suppressed."</p><p></p><p>"The sect master deprived me of my cultivation, my fiancée tore up the marriage contract, and finally expelled me from the sect. Haha."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I still had something preserved, and I survived the life-and-death crisis and regained my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Now I hear that this three-stage demonic fox has escaped, and it has the bloodline of the Azure Void Royal Clan, one demon is stronger than six demons! I must subdue this fox! Help me cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>"I must kill my way back, stand in front of them and tell them, not to prove anything, but to get back what I have lost with my own hands!"</p><p></p><p>"The river flows east for thirty years, and then west for thirty years, don't underestimate the poor young man!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe's gaze faltered, then shone with brilliance, as if he had found a kindred spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, Brother Tu, it's rare to be so in tune with you. I'll just take the Purple Gold Bell, and I won't fight you for this demonic fox."</p><p></p><p>"Brother Maorun, no need for many words, we are brothers in our hearts."</p><p></p><p>In the night, the two seemed to be touched by the previous words, thinking of their own tragic experiences, and embraced each other and wept.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, the two separated, their eyes fixed on the remaining woman.</p><p></p><p>"Then, Miss Bai Lu, what are you here for?"</p><p></p><p>The woman called Bai Lu was wearing a white silk veil, only revealing her somewhat bewitching eyes. Her clothes looked ordinary, but the shapes were strange.</p><p></p><p>The sleeves, shoulders, and thighs seemed to have been deliberately cut, revealing some pale spring scenery.</p><p></p><p>With this makeup, walking on the street, she might be despised by the busybodies as indecent, or someone might inwardly sigh that she is a female bodhisattva.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu seemed to be quite disdainful of the two men's questions, and her answer was also very simple.</p><p></p><p>"I am from the Harmony Sect, and this time I came down the mountain to refine my heart in the mundane world."</p><p></p><p>Refine the heart in the mundane world? What is that?</p><p></p><p>The two men looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Bai Lu's gaze was quite helpless. At the moment, she was just standing by the cliff, watching the four figures disappear in the distance.</p><p></p><p>She stared for a while, then seemed to have thought of something, and smiled lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the heart in the mundane world... Well, in your words."</p><p></p><p>"It's probably just looking for a man."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

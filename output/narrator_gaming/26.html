        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Out of caution, Ye Wuyou still inquired about the people in the village.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen anyone wearing the same clothes as you?" The old man at the village entrance looked puzzled, standing by the door.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the few of them, then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's too dark, I can't see clearly what you're wearing, and anyway, there are so many people coming and going in this village, who can remember them all."</p><p></p><p>This was a lie.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that cultivators would come to this place to practice, cultivators are not like wild grass by the roadside, there couldn't be that many.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing handed over a small money bag again, "Old man, can you see clearly now?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I can see clearly." The old man chuckled as he put away the money bag and placed it in the drawer next to him.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes and looked closely at the few of them, then shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen them before, to be honest, there haven't been any outsiders in this village in the past few days, you all are the first batch this week."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou was very curious.</p><p></p><p>Are all the people in this village like this? How can they survive when facing cultivators?</p><p></p><p>A cultivator, even at a low level, has refined their qi and blood, and possess the unique "qi" of their cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>It may be an exaggeration to say that they can take the head of an enemy general from the midst of a myriad soldiers, but for these weak and elderly villagers, it would be like a wolf entering a sheep pen.</p><p></p><p>Not getting the answer they wanted, Lin Qingqing looked at the red wolf smoke still burning on the mountain, her expression somewhat silent.</p><p></p><p>Has the prison guard recently received a task near the Yunwu Mountains? Lin Qingqing thought hard, and the final answer was:</p><p></p><p>I don't know.</p><p></p><p>From entering the village, to the ringing of the bell, to their group going out, they saw the beacon fire on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Could it be just a coincidence? "Hey, young man, what are you looking at? I've already told you everything, you can't take back the silver."</p><p></p><p>The sudden words interrupted Lin Qingqing's thoughts, and she turned around to see Ye Wuyou crouching next to the old man, looking at something.</p><p></p><p>Following his gaze, it was the drawer where the old man had put the money.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou shook his head and stood up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>Imperceptible to the naked eye, a ghostly blue hand slowly withdrew from the drawer and returned to Ye Wuyou's body.</p><p></p><p>He had just used "Ghost" to briefly inspect, and the drawer only contained a money bag and the small change they had given when they entered the village.</p><p></p><p>The old man at the village entrance should not have lied... at least it didn't seem so.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou and Lin Qingqing were both pondering whether there might be something suspicious, but Xu Fang couldn't wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>The burly man's voice was very loud at the moment, and his expression was fearless.</p><p></p><p>"What are you still worrying about? Let's just go up the mountain. If they really are our colleagues from the prison, we'll be too late and have to collect their bodies."</p><p></p><p>With that, he walked out of the village alone.</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzhen sighed and quietly followed.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing didn't hesitate either, after all, they came here to capture the fox demon, and they had to go search for it.</p><p></p><p>It's just that when Lin Qingqing walked out of the village, she took out an item and ignited it on an empty lot by the side.</p><p></p><p>The same red beacon fire as in the mountains was lit here.</p><p></p><p>"This is to signal them that we have received their message, and also to tell them not to move around." Lin Qingqing said.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ye Wuyou was at the back of the group, and as he was about to catch up, he heard the old man at the village entrance rambling behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Young man... come back early."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The mountain path at night was not easy to walk.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the place where the wolf smoke was lit, while it looked close from the foot of the mountain, was actually quite a distance to walk.</p><p></p><p>"I say, is there no such thing as flying on a sword?" Ye Wuyou asked.</p><p></p><p>Nothing else, a group of cultivators climbing the mountain in the middle of the night made Ye Wuyou feel there was no explanation for it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang, who was leading the way, heard this and said unhappily, "Flying on a sword..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"First, you must be a sword cultivator, and secondly, you must have reached the Middle Realm Third Stage, only then can you condense a spiritual body and appearance."</p><p></p><p>The Middle Realm Third Stage? Ye Wuyou raised his eyebrows, he had just entered the First Stage, that seemed too far away.</p><p></p><p>"That's precisely why there's the saying of 'breaking through the lower realms to defeat the enemy' for the Lower Realms, but for a Lower Realm cultivator to defeat a Middle Realm Third Stage cultivator is almost impossible, not to mention other things, just being able to soar through the air puts them in an unassailable position."  Lin Qingqing explained.</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily true." It was the ever-silent Bai Changzai who suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Their figures were swiftly darting through the forest, but Bai Changzai's voice remained very calm.</p><p></p><p>"As a talisman master, even without reaching the Middle Realm Third Stage, one can still soar through the air, just like I'm doing now."</p><p></p><p>He stuck a talisman onto himself, and as he spoke, Bai Changzai actually floated up.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in white robes, Bai Changzai floating in the night mountain, truly looked like...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou suddenly felt that he could try specializing in talismans in the future.</p><p></p><p>Look at that Fifth Realm's Zhao Changhe, he can only punch.</p><p></p><p>The Second Realm's Bai Changzai, when he strikes it's a combination of thunder and fire, and while others have to walk, he can fly.</p><p></p><p>This is what a true cultivator should be like...</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn't long before the ethereal Bai Changzai stumbled in mid-air, the entire person falling onto a tree branch, his white uniform torn into several rags.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, the energy consumption was too great." </p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai's speech remained solemn as ever.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, don't dwell on whether those below the Third Realm can fly or not, we're almost there."</p><p></p><p>The signal fire had been extinguished, but based on the previous traces, it should be not far ahead.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou swept a glance around, his expression puzzled.</p><p></p><p>So quiet?</p><p></p><p>And there were no signs of battle either.</p><p></p><p>If they didn't encounter any enemies, and there were no signs of battle, then why did the other party light the signal fire?</p><p></p><p>"That's strange, it should be around here." </p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing's figure stopped, checking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>But there was not a single trace to be found.</p><p></p><p>Was the distance estimation wrong? Impossible, apart from Ye Wuyou, the rest of them were experienced Heavenly Prison Guards.</p><p></p><p>A simple distance judgment was still within their capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"What the hell is going on, we came to rescue people, but we arrived and didn't see anyone." Xu Fang was standing on a tree, his gaze straining to see far.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing couldn't figure out the reason either, and could only say,</p><p></p><p>"The priority now is to establish contact with them, if we really can't find them, then we can only return the way we came."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Lin Qingqing lit another signal fire.</p><p></p><p>"They'll see this lit signal fire and come find us."</p><p></p><p>An identical crimson signal fire was lit, billowing straight up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, old hag, when we took on this mission, was it only our team that came to this Cloud Mist Mountain Range?" Xu Fang asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Qingqing immediately flared up in anger.</p><p></p><p>"A dog's mouth can't spit out ivory, I have a name you know!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm not joking around, were there any other teams that came here?" Xu Fang shouted.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the abnormality in his words, Lin Qingqing thought for a moment, but soon shook her head, affirming,</p><p></p><p>"If it was a previous mission I'm not sure, there may have been other teams here... but when we took on this mission, it was only this fox demon in the Cloud Mist Mountain Range vicinity."</p><p></p><p>"Then what's down the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Down the mountain?</p><p></p><p>Everyone's gaze turned to look.</p><p></p><p>In the night, the faint lights of a village could be dimly seen at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>And in the direction of the village, another crimson signal fire had been lit.</p><p></p><p>Just like the one Lin Qingqing had ignited earlier.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter End)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu finally met the Mr. Zhao that Chun Tao had mentioned, Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>Oh, Chun Tao was the name of that young lady, and according to her, she was half a disciple of Mr. Zhao.</p><p></p><p>As for why she was only half a disciple, it was because Chun Tao herself was already a renowned physician, and she came to learn from Zhao Changhe in areas beyond just medicine.</p><p></p><p>Although still young in age, and not as gifted as Lu Caiwi who could be considered a prodigy, Chun Tao had already reached the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu felt quite ashamed, especially when facing this top-tier "Class A" expert from the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>For example, right at the start, Zhao Changhe asked him:</p><p></p><p>"You have not yet reached the First Realm, so how did you enter the Heavenly Prison?"</p><p></p><p>"I was specially recruited."</p><p></p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>"I went through the back door."</p><p></p><p>A bit awkward.</p><p></p><p>[The old geezer is quite dissatisfied with you right now, but what right does he have to be dissatisfied, he's just a mortal at the Fifth Realm, it's not like you've never fought him before, you inwardly sneer repeatedly, and are about to teach him a lesson.]</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe did not know what Ye Wuyu was thinking, and only fell silent for a while before saying indifferently:</p><p></p><p>"That Warden wanted me to keep an eye on you, I don't quite understand it, and I'm not too willing either."</p><p></p><p>"But the fact that you were able to come out alive from the Eighth Layer, even if you relied on that little Miss Lu, still shows you have some abilities."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe did not know what had happened in the Eighth Layer, as the Warden had not explained anything.</p><p></p><p>That day, the Warden had come out from the Eighth Layer, bringing back the still-living Lu Caiwi and the blood-stained Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>That young lady was able to get out of bed and walk on her own the next day, but this kid...</p><p></p><p>He had been sleeping like a pig in Zhao Changhe's place for a full week.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe's temperament naturally could not tolerate this, and after learning that this kid had woken up, he immediately sought him out.</p><p></p><p>Since the Warden had instructed to keep an eye on him, even if Zhao Changhe was unwilling, he had to put on a show of politeness.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the other party turned out to be an idiot, he could just casually dismiss him and let him leave.</p><p></p><p>"Now, bring out your true abilities and try to attack me as much as possible," Zhao Changhe threw out these words, then stood with his hands folded, coldly standing in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was quite large, and from the kitchen came the sounds of pots and pans clanging, as Chun Tao was cooking.</p><p></p><p>[The old scoundrel wants to intimidate you, how laughable, a Fifth Realm cultivator, tell me, what are you pretending for?]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu did not heed the noise in his mind, his gaze shifting from Zhao Changhe to the corner of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>There was a rack full of weapons.</p><p></p><p>Noticing Ye Wuyu's gaze, Zhao Changhe slowly nodded and said,</p><p></p><p>"You can choose whatever you like."</p><p></p><p>So Ye Wuyu selected a sword.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't tell the quality of the sword, but after a cursory feel, it was perhaps not as good as the one Lu Caiwi had.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the faint qi within him, Ye Wuyu took a deep breath and no longer hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me."</p><p></p><p>The sword struck!</p><p></p><p>The Formless Heart Sutra was already in motion.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's figure, appearing quite thin in the evening breeze, suddenly exuded a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The sleeves of his robe fluttered, and the meager qi within him was squeezed out by Ye Wuyu, flowing into the sword blade.</p><p></p><p>A thunderstorm arose from the ground.</p><p></p><p>It worked!</p><p></p><p>Releasing the sword strike, Ye Wuyu's eyes gleamed.</p><p></p><p>Although his realm had already dissipated like a castle in the air, the effects of the Formless Heart Sutra remained, and even this sword strike, while weaker than before, was still extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's figure followed the sword, and in an instant, he was already before Zhao Changhe.</p><p></p><p>A sharp glint flashed in Zhao Changhe's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Wuyu was pressed to the ground, sword and all, unable to get up.</p><p></p><p>From above, Zhao Changhe's angry voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Who taught you to practice like this, are you trying to die?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your body refinement is not yet complete, but you've already cultivated qi, and can even use such a powerful sword technique. Do you think you're some kind of genius?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Didn't Lü Miss teach you this technique and tell you the precautions?" </p><p></p><p>"This is a forceful technique that concentrates one's inner energy to reach the peak. You, a person who hasn't even nurtured your own body, dare to use it casually. If you try it a few more times, you'll never be able to reach the higher realms in this lifetime."</p><p></p><p>At the dining table, Zhao Changhe's scolding was unrelenting.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu actually felt the other party was overreacting, but he couldn't refute it.</p><p></p><p>As for blaming Lü Caiwai, that was even more absurd, as he had simply copied the technique.</p><p></p><p>[Common mortals, how could they understand the profound mysteries? The originally fierce and deadly technique has already been transformed to be like an ordinary sword technique.]</p><p></p><p>See, it should be fine.</p><p></p><p>[As long as you don't die, use it to the fullest.]</p><p></p><p>Uh, perhaps there is still some danger.</p><p></p><p>"Before you cultivate to the Yizheng realm, you must stay here obediently. Chuntao, keep an eye on him, don't let him go anywhere, or else it will be my reputation on the line."</p><p></p><p>"After all, you don't want to become an unemployed vagrant, right?"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Zhao Changhe took out a bottle of wine, poured it full in his cup, and then looked at Ye Wuyu, extending his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to drink?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu did not refuse.</p><p></p><p>But when he downed the cup of wine in one gulp, as his gaze swept over Zhao Changhe's aged yet slightly playful smile, he knew that big trouble was coming.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, as the wine entered his throat, it was initially fine, but then it turned into a fiery line, burning in his chest.</p><p></p><p>His skin instantly flushed red, and a surge of strength came from below, making Ye Wuyu feel like his fontanel was trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Consider yourself lucky to have drunk it. It's a medicinal wine made from a fourth-grade snake gall, something I wouldn't normally be able to enjoy if not for the incident at the Tianlao that killed so many demons."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu didn't know when Zhao Changhe had left.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, he only heard Chuntao's gentle voice beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, he's gone. Go take a bath, I've already prepared the medicinal bath for you."</p><p></p><p>Huh? Take a bath?</p><p></p><p>Oh right, he should take a bath, it's been a couple of weeks, Ye Wuyu couldn't stand his own smell anymore.</p><p></p><p>Drowsily, he was supported by Chuntao to the room, where a tub of hot water was already prepared, and the fragrance of medicine was emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, normally one shouldn't take a bath after drinking, but this precious medicinal wine, if you don't absorb it through the medicinal bath right now, it would be a waste."</p><p></p><p>[No need for further words, as the saying goes, 'after eating and drinking, one thinks of lust.' Right now, you should just grab this woman, her fair and beautiful body emitting the fragrance of medicine, combined with the medicinal bath, is truly delectable. Tonight, you shall decide to have an aquatic Mandarin duck coupling...]</p><p></p><p>Tsk...</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu shook his head and walked straight to the bathtub to undress.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, he turned around, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you still not leaving?"</p><p></p><p>In the mist of the water, Chuntao's expression was not visible, but her voice came calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master is drunk, I'm afraid you might drown in the wooden tub."</p><p></p><p>"But you don't have to stay and watch..." Ye Wuyu felt something was off.</p><p></p><p>Chuntao smiled and said in a very calm tone, "Young Master, are you perhaps feeling shy? But Chuntao is a physician, during the week you were unconscious, it was I who wiped your body."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had no more words, and he didn't dwell on it further.</p><p></p><p>After all, the other party was a physician with a benevolent heart, since she had said so, why should he be petty.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Ye Wuyu was completely naked and slipped into the bathtub.</p><p></p><p>"Splash."</p><p></p><p>Water splashed everywhere, followed by Chuntao's startled cry, and then she ran out of the room.</p><p></p><p>From outside, Ye Wuyu could hear Chuntao and a few other women whispering.</p><p></p><p>"Xiali, you lost, I told you Young Master's there is so... big."</p><p></p><p>"It's all Qiugua's fault, she's the one who insisted on betting."</p><p></p><p>"Why blame me? Blame Dongzao."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu: "..."</p><p></p><p>What's going on? Why are there other people?</p><p></p><p>And wasn't it supposed to be a physician's benevolent heart?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

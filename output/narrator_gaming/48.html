        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By the small river, next to the campfire, Xu Fang's snoring was as loud as thunder, sleeping soundly.</p><p></p><p>[Disturbing the mind, your snoring is louder than a pig! How can a cultivator be like a pig! You should just grab a watermelon knife and slaughter the pig right now!]</p><p></p><p>Sigh... Ye Wuyou lay by the tree, curling up.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing was tapping her fingers, with a troubled look on her face, calculating something.</p><p></p><p>"I thought it would be just a few days, but in the end we ended up staying in that village for a week, lost four horses, and it will take two more days to get back. We only recovered the body of the demonic fox, this mission is not worth it at all."</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai was lying beside her, though he should have been fast asleep, he now closed his eyes and said, "Well, as long as we can survive, that's good enough."</p><p></p><p>"You're not sleeping?" Lin Qingqing was surprised, but Bai Changzai didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>A rustling sound came from the side.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing saw Ye Wuyou getting up from the ground, and just as she was about to say that he wasn't sleeping either, she saw the simple bandage on his face and the words got stuck in her throat.</p><p></p><p>"Your eye... I mean, when we get back to the Sky Prison, we can ask if any of the cultivators there have the ability to help you recover it?"</p><p></p><p>Her words carried a hint of apology.</p><p></p><p>She and the other two at the Qi Realm level had thought this was an easy mission, but Ye Wuyou was just there to make up the numbers. </p><p></p><p>In the end, they got lost in the village, and it was Ye Wuyou who led them out of the trouble, but he ended up losing an eye because of it.</p><p></p><p>Should she give him the entire reward for this mission? But no, the captain also needs the medicinal materials for healing spiritual wounds...</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lin Qingqing's words, Ye Wuyou didn't seem to mind, he just shook his head slightly and walked away.</p><p></p><p>"It's too noisy, I'll go for a walk."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go with you."</p><p></p><p>"And I'll go refill the water."</p><p></p><p>"Oh..."</p><p></p><p>[No, don't go, it's dark and windy, a lone man and woman, this won't end well.]</p><p></p><p>Damn, this is so awkward.</p><p></p><p>Sending Lin Qingqing away, Ye Wuyou walked through the small forest, following the sound of the stream to the riverside.</p><p></p><p>Standing by the water, he reached out and rubbed the bandaged side of his face, it was a bit itchy there.</p><p></p><p>What's going on? The strange sensation in his eye seemed to be getting more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>After hesitating for a moment, Ye Wuyou unwrapped the bandage.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his reflection in the water flow, at the black empty socket where his eye used to be, Ye Wuyou smiled wryly and tried to wrap the bandage back on.</p><p></p><p>But the cloth slipped from his hand and fell into the water, flowing away with the current.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou stood there, his expression a bit off.</p><p></p><p>The lone remaining eye slowly looked down at his left hand, the hand that had just tried to grab the cloth.</p><p></p><p>The empty sleeve hung limply, swaying in the evening breeze.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou's face finally showed a hint of surprise and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>His left hand was gone.</p><p></p><p>But in the next moment, it wasn't just the left hand.</p><p></p><p>His hands, legs, waist, chest... all the way up to his head.</p><p></p><p>The man standing by the riverbank collapsed like a pile of building blocks, leaving only his empty clothes gently drifting to the ground.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Huff, huff..." Ye Wuyou was now lying by the riverbank, his forehead beaded with cold sweat, his skin twitching as if in spasm.</p><p></p><p>He kept taking deep breaths.</p><p></p><p>The scene he had just witnessed felt like a dream, or something else. The cold river water splashing on his face brought a slight calmness to his mind.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, Ye Wuyou's inner peace was shattered by what he saw in the reflection of the river water.</p><p></p><p>In the empty eye socket that had once been black, there was now a sinister red eye, the same demonic eye he had bitten and swallowed before.</p><p></p><p>A strange feeling came from Ye Wuyou's heart.</p><p></p><p>This eye, it was watching him.</p><p></p><p>Although it was now part of his own body, replacing the eye he had lost, Ye Wuyou could sense that this eye was looking at the river surface, looking at his own reflection.</p><p></p><p>As if to confirm his suspicion, the crimson eye even shifted, moving to the side.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou immediately felt his vision also shift, no longer under his control.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ye Wuyou quickly tried to regain control of his eyes, or rather, control of this one eye.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, the reflection in the river showed his eye blinking, and Ye Wuyou let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He rolled the eye around, feeling that his vision was back to normal.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The night scenery across the river was crystal clear, every blade of grass and every tree visible to him.</p><p></p><p>Good news, his eyes had recovered.</p><p></p><p>Bad news, these eyes occasionally had their own ideas.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? I had chewed and swallowed it back then, how could it reappear on me?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu quietly looked at the reflection in the river, observing this absurd scene.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of these strange things was really too little, he was truly unsure what changes had occurred to his body.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps, this eyeball, just like the previous ghost, was swallowed by me, so I have control over it?"</p><p></p><p>[That useless Grand Dao artifact remnant, even if you swallowed it, it's just that you went blind, otherwise how could this thing appear on you?]</p><p></p><p>Tsk, the same old dog barking, am I fucking blind? Ah, I really am blind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu thought, reaching out and touching his eyelids, as if wanting to feel the reality of that eye.</p><p></p><p>But the absurd scene did not stop, like a midnight stage play, the unfolding scenes became increasingly bizarre.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze was now silently examining his left hand, the corners of his mouth twitching slightly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because the previous outrageous events were already enough, there was no longer the previous horror in his eyes, only bewilderment and confusion.</p><p></p><p>His left hand had swollen by about a circle from the forearm, turning into a hazy blue color, with mottled blood vessels winding around it, and the back of his hand was covered in blue tendons, with inch-long nails that gleamed with a sinister and sharp light.</p><p></p><p>If there were others present at the moment, they would only see a man sitting by the river, using his crimson, demonic-like eyes to gaze at the empty clothes before him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu knew very well what this was.</p><p></p><p>He had used it many times before.</p><p></p><p>The "ghost" claw.</p><p></p><p>Now appearing on his own body? </p><p></p><p>Is this good or bad? Ye Wuyu's expression gradually became unsightly.</p><p></p><p>If it was just his eyes recovering, although the crimson demonic eyes were eerie and frightening, as long as they were covered, Ye Wuyu did not feel that this was a bad thing.</p><p></p><p>But this ghost claw appearing on his own body, Ye Wuyu felt very uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The dreamlike scene just now was still vividly in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's expression slightly faltered, as if he had remembered something.</p><p></p><p>In that illusion at the bottom of the well, the narrator had seemed to say something.</p><p></p><p>[Bullshit, this broken Grand Dao remnant is useless, it's just a kind of dog-skin plaster that sticks to people and won't come off, and occasionally it will even harm...]</p><p></p><p>At the time, he wanted to ask further, but the situation was urgent, and the narrator's remarks were always jumping around.</p><p></p><p>So, the Grand Dao remnant, will this strange thing harm people? [Afraid of nothing, it's just that over time, this damn remnant will covet your body, but you won't worry about these things, these remnants are just defeated underlings, you can crush them with a single pinch...]</p><p></p><p>Stop barking! Speak human language! But the narrator fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu held his head.</p><p></p><p>He really felt a headache at the moment, this dog narrator beside him, the help he provided was not only useless, but also completely random, and there were many things he had to explore on his own.</p><p></p><p>Damn thing is really useless, not as good as the sixth-realm remnant soul grandpa in Luo Caiwi's hands!</p><p></p><p>If Xia Anmeng was by his side, he would not only have cultivation techniques and divine abilities, but also be able to ask about anything he didn't understand in his cultivation, and there would be a myriad of secret realms waiting for him to explore, and he could even have friendly chats.</p><p></p><p>[Stop farting, that remnant soul is worthy of you? You should immediately reflect on how such a stupid idea could arise in your heart.]</p><p></p><p>[These Grand Dao remnants, surviving to this day, neither living nor dead, when they encounter a person like you with extraordinary talents, of course they will try their best to covet your body, first throwing out some sweetness to make you use them constantly, and then when you are overjoyed and use them more, the connection deepens, and these damn things will start to harm you.]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu naturally understood the narrator's meaning.</p><p></p><p>In other words, every time he used the power of the "ghost" in the past, it actually deepened his connection with this thing, and over time it would start to invade him?</p><p></p><p>How to stop it?</p><p></p><p>This time the narrator responded to his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>[Stop it? You just need to smile lightly and feel that your own thoughts are extremely stupid. Why stop it? Why not wait for these dog remnants to completely invade your body, after all, you were able to devour it the first time, so you can devour it the second time...]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu felt this was ridiculous.</p><p></p><p>Could it be the same? Back then, he had relied on Xia Anmeng's power, and by the time his body had transformed into that strange shape, could he really replicate the previous situation? "If it really comes to that, what should I do?" Ye Wuyu asked very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>[Just fuck with them!]</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

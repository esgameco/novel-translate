        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Countless miscellaneous items fell to the ground. Ye Wuyou crouched by the bed in the room and glanced underneath.</p><p></p><p>It was empty.</p><p></p><p>The scene he had just witnessed through the Tian Yan was merely a past image, not the present.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and picked up a scattered box. He had seen this box before when he was sorting through his father's belongings, and it seemed to contain some paintings, but they were quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Just a landscape painting.</p><p></p><p>He opened the painting box, and it was still the same ordinary landscape painting, but Ye Wuyou's gaze had become sharp.</p><p></p><p>A few months ago, when he had organized these items in the house, he had not found anything unusual, but now it was different.</p><p></p><p>He was now very sensitive to any strange auras.</p><p></p><p>In this box, there was an extremely faint Dao aura, very faint, almost dissipating...</p><p></p><p>It was not emanating from the painting, but from the box itself.</p><p></p><p>"The painting is just a cover, the box is the strange object? No, the aura is dissipating quickly, the painting inside has been switched by someone."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou made an initial judgment.</p><p></p><p>The other party did not understand the strange, and may not have even encountered such things before, otherwise they would have taken this box away.</p><p></p><p>However... that's not right either. Normal people can't even perceive the strange, let alone sense it, so they ignored this painting box.</p><p></p><p>If it were anyone else, or anyone in Tianlan City other than Ye Wuyou and Lu Qingshan, this extremely faint Dao aura would have gone completely unnoticed over the past few months.</p><p></p><p>[Tsk, you chuckle, not even a relic... just another piece of trash...]</p><p></p><p>This painting box was left by his father, but why would his father have such an item? His fingers gently caressed the box, constantly pondering.</p><p></p><p>His fingertips suddenly paused, as if he had touched something. Ye Wuyou focused his gaze, looking into the painting box in the candlelight.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wu Zuolong stood silently in his own room, the handprint on his face glowing red.</p><p></p><p>His originally malicious expression now showed hesitation for a moment, and finally he took an object from the bookshelf.</p><p></p><p>The wrapping of the object was very careful, with a touch of spirituality, not like an ordinary object, similar to the bell that the Qianhuan Gate had once used to seal the eyeball.</p><p></p><p>He took out the item inside, then carefully spread it out, and then knelt down in front of it.</p><p></p><p>It was a painting.</p><p></p><p>The figure in the painting was depicted extremely well, both in stature and temperament, but only the face was empty, a faceless woman.</p><p></p><p>Then there was only the sound of Wu Zuolong's voice in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Oh painted immortal, please hear my plea."</p><p></p><p>"I saw a person... a person who should have died."</p><p></p><p>"No, he must have died before, and to prevent anyone from finding out anything, even his memories were erased..."</p><p></p><p>"I don't dare let anyone else know, and I don't dare ask anyone else for help, otherwise why do you think I called you!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill him, kill him again."</p><p></p><p>"What are the conditions..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Zuolong stood there for a long time, as if pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Then he wrapped the painting back up and put it away.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>According to the inscriptions on the painting box, Ye Wuyou came to his own small courtyard and lifted up a blue stone slab.</p><p></p><p>On the back of the stone slab were densely written characters, written in spiritual energy, the handwriting of Ye Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>[I am Ye Changsheng, when you see this, I will already be dead.]</p><p></p><p>[If you have found this, Wuyou, you must have seen that painting and opened it, but listen to me, do not believe that thing at all.]</p><p></p><p>[That thing, I can't get rid of it, even if I throw it away and bury it, it will come back on its own, like a stubborn leech, impossible to get rid of.]</p><p></p><p>[No matter what the thing in the painting says, do not answer, do not answer, do not answer.]</p><p></p><p>The evening temperature was a bit chilly, and combined with these words, it made one feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou frowned slightly and looked down further.</p><p></p><p>[I accidentally obtained this painting during the month you were taking the exam.]</p><p></p><p>[I opened the painting, and that thing said it could fulfill my wish, you know, your father really didn't have any wishes in his life, he just hoped you could pass the imperial examination.]</p><p></p><p>[But I missed your mother.]</p><p></p><p>[I didn't believe in those superstitious things, but since the painting was already opened, I might as well give it a try.]</p><p></p><p>[I asked that thing if it could bring your mother back, I wanted to see her again.]</p><p></p><p>[That thing said it could, but it had a condition, the price was a basin of dog's blood.]</p><p></p><p>[I was very excited at the time, thinking this was too easy, so I slaughtered the neighbor's dog.]</p><p></p><p>[At the time, nothing happened, and I also felt that thing was just deceiving me, so I just fell asleep.]</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>【But later, your mother really came back】</p><p></p><p>The handwriting had become a bit sloppy, understandably, as the father's emotions were somewhat agitated when he wrote this part.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wurou's heart gradually sank.</p><p></p><p>The dead cannot be brought back to life.</p><p></p><p>Even if there were some supernatural powers in this world that could see the deceased, the price would definitely not be just a bowl of pig's blood... </p><p></p><p>How could an artifact with a great Dao aura possibly revive the dead? So, his father, Ye Changsheng, had been deceived...</p><p></p><p>【At the time, I was really happy, I thought that thing was a treasure, and I brought it out】</p><p></p><p>【But I couldn't explain it, I didn't even dare let your mother go out, because your mother had been gone for many years, if someone saw her, how would I explain it?】</p><p></p><p>【The little girl next door has been wanting to come find her dog, but I've yelled at her several times, scaring her away】</p><p></p><p>【Those few days were the happiest days for your father, your mother and I stayed at home, just like when we were young】</p><p></p><p>【Later, one day I went out to buy some pastries, your mother loved to eat white sugar cakes the most】</p><p></p><p>【I came back early, wanting to surprise your mother】</p><p></p><p>【I regret it, I really regret why I came back quietly, it wouldn't have been like this otherwise】</p><p></p><p>【I didn't go inside, but through the window, I wanted to see what your mother was doing】</p><p></p><p>【I saw, I saw your mother combing her hair, but she took her head off】</p><p></p><p>There was a long, shocking gash on the stone slab, covered by a layer of spiritual energy, which was the handwriting of his father carved with spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wurou reached out and gently stroked it.</p><p></p><p>The handwriting was just handwriting, but Ye Wurou could still feel his father's emotions at the time.</p><p></p><p>It was probably despair.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of falling from heaven to hell was not a pleasant one.</p><p></p><p>【I killed your mother】</p><p></p><p>【No, that was not your mother, it was just a deceptive monster, and after it died, it didn't even leave a corpse】</p><p></p><p>【But it looked so much like her, when I killed her, she even smiled at me】</p><p></p><p>【When your mother left, she was also smiling】</p><p></p><p>【I wanted to tear up that painting, but I couldn't tear it, and I threw it away countless times, but that thing just wouldn't go away, I would wake up and it would be back under the bed】</p><p></p><p>【I thought about it for a long time, what use does this thing have, can it be used】</p><p></p><p>【After all, if I hadn't discovered it that day, maybe your mother really did come back】</p><p></p><p>【So, it might be useful, right?】</p><p></p><p>【I made one last wish, hoping you could pass the imperial examinations】</p><p></p><p>【The price was to kill someone】</p><p></p><p>【I started to be a bit conflicted, but I soon was no longer conflicted】</p><p></p><p>【It didn't say I had to kill a specific person, anyone would do, as long as it was a human】</p><p></p><p>【I, your father, miss your mother】</p><p></p><p>The handwriting ended here.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wurou took one last look at the stone slab, then crushed it to pieces with his foot.</p><p></p><p>【Ridiculous, too ridiculous, you mocked inwardly, the ignorant mortals, easily believed the words of that demonic thing, and in the end gained nothing, truly...】</p><p></p><p>"Shut up." Ye Wurou said softly, his voice very cold.</p><p></p><p>Father Ye Changsheng did not kill anyone, nor did he die of illness.</p><p></p><p>He committed suicide.</p><p></p><p>Father told himself not to believe that thing in the painting, but he himself believed it, or rather, forced himself to believe it.</p><p></p><p>The old man's last wish was just to let himself pass the imperial examinations, to become an educated person, and to live a better life.</p><p></p><p>However, that painting is gone now, but Ye Wurou has already confirmed one thing.</p><p></p><p>That thing was a deception.</p><p></p><p>Because he really didn't pass the imperial examinations.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wurou stood in the bleak evening courtyard and sighed.</p><p></p><p>The words were not very nice.</p><p></p><p>But in the true sense, he had actually never seen Ye Changsheng.</p><p></p><p>But...</p><p></p><p>This kind of manipulation of people's hearts, he hated it very much.</p><p></p><p>Plus, it had deceived his father and cost him his life.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wurou quietly opened his hand, he had not been idle.</p><p></p><p>The little figure in his palm had already kowtowed nine times intermittently, and somehow, its form seemed a bit dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The ShenDao technique Tianyan had also advanced to the second layer.</p><p></p><p>As for the third layer, Ye Wurou had no mood to watch the little figure kowtow eighty-one times, and he could feel that his own "ghostly" aura had weakened a bit.</p><p></p><p>But it was enough.</p><p></p><p>Pushing the heavenly mechanism.</p><p></p><p>"Any clues to the cause of my own death."</p><p></p><p>This was the most important thing.</p><p></p><p>If he did not die of illness but was killed by someone, then he was very likely already in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>The scene unfolded before Ye Wurou's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The evening wind was very cold.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wurou wanted to kill someone.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The so-called strange influence should naturally be resolved by the strange itself.</p><p></p><p>The jelly-like membrane, now only the size of a palm, was slowly crawling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Just as Ye Wuyu was puzzled, wondering how this was different from his previous aimless walking, it stopped.</p><p></p><p>This was still the passageway within the Celestial Prison, dimly lit.</p><p></p><p>Although Ye Wuyu could see the "strange" compared to the others, he could only see it and still could not communicate with it.</p><p></p><p>After all, the thing at his feet didn't even have a mouth, so it would be quite difficult to make it speak.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was still pondering the meaning of this, the voice of Xia Anmeng in his mind suddenly let out a light exclamation.</p><p></p><p>"This is... the boundary of the loop," Xia Anmeng's voice sounded a little hesitant, but then became affirmative.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say you couldn't detect anything unusual?" Ye Wuyu asked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Even as a spiritual body, Xia Anmeng couldn't help but roll her eyes, her tone dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, of course, one wouldn't be able to perceive it, but now that we've been standing here for so long, and the thing at your feet just happens to be staying here and not leaving, could it be that even I, the master, wouldn't be able to detect it? That would be a waste of all these years."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu understood the meaning of the other party's words.</p><p></p><p>It was like a sudden additional auxiliary line appearing in a complex geometric pattern, making everything clear.</p><p></p><p>What she said made sense...</p><p></p><p>But cultivation is like mathematics, either you can do it or you can't.</p><p></p><p>"What do I need to do now?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, who had borrowed a realm of cultivation, was still at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Shatter this boundary, use your strongest technique."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this answer, Ye Wuyu seriously considered what techniques he actually knew.</p><p></p><p>Well, it's still the same.</p><p></p><p>The "Formless Heart Sutra" was activated, the spiritual energy resonating, and once again that crisp sword light flashed in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Sword rises, wind and thunder!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xia Anmeng, who was possessing Ye Wuyu's body, also widened her eyes to watch this scene.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, the incident had happened so suddenly that Xia Anmeng had not noticed how Ye Wuyu had unleashed that sword.</p><p></p><p>But now, due to the possession, Xia Anmeng could clearly perceive how the spiritual energy was circulating within Ye Wuyu.</p><p></p><p>As Lu Caiwi's master, the old grandpa who accompanied her, she naturally knew this sword technique of her disciple, even though it was not her own creation, but she had personally guided the other party on it many times.</p><p></p><p>But this technique required a specific cultivation method and a specific meridian circulation of spiritual energy. If the circulation was not proper, the practitioner would be hindered...</p><p></p><p>But now, everything Ye Wuyu did had overturned her understanding.</p><p></p><p>"How did he learn this technique!"</p><p></p><p>A mortal without any cultivation realm could resist the invasion of the strange.</p><p></p><p>Without any prior cultivation, he could unleash the same sword technique as Lu Caiwi.</p><p></p><p>Even she herself could not pinpoint the location of the strange existence, but the other party's sword strike was as if he could see it directly, no longer just detecting it, but almost seeing it.</p><p></p><p>In addition, he could perceive the state of her spiritual being, and point out her realm with a word...</p><p></p><p>What is his true identity...</p><p></p><p>Is he human, or...?</p><p></p><p>Compared to Xia Anmeng's surprise and inner turmoil, Ye Wuyu's aura seemed to have paused for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Even though the passageway in front of him was empty, his sword strike had indeed hit something.</p><p></p><p>It's just that...</p><p></p><p>It seems a little insufficient for now.</p><p></p><p>Hmm...</p><p></p><p>A murmur reached his ears, and then turned into a slightly painful whisper.</p><p></p><p>The delicate figure on his back trembled slightly, followed by a warm but gradually rapid breathing.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi had woken up.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>Her waking up at this moment was not good news.</p><p></p><p>It meant that the invasion of the strange would continue to corrode her mind.</p><p></p><p>Lu Caiwi's reaction was quick, perhaps due to her keen senses as a Qi Realm cultivator. She quickly realized what had happened.</p><p></p><p>She rolled off Ye Wuyu and fell to the ground, but stumbled.</p><p></p><p>"The sword... give it to me."</p><p></p><p>A painful murmur came from in front of him.</p><p></p><p>【The little girl wants to play the self-harm routine again, how pitiful. You, unaffected by the invasion, have a calm expression, only coldly overlooking the masses.】</p><p></p><p>Shut the fuck up.</p><p></p><p>【Such worldly warriors, who call themselves cultivators, are disturbed by the remnant power of these wretched great ways. You do not understand, cannot understand why they are so weak...】</p><p></p><p>【The further you go, the thicker the invasion will be. You may sneer, or feel compassion, and give her a way to live...】</p><p></p><p>【Just deprive her of the five senses, make her unable to see, hear, smell, or taste... Then for the rest of her life, this little girl can only depend on you, becoming your puppet furnace.】</p><p></p><p>Shut up, shut up.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's body trembled slightly at the moment, and a strange emotion was accumulating in his heart, making him extremely irritated.</p><p></p><p>Damn it, could it be that I've also been invaded by this cursed place?</p><p></p><p>Perhaps distracted, and not knowing where her strength came from, the long sword was snatched from his hand by Lu Caiwi.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the sword light flashed.</p><p></p><p>Ding...</p><p></p><p>The long sword was thrown several meters away, falling to the ground with a crisp metallic sound.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sound of stone colliding.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu pressed his single leg down on Lu Caiwei, holding the woman down so she could not move.</p><p></p><p>There was still lingering fear in his eyes. Damn it... Was she just now trying to scratch her own face?</p><p></p><p>A pained murmur came from beneath him.</p><p></p><p>"Let... let me go."</p><p></p><p>Beneath the disheveled hair was a beautiful face filled with tears, the previous coldness in her eyes now replaced by endless turmoil and agony.</p><p></p><p>"Please, please..."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, closed his eyes and opened them again, the extra emotions in his eyes having dissipated, leaving only calmness.</p><p></p><p>If destroying her appearance could relieve this pain and keep her lucid, Ye Wuyu would certainly not stop it, nor would he care.</p><p></p><p>Between life and death, even the best of appearances would ultimately become a crimson skeletal frame.</p><p></p><p>But, it was useless.</p><p></p><p>Since the matter could not be resolved, it would be better to deprive her of the five senses as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of his heart, a faint sigh echoed.</p><p></p><p>Summer An Meng seemed to be questioning, or perhaps doubting.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyu, are you human?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The main hall of the first layer of the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>It had been nearly four days since the riot in the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the Heavenly Prison was indeed quite serious, but the foundation was ultimately unharmed, at least it had not sunk into a crater.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, numerous Heavenly Prison guards had gathered here, with passing guards also bearing various injuries.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the crowd were somewhat dazed as they silently stared at the few figures in the front.</p><p></p><p>"Has the counting been completed? How many are still unaccounted for?"</p><p></p><p>The one speaking was an elderly man in a black robe, currently holding a shattered mirror and examining it.</p><p></p><p>Although the old man had no visible filth on him, the heavy scent of blood could not be suppressed by the wind.</p><p></p><p>Hanging at his waist was a token with a large character engraved on it: [Jia].</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Lord Zhao, the headcount from the first to seventh layers is complete, with seventeen colleagues having perished, and eight more unaccounted for."</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent for a moment, and after a long while, the old man sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>"Has the cause of this incident been investigated?"</p><p></p><p>The guard who had previously responded hesitated for a moment, sweeping his gaze across the crowd before continuing.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Lord Zhao, it was the demonic creature previously captured by the Fifth Squad of the Class B division. It deliberately allowed itself to be captured and brought the Heavenly Mirror, a powerful artifact, causing the order of the layers within the Heavenly Prison to be inverted, leaving us unable to provide timely reinforcement..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he was interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic creature deliberately allowed itself to be captured? Why not just say the people were too stupid to notice?"</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe's white hair swayed without wind, his black robe rustling violently with the force of his aura.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the captain of the Fifth Squad of Class B?"</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the lord, the captain's name is Lu Caiwei, and she is currently missing..."</p><p></p><p>Missing...</p><p></p><p>They had searched through all the layers from the first to the seventh, bringing back all the bodies, living or dead.</p><p></p><p>This current disappearance could only mean that she had fallen into the eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>The eighth layer, apart from the Warden, no one else could enter.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe tossed the now-ruined Heavenly Mirror to the ground, his expression clouded.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mirror could invert the order of things, and in the chaos of the Heavenly Prison, it would mean that someone trying to enter a certain layer would end up in another.</p><p></p><p>"I recall that at the Class B level, there would be a soul imprint left behind... Have someone bring it up for inspection."</p><p></p><p>A row of jade-colored glass cups were brought out, like a lantern stand.</p><p></p><p>Each glass cup contained a flickering flame, representing an individual life.</p><p></p><p>Some had already dimmed, but most were still bright.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Caiwei... Let me find her, hmph."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe's gaze swept over the lit glass cups, and although he still had a stern expression, the oppression in his heart had dissipated considerably.</p><p></p><p>She's still alive, and as long as the Warden returns, she can be rescued.</p><p></p><p>"She's still there, the captain is still alive! The captain can't possibly be dead!!"</p><p></p><p>The loud exclamation seemed to come from a joyful prison guard of the Class C division, who was quickly pulled aside and silenced by his comrades.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up, you're embarrassing the captain."</p><p></p><p>Though the words were harsh, the relief on their faces was evident.</p><p></p><p>With this Heavenly Prison incident, they had committed a grave error and needed to atone for it.</p><p></p><p>If the captain was gone, how would they, a group of Class C prison guards, continue on? They would be mocked endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe glanced at them and roared.</p><p></p><p>"Overreacting, where's the dignity! If Class B prison guards are so easily killed, then perhaps it's better to..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Zhao Changhe noticed the changing expressions of the people below.</p><p></p><p>From initial euphoric joy, to surprise, to disbelief and finally to a somber pallor.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe abruptly turned around.</p><p></p><p>On the lantern stand, a jade-colored glass cup slowly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As the four figures entered the city, they all couldn't help but let out a long sigh.</p><p></p><p>"We're finally back. Come, let's go to the Heavenly Prison first to hand in the task." Xu Fang's loud voice rang out, and then he looked at Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>The burly man chuckled and then walked over to give Ye Wuyou a punch, saying boldly, "Although I don't know how you did it, the important thing is that you came back safely. Come, let's hand in the task first, and then I'll treat you to a drink, brother."</p><p></p><p>"And I'll tell you about some of the things in our Heavenly Prison, like our captain, he's really something..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, Ye Wuyou extended his left hand and took out a token from his waist.</p><p></p><p>That eerie, azure-blue left hand that was terrifying the night before was now normal like a regular person's.</p><p></p><p>[In the three-foot alley to the right of the city gate, there is a woman secretly watching you, with malicious intent. Her three measurements are...]</p><p></p><p>His gaze lightly swept across the corner of the city gate, then quickly withdrew.</p><p></p><p>"I still have some things to take care of. You guys go help me collect it, and I'll come find you later."</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Fang was about to ask what was going on, Lin Qingqing quickly took the token and dragged him away.</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for a beating, you old hag!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask what you shouldn't ask, you fool!"</p><p></p><p>After the group had left, Ye Wuyou looked at his arm and then walked towards the nearby alley.</p><p></p><p>In Ye Wuyou's own eyes, he could see the true appearance of his left arm, but to others, his arm looked normal. </p><p></p><p>This was just an illusion, cast by his restored scarlet right eye.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that strange eyeball couldn't have been just for helping him see. </p><p></p><p>Last night, he hadn't slept, and through the fragmentary hints from the narration and his own constant attempts, he discovered the eye's peculiarity - it was capable of illusion.</p><p></p><p>Using this bizarre right eye, he could cast illusions he normally couldn't.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had focused the illusion on his own arm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could also use the illusion to restore his eyes to normal, but after thinking about it, he decided not to.</p><p></p><p>Less is more, his eyes had just gone blind the day before and miraculously recovered the next day. If Lin Qingqing and the others asked about it, how would he explain?</p><p></p><p>Was this method really without any side effects? He had doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>[You sneered, and countless thoughts flashed through your mind. The remnants of the Great Dao were nothing but trash to you, and this Great Dao Aura item was the trash among the trash, a broken trinket that had previously been used as a bell. If it hadn't damaged one of your eyes, it wouldn't even have the qualification to appear on you.]</p><p></p><p>Okay, okay, okay...</p><p></p><p>The endless praise from the narration, even if it went in one ear and out the other, after hearing it so much, it almost made Ye Wuyou a little inflated.</p><p></p><p>But he quickly suppressed the inflation in his heart and looked at the smiling woman in the alley.</p><p></p><p>"How did you find me? I was planning to notify you at the Heavenly Prison." Spring Peach smiled.</p><p></p><p>As the words fell, Spring Peach took a few steps towards him, first looking at his bandaged eye, then circling around him, her brows slightly furrowed, and she said with a hint of reproach, "Seriously, Xiao Yezi, how did you lose an eye on your trip out?"</p><p></p><p>"Some things happened, it's not a big deal," Ye Wuyou chose to skip over this topic.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Spring Peach appear here and specifically look for him, the meaning behind it was naturally self-evident.</p><p></p><p>"Zhao Changhe wants to see me?" he asked.</p><p></p><p>Spring Peach shook her head. "Lord Zhao doesn't know when you'll be back, it's the Warden who wants to see you."</p><p></p><p>Spring Peach's words made Ye Wuyou pause. How did the Warden know when he would return to Tianlan City?</p><p></p><p>But it's fine, he had planned to go find the other party anyway.</p><p></p><p>The nonsense the narration had said yesterday had completely shaken Ye Wuyou's confidence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't just quietly wait for himself to be completely transformed into something bizarre, that would be suicidal. </p><p></p><p>He had only been able to control this "ghost" for less than half a month.</p><p></p><p>If it was half a year, what would he become? He could only seek other ways to solve the issue of this bizarre invasion of his own body.</p><p></p><p>But ordinary people definitely couldn't help with this, even someone who seems to know everything like Xia Anmeng, probably wouldn't understand the situation happening to him.</p><p></p><p>So, the only one left was the Warden he had met before.</p><p></p><p>Because the other party...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was clear that there were also remnants of the Great Dao up above.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as mentioned earlier, the other party seemed to want to take him as a disciple?...</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Ye Wuyou saw the mysterious Warden in a pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Chuntao had only brought him to the door and then left. The nearby streets were very quiet, with no one around, not knowing if it was usually empty or intentionally isolated.</p><p></p><p>A tranquil sandalwood fragrance wafted from the room. A few goldfish were swimming back and forth in the fish tank, and the walls were lined with bookshelves filled with dense, incomprehensible books to Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou shifted his gaze from the interior of the room and looked towards the window, at the figure emanating a strong scholarly aura.</p><p></p><p>He did not look like a warden, but more like a middle-aged scholar. If the words were a little harsher, he would be considered a decadent Confucian.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou did not know much about this person, after all, their only interaction was that one punch in the eighth layer of the Divine Prison.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that the other's name was Lu Qingshan, a cultivator of the Five Realms Great Spiritual Penetrations, and the warden of the Divine Prison.</p><p></p><p>And, just like himself, it seemed that there were remnants of the Great Dao on his body.</p><p></p><p>The slight sound of flipping pages arose, as Lu Qingshan held a book in his hand, his gaze focused on reading, as if he had not noticed the person in the room.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou furrowed his brow, but did not disturb him immediately. Instead, he focused his attention on the area behind Lu Qingshan.</p><p></p><p>He could see the remnants of the Great Dao, so at this moment, Ye Wuyou wanted to see clearly what the strange thing on the other's body was.</p><p></p><p>A faint, illusory figure appeared behind Lu Qingshan, visible as a human form, but the features were indistinct, as if obscured by a hazy veil.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou strained to see it more clearly.</p><p></p><p>Under his gaze, the illusory figure gradually became clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>But just as Ye Wuyou was about to see the face of that thing, the illusory figure seemed to sense something, slightly turning its head to look at Ye Wuyou.</p><p></p><p>"Clap."</p><p></p><p>The book in Lu Qingshan's hand closed, and at the same time, his gentle and calm voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't keep staring, that's not good."</p><p></p><p>Feeling the other's gaze upon him, Ye Wuyou hesitated for a moment, then clasped his hands and bowed, wanting to say something.</p><p></p><p>But Lu Qingshan's words came again, his tone still calm and even.</p><p></p><p>"Has your left hand already turned into this? So fast, I thought it would take at least three months for the first signs to appear."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps in a good mood, this warden even made a joke.</p><p></p><p>"You've been out for less than half a month, and now it's turned into this. It can only be from overuse. Could it be that you saw a stray dog and had to use this remnant to slap it a few times?"</p><p></p><p>This joke was not funny, and Ye Wuyou naturally could not laugh.</p><p></p><p>This topic was too heavy, because he had previously hated to use his demonic hand even to eat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his pupils contracted slightly, and he was not surprised that the other could see through the illusory technique concealing his arm.</p><p></p><p>What he cared about were the information contained in the other's words.</p><p></p><p>What the other called "strange" was not the common perception of "abnormal", but referred to it as a "remnant".</p><p></p><p>This warden seemed to have a deep understanding of these "remnants of the Great Dao".</p><p></p><p>He looked up, meeting the other's gentle gaze.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan quietly observed Ye Wuyou, not seeming surprised by the arm, his gaze sweeping over the simple bandage on Ye Wuyou's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You can take it off, and afterwards, I'll say I helped you cure your eye disease," Lu Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou removed the cloth from his eyes, revealing the scarlet, demonic eye.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to an outsider, Ye Wuyou's eye would appear normal.</p><p></p><p>But this outsider did not include the person in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou stood there silently, not having spoken a word from the moment he entered the room.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed that all of his secrets had been seen through by the other.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the smiling Lu Qingshan in front of him, a thought emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Was there anything the other did not know? As if to confirm his thoughts, the smiling Lu Qingshan spoke in a calm voice.</p><p></p><p>"Ye Wuyou, you can ask me anything you want to know. After all, I'm the one who summoned you here."</p><p></p><p>"I know everything."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

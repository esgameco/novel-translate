        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing held a bell in her hand and shook it.</p><p></p><p>The bell contained a trace of the demonic fox's aura, which could be used for positioning, and was something they had just gathered the required number of people to obtain.</p><p></p><p>The demonic fox was located in the Yunwu Mountain Range outside of Tianlan City, about sixty-plus li away.</p><p></p><p>At such a distance, even though the few of them had cultivation, it would be foolish to completely exhaust their spiritual energy just by running there. So Lin Qingqing somehow managed to procure a few horses.</p><p></p><p>And thus, this awkward scene unfolded at the entrance of the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, Ye Wuyu was not very good at riding horses. The only time he had ridden a horse was when he had paid 150 yuan at a scenic spot, and someone had led the horse around with him on it.</p><p></p><p>The awkwardness on horseback soon drew the sidelong glances of a few people.</p><p></p><p>In contrast to the disdain of the burly man Xu Fang, Lin Qingqing's eyes were smiling as she said sweetly, "Young master, why don't you ride with me? You can sit in front, and I'm quite good at riding."</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang clicked his tongue lightly and muttered, "That old hag gets horny just by seeing a pretty boy..."</p><p></p><p>[Hearing this mocking, you coldly laugh three times and shout, "I'll have you know, this fine figure of mine could be a sought-after patron at the Dragon and Phoenix Pavilion, a true duck king among the many beauties' laps. How can you simply call me a 'pretty boy'?"]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu unconsciously touched his own face, his whole body covered in goosebumps, greatly shocked. Why would one use such a brazen tone to say such a thing?</p><p></p><p>With her second-realm senses, Lin Qingqing quickly turned around, her smile fading, and pointed at Xu Fang, angrily spitting, "What I do is none of your business. You, who used to blush every time you talked to the captain, how dare you say that about me?"</p><p></p><p>"Who? Who was always thinking about the captain? Who the hell blushed when talking?" </p><p></p><p>"Ah, yes, yes, you're just dreaming."</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the seemingly well-practiced bickering of the two, Ye Wuyu looked at the restless steed beneath him, and an idea struck him.</p><p></p><p>Ghostly blue hands extended from Ye Wuyu's body, gently wrapping around the horse like ropes, tightly binding Ye Wuyu and the horse together.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this eerie scene went unnoticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>The spirited steed suddenly shuddered and let out a snort, instantly calming down.</p><p></p><p>[You immediately leap up to the pavilion and grab the peeping Tom, demanding, "What scoundrel dares to secretly spy on me?"]</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was slightly taken aback, then turned back with an expressionless face, sweeping his gaze over the buildings on the side of the street, before saying to the still-bickering pair, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing and Xu Fang stopped arguing and looked at Ye Wuyu with a touch of surprise, but didn't ask further.</p><p></p><p>The group of four gradually moved farther away along the official road.</p><p></p><p>Just along the street outside the Heavenly Prison, a man's slightly surprised laughter could be heard from a window.</p><p></p><p>"Why is the lord laughing?" an elderly voice, tinged with confusion, came from the side.</p><p></p><p>It was Zhao Changhe sitting nearby, a chessboard in front of him, playing against the man.</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan withdrew his gaze, looking at the chessboard, his voice calm but with a hint of amusement. "Nothing, I just saw something interesting."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan never would have imagined that the boy would use "eerie" means to ride a horse. And as for that seemingly casual gaze, was it truly just a casual glance?</p><p></p><p>"It's your move," Lu Qingshan said.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe was clearly not focused on the chessboard, casually placing a piece, then asked, "Lord, you said you wanted to take that boy as a disciple before. Were you serious?"</p><p></p><p>"Serious... perhaps." Lu Qingshan's tone was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe couldn't sit still. "Lord, if you have such intentions, why don't you go see him?"</p><p></p><p>"Good things take time." Lu Qingshan's voice was calm.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe scratched his head, his expression disgruntled.</p><p>Their Warden Lord was good in every way - his temperament, appearance, and cultivation were all exceptional. Even if he was only at the Fifth Realm...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he could stay in Tianlan and Da Yan, it was still an insurmountable mountain peak for him.</p><p></p><p>But still... that Enigmatic Man really deserves to die.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe, who was still thinking about taking Ye Wuyu as his disciple, made one last attempt.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, I've seen that kid before, he's usually carefree, but deep down he's the type who will fight to the death at the slightest provocation. His temperament is not quite compatible with your cultivation technique..."</p><p></p><p>Lu Qingshan didn't mind, but after contemplating, he lightly placed a chess piece on the board.</p><p></p><p>"Changhe, what I want to pass on to him is not actually a cultivation technique..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Well, let me introduce you, this big guy is called Xu Fang, at the Second Realm, but he's a fool who has trained his body to the point of stupidity. He's foul-mouthed in daily life, and he only survived in the Heavenly Prison by pure luck. If he were to join an external cultivation sect, he wouldn't last three days with that personality."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing's introduction did not conceal her voice, and Xu Fang's figure trembled slightly, looking like he was about to erupt again.</p><p></p><p>But Lin Qingqing quickly ignored him, pointing to the white-faced man who had not spoken since their meeting, and said,</p><p></p><p>"This one, we call him Bai Changzai, also at the Second Realm, but he specializes in talisman arts, with endless tricks. Anyway, if there's any danger, you'll never see him head-on."</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai nodded slightly at Ye Wuyu, still not uttering a word, as if greeting him.</p><p></p><p>"As for me," Lin Qingqing puffed out her chest slightly, her expression quite proud.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also at the Second Realm, but my cultivation direction is formation arts." After saying this, Lin Qingqing tilted her head up arrogantly, as if waiting for praise.</p><p></p><p>However, Ye Wuyu showed no reaction, his expression slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Formation arts... what's the problem?</p><p></p><p>From the side came Xu Fang's barely concealed mocking laughter. "Forget it, that kid doesn't understand. But you, a Second Realm formation artist, don't brag so much. You can't even set up advanced formations, and your low-level formations are just barely passable, it's embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>"Pig-headed fool, if you don't speak you'll die, right? You Second Realm formation artist is eating your rice. I have talent, you know? Not everyone can be a formation artist. With that broken brain of yours, you'll definitely never learn it! You can only cultivate your body!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them were both quick-tempered, only Bai Changzai remained silent as usual, as if he was already accustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu continued on his way, but in his mind, he had a general framework of the division within this so-called team in the Heavenly Prison.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators had different cultivation directions, there were powerful sword cultivators like Lu Caiwi, and there were medical specialists like Chuntao...</p><p></p><p>The other three in his team were Xu Fang, the body cultivator, Bai Changzai, the talisman expert, and Lin Qingqing, the formation artist.</p><p></p><p>It was a rather reasonable combination... if there was also a medical practitioner, it would be even better.</p><p></p><p>Pity, it can't be changed.</p><p></p><p>The journey of over sixty li was not smooth, but they had already walked nearly half of it, and in the distance, the misty mountain forest could be vaguely seen.</p><p></p><p>The sky was also starting to darken.</p><p></p><p>But this was not the official road, but a small mountain path, surrounded by mountains, so there would be no inns here.</p><p></p><p>"In about a few more hours, we'll reach the foot of Cloud Mist Mountain. I remember there's a village there where we can rest," Lin Qingqing said, looking at the map.</p><p></p><p>The others had no objections.</p><p></p><p>The mountain wind blew past, carrying the chilling air of the forest.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the familiar dog's bark echoed in his mind.</p><p></p><p>【The mountains are naturally cold, but this beast has come to me of its own accord, and as I'm feeling a bit hungry, I won't hold back...】</p><p></p><p>The spirited horse under him let out a joyful neigh.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying restraints that had bound him all the way were now completely gone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's figure leapt out.</p><p></p><p>In his mind flashed the image of Zhao Changhe's kick from the sky that snowy night.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The ground in front of the group was smashed into a pit over a zhang wide, the soil startled into the air, scattering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"You brat! What are you doing!" Xu Fang's expression was furious, as the dirt and sand had sprayed all over his face.</p><p></p><p>However, the next moment, accompanying a thunderous roar, was an angry howl!</p><p></p><p>A strange beast covered in sharp scales, with blood still dripping from its head, was now crouching on the path, its gaze ferocious as it stared at the group.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was initially puzzled. Running to the so-called village in the dead of night to rest, anyone with a sense of safety would not fail to be driven away as a thief or bandit. </p><p></p><p>But very soon, he realized his thoughts were a bit excessive.</p><p></p><p>Although it was already late at night, the village at the foot of the Cloud Mist Mountains still had lights burning, and there were even people waiting at the village entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Two taels of silver per person, you can freely choose any vacant house in the east of the village."</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing was unfazed, paid the silver, and led the three of them to select an empty room to rest.</p><p></p><p>"Strange? This Cloud Mist Mountain range is the only place near Tianlancheng where demonic beasts exist. In the past, cultivators would often come here to train. As the only inhabited place around, the village at the foot of the mountain has gradually developed in this way over time."</p><p></p><p>"Not only do they provide accommodation, they also offer guides to enter the mountain, and services to find spiritual herbs and the like. The people in this village are quite shrewd."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was surprised and asked, "Then doesn't the village stationed here fear the demonic beasts' invasion?"</p><p></p><p>"Fear? How could they not fear? But there is money to be made here, earning more in a month than a year of farming and mountain work. And this is the off-season of deep winter, when most of the demonic beasts in the mountains are in hibernation. If it happens to coincide with the days when disciples of some cultivation sects come out to train, it's twenty taels of silver per person."</p><p></p><p>"If those are the scions of powerful sects, in a burst of generosity or out of jealousy for a beauty, they would casually bestow some gifts, which would be endless riches."</p><p></p><p>"People die for money, birds die for food. If lucky, they can earn in a few months what ordinary people can't in a lifetime. And you haven't seen that the village is mostly filled with the elderly? The young have long since gone out to the cities. What is life to them?"  Lin Qingqing said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu was speechless, gradually understanding the implications.</p><p></p><p>The small wooden house was cramped with four people, with only an oil lamp casting a hazy glow, and the dilapidated little window outside was dark, occasionally howling with mountain winds.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing seemed to be in a mischievous mood, raising the oil lamp in front of her face and speaking in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"You know, the most terrible thing about this village is not the demonic beasts, but the people."</p><p></p><p>"At least the demonic beasts have a pattern when they attack, and there are often cultivators in the village. The demonic beasts at the foot of the mountain are just minor ones, not difficult to handle."</p><p></p><p>"But there are always cultivators who have fallen into the wrong path, indiscriminately slaughtering. Facing this group of lonely elderly left in the mountains, what do you think would happen?"</p><p></p><p>【In the conversation, you keenly captured a hint of strangeness in the words, in the eyes of true cultivators, ordinary people are nothing but dogs...】</p><p></p><p>Whoosh whoosh whoosh...</p><p></p><p>The wind in the mountain was strong at night, and the old window frame seemed unable to withstand the fierce gale, with a corner broken.</p><p></p><p>The mountain wind rushed in through the gap, making the oil lamp flicker.</p><p></p><p>Xu Fang snorted disdainfully, the burly man turning his back and ignoring it.</p><p></p><p>Bai Changzai still had his eyes closed, silent and not uttering a word.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu listened quietly, but after a long time, he still didn't hear the continuation, and couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"What happened next?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing chuckled, then put down the oil lamp and shrugged helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either, but this village has been here for decades, and nothing has happened. The longer the time, perhaps those cultivators with crooked intentions no longer dare to act rashly. Who knows what methods this seemingly harmless village has."</p><p></p><p>【This person is really whetting one's appetite. Since you can't get the answer from her mouth, you might as well take action yourself. Tonight, you'll start by investigating the truth of this village.】</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The slaughter was almost complete, so let's see what kind of tricks they have!</p><p></p><p>It's not a bad idea... Pah! Ye Wuyu looked at the woman in front of him, who was laughing uncontrollably, at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this just to whet the appetite? No wonder those two weren't happy to hear it.</p><p></p><p>The brief banter had also dispelled the fatigue of the group on the way. Lin Qingqing cleared her throat and spoke seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk about that fox demon."</p><p></p><p>She took out the bell given to her in the prison and infused it with a trace of spiritual energy, gently shaking it.</p><p></p><p>Ding-a-ling...</p><p></p><p>A illusory scene appeared between the four of them, with a painted screen and text descriptions.</p><p></p><p>The Three-Tailed Fox Demon of Qingqiu, thirty-six years ago, crossed the vast mountains and arrived in the Great Yan.</p><p></p><p>Due to the fox demon's innate talent, even without reaching the fourth realm, it naturally possessed the ability of illusion transformation, often transforming into a beautiful woman and wandering throughout the Great Yan, taking human lives.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-four years ago, the Qingqiu fox demon transformed into a beautiful woman and infiltrated the cultivation sect Qianhuan Gate, using her fox charm to bewitch the sect master, and stole the sect's precious treasure, later causing the destruction of Qianhuan Gate.</p><p></p><p>Twenty-three years ago, a certain high-ranking official of the Celestial Prison encountered the fox demon, who had transformed into a beautiful woman and was bewitching the common people. After a fierce battle, he captured it and brought it back.</p><p></p><p>Note: 1. Suspecting that this fox demon has the bloodline of the Qingqiu royal family, and the whereabouts of Qianhuan Gate's treasure are still unknown, it has not been sentenced, but instead held in indefinite custody.</p><p></p><p>2. The fox demon's own destructive spiritual powers are relatively weak, but its illusion arts are extraordinary. Our department has captured this fox demon many times, but it has always managed to escape.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu had never seen the effects of this treasure before, initially thinking it was just a talisman for locating the fox demon.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, a high-ranking official inspecting at the Spring Wind Pavilion? As if we don't know what kind of place the Spring Wind Pavilion is! I really want to know which big shot has such elegant tastes!" Xu Fang laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing's eyes narrowed as she sneered, "Oh, so you know what the Spring Wind Pavilion is? Wait until the captain returns from the mission, then I'll tell him."</p><p></p><p>The laughter abruptly stopped.</p><p></p><p>But Ye Wuyu kept staring at the information, feeling a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>"Familiar? That's right, only that old scoundrel would be capable of such a beastly act. You inwardly despise him, and the next time you see that old wretch, this training will be very beneficial, you must ask him why he didn't take you along."</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe? His contemplation didn't last long, as the sound of the bell interrupted his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>The bell containing a trace of the fox demon's aura was now moving on its own, emitting a clear ringing sound.</p><p></p><p>Lin Qingqing's eyes narrowed slightly, and in the next moment, she had already stepped out of the house.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, I was just thinking how to find you in this vast forest, but it turns out the fox demon dares to come to us! It saves us the trouble."</p><p></p><p>"Eh... What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The four of them had now come outside the house. The surroundings were still the same as before, the village remained quiet.</p><p></p><p>But in the distance, towards the mountains, a red wolf smoke signal was rising.</p><p></p><p>"A red wolf smoke signal, it's an internal signal from our Celestial Prison... Does that mean one of our comrades is in trouble?" Lin Qingqing's expression changed, clearly not expecting such a scene.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the bell in her hand, it had stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change obviously caused a momentary lapse in Lin Qingqing's composure. She looked at the red wolf smoke in the mountains, then at the peaceful village around them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go up the mountain to rescue them."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

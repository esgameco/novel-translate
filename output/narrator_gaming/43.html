        <h1>Chapter 43</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The man in the brocade robe made hand seals, constantly changing them, then raised his hands high as if he was unleashing some kind of divine ability.</p><p></p><p>But there was no response, and the surrounding undead started to surround him.</p><p></p><p>"It's not working, the illusion technique is useless!"</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the figure of Ye Wuyou kept flickering within the crowd, and the things Zhao Changhe had taught him were being fully utilized in this situation.</p><p></p><p>In addition, translucent azure-colored arms kept emerging from his body, and as Ye Wuyou moved, the decaying corpses around him fell one by one.</p><p></p><p>"These people are not that strong, they seem to be cultivators who died a long time ago, with a few of them occasionally able to use divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>The pressure on Ye Wuyou's side was not that great, perhaps because most of the undead had rushed towards the other party due to the arrogant words of the man in the brocade robe.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>A deafening explosion came from within the man in the brocade robe's encirclement, and more than ten undead were thrown up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>"This won't work." Ye Wuyou quickly made a judgment in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Pitting the living against the dead would only be disadvantageous, and the other side had more people and some could even use divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The most urgent task now was to find the source of this place, that strange eyeball.</p><p></p><p>He shouted towards the man in the brocade robe, "You hold them off first, I have a way to find that thing."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for a response, Ye Wuyou took a step and the azure giant hand tore apart a corpse that was about to unleash a divine ability, then he jumped onto a dilapidated house nearby.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the rooftop, Ye Wuyou's gaze frantically scanned the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, it must be nearby, I can sense it."</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Dao remnant, or something similar, was something Ye Wuyou was very familiar with from his previous encounters.</p><p></p><p>Although that eyeball was not a remnant, it had a similar aura.</p><p></p><p>That unique feeling, the desire to invade one's senses, could not be mistaken.</p><p></p><p>"Found it!" Ye Wuyou took a big step and leaped towards another rooftop, but when he arrived, it was empty, with nothing there.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed, and he then closed his eyes, opening them after a moment and shouting down towards the man in the brocade robe who was still fighting the undead.</p><p></p><p>"Something's wrong! That thing can move!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the man in the brocade robe's expression also immediately turned grim.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not seen the thing in the Purple Gold Bell, as a member of the Thousand Illusion Gate, he vaguely knew that it was no ordinary object.</p><p></p><p>But how bizarre, as long as it was an inanimate object... even if it was not inanimate, as long as it could not move or run, its danger would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Just like a tiger, everyone knows it is ferocious, but if that tiger could only stay in one place and not move, the danger would naturally decrease significantly, and it could even be considered for capture.</p><p></p><p>But now, it could move.</p><p></p><p>A sound of tile collapse came from the side of the street, but then Ye Wuyou emerged with empty hands, his gaze looking elsewhere.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the thing had escaped again.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, it seemed to know that these undead could not hold the two of them, and the group of dark figures below had started to change.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou, standing on the rooftop, could see it clearly - a few decayed bodies with powerful auras were slowly growing flesh and skin, regaining vitality.</p><p></p><p>The deceased cultivators were weak, but if they came back to life, it would be a different story.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, those guys are starting to revive."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyou shouted down, and with a step, he was about to rush towards the few reviving undead.</p><p></p><p>He was not trying to save the man in the brocade robe, but if those half-human, half-ghost creatures revived, the other party would definitely not be able to hold them off, and he would also be hindered.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about me!" </p><p></p><p>A roar came from the street, causing Ye Wuyou to stop in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Ye brother, you are only at the initial stage, just go find that thing, don't worry about me!"</p><p></p><p>"I still need to kill that demonic fox and use this precious treasure to rebuild my sect!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"West also wants to stop me!!! No way!" Accompanied by the words of the man in brocade robes, his eyes quickly scanned the surroundings, and his aura sharply cut across his own arm, with blood and aura flowing out from his body.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes quickly chanted some incantation, his blood-stained arm trembling as he continuously changed the hand seals.</p><p></p><p>The blood mixed with aura transformed into several sharp thread-like strands, and then, centered on the man in brocade robes, they swept outwards for dozens of yards.</p><p></p><p>These blood strands were extremely sharp, and in an instant, more than half of the decaying corpses were sliced in half at the waist.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes raised both hands, and the remaining blood strands turned into droplets of blood that were sprinkled around the remaining corpses, then bursting into raging flames.</p><p></p><p>This group of black, dried corpses was actually resolved by the man in brocade robes alone.</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu stood on the roof, his eyes watching this scene, his heart slightly shaken, but his eyes revealed a gleam.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he could easily kill the other party, relying more on the unseen ghostly hand, not because the Qi Boundary cultivator was weak.</p><p></p><p>Qi Boundary cultivators obviously have some hidden trump cards.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't bring the wrong person.</p><p></p><p>If Ye Wuyu had to deal with these decaying corpses himself, it would have been very troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes panted heavily, then leaped up to the rooftop, looking around and asking, "Have you found it?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, originally I couldn't find it, but after you killed them, it seems it couldn't help but come out."</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu's gaze calmly looked towards a distant rooftop.</p><p></p><p>A strange creature stood there. </p><p></p><p>Half of its head was bald, exposing the stark white bones, and the originally flawless white fur on its body had now turned yellowish, with most of the fur fallen off. Behind it, a tail that was reduced to just bones swayed gently.</p><p></p><p>Although its appearance had changed greatly, Ye Wuyu still recognized it, and also knew why it could move.</p><p></p><p>That familiar aura was within the body of this demonic fox.</p><p></p><p>Yes, if the deceased man in brocade robes could be manipulated, then this demonic fox would be no exception.</p><p></p><p>"That ghostly thing, the root cause of everything in this place, is within the demonic fox's body."</p><p></p><p>Following Ye Wuyu's finger, the man in brocade robes swallowed hard, but then his eyes were replaced by a look of hatred.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic fox! It's you, this vile beast, who caused me to fall to this state!"</p><p></p><p>With that, without waiting for Ye Wuyu's response, the man in brocade robes leaped out, his hands forming seals, his body emanating flashes of light, seemingly using some divine technique.</p><p></p><p>But the demonic fox was exceptionally agile, just like earlier with Ye Wuyu, the man in brocade robes grasped at empty air.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, the demonic fox was still standing on the distant rooftop, slowly stopping, turning its empty eye sockets to gaze at the two, as if mocking and taunting them.</p><p></p><p>The man in brocade robes' expression was unwilling, but he clearly understood that he could not catch up to the demonic fox.</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to look at Ye Wuyu, "Brother Ye, is there any way, as long as we can capture that demonic fox, I have the confidence to seal that ghostly thing."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, Brother Ye? Why is there white smoke coming out of your head?"</p><p></p><p>Ye Wuyu, whose skin had turned completely red, slowly opened his mouth, and a stream of scorching white mist was exhaled from him.</p><p></p><p>Under the operation of the "Formless Heart Sutra", the aura in his body was rushing towards several acupoints.</p><p></p><p>Zhao Changhe's words from that day now seemed to be ringing in his ears.</p><p></p><p>"This is called 'Burning Blood', which requires drawing the aura from the dantian and storing it in fixed meridians. When facing an enemy, the boiling of one's own blood can be used..."</p><p></p><p>"It will last about three minutes."</p><p></p><p>"Give me three minutes." The scorching words were uttered.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ye Wuyu's toes heavily stepped on the rooftop, and his figure disappeared. </p><p></p><p>And the layers of tiles on the roof, at this stomp, first fell silent, and then all the tiles exploded and shattered outwards!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

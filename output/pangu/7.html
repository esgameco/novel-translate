            <p>Time flies,</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, three years have passed.</p><p></p><p>In the Yudao Palace on the Gu family's Void Immortal Island, Gu Daoyi was engrossed in reading an ancient scripture.</p><p></p><p>If someone were to see it, they would discover that the four characters written on the cover of this ancient scripture, imbued with the meaning of the Dao, wereâ€”Milo Source Canon!</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely renowned imperial scripture!</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, there was once a stunningly talented Milo Emperor in the Xuanhuang world. His Dao-attaining cultivation technique was none other than the Milo Source Canon.</p><p></p><p>After the Milo Emperor attained the Dao, his strength was extremely powerful. He established the Milo Palace, which shook the myriad domains, and he went to various ancient lands and entered numerous forbidden zones to exchange Dao techniques, gradually perfecting his Milo Source Canon. Before the Milo Emperor disappeared, the Milo Source Canon was already approaching the level of an Immortal Scripture.</p><p></p><p>The Milo Emperor's strength was also nearly invincible. It was said that he found a path to immortality and forcibly attacked his way in, then disappeared without a trace, with no news for countless years.</p><p></p><p>The world believed that the Milo Emperor had died, but the emperors, supreme beings, and ancient monarchs of the myriad domains firmly believed that the Milo Emperor had become an immortal, and that they still had a path to follow.</p><p></p><p>Several hundred thousand years after the Milo Emperor's disappearance, the Milo Palace he established had once reached the pinnacle of glory, but was ultimately destroyed, simply because the Milo Emperor had disappeared too hastily and did not leave behind many successors. The Milo Palace gradually became unable to sustain itself and lacked successors.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Milo Source Canon was also spread, with a small portion of top-level forces possessing it, and the ancient Gu family was one of them.</p><p></p><p>The reason why Gu Daoyi was comprehending this Milo Source Canon was to absorb its essence. The Milo Source Canon had extremely high attainments in the Nirvana Great Dao. If he could grasp its essence, it would help him create an undying technique.</p><p></p><p>In these three years, Gu Daoyi had been pondering on the profound and comprehending the Dao, never leaving the Void Immortal Island. However, his legends were everywhere in the Divine Prefecture, and countless members of the Gu family still paid great attention to him.</p><p></p><p>This was simply because Gu Daoyi was a mortal body, yet he still retained the status of the Gu family's divine son, which couldn't help but shock and dissatisfy countless disciples of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Countless members of the Gu family believed that the elders were too biased. Although Gu Daoyi was the son of the family head, he did not have a special physique and his talent seemed ordinary, so how could he continue to be the Gu family's divine son?</p><p></p><p>The family head, Gu Taichu, was still trapped in a forbidden zone!</p><p></p><p>The elders turned a deaf ear and a blind eye to this. They still had a sense of propriety and did not release the news that the Void Emperor had allowed Gu Daoyi to be the chief leader. Otherwise, the younger generations of the Gu family would probably cause an uproar.</p><p></p><p>The younger generations of the Gu family were dissatisfied, but the powerful figures from the outside world who had heard the news were very satisfied. The ancient Gu family was going to stubbornly stabilize Gu Taichu's position?</p><p></p><p>They also believed that it was because of Gu Taichu that Gu Daoyi could continue to be the Gu family's divine son. Otherwise, with just a mere mortal body, what virtue, ability, or qualifications did he have to be the Gu family's divine son?</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the powerful figures from the outside world all lowered their attention towards Gu Daoyi, and even stopped paying attention altogether. Only a very small number of forces still maintained a low level of attention.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was very clear about these situations. The Gu family elders</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From time to time, he would come to find him, not to preach to him, but to tell him some situations, say some intelligence, and cultivate Gu Daoyi's beliefs, incidentally to supplement Gu Daoyi's body and enhance his origin.</p><p></p><p>As for the disturbances from the outside world, Gu Daoyi did not pay attention to them at all. With his identity, he did not need to pay attention. When the time comes, the truth will naturally come to light.</p><p></p><p>For the past three years, he had devoted himself to comprehending the law, mainly to prepare for the creation of the immortal method. The smelting of all laws and scriptures was also of great help to him. Having absorbed the essence of countless laws, he had a deep understanding of various wonders and was constantly accumulating them, waiting for the day when they would burst out.</p><p></p><p>At that time, with his deep accumulation, he only needed to comprehend the Tao casually, and he could create the skills, divine powers, and wonders he wanted, and even forge an exclusive physique.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the clan kept taking out the scriptures from the Gu family's secret collection and bringing them to the Imperial Dao Palace for him to read and comprehend. After three years of unremitting efforts, he had finished reading all the scriptures below the Gu family's imperial scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Those shallow and weak skills, he only needed to glance at them to comprehend the wonders contained in them and see the Dao rhyme they wanted to express. If he was willing, he could immediately innovate and create more powerful skills.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Daoyi did not do so. It was a waste of energy. There were countless cultivators in the ancient Gu family who could create weak low-level skills, and there was no need for Gu Daoyi to do it. The elders would not agree with him doing so either.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Gu Daoyi's heart contained countless wonders, drawing on all scriptures and smelting all laws. His whole body exuded Dao rhyme and was surrounded by Dao meaning, naturally and in harmony with heaven and man, reaching the realm of natural Dao.</p><p></p><p>He had just turned three years old, but his height and appearance were no different from a seven- or eight-year-old child. His face was like a crown jade, his eyebrows like stars, his eyes like the universe, and his features distinct. At such a young age, he was like a banished immortal.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Dao Palace where Gu Daoyi lived was his residence, specially refined for him by the Void Emperor, implying the wonders of the void, and was also a peak quasi-emperor weapon that could protect him at critical moments.</p><p></p><p>The immortal gold used to refine the Imperial Dao Palace could be used to refine extreme Dao imperial weapons. Except for the lack of imprinting of the Great Dao at the imperial level, there was not much difference from extreme Dao imperial weapons, and it was engraved with imperial formations, imperial patterns, and so on.</p><p></p><p>When he went out, he could also collect the Imperial Dao Palace and take it with him. The Imperial Dao Palace was intelligent and would automatically block the killing for him. Even if an emperor or a supreme being made a move, it could hold on for a while, which was enough time for the Void Emperor to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~"</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi put down the Maitreya Sutra and rubbed his slightly tired brow, his eyes revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had succeeded!</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please give flowers!

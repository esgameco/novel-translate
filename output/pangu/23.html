        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Gu Dao did not stop Huang Weiyang's actions.</p><p></p><p>He knew that Huang Weiyang missed the Nine Heavens Phoenix too much. The two had not seen each other for millions of years, and this longing spanned across the ages.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang looked to be over a hundred years old, but according to the age range of the Nine Heavens Phoenix, she was actually still a young phoenix, about the same age as Gu Dao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao also wanted to know if the Nine Heavens Phoenix, one of the Ten Ancient Fiends, could transcend time and space to meet and communicate with Huang Weiyang.</p><p></p><p>Not only him, but after the initial shock, everyone present also turned their eyes to Huang Weiyang and the Nine Heavens Phoenix. Could one of the Ten Ancient Fiends really communicate with a young fiend?</p><p></p><p>Hidden in the void, the Six Patriarchs Gu Yuanwu, the many elders in the Celestial Palace, and even the Void Emperor in the forbidden area all cast their attentive gazes.</p><p></p><p>"Poor child." The Void Emperor shook his head and sighed softly.</p><p></p><p>His cultivation had long reached the extreme realm, and he could be called a Divine Emperor among emperors, much stronger than ordinary emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor had once transcended time and space under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree to discuss the Dao with Emperor Lei Yuan, Ancient Emperor Tai Yi, and Heng Yu Dao Zun. He knew it was possible to communicate across time and space.</p><p></p><p>But he could only do it after reaching the Divine Emperor realm. Huang Weiyang had only reached the peak of the Emperor realm, so how could she do it?</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Heavens Phoenix is truly peerless in her beauty."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the peerless figure under the tree, Gu Dao couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Phoenix was a woman wearing a nine-colored splendid robe. Her face was unclear, but she was definitely of unparalleled beauty, with a graceful and full figure, and a slender and outstanding stature.</p><p></p><p>Her supreme imperial weapon was that nine-colored splendid robe, called the Phoenix Dao Robe. It was a rare defensive imperial weapon, enveloped in endless Dao principles, as if it could suppress time and space.</p><p></p><p>Countless order runes intertwined, and endless Dao principles gathered, forming a river above her head, full of vigorous vitality, like the river of life, mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>She stood under the tree, contemplating the Dao, and then got up and walked step by step into the void, as if to go against the flow of the river of time and return to the era before the ancient times.</p><p></p><p>She had looked back many times, and the living beings contemplating the Dao under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree in later generations had caught her attention. Suddenly, the Nine Heavens Phoenix paused, withdrew from the river of time, and returned to the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>Then, using the profoundness of the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, she looked towards the later generations, her gaze seeming to be able to span across the ages and see the figure walking towards her.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Phoenix murmured to herself, and no one could hear what she was saying, but Gu Dao discovered that her face was filled with a mixture of sorrow and joy, and he instantly understood her state of mind.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree was too profound or if the Nine Heavens Phoenix's strength was indeed terrifyingly strong, but in the ancient era, she actually sensed Huang Weiyang of this generation.</p><p></p><p>"Mother~"</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang had already walked up to the Nine Heavens Phoenix, her jade hand reaching out, but she did not touch the flawless soft hand extended by the Nine Heavens Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang kept calling out, kept trying to touch, wanting to throw herself into the Nine Heavens Phoenix's embrace, but she failed every time.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Phoenix was also communicating with Huang Weiyang and also wanted to</p><p></p><p>Holding Huang Weiyang's hand, he also wanted to hug this young daughter, but he failed as well.</p><p></p><p>A trace of sadness appeared on the flawless and beautiful face of the Nine Heavens Immortal Phoenix. Even though she had crossed countless ages to meet her daughter, they still could not communicate.</p><p></p><p>But she quickly put away her sadness. If they could not communicate, then so be it. The fact that she could see her daughter again meant that Huang Weiyang had successfully lived into the later generations and had already been born.</p><p></p><p>Two lines of clear tears hung on Huang Weiyang's exquisite face as she muttered to herself. A look of reluctance appeared on Gu Dao Yi's face.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings at the Sovereign Realm level, such as Tai Yi Ancient Emperor, Heng Yu Dao Zun, Lei Yuan God Emperor and others under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, also saw this scene and all sighed and shook their heads helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The countless members of the Gu family surrounding them saw this and showed sympathetic expressions one after another.</p><p></p><p>As the daughter of an emperor, Huang Weiyang possessed the strongest bloodline and physique, and had extremely high innate talent and comprehension. After being sealed in the Divine Source for millions of years, now that she had emerged, she could no longer exchange a single word with her birth mother. It was both pitiful and lamentable.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu~ Mother, I miss you so much......"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Weiyang looked like a seven or eight-year-old young girl. Her current appearance was that of a helpless, exquisite, and jade-like little loli.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi sighed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked towards the imprint of the Vast Space Emperor, who also looked back at him. He instantly understood Gu Dao Yi's intention. In the next moment, the Vast Space Emperor's voice resounded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, you want to lend Huang Weiyang a hand?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi nodded and said in his heart, "Weiyang is my follower. If I help her today, she will help me in the future."</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>Appreciation appeared in the Vast Space Emperor's eyes. "Then I will assist you."</p><p></p><p>His gaze crossed the void, glancing at Gu Dao Yi, then at Huang Weiyang. He felt the two were very well-matched and their identities were also quite suitable.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"No need to thank me. I'm only providing a little bit of power. It will mainly depend on you."</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi understands."</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's comprehension was unrivaled. With the Vast Space Emperor saying this, he immediately understood the meaning.</p><p></p><p>Although the Vast Space Emperor possessed invincible power, he was still unable to help Huang Weiyang communicate across time and space with the Nine Heavens Immortal Phoenix. This required Gu Dao Yi to temporarily create a method, pioneering a dharma that could help people communicate across the ages.</p><p></p><p>Then the Vast Space Emperor would use it. With his strength, as long as there was a corresponding method, it would be very easy to accomplish.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's gaze shifted from the Vast Space Emperor to the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree. He softly said, "Tree spirit, lend me a hand."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree trembled, and boundless radiance showered down, illuminating the heavens. The light all fell upon Gu Dao Yi. He closed his eyes and directly entered a state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates. Currently this is the sixth update.

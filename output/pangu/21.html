        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Time passed slowly, and a short while of about fifteen minutes went by.</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of countless people, Gu Dao Yi finally awoke from his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The technique he created had succeeded!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the face of the majestic and invincible figure was no longer blurry. Countless people suddenly discovered that the invincible powerhouse suppressing the Chaotic Sea had exactly the same appearance as the Divine Son.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss~ The Divine Son actually used himself as the source to create a world-shaking marvelous technique."</p><p></p><p>"In front of the Divine Son, we are just that dim firefly, while the Divine Son is the bright moon illuminating the heavens for all eternity, completely incomparable."</p><p></p><p>"Creating a world-shaking marvelous technique at the age of three is too shocking and unheard of!"</p><p></p><p>"Shaking the ancient and dazzling the present!"</p><p></p><p>"Today's event will surely be recorded in ancient history. We are fortunate to be witnesses and can also be passed down through the ages with it."</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Gu family were shocked to the point of numbness in their scalps, staring with wide eyes in disbelief, their hearts unable to calm the raging waves for a long time.</p><p></p><p>A person who has not yet cultivated, a mortal without any physique, a three-year-old child, actually evolved an invincible dao image and created an unparalleled invincible technique. If this spreads, no one would believe it.</p><p></p><p>This is a legend!</p><p></p><p>This is a myth!</p><p></p><p>Even the young Great Emperors could not compare to this!</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi stood in place, with countless runes jumping in his eyes, surrounded by boundless dao meaning. The noisy discussions around him were blocked by Huang Wei Yang and did not reach his ears.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" Huang Wei Yang's cold and beautiful, magnetic voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Very good."</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's mouth curled up as he continued to step forward. He wanted to take a stroll under the ancient tea tree of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, does the technique you created have a name?" Huang Wei Yang came over, full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi said without thinking, "Flowing Sand Between the Fingers."</p><p></p><p>Huang Wei Yang's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>This name was not domineering, but in connection with the dao image that had just dissipated, she felt a shock in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The flowing sand between the fingers, this sand could be one broken world after another, one broken universe after another. With countless flowing sand invading, the power was immeasurable. Who could resist it?</p><p></p><p>If this move was unleashed, it could be said to be invincible at the same realm, and could even kill powerful enemies across realms.</p><p></p><p>If an almighty being at the Emperor Realm used it, their combat power would also be greatly enhanced, and they would likely still be able to sweep invincibly.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, can I learn this supreme marvelous technique?" After hesitating for a moment, Huang Wei Yang still asked.</p><p></p><p>Huang Wei Yang felt that the invincible technique created by Gu Dao Yi might even surpass the supreme marvelous technique created by her mother.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that her mother was one of the Ten Fiends of the ancient times, an almighty being at the Emperor Realm, with extremely powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Fiends of the ancient times was a title given by later generations, listing the ten most powerful divine beasts of the ancient era. Originally known as the Ten Gods of the ancient times, more people referred to them as the Ten Fiends of the ancient times because of their fierce reputation.</p><p></p><p>Each of the Ten Fiends of the ancient times created a world-shaking marvelous technique, slaughtering the heavens, striding through eternity, unstoppable, killing across the myriad heavens and realms.</p><p></p><p>The following is the full English translation of the provided Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His guts trembled.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Fiendish Techniques of the Primordial Era were as famous as the Nine Character Secret Methods of the Divine Ancient Era, and were the supreme techniques that countless cultivators from myriad realms dreamed of.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang naturally learned the supreme technique created by the Nine Heavenly Phoenix, called the Phoenix Immortality Method, which possessed heaven-defying power.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, she had wandered around the Gu Family's Dao Concealment Hall and saw many supreme techniques, world-shaking divine powers, and invincible methods that spanned various eras, including some of the Nine Character Secret Methods and Ten Fiendish Techniques. However, few could compare to Gu Dao Yi's Finger Sand Technique.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid it might not work," Gu Dao Yi said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>A look of disappointment appeared on Huang Weiyang's beautiful face, but she couldn't help asking, "Why?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi spoke bluntly, "Your comprehension ability is somewhat lacking."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the serious Gu Dao Yi, Huang Weiyang felt the urge to spit blood. She was actively seeking to be put down.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Weiyang did not give up. With a dazzling smile on her face, she said, "My comprehension ability is lacking, but isn't that why I have you?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll teach you when we get back. If there's anything you don't understand, feel free to ask me," Gu Dao Yi replied without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Since this little phoenix Huang Weiyang wanted to get closer to him, Gu Dao Yi wouldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, the two arrived in front of the ancient Dao Comprehension Tea Tree. Gu Dao Yi stopped about four or five meters away from the trunk and stared intently at the space beneath the tree.</p><p></p><p>There were figures that seemed both illusory and real, as if they truly existed.</p><p></p><p>Each figure exuded an aura of unrivaled supremacy, transmitted across endless years, commanding sincere admiration.</p><p></p><p>They were Emperors!</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's eyes flashed, and he instantly realized that most of these were the Emperors that the Gu Family had produced since ancient times in the Desolate Era, as well as some Emperors who had close ties with the Gu Family, such as Huang Weiyang's mother, one of the Ten Fiends of the Primordial Era, the Nine Heavenly Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>These Emperor-level powerhouses had come to the Gu Family and comprehended the Dao under the ancient Dao Comprehension Tea Tree. The tree, with its profound mysteries, had imprinted the figures of these Emperors.</p><p></p><p>Under the tree, Gu Dao Yi saw the Void Emperor. His figure was hazy, and above his head was an ancient and simple bronze mirror, rising and falling, emanating chaotic energy, possessing the mighty power to suppress myriad realms and eras.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family had risen to prominence in the Desolate Era, and up to now, a total of five Emperor-level powerhouses had emerged. Four of them were imprinted here, with only the Emperor-level powerhouse from the Desolate Era Gu Family missing.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the four Emperors of the Desolate Era Gu Family and the Nine Heavenly Phoenix, there were imprints of three other Emperor-level powerhouses under the ancient Dao Comprehension Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today, there will still be ten updates. This is currently the fourth update, and the explosive updates will continue!</p><p></p><p>Please give flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

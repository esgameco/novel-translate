        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Gu Daoyi gently stroked Huang Weiyang's silky hair, allowing her to sob in his embrace.</p><p></p><p>Although his body was only three years old, Gu Daoyi's consciousness was not limited to this. He was very clear about certain things and did not want to refuse.</p><p></p><p>In this life, he wanted to live according to his own heart.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, crybaby, stop crying. There are so many people watching. Go and talk to your mother."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's tone was very gentle. He had already told the Void Emperor about the auxiliary method he had realized, and the Void Emperor would soon learn and prepare to use it.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm~" Huang Weiyang nodded obediently.</p><p></p><p>After Gu Daoyi wiped away her tears, she immediately rushed back to the ancient tea tree of enlightenment, but she felt a little strange in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was only three years old, while she was already one hundred and twenty-two. However, their behavior just now had been reversed.</p><p></p><p>She behaved like a child, while Gu Daoyi seemed like an adult, carefully comforting her and helping her solve a huge problem.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang didn't ask Gu Daoyi what this method was. She didn't need to know, as it would be useless for her to cultivate it with her current strength.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi told her to go and communicate with her mother, so he must have arranged everything. This gave her a sense of reassurance.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, when she returned to her mother's side, the Void Emperor's words were transmitted to her heart. Huang Weiyang quickly followed the instructions and was surprised to find that she could really communicate with her mother now.</p><p></p><p>She could hear the words of the Nine Heavenly Phoenix, and her mother's words could also be transmitted across time and space to the present. Huang Weiyang's beautiful face was full of joy, and she felt very moved in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Even the Nine Heavenly Phoenix cast a kind glance at Gu Daoyi, with a hint of growing satisfaction as if looking at a son-in-law. This made Gu Daoyi a little uncomfortable, but his expression did not change at all.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor isolated the conversation between Huang Weiyang and the Nine Heavenly Phoenix, giving them a private space.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi knew that Huang Weiyang and the Nine Heavenly Phoenix were both very happy at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Gu family members also watched this scene, and they had more recognition for the young lord Gu Daoyi in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang was the young lord's close companion. Whenever she had difficulties, the young lord would lend a helping hand and arrange everything properly, showing great maturity and steadiness.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was the divine son of the Gu family, and they were the younger generation of the Gu family. If they had difficulties, the young lord would probably also extend a helping hand within a reasonable scope.</p><p></p><p>Influential figures with human touch often gain more recognition, while those who are aloof and look down on everything will be alienated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's gaze swept over the surrounding Gu family members, nodding at them. He also noticed Gu Qingyao in the crowd and looked at her for an extra moment.</p><p></p><p>All the Gu family members lowered their heads respectfully, including Gu Qingyao, but she had richer inner thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"The young lord pays more attention to me. He must also hope that I can follow him. I have to work harder and break free from my shackles as soon as possible, so that I..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi naturally didn't know what Gu Qingyao was thinking. At this moment, he had already walked to the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree and sat down cross-legged. The ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree swayed, scattering boundless divine light and endless Dao principles, making Gu Daoyi appear even more transcendent and sacred.</p><p></p><p>The branded bodies of Thunder Abyss God Emperor, Taiyi Ancient Emperor, Yuhua Ancient Emperor, Hengyu Dao Venerable, Chiyan Dao Venerable, Xuan Emperor, and Void Great Emperor all gathered around and sat cross-legged around him.</p><p></p><p>Seven emperors guarding!</p><p></p><p>This scene made countless Gu family disciples' blood boil with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, who could make seven Dao Realm supreme powerhouses willingly accompany them as subordinate roles?</p><p></p><p>Only their Gu family's Divine Son, Gu Daoyi!</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, at this moment, the Divine Son still hadn't cultivated and had no cultivation base, yet he gained the respect of seven Dao Realm supreme powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>This was a scene worthy of being recorded in ancient history. Countless Gu family descendants didn't even blink, afraid of missing any single sentence or movement and regretting it for life.</p><p></p><p>Judging from this lineup, it seemed like the Divine Son was going to discuss and exchange insights with the seven great emperors. The content of the discussion might be profound and abstruse, deep and mysterious, but as long as they could understand the gist, they would benefit for life. If they could comprehend more, they would definitely have great achievements in the future.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the ages, such an epoch-making discussion between seven emperors had never occurred, and the protagonist of the discussion was actually a three-year-old child without any cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But no one felt it was inappropriate. Even the seven Dao Realm supreme powerhouses felt it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Daoyi's comprehension was heaven-defying!</p><p></p><p>Everything that happened today was a divine halo suspended behind Gu Daoyi's head, enough to make him shine through the ages and gain the heartfelt recognition of the seven Dao Realm supreme powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu, who was originally hidden in the void, landed silently. He naturally didn't want to miss such an earth-shattering scene, and he couldn't miss it either.</p><p></p><p>With the Divine Son discussing insights with the Dao Realm supreme powerhouses, he also couldn't hide in the void and peek. That would be extremely disrespectful.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Yuanwu's identity and status, if he usually appeared in such a crowded place, he would definitely attract everyone's attention and directly steal all the focus.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, none of the people present even looked at him. They all stared unblinkingly at the area under the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree, even ignoring the Nine Heavenly Phoenix and Huang Weiyao mother and daughter.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Gu Yuanwu secretly clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his divine sense discovered that many Gu family patriarchs, grand elders, and elders had also quietly arrived. They nodded at him, and no one said a word.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu also discovered that several old ancestors who were in secluded cultivation in blessed lands across the Divine Continent had quietly ended their seclusion and came to the ancient Enlightenment Land, even standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>Everyone subconsciously held their breath and focused their minds, looking at this scene with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the first update, continuing the explosive releases!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards! Your support is my motivation to release explosively!</p><p></p><p>Please, dear family members, support me. This little author is kneeling in thanks here!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After sorting out his comprehension of the Great Dao, Gu Dao Yi discovered that the supreme beings at the Emperor Realm like Vast Space Emperor, Nine Heavens Phoenix, Eternal Universe Reverend, and Thunder Abyss God Emperor had all awakened, some with smiling faces and some staring at him with burning eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, can we start the Dao Debate now?" </p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, Dao Yi, you're going to debate with the eight of us. Are you ready?"</p><p></p><p>"If you can't hold up, you have to say it."</p><p></p><p>"We few will not hold back. We will go all out to let you know how formidable we are."</p><p></p><p>"........"</p><p></p><p>The God Emperors, Ancient Emperors, Dao Reverends, and Great Emperors spoke one after another in a very relaxed tone.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Dao Yi had suppressed them earlier in his Dao Lecture, the eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm did not mind. Lecturing the Dao and Debating the Dao were different.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi was only three years old. His insights and experiences were his biggest shortcomings. Without accumulating sufficient foundation, how could he surpass them in the Dao Debate? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had also gained greatly just now, taking their comprehension of their respective Great Daos to the next level. With the eight of them joining hands, it was impossible for Gu Dao Yi to win the Dao Debate.</p><p></p><p>"Begin." </p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi nodded slightly, his expression as calm as still water, as if he did not feel the slightest pressure and regarded the eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm as nothing.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use this Dao Debate to continue enriching his foundation, enhancing his accumulation, and perfecting the embryonic form of his Dao. He believed this Dao Debate could promote his further advancement.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings like Tai Yi Ancient Emperor, Feather Transformation Ancient Emperor, Nine Heavens Phoenix let Gu Dao Yi speak first. Gu Dao Yi did not decline either.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao that can be spoken is not the eternal Dao. The name that can be named is not the eternal name. Nothingness is the beginning of heaven and earth; Existence is the mother of all things. Therefore, always be without desires in order to observe its mysteries; Always have desires in order to observe its manifestations. These two emerge together but have different names. Together they are called profound. Profound and again profound, the gateway to myriad wonders......"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Dao Yi opened his mouth, it was the Dao De Jing. In his previous life, he liked to study these texts and had some insights. In this life, his comprehension was heaven-defying. He often pondered over it, and also comprehended the Ten Emperor Scriptures and various Emperor Realm Great Daos, so he had thoroughly understood the Dao De Jing.</p><p></p><p>It has to be said that this is a profound and unfathomable scripture that directly points to the essence of the Great Dao. In just five thousand characters, it analyzes the essence of the Great Dao, which is too remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!" </p><p></p><p>The eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm like Vast Space Emperor, Nine Heavens Phoenix, Thunder Abyss God Emperor, and Profound Emperor were dumbfounded upon hearing it, and couldn't help gasping in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Can such incisive and profound words really be spoken by a three-year-old child?</p><p></p><p>Although they had long known that Gu Dao Yi's comprehension was heaven-defying and had witnessed it many times, they were still shocked this time, even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>The words expounded by Gu Dao Yi could be called the ultimate truth of the Great Dao, directly pointing to the essence of the Great Dao. Just understanding the superficial meaning could allow one to easily cultivate to the Quasi-Emperor Realm. With a little insight, one could attain the Dao and become an Emperor.</p><p></p><p>If one had more insights, it was very likely to ascend to immortality on the spot.</p><p></p><p>This was</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It was the Tao Te Ching that gave them the feeling, bringing them endless shock.</p><p></p><p>Compared to their own understanding of the Great Dao, it was many times more profound and unfathomable. It was indeed an unparalleled prodigy with heaven-defying comprehension. At only three years old, he was actually able to speak such extremely abstruse Dao language.</p><p></p><p>This thought was only fleeting. They quickly entered into comprehension, seizing every second to understand, unwilling to miss a single sentence or a single word.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Dao Yi finished speaking, the eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm looked at each other and suddenly found that they didn't know where to begin.</p><p></p><p>Discussing the Dao, discussing the Dao, how could they discuss the Dao now?</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's words directly pointed to the essence of the Great Dao. They admitted defeat and sincerely submitted. There was simply nothing good to discuss.</p><p></p><p>In this discussion of the Dao, they had already lost.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor sighed. The Thunder Abyss God Emperor, the Taiyi Ancient Emperor, the Hengyu Dao Venerable and other Emperor Realm experts had mixed feelings of joy and sorrow. The Nine Heavens Phoenix's beautiful eyes flashed with a strange light, and Huang Weiyao's beautiful eyes shone.</p><p></p><p>If there weren't so many people here, she would have wanted to directly pounce into Gu Dao Yi's arms and praise how amazing he was.</p><p></p><p>Although they had already admitted defeat in their hearts, the eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm still did not give up. They couldn't possibly surrender without saying a word. That would be too embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm spoke one after another, discussing the Dao with Gu Dao Yi. The eight Emperor Realms simultaneously targeted Gu Dao Yi alone, but they were always at a disadvantage, suppressed by Gu Dao Yi.</p><p></p><p>This left the countless Gu family cultivators observing from afar dumbfounded, their eyeballs nearly falling to the ground. They suspected that they had seen wrong.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Son actually suppressed eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm while discussing the Dao!</p><p></p><p>One Dao suppressing eight Daos!</p><p></p><p>One person suppressing eight Emperors!</p><p></p><p>What a magnificent feat, what an unparalleled achievement!</p><p></p><p>It could absolutely be called earth-shattering and historically brilliant!</p><p></p><p>"This child has my style from back then."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the scene under the tree that shook the ages, the Third Ancestor Gu Changge said with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, Third Elder. It's fine to boast in private, but what are you pretending for here?"</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Ancestor Gu Yuanwu bluntly exposed his old habit. This Third Elder Ancestor had a hobby, and that was to show off and brag.</p><p></p><p>Gu Changge rolled his eyes, but didn't refute.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Son is really too amazing, simply the supreme deity in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao looked at that unrivaled immortal figure with shining eyes, full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>She decided that tomorrow she would go to the Imperial Dao Palace on the Celestial Immortal Island to report and let the Divine Son accept her as a follower.</p><p></p><p>Today, after listening to the Dao, she had realized many things. The original flaws in her cultivation technique had been made up and perfected by her. Her physical strength had even broken through the threshold of 10 million jin without her knowing it.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Qingyao hadn't deliberately suppressed it, she would have already advanced to the Divine Ability Realm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, rating tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>But now everything is different.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Dao Yi present, barring any unforeseen circumstances, the Void Emperor will certainly be able to live out his third lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Even the accumulated dao injuries within his body will be repaired. After Gu Tai Chu and Gu Dao Yi attain the Dao, the Void Emperor will be able to live out his fourth lifetime by himself.</p><p></p><p>The several ancient emperors chatted animatedly, with Gu Dao Yi only occasionally interjecting a few words.</p><p></p><p>Only after the casual conversation ended did they begin to formally discuss the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Starting with the Void Emperor, he expounded his imperial scripture, the "Void Scripture", and his Great Dao of the Void;</p><p></p><p>"The Great Dao becomes emptiness, the ancestor of all things, blending with the light, eternally existing......"</p><p></p><p>Next was the Xuan Emperor. This demon race emperor cultivated the Dao of the Saber, with the imperial weapon being the Xuan Tian Saber and the imperial scripture being the "Xuan Tian Scripture";</p><p></p><p>After that were the Heng Yu Dao Venerable and Chi Yan Dao Venerable from the ancient era, followed by the Tai Yi Ancient Emperor and Yu Hua Ancient Emperor from the distant ancient era, and then the Lei Yuan Divine Emperor from the primordial era.</p><p></p><p>The seven emperors each had their own specialties in the Great Dao, having nearly or already reached the pinnacle in their respective domains, with an extremely thorough understanding of the corresponding Great Dao. When discussing the Dao, every word was a gem and every sentence was brilliant.</p><p></p><p>Those with poor comprehension would find it incomprehensible, not understanding a thing; those with average comprehension could grasp the superficial aspects after the profound words entered their bodies; those with good comprehension could understand a small portion;</p><p></p><p>Even those with extremely good comprehension, such as the most outstanding individuals of the younger generation, the various Grand Elders, Clan Elders, and Patriarchs of the Gu family, could only comprehend a portion, and it was very strenuous, requiring them to concentrate all their energy to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Even so, they listened with rapture, deeply immersed, and all their previous confusions were suddenly cleared up at this moment. Some cultivators who had been stuck at bottlenecks broke through their realms on the spot or comprehended divine abilities and marvelous techniques to an even more profound level.</p><p></p><p>Compared to those cultivators who were sweating like rain, frowning, and looking exhausted, Gu Dao Yi's expression was calm, his entire being relaxed and at ease, even somewhat carefree.</p><p></p><p>No matter how profound and abstruse the Great Dao expounded by the emperor-level powerhouses was, it could not stump Gu Dao Yi. He did not even need to furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>When the emperor-level powerhouses spoke about the Dao, Gu Dao Yi had already comprehended it, and even directly deduced and pondered it to a deeper level.</p><p></p><p>In front of Gu Dao Yi, whose comprehension defied the heavens, these were all elementary!</p><p></p><p>For Gu Dao Yi, independently comprehending imperial scriptures, supreme marvelous techniques, and independently understanding the Dao to create techniques was still quite consuming of mental energy, but it was completely different at this moment.</p><p></p><p>These emperor-level powerhouses discussed the Dao with the intention of spreading their own Great Dao. The Great Dao was profound and abstruse, so after comprehending it, they expressed it in their own understanding, which was much easier than directly comprehending the Great Dao. Of course, completely accepting it could also lead to misunderstandings about the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>When they spoke, Gu Dao Yi listened, directly comprehending the marvelous Dao they described, equivalent to them "spoon-feeding" him.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Dao Yi's view, there was no difficulty at all.</p><p></p><p>The seven emperor-level powerhouses were like seven imperial scriptures. Gu Dao Yi discovered that the Gu family possessed all these scriptures, but he had not had time to comprehend them yet, only comprehending a portion of the Void Scripture through the Small Void Scripture he had created.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he had an extremely profound understanding of the seven emperor scriptures, including the Void Scripture, the Mysterious Heaven Scripture, and the Thunder Abyss Divine Dao Scripture. It was no exaggeration to say that he had basically comprehended them all.</p><p></p><p>If he were to comprehend an emperor scripture alone, it would take him two or three days to fully understand it. However, with someone's guidance, the speed of comprehension would be much faster. If the one guiding him was the creator of the technique, the speed of comprehension would increase even more dramatically.</p><p></p><p>After listening to the teachings of the seven supreme beings at the emperor realm, Gu Dao Yi had also comprehended the seven emperor scriptures and gained a deep understanding of the seven great Daos they cultivated, reaching a very high level of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's mind was filled with endless Dao wonders, and his soul was illuminated with countless insights. He felt that he could enter a state of enlightenment at any time and use it to create powerful and supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Dao Yi suppressed this urge. It was not appropriate to seek enlightenment during a discussion of the Dao, and he also did not want to create new techniques for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Today's continuous enlightenment and creation of techniques had consumed a considerable amount of Gu Dao Yi's energy, and his accumulated foundation had also been depleted. Although he had replenished it and even made his foundation more abundant, he wanted to take a break.</p><p></p><p>Once he had comprehended all the emperor scriptures of the Gu family, he would then seek enlightenment and create techniques. With a solid foundation, he would be able to create even more powerful techniques.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would not only create the immortality technique for the Void Emperor but also his physique.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi wanted to create his physique all at once and then forge an invincible physique. During this discussion of the Dao, he already had some ideas in his mind and had constructed the embryonic form of his physique.</p><p></p><p>Each supreme being at the emperor realm would carefully observe Gu Dao Yi after their teaching, wanting to see the extent of his comprehension. They did not listen to each other's teachings because they had already been very familiar with each other's Daos for countless years.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Dao Yi always at ease and with a calm expression, they were extremely shocked in their hearts. However, thinking of Gu Dao Yi's heaven-defying comprehension ability, they felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>If they personally taught him and Gu Dao Yi still could not quickly comprehend, then his comprehension ability would not be heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>When the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor had also finished his teaching, he looked at Gu Dao Yi and said with a smile, "Dao Yi, we have all finished our teachings. Why don't you share your thoughts as well?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Gu Dao Yi did not decline.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi has gained some insights after listening to the teachings of the ancient emperors, so I will share my understanding with you all."</p><p></p><p>With those words, Gu Dao Yi began his teaching.</p><p></p><p>He first spoke about the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor's Thunder Dao. The Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor listened with a smile on his face, looking relaxed at first, but gradually became solemn and finally turned serious.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Dao that Gu Dao Yi described was derived from his Thunder Dao, but there were some differences, and these differences were the key to the Thunder Dao.</p><p></p><p>After listening to Gu Dao Yi's teaching, the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor was so shocked that he fell silent. He discovered that the Dao he had realized actually had some biases and had lost its essence, no wonder his strength had been unable to progress further.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the third update, continuing the explosive updates!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>In just nine days, he had comprehended the four imperial-level techniques - the Fuxi Yandao Scripture, the Fuxi Zhandao Sword Formula, the Zhendao Fist, and the Yudao Seal. This was a bit faster than Gu Daoyi had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>He had originally estimated that it would take nearly ten days to fully comprehend them. This was all thanks to the Fuxi Yandao Scripture. </p><p></p><p>No wonder the Fuxi Yandao Scripture was ranked second in difficulty, yet placed at the very top. As long as one comprehended the Fuxi Yandao Scripture, comprehending the remaining three techniques would be much faster.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi only spent three days on the Fuxi Zhantian Sword Formula and the Zhendao Fist combined. The remaining three days were all used to comprehend the Yudao Seal.</p><p></p><p>It must be said, the Yudao Seal was indeed the supreme marvel created by Emperor Fuxi before his death, truly powerful to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Daoyi stood up, ready to leave the Fuxi Space, he found that Emperor Fuxi's remnant will had appeared again, looking at him with shock on his face and a dazed look in his eyes. </p><p></p><p>Emperor Fuxi wanted to speak but stopped.</p><p></p><p>The four techniques he left behind were all extremely powerful. Even a peerless genius with the potential of an emperor could at most comprehend one technique in ten days' time.</p><p></p><p>If it was an unparalleled prodigy with stunning talent, it might be possible to comprehend two techniques in a short ten days, but two at most, definitely not more.</p><p></p><p>But this young man in front of him... no, this child, only three years old, had actually comprehended all of his life's work in just nine days.</p><p></p><p>This comprehension ability was simply heaven-defying!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fuxi even suspected that this child's comprehension surpassed ancient and modern times. He had never heard of a living being with such monstrous talent.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, is there anything else?" Gu Daoyi asked.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fuxi was silent for a moment before saying, "If you have the chance, you can go to the Immortal Ruins. There is a Primordial Supreme Eight Trigrams Furnace inside, which may present an opportunity for you."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's eyes flashed as he agreed.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Ruins were in the East Realm, a forbidden zone of life, with supreme beings at the Emperor Realm slumbering inside. It was extremely dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The greater the risk, the greater the opportunity. </p><p></p><p>Since Emperor Fuxi said that the Primordial Supreme Eight Trigrams Furnace in the Immortal Ruins was his opportunity, then this opportunity must be very significant.</p><p></p><p>He had no plans to go now. When he had sufficient strength, he would naturally visit the Immortal Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Daoyi bowed in thanks to Emperor Fuxi and then left the Fuxi Space.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the empty Fuxi Space, a hint of curiosity arose in Emperor Fuxi's eyes, wondering what the current state of the Xuanhuang World was like to produce such an unparalleled prodigy with heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Soon a smile appeared on Emperor Fuxi's face. Gu Daoyi had comprehended all four of his techniques, making him his successor of sorts. His name would once again shake the heavens.</p><p></p><p>.........</p><p></p><p>At the Dao Comprehension Ancient Land, in front of the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi sat cross-legged here, surrounded by myriad Dao phenomena reflecting heaven and earth, causing all the Gu family descendants in the Dao Comprehension Ancient Land to be shocked, and the many Gu family elders observing from afar were also incredibly astonished. </p><p></p><p>Even the Void Emperor was alarmed, watching all this from the forbidden area, a look of shock appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"An Immortal King descends upon the Nine Heavens!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Diagram of Primordial Dao Evolution!"</p><p></p><p>"All Daos converge into one!"</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor uttered thirteen Dao phenomena in succession, his eyes filled with increasing astonishment and his heart surging with shock.</p><p></p><p>Dao phenomena, the manifestations of the Great Dao, surpass strange phenomena and marvelous scenes. A heavenly genius would find it difficult to reflect even one Dao phenomenon in their entire life. Only peerless heavenly geniuses could reflect one Dao phenomenon, with a chance to reflect two or three.</p><p></p><p>But what about Gu Dao Yi?</p><p></p><p>He actually reflected thirteen Dao phenomena, each one being the most top-grade. It was truly world-shaking and unorthodox.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi's talent is stunning throughout ancient and modern times, and his comprehension surpasses all ages," the Void Emperor muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought he had seen the limit of Gu Dao Yi's comprehension, but it turned out that Gu Dao Yi's comprehension had no limits at all.</p><p></p><p>Peerless heavenly geniuses, after embarking on the path of cultivation, would evolve many strange phenomena and marvelous scenes before being able to break through the fog and evolve Dao phenomena. However, Gu Dao Yi, without even cultivating, directly evolved and reflected thirteen of the most top-grade Dao phenomena.</p><p></p><p>Such comprehension and talent made even him, the Void Emperor, feel inferior and ashamed in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Although there had been many great emperors and celestial monarchs throughout the myriad ages, the Void Emperor felt that the comprehension and talent of those supreme beings at the Emperor Realm still paled in comparison to Gu Dao Yi.</p><p></p><p>This was a golden era, as well as an era of great contention. Gu Dao Yi was born in response to the times. Although he lacked a powerful physique, he possessed heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Their ancient Gu family had produced an existence with limitless potential who would become the celestial emperor ruling over the myriad realms in the future, becoming an immortal who would live forever and overlook the cycles of time.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi comprehended the ancient stele of Fuxi and evolved thirteen top-grade Dao phenomena. It seems he has emptied out Fuxi the Great's legacy. I wonder what good things he obtained," the Void Emperor quickly calmed his emotions and thought with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Having a junior with heaven-defying comprehension within the family was truly exhilarating!</p><p></p><p>Just by giving Gu Dao Yi some time, the family's foundation would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>For example, this time, Gu Dao Yi obtained the legacy of Fuxi the Great, meaning that the ancient Gu family also gained Fuxi the Great's legacy. With each additional legacy from a great emperor, the Gu family's foundation would rise significantly, and the probability of cultivating supreme beings at the Emperor Realm would increase.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Fuxi the Great was a great emperor with a formidable reputation. His emperor scripture, the "Fuxi Dao Evolution Scripture," and the "Four Moves of Suppressing the Dao" were renowned throughout the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Although the ancient Gu family was powerful, they did not possess Fuxi the Great's legacy and had only obtained one supreme technique, the "Dao Severing Palm," which was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>"Yuan Wu, go to the Ancient Land of Dao Comprehension," the Void Emperor withdrew his gaze and transmitted a message through the void, giving a few instructions.</p><p></p><p>On another void divine island above the Divine Continent, Gu Yuan Wu walked out of the Imperial Dao Palace with a smile on his lips, taking steps towards the Ancient Land of Dao Comprehension.</p><p></p><p>PS: Is anyone reading this? It seems writing original xuanhuan novels on Feilu is indeed a dead end.</p><p></p><p>If there are no readers despite ten updates every day, this little author can only leave.</p><p></p><p>Please support me, dear readers. This little author is kowtowing in gratitude!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"The void is like an abyss, the source of the great Dao. At the beginning of heaven and earth, all things become empty..."</p><p></p><p>As Gu Daoyi began to speak, he expounded on the Dao of the Void, which was his unique understanding, already touching upon the deepest levels of the Dao of the Void.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor's eyes lit up. Gu Daoyi understood his intentions. As soon as he opened his mouth, he spoke the essence of the Dao of the Void, directly pointing out the differences from his own understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful! Wonderful! Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>"So it can be like this too!"</p><p></p><p>"The void is like an abyss, the void is like a measure, the void is like a whisker, the void is like stillness... This is the true essence of the Dao of the Void."</p><p></p><p>As Gu Daoyi continued to expound the Dao, the Void Emperor couldn't help but applaud in admiration, his eyes shining brightly, as if two voids were spinning, constantly comprehending, constantly deducing.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor controlled the endless void and had an extremely deep understanding of the Dao of the Void, having reached the peak of the human realm. His combat power had also reached the level of a Divine Emperor.</p><p></p><p>With his discerning eye, he could easily distinguish the truth, falsehood, and difficulty of the Dao of the Void expounded by Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit that his "grandson" was indeed extraordinary. His attainments in the Dao of the Void had already surpassed his own, comprehending the Dao of the Void to a new height.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Dao of the Void, but Gu Daoyi had also comprehended the Dao of the Supreme One, the Dao of Feather Transformation, the Dao of Thunder, and other seven Daos to a new height.</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended it!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the Void Emperor spoke no more and closed his eyes, entering a state of deep comprehension.</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that if he could fully digest the essence of the Dao of the Void expounded by Gu Daoyi, his combat power would further improve. Even if he couldn't transform into a War Immortal, he would not be far from it, truly able to sweep through the world and be invincible in all realms.</p><p></p><p>"...The Dao is infinitely empty."</p><p></p><p>When the last sentence was spoken, Gu Daoyi looked at the seven supreme beings of the imperial realm around him and found that they were all still comprehending the Daos he had just expounded.</p><p></p><p>A calm smile appeared on Gu Daoyi's face.</p><p></p><p>Expounding the seven Daos was equivalent to sorting out his own insights, which allowed Gu Daoyi's understanding of these seven Daos to be integrated and reach a new height.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi looked further away and found that all the Gu family elders had come, as well as a few old ancestors whom he had only met a handful of times. These important figures of the Gu family and the younger generations of the Gu family were all immersed in comprehension, their brows sometimes relaxed and sometimes furrowed, their expressions sometimes joyful and sometimes troubled.</p><p></p><p>He nodded inwardly. After this round of expounding the Dao, from the younger generation to the high-level figures of the Gu family in the Desolate Ancient times, they would all gain a lot, enhancing their strength and foundation, and making the foundation of the Gu family in the Desolate Ancient times even more profound.</p><p></p><p>After scanning the surroundings, Gu Daoyi's gaze returned to the supreme beings of the imperial realm such as the Void Emperor, the Ancient Emperor of the Supreme One, and the Divine Emperor of the Thunder Abyss, the corners of his mouth slightly raised.</p><p></p><p>These supreme beings of the imperial realm had reached a bottleneck in their comprehension of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>After listening to his sermon this time, it will surely break the shackles and enter a higher stage. </p><p></p><p>Except for the Void Emperor, the strength of the other emperors will not improve, after all they are just an imprint.</p><p></p><p>However, their understanding of the Great Dao cannot be faked. This time they are likely to create many new supreme techniques.</p><p></p><p>This is what Gu Daoyi is looking forward to.</p><p></p><p>When they create it, Gu Daoyi is ready to "rely on the old", these ancient emperors can "rely on the young", and he can also rely on the old, saving him a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he only needs to take a casual look to comprehend, directly transform it into his own foundation accumulation, so that he is one step closer to his goal.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Huang Weiyang's cold, gentle and beautiful magnetic voice came.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's eyes flashed, feeling a little strange. Huang Weiyang is now a loli body, but she has a royal sister's voice, and her heart can be both loli and royal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi looked over and found that the Nine Heavenly Phoenix and Huang Weiyang came side by side across the ages, two peerless beauties, one big and one small, with an unparalleled temperament, and a mother and daughter with almost the same appearance.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's heart sea fluctuated for a moment, and then calmed down in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Weiyang."</p><p></p><p>"Senior."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the two peerless beauties who came together, Gu Daoyi responded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll call you Daoyi too."</p><p></p><p>Dressed in a nine-colored magnificent robe, the Nine Heavenly Phoenix came to the front, carefully looked at this unparalleled exiled immortal, and then said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang stood beside the Nine Heavenly Phoenix without speaking, her eyes always on Gu Daoyi, as if there was only him in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, you have communicated with Void, Lei Yuan, Taiyi, Hengyu and others, but you haven't communicated with me yet. Let's have a deep exchange and discuss the depth of the Great Dao."</p><p></p><p>A peerlessly beautiful smile appeared on the face of the Nine Heavenly Phoenix, and a strange color flashed in the depths of her beautiful eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's eyes moved slightly, the second half of what the Nine Heavenly Phoenix said sounded a bit strange?</p><p></p><p>I hope he's overthinking it.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please~" Gu Daoyi's tone was calm, with a hint of respect.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavenly Phoenix did not hesitate at all, and immediately sat down cross-legged, facing Gu Daoyi, her phoenix lips parted slightly, and the mysterious Dao sound resounded between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang hurriedly sat down, pretending to sit upright, only her eyes would occasionally shift to Gu Daoyi's body from time to time.</p><p></p><p>Listening to the Dao of the Nine Heavenly Phoenix, Gu Daoyi's expression was calm and peaceful, and pictures appeared in his mind, with the phoenix flapping its wings and striking across the long sky, the phoenix being reborn in the fire of nirvana, the phoenix killing all over the world, and sweeping away all enemies...</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

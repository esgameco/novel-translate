        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Under the ancient tea tree of enlightenment,</p><p></p><p>"Today's discussion on the Dao is over. Dao Yi should also take his leave," Gu Daoyi stood up and looked at the eight Emperors around him, bowing in salute.</p><p></p><p>The eight supreme Emperors, including Thunder Abyss God Emperor, Taiyi Ancient Emperor, Hengyu Dao Venerable, and Void Emperor, also stood up and returned the salute one by one.</p><p></p><p>"In today's discussion on the Dao, we have gained much, benefited greatly, and had profound insights. We have new comprehensions of the Great Dao and may very well create new supreme wondrous techniques."</p><p></p><p>"If successful, we will pass them to Void to deliver to you. We still hope Dao Yi will help us refine and perfect them."</p><p></p><p>Thunder Abyss God Emperor spoke solemnly, and the other supreme Emperors all nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will await your good news. When the time comes, Dao Yi will definitely give his all."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi immediately responded without the slightest hesitation. This was precisely his goal. </p><p></p><p>Having an elder at home is like having a treasure. Now his family had eight elders, so they had eight treasures to slowly nibble on.</p><p></p><p>Thunder Abyss God Emperor, Taiyi Ancient Emperor, Hengyu Dao Venerable, Xuan Emperor and the others all nodded as their figures gradually dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Nine Heavens Phoenix looked at her daughter Huang Weiyang, smiled and waved her hand, her peerlessly beautiful form also vanishing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang felt a bit sad, opening her mouth as if to speak but stopping herself.</p><p></p><p>Now that she had emerged into the world and was following Gu Daoyi, she would definitely be able to prove the Dao and become an Emperor in the future. She didn't need to worry about being unable to contact her mother Nine Heavens Phoenix again.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's voice rang out, bringing Huang Weiyang back to her senses. She hurriedly followed this man of her heart, matching his steps, never leaving his side.</p><p></p><p>The entire ancient land of enlightenment gathered countless Gu family cultivators, but at this moment it was completely silent as they respectfully bowed their heads to show respect for this Gu family divine son. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, their admiration for Gu Daoyi was the same as for the Void Emperor. Seeing Gu Daoyi was like seeing the Great Emperor!</p><p></p><p>After walking a few steps, Gu Daoyi suddenly stopped, turned to look at the ancient enlightenment tea tree, then looked at the one hundred and eight tea leaves and nine tea fruits, and spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Today, many thanks to the senior for the assistance. In the future, Dao Yi will definitely repay it."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was not a stingy and ungrateful person. Knowing that today's enlightenment discussion on the Dao had received the grace of the ancient enlightenment tea tree and formed a karmic connection, he would give recompense in the future to resolve this karma.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, this is for you."</p><p></p><p>An ancient, time-worn voice resounded in Gu Daoyi's mind.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a beam of Dao light flew out from the ancient enlightenment tea tree and merged into Gu Daoyi's body, making him feel refreshed in mind and body.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi expressed his gratitude again.</p><p></p><p>Although the ancient enlightenment tea tree didn't say what this was, Gu Daoyi's comprehension was extraordinary. He instantly analyzed the essence of this Dao light beam and understood everything.</p><p></p><p>This Dao light beam was an unparalleled treasure nurtured by the ancient enlightenment tea tree over countless years. It was a string of prayer beads formed from twenty-four Enlightenment Beads. The ancient enlightenment tea tree only had this one string of prayer beads, not a single extra Enlightenment Bead.</p><p></p><p>Each Enlightenment Bead took the ancient enlightenment tea tree over a million years to nurture. This string of Enlightenment Bead prayer beads cost the ancient enlightenment tea tree several thousand...</p><p></p><p>The Wudao Zi has been nurtured since the ancient times of the gods, spanning tens of thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>A single Wudao Zi can help one achieve enlightenment. A bracelet made of twenty-four Wudao Zi has more than half the effectiveness of the Wudao Ancient Tea Tree, which shows how precious it is.</p><p></p><p>If a Great Emperor were to see it, they would fight for it. This Wudao bracelet is of great use even to the most powerful beings at the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the Wudao Ancient Tea Tree gave it to Gu Daoyi, which surprised him and made him understand the Tea Tree's intentions.</p><p></p><p>This Wudao bracelet is indeed of great use to him. In the future, Gu Daoyi will no longer need to go to the ancient land of enlightenment. It's equivalent to carrying a miniature Wudao Ancient Tea Tree with him. Coupled with the Fuxi Yan Dao Scripture, his heaven-defying comprehension will burst forth with even more brilliant splendor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi felt a little regretful. If the Wudao Ancient Tea Tree could nurture for another one or two million years and form a Wudao bracelet with thirty-six Wudao Zi, its effectiveness would be no less than the Wudao Ancient Tea Tree itself.</p><p></p><p>But he also understood that the Wudao Ancient Tea Tree couldn't wait that long, because by then, Gu Daoyi would no longer need it.</p><p></p><p>It could only invest in advance and form a greater karmic connection with Gu Daoyi to receive greater returns in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Wudao Ancient Tea Tree has existed for countless years and has long become spiritually aware. It has been waiting for an opportunity to give away the Wudao bracelet. It didn't even give it to the Emperor Realm powerhouses it encountered in the past.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wudao Ancient Tea Tree didn't say it, Gu Daoyi knew what it wanted.</p><p></p><p>Transformation!</p><p></p><p>In this world, there are many immortal divine medicines, such as the True Dragon Immortal Medicine, the Qilin Immortal Medicine, the Phoenix Immortal Medicine, the Tribulation-Transcending Divine Lotus, the Bodhi Ancient Tree, the Creation Divine Vine, the Life Ancient Tree, the Nine Apertures Immortal Medicine, the Myriad Stars Divine Medicine, the Heavenly Fate Immortal Medicine, the Myriad Spirits Divine Tree, and so on, totaling seventy-two kinds.</p><p></p><p>These immortal medicines are born in response to the great Dao of heaven and earth, inherently containing great creation, but also great shackles.</p><p></p><p>They have long lifespans, even immortality, but little strength. When they encounter cultivators who want to capture them, they will try every means to escape.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Dao principles of heaven and earth restrain them, making it nearly impossible for them to transform.</p><p></p><p>Unable to transform and cultivate, they can only hide carefully. Once found, they will become divine medicines for Emperor Realm powerhouses to prolong their lives.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Realm experts rarely kill immortal medicines. They only need a part of the immortal medicine to live to the next life. Living immortal medicines are the most valuable.</p><p></p><p>But this is very painful for the immortal medicines because a part of their body is cut off each time.</p><p></p><p>Legend has it that there were once immortal medicines that broke free from their shackles, transformed into true living beings, and even attained the Dao and became emperors, but this is only a legend.</p><p></p><p>The Wudao Ancient Tea Tree wants to use Gu Daoyi's help to break its shackles. This is very difficult. Even a Divine Emperor like the Void Emperor cannot do it, but it believes Gu Daoyi can.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, rating tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

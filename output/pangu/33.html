        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Even the mother-daughter pair of Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress and Huang Weiyang, who were having a private conversation on the side, stopped their discussion at some unknown point. </p><p></p><p>They turned their heads to look at that exiled immortal-like figure, their flawless and extremely beautiful faces simultaneously revealing shock, their beautiful eyes also flashing with unusual brilliance.</p><p></p><p>As expected of a mother and daughter, they were practically carved from the same mold. Not only were their appearances almost identical, their expressions at this moment were also exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>The two peerless beauties, one tall and one short, standing there formed an absolutely stunning sight.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor had blocked the outside world from peeping at them, not even allowing sound to be transmitted out, but the voices from the debate could enter. Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress and Huang Weiyang were also able to see the debate under the tree.</p><p></p><p>"What an unrivaled demon, it's a pity he wasn't born in the ancient era, otherwise... Fortunately he was born into the Gu family, I can rest assured with my daughter following him."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the peerless exiled immortal under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress muttered to herself, glancing from time to time at her daughter Huang Weiyang, a smile appearing on her extremely beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi is really too amazing!" </p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang gazed dazedly at that figure, her eyes filled with unusual brilliance, infinitely magnifying him in her mind's ocean, making him appear incomparably lofty.</p><p></p><p>She had no doubt that Gu Daoyi could achieve the unparalleled feat of attaining the Dao within a hundred years, because he was Gu Daoyi with his heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang's gaze was completely on Gu Daoyi, not even noticing Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress looking at her.</p><p></p><p>Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress sighed, this child was really showing favoritism. The two hadn't even become Dao companions yet, but Huang Weiyang's eyes were already filled with only Gu Daoyi, forgetting even her own mother whom she hadn't seen for eons.</p><p></p><p>However, Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress felt this was a good thing. With Huang Weiyang following Gu Daoyi and her heartstrings tied to him, her status could barely be considered a match for him.</p><p></p><p>If that still wasn't enough, then she could just become one of Gu Daoyi's Dao companions.</p><p></p><p>A flash of shyness suddenly passed through Nine Heavens Phoenix Empress' eyes. Just now an extremely bold notion had surfaced in her mind, which she promptly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>She thought all of this was useless. She didn't even know if her true body had perished many tens of thousands of years ago, with the probability of still being alive less than one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>Under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree,</p><p></p><p>Countless shocked gazes converged, but Gu Daoyi seemed not to notice, sitting cross-legged in tranquility, his bearing transcendent like an immortal.</p><p></p><p>After the Void Emperor, Thunder Abyss God Emperor, Taiyi Ancient Emperor, Hengyu Dao Venerate and other Emperors and supreme experts recovered their senses, Gu Daoyi prepared to continue the debate.</p><p></p><p>It was called a debate, but actually only the first half had taken place.</p><p></p><p>In the first half, the seven Emperor realm supreme experts expounded their Daos, and after Gu Daoyi finished listening, he also expounded his Dao. Only then would the second half begin, with Gu Daoyi formally debating and exchanging Dao insights with the seven Emperor realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, please continue." Taiyi Ancient Emperor spoke.</p><p></p><p>Above his head was a immortal sword, it was the Taiyi Sword, cast from three types of immortal gold, bearing Taiyi Ancient Emperor's Dao.</p><p></p><p>Tai-</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The sword rose and fell, floating and sinking, emanating endless brilliance. The dazzling sword light seemed to want to tear through the ages and sever eternity.</p><p></p><p>Anyone who saw this immortal sword would involuntarily lower their head, because it was too sharp. Just one glance would leave an indelible mark in their mind.</p><p></p><p>If they were enemies, the Ancient Emperor Taiyi could activate the mark across space and time, mysteriously slaying the enemy.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Emperor, the Ancient Emperor Yuhua, the Venerable Lord of the Crimson Flame, and other supreme beings at the Emperor Realm all nodded. Next, Gu Daoyi should expound on their Dao. They were eager to see if their understanding of the Dao had any biases.</p><p></p><p>To be able to prove the Dao and become an emperor, they had unwavering faith in their own Dao. Otherwise, their Dao heart would waver and collapse, causing them to fall in realm.</p><p></p><p>But now they were just imprints and didn't need to worry about these things. Moreover, they had already witnessed Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension, surpassing the Thunder Abyss God Emperor in the Dao of Thunder and Lightning.</p><p></p><p>So the several ancient great emperors all wanted to broaden their horizons and see if they could catch a glimpse of a higher level of the Dao through Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Abyss God Emperor's eyes flashed, but he did not ask. He could contemplate those two difficult points on his own first. If it still didn't work, there would be many opportunities to inquire in the future. There was no need to delay the time for discussing the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi nodded slightly, his expression as calm as an ancient well, increasingly transcendent.</p><p></p><p>The eight of them sat under the tree, as if he was the one with unfathomably profound cultivation, and the others were all juniors who had come to listen to the Dao. But in fact, it was the exact opposite.</p><p></p><p>Next, Gu Daoyi expounded on the Great Dao of Taiyi of the Ancient Emperor Taiyi. Various wonders of the Dao emerged one after another. For a time, flowers fell from the sky, golden lotuses surged from the earth, immortal sounds rang out in succession, and auspicious lights illuminated the myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Emperor Taiyi, like the Thunder Abyss God Emperor, was at first relaxed and at ease, but gradually his expression became solemn, and even somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he was overjoyed. Gu Daoyi was indeed formidable. His insight into the Great Dao of Taiyi surpassed his own by quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the explanation of the Great Dao of Taiyi, Gu Daoyi glanced at the Ancient Emperor Taiyi, who was immersed in it, and then continued to explain the Dao of Feathered Transformation. The Ancient Emperor Yuhua also fell into deep listening to the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Then it was the Venerable Lord of Eternal Cosmos, the Venerable Lord of Crimson Flame, and the Mysterious Emperor. These three supreme beings at the Emperor Realm also successively fell into comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Gu Daoyi looked at the Void Emperor. The Void Emperor nodded slightly at him, very much looking forward to it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi had comprehended the Minor Void Scripture when he was born, and had also listened to the Void Emperor's discourse on the Dao. So to what step had his understanding of the Dao of the Void reached?</p><p></p><p>PS: Yesterday, my tenosynovitis flared up. This morning, both of my wrists and all ten fingers are sore and aching. From now on, I'll update five chapters a day. When I'm rested and recovered, I'll start releasing more chapters.</p><p></p><p>Please continue to give flowers, rating tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards! Your support is my motivation to release more chapters!</p><p></p><p>I implore you, dear readers, to support me. This little author is kowtowing in thanks here!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

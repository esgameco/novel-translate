        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the primordial world of Xuanhuang, </p><p></p><p>In the Eastern Wilderness, Northern Regions, and Divine Land,</p><p></p><p>Lies the ancestral land of the ancient Gu family.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family has been passed down from ancient times, through numerous eras and countless years, producing many great emperors. Even now, a great emperor still presides over the family.</p><p></p><p>Within the Divine Land, there are countless immortal mountains and divine islands, where spiritual herbs and divine medicines are abundant, and immortal birds and auspicious beasts soar. Myriad ancient exotic species roar, presenting a magnificent and prosperous scene.</p><p></p><p>Numerous powerful members of the Gu family ride ancient exotic mounts, patrolling the world. The mighty aura emanating from them is so powerful that even when they try their best to restrain it, the void still threatens to distort and shatter.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless gazes from the outside world are focused on the Gu family, secretly paying attention to the movements within. Each of them is a prominent figure who has shaken the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>This is because the Gu family is about to give birth to a "supreme prodigy".</p><p></p><p>The Gu family already has a great emperor presiding over them, and among the younger generation, there is Gu Taichu, the White-Robed Divine King who has the bearing of a great emperor and whose name resounds throughout Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>The "supreme prodigy" about to be born is the offspring of Gu Taichu, the current patriarch of the Gu family. The mother, Ji Mingyue, is the legitimate daughter of the ancient Ji family and possesses profound cultivation and a powerful physique.</p><p></p><p>The combination of two powerful physiques, along with the bloodlines of two ancient families, is destined to give the child an extraordinarily strong constitution upon birth.</p><p></p><p>The prominent figures from the outside world all want to know what kind of special physique Gu Taichu's offspring will possess. If it is too powerful, they will take action to eliminate the child.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, given time, with the Gu family having three emperors in one household, they will dominate the Xuanhuang world!</p><p></p><p>While undercurrents surge in the outside world, inside the Gu family's ancestral land in the Central Province, there is a sense of gloom and despair.</p><p></p><p>On the Gu family's Void Immortal Island, inside the Chengdao Palace, many Gu family elders are waiting for the "Gu Family Divine Son" to be born, but their faces are quite worried.</p><p></p><p>They suspect that Patriarch Gu Taichu's offspring may not possess a special physique.</p><p></p><p>This is because before the birth of a being with a special physique, there will be accompanying strange phenomena and wondrous scenes. The greater the number and scale of these occurrences, the stronger the physique.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there have been exceptions throughout history, but such examples can be counted on two hands.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family elders naturally hope that the Gu Family Divine Son is an exception. They have placed endless expectations on this child, determining his identity as the Gu Family Divine Son as soon as he was conceived.</p><p></p><p>If he is an exception and possesses the strongest physique, he may be able to fulfill the glorious tale of the Gu family having three emperors in one household in the future;</p><p></p><p>If he is not, it will shake Gu Taichu's prestige and convey an unfavorable message to the outside world that the Gu family has no successors!</p><p></p><p>The Gu family elders do not wish to see either of these outcomes. They fervently hope that the Gu Family Divine Son is an exception, allowing the Gu family to continue prospering for countless years to come.</p><p></p><p>"Wah~"</p><p></p><p>With a cry, the Gu Family Divine Son was finally born.</p><p></p><p>The many Gu family elders looked at the infant in swaddling clothes, their faces filled with disappointment. They stamped their feet and beat their chests, sighing and lamenting, "Oh vast heavens, how could you be so unkind to our Gu family..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"For my Gu family!"</p><p></p><p>The result they least wanted to see still appeared. </p><p></p><p>When the baby was born, there were no accompanying unusual signs. With their strength, they could see at a glance that this baby had no constitution, which made them extremely uncomfortable. They all went to find a place to drown their sorrows.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures from the outside world who were paying attention breathed a sigh of relief and also dispersed one after another. A scene of killing and gunpowder smoke dissipated into nothingness. </p><p></p><p>They were very shocked that the Gu family's divine son actually had no constitution, but also very pleasantly surprised. The heavens were on their side.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's emperor was already old and might not even be able to hold on until the White-Clothed Divine King Gu Taichu attained the Dao. Now that the Gu family's divine son was crippled, if something happened to Gu Taichu, then the glorious ancient Gu family would also decline.</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>On the Illusory Immortal Island,</p><p></p><p>After the baby was born, he did not cry again. His eyes were lively as he looked around, mixed with a hint of blankness. </p><p></p><p>"After nine years, I have finally been born."</p><p></p><p>The baby murmured in his heart. He was a transmigrator who had stayed in his mother's womb for a full nine years before being born.</p><p></p><p>During these nine years, although he had not been born, he had learned about the Gu family and the Profound Yellow World to a great extent, all from listening to his mother Ji Mingyue and other members of the Gu family conversing.</p><p></p><p>Now he was the Gu family's divine son with a distinguished identity and lofty status. The Gu family was an ancient family that had been passed down for countless years and awed the Profound Yellow Great World. As for his previous life, it was better not to mention it.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family elders were extremely disappointed in him, and countless powerful figures from the outside world felt that he was no longer a threat and also looked down on him with disdain. The Gu family's divine son was actually an ordinary mortal - how ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>But Gu Daoyi did not care in the slightest. What was a mere constitution? This situation was instead beneficial for him, giving him more time to grow up.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's confidence came from his comprehension ability - he possessed a heaven-defying level of comprehension!</p><p></p><p>When he transmigrated, he was noticed by the Great Dao and received its blessing, gaining a heaven-defying level of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>During the nine years, he had tried to comprehend the creation of heaven and earth and the manifestation of the Dao, but unfortunately failed, only because he was still in the prenatal stage and had not been born yet. His heaven-defying comprehension had not been activated.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had successfully been born, and his heaven-defying comprehension was also officially activated. </p><p></p><p>No constitution? He would create an invincible constitution himself!</p><p></p><p>He wanted to let this world experience the terror of heaven-defying comprehension!</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue got up from the bed, her peerlessly beautiful face slightly pale. She tightly pursed her red lips and took the baby from the swaddling clothes.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this child, Ji Mingyue finally spoke, her voice a little weak: "My son, from now on your name is Gu Daoyi. This is the name your father chose for you."</p><p></p><p>(PS: Asking for flowers! Asking for monthly tickets! Asking for review tickets! Asking for favorites!!!

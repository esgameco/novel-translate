        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>In the forbidden land,</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor's eyes lit up upon hearing Gu Dao Yi's answer.</p><p></p><p>"What a great Eternal Cosmic Law!"</p><p></p><p>"Tai" refers to space-time, "Yu" refers to the four directions above and below, "Zhou" refers to the past and present, "Yong" means immortality, and "Heng" means imperishable. These five characters encapsulate the essence of this world-conquering imperial law and also demonstrate Gu Dao Yi's ambition.</p><p></p><p>Such a world-conquering imperial law is already not inferior to the two invincible laws he created, and may even be slightly stronger. If it is fully perfected, his invincible laws will be far from comparable.</p><p></p><p>"It's really enviable insight."</p><p></p><p>A hint of envy appeared in the Void Emperor's eyes. If his insight was half that of Gu Dao Yi's, his combat power would be greatly enhanced, and he might have even become an immortal.</p><p></p><p>How could he still have the current life span crisis?</p><p></p><p>Even with the help of the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, he was unable to create an immortality law, which was truly a regret.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Gu Dao Yi was born. This "grandson" with heaven-defying insight always brought him surprises.</p><p></p><p>On the day he was born, he declared that he would create an immortality law for him, allowing him to live out his third life. At that time, the Void Emperor still had doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>But after three years of observation, especially today's experience, the Void Emperor completely dispelled all doubts.</p><p></p><p>He was rather looking forward to when Gu Dao Yi would create the immortality law and what kind of immortality law he would create.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient land of enlightenment, in front of the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi stood up, his white clothes untainted by dust, his temperament transcendent and detached, returning to simplicity, truly like an immortal descending to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>He was also in a good mood at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree was indeed effective for him. Although the effect was not as great as imagined, it was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>With the Fuxi Yan Dao Scripture and the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, coupled with his heaven-defying insight, he easily created a world-conquering imperial law.</p><p></p><p>Although it was incomplete, it was sufficient for the time being, not inferior to the supreme techniques created by those imperial realm powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Once the Eternal Cosmic Law was used, Gu Dao Yi could summon his future self to fight together.</p><p></p><p>His future self was also his true body, and apart from the Eternal Cosmic Law, he could use all other techniques, countless times stronger than his current self.</p><p></p><p>How strong the future self was depended on how strong Gu Dao Yi's magic power was and how far downstream he could extend in the river of time, summoning the future self from the corresponding timeline.</p><p></p><p>As long as his magic power could sustain it, he could summon three future selves, five future selves, or even ten future selves.</p><p></p><p>The reason why this world-conquering imperial law was said to be incomplete was because it still had many flaws.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was a limit to the number of future selves that could be summoned, the strength of the future self depended on how strong Gu Dao Yi's magic power was at that time, the future self could not use the Eternal Cosmic Law, and the Eternal Cosmic Law could not be used again for a short period of time after it was used...</p><p></p><p>The most critical flaw was that after using the Eternal Cosmic Law, Gu Dao Yi would disappear from the world at certain times in the future, and no one would be able to find him.</p><p></p><p>The Eternal Cosmic</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The principle of the Eternal Law is to use great magical power to capture one's future self from a certain time period and summon it to the present.</p><p></p><p>If using one day as the scale, Gu Daoyi summoned his 365 future selves from 500 years later, then these 365 future selves could fight in the present for one day. </p><p></p><p>However, in the 501st year, Gu Daoyi would disappear for that entire year, as if he did not exist in the world.</p><p></p><p>This could have a major impact. </p><p></p><p>Because at that time, his past self summoned him to the past to fight, he had already left the current time and space. During the time he disappeared, the Gu family may be destroyed, his parents may die, or nothing may happen and they just get through it. In any case, anything could happen.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Daoyi's conception, the complete Taizhu Eternal Law should be like this:</p><p></p><p>Once the Taizhu Eternal Law is unleashed, without any time interval, without needing to use great magical power to pry, no matter what realm he is in, he can summon his strongest future self, without limit to the number. The future self can also unleash the Taizhu Eternal Law again, and the future him will not be affected by it and will not disappear for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>This kind of law is the truly unrivaled law in Gu Daoyi's mind!</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, it is impossible for him now to create a perfect Taizhu Eternal Law.</p><p></p><p>Even if his enlightenment is always defying the heavens, it's not possible. He needs more time. If he can comprehend the Dao for ten years, a hundred years or even longer, Gu Daoyi feels that he can gradually perfect the Taizhu Eternal Law.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~" </p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his thoughts, Gu Daoyi let out a soft sigh.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes were upon him, but Gu Daoyi acted as if there was nothing, without any pressure, his heart extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>"Weiyang."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi looked at the two peerlessly beautiful women, one big and one small, under the tree.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Immortal Phoenix and Huang Weiyang, as well as all the Emperor Realm branded bodies and everyone around them looked over.</p><p></p><p>It was gratifying that Divine Son Gu Daoyi had created an unrivaled imperial law, but had the direction of this creation gone astray? </p><p></p><p>Shouldn't he have created an assisting law to help Huang Weiyang span through the ages and communicate with the Nine Heavens Immortal Phoenix?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, this kind of assisting law was too difficult, even more difficult than creating an invincible law, so the Divine Son felt he couldn't do it, and thus settled for the next best thing...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Huang Weiyang spoke, her voice gentle, cold and magnetic.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, it's okay, I can wait."</p><p></p><p>Although she couldn't communicate with her mother today and felt a bit disappointed, it was nothing. She was very happy to see her mother again.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's enlightenment defied the heavens. Given some time, sooner or later he would be able to create the corresponding law. She didn't mind waiting a bit longer. When the time comes, she would be able to communicate with her mother.</p>

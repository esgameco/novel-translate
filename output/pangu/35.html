            <p>Title: Nine Heavenly Phoenix Goddess</p><p></p><p>During her lecture, the Nine Heavenly Phoenix Goddess smiled radiantly, her beauty alluring and irresistible.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao listened with great interest, but did not take the time to appreciate the stunning scenery before him.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavenly Phoenix Goddess's discourse on the Immortal Dao also touched upon the Dao of Nirvana and Space, revealing her profound understanding of these three great Daos.</p><p></p><p>As Gu Dao listened to her lecture, a vivid image appeared in his mind, illustrating the life of the Nine Heavenly Phoenix Goddess.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of the Divine Ancient Era, numerous primordial divine ores were born between heaven and earth. At the core of one such ore lay a colossal egg, engraved with countless Dao principles and runes, continuously absorbing the essence of heaven and earth to nourish and nurture itself.</p><p></p><p>Protected by primordial grand formations, these divine ores concealed the workings of fate, making them undetectable even to supreme beings of the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus, nourished by the laws and essence of heaven and earth, the primordial divine egg gradually developed signs of life, its vitality growing stronger and its aura more potent with each passing moment.</p><p></p><p>Countless ages passed, and as the Xuanhuang World entered the Primordial Era, a small phoenix broke free from the egg, born sacred with the cultivation of a Sage.</p><p></p><p>The little phoenix did not rush to leave, instead building a phoenix nest within the primordial divine ore, quietly cultivating, comprehending the Dao, and mastering divine abilities and techniques.</p><p></p><p>By the time she emerged into the world, she had already attained the cultivation of a Grand Sage. She campaigned across the Nine Heavens and Ten Earths, clashing with countless heavenly prodigies and demons, tempering herself. Her physical body grew increasingly powerful, her cultivation more profound, and her strength ever greater. Her understanding of the Dao also progressed by leaps and bounds.</p><p></p><p>In the 980th year of her birth and the 330th year since her emergence, her cultivation reached the threshold of the Emperor Realm, making her the supreme heavenly prodigy of the entire Xuanhuang World.</p><p></p><p>Her name resounded throughout the myriad realms, shaking the eternal azure sky. All knew of her peerless elegance and beautyâ€”Huang Zhao Yue!</p><p></p><p>From then on, Huang Zhao Yue set foot on the path of the Emperor, venturing into the endless starry expanse, slaughtering heavenly prodigies and demons across the ages until they trembled in fear, using the bones of countless powerhouses to build her formidable reputation.</p><p></p><p>As well as the foundation for her Dao enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhao Yue had many followers, including top-tier heavenly prodigies and demons who adored her, but she never showed them any favor.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze never lingered on those of the opposite sex who were weaker than her.</p><p></p><p>In the 2,255th year of her life, Huang Zhao Yue faced her tribulation of Dao enlightenment. Supreme beings and Divine Emperors from forbidden zones emerged, seeking to seize her Emperor Realm Dao Fruit when she was at her weakest during the tribulation.</p><p></p><p>However, Huang Zhao Yue fiercely counterattacked and slaughtered them, even though they had pushed themselves to the limit and restored their combat strength to the Emperor Realm, they were no match for her.</p><p></p><p>This was because Huang Zhao Yue had already quietly attained Dao enlightenment in an alternative manner. Her physical body was as powerful as that of a supreme being in the Emperor Realm, and she excelled in the Immortal Dao of Nirvana, granting her exceptional recovery abilities.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the tribulation of Dao enlightenment, although weakened, her body had been inscribed with the Dao principles of the Emperor Realm, further enhancing her combat prowess.</p><p></p><p>In a single battle, she vanquished two Supreme Beings and Divine Emperors, elevating Huang Zhao Yue's fearsome reputation to new heights, truly shocking the world.</p><p></p><p>In the myriad realms of the heavens, resounding through the eternal universe, there was hardly anyone who did not know or had not heard of it.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, some people began to refer to Huang Zhaoyue, the Nine Heavens Phoenix, along with several other divine beasts from the ancient times, as the "Five Fiercest of the Ancient Era"!</p><p></p><p>Huang Zhaoyue was the fifth among the Ten Fiercest of the Ancient Era, while the other five emerged after Huang Zhaoyue and established their own formidable reputations.</p><p></p><p>Scene after scene flashed by, and Gu Daoyi even witnessed how Huang Weiyuan was born.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat unexpectedly, Huang Weiyuan had no biological father and was solely given birth to by Huang Zhaoyue.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Huang Zhaoyue had already lived out her second life and reached her later years. She wanted to walk a legendary path and attempt to live out a heaven-defying third life.</p><p></p><p>This journey was fraught with uncertainty, and the probability of failure was high. Therefore, Huang Zhaoyue wanted to have a child to inherit her bloodline and everything she possessed.</p><p></p><p>She communicated with the Great Dao of Heaven and Earth, giving birth to Huang Weiyuan. She accompanied Huang Weiyuan for several decades before reluctantly sending her to the ancient Gu family in the desolate lands, entrusting her to the Thunder Abyss God Emperor to be sealed within the Divine Source.</p><p></p><p>Finally, with all her worries put to rest, the Nine Heavens Phoenix embarked on that nearly suicidal path, vanishing into the myriad realms of the heavens, never to be seen or heard from again.</p><p></p><p>Through the Nine Heavens Phoenix's discourse on the Dao, Gu Daoyi not only comprehended her mastery of the Daos of Immortality, Nirvana, and Space but also gained a rough overview of her entire life.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Gu Daoyi a little. Previously, when the Seven Emperors had discoursed on the Dao, he had been unable to achieve this, so why was he able to do so this time?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Nine Heavens Phoenix had intentionally allowed him to see?</p><p></p><p>This thought surfaced in Gu Daoyi's mind.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look towards the peerlessly beautiful Nine Heavens Phoenix, only to find Huang Zhaoyue's gaze fixed intently upon him, her eyes seeming to hold a unique charm.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, it's your turn," Huang Zhaoyue spoke, a stunning smile gracing her flawless face.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi put aside his distracting thoughts and nodded slightly, saying, "Please listen carefully, Senior."</p><p></p><p>With those words, Gu Daoyi began his discourse on the Dao. In an instant, flowers bloomed between heaven and earth, lotuses emerged in the void, and the sound of the Great Dao echoed endlessly, with countless wondrous scenes and phenomena unfolding one after another.</p><p></p><p>At some point, the Nine Heavens Phoenix closed her beautiful eyes, her expression shifting from a smile to a solemn one, her phoenix brows tightly knitted as she immersed herself in deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Beside Huang Zhaoyue, Huang Weiyuan was in a similar state. Having listened to her mother's discourse on the Dao and then Gu Daoyi's, the confusion that had previously existed in her mind was suddenly cleared, and she experienced a great epiphany.</p><p></p><p>Her comprehension of the Dao advanced by leaps and bounds, reaching a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyuan's aura also soared wildly, actually breaking through from the peak of the Sealed Emperor Realm to the Saint Realm in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>She directly stepped into the realm of the Saintly Dao!</p><p></p><p>PS: Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

This little author is kowtowing in gratitude!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

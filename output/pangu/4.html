        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Although Gu Daoyi's tone was childish, it was extremely firm.</p><p></p><p>Possessing a heaven-defying comprehension ability, he had no intention of hiding it. With the backing of two great primordial families, who could suppress him?</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the shock in her heart, Ji Mingyue's face revealed a brilliant smile. Since her son said so, he must have created a "Minor Void Scripture".</p><p></p><p>Although this was unimaginable, it was not impossible. As Gu Daoyi's mother, Ji Mingyue naturally believed him.</p><p></p><p>"Then mother will help Daoyi to comprehend it." Ji Mingyue said with a smile. </p><p></p><p>As the goddess of the primordial Ji family, Ji Mingyue had her own bearing. She was a proud daughter of heaven, with a beautiful reputation throughout the Xuanhuang world. Her strength was outstanding among her peers, having already cultivated to the 4th level of the Saint King realm.</p><p></p><p>She cultivated the emperor scripture of the primordial Ji family. After marrying Gu Taichu, she also comprehended many emperor scriptures of the primordial Gu family, giving her extremely deep insights and knowledge.</p><p></p><p>She had also seen the Void Emperor's Void Scripture. When Gu Daoyi said he had comprehended the Dao and created the Minor Void Scripture, she wanted to take a look.</p><p></p><p>If it really contained the profundities of the Grand Dao of the Void, then her guess would come true.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi did not hesitate and carefully explained the Minor Void Scripture he created. After listening, Ji Mingyue fell silent. </p><p></p><p>Although she had not carefully comprehended it, with her knowledge, she could still hear the profoundness of this Minor Void Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Without speaking, Ji Mingyue began to comprehend. She wanted to know how devilish her son Gu Daoyi's comprehension ability was.</p><p></p><p>Being born with innate knowledge and being able to speak clearly and logically was trivial compared to creating the Minor Void Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Her son had only been in the Void Emperor's arms for a short while, no more than ten breaths, yet he had comprehended the Dao and created a technique. This comprehension ability was truly devilish.</p><p></p><p>From the profoundness and grade of the Minor Void Scripture, one could get a preliminary glimpse of the extent of Gu Daoyi's devilish comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi did not disturb her, and also closed his eyes to rest in his swaddling clothes. </p><p></p><p>Having just been born and comprehending the Dao to create a technique had consumed a lot of his energy. Without a special physique, he needed to rest and recover now.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Ji Mingyue opened her eyes, which were filled with complex emotions - shock, disbelief, pleasant surprise, bewilderment...</p><p></p><p>Her son Gu Daoyi was too devilish! </p><p></p><p>Even calling him an emperor's fetus was insufficient - he was a true immortal fetus!</p><p></p><p>She had already fully comprehended the Minor Void Scripture. It was a technique that could be cultivated to the Great Sage realm, and was quite powerful. If released to the outside world, holy lands, great sects, ancient countries, and long-living aristocratic families of this level would fight over it.</p><p></p><p>Forces of this level had never produced an emperor, but had produced ancient sages and quasi-emperors, possessing ancient sage weapons and even quasi-emperor weapons. A Great Sage realm technique was enough to make holy lands and great sects fight until their heads bled.</p><p></p><p>Especially since this technique was also a simplified version of the primordial Gu family's emperor scripture "Void Scripture", the fighting would be even more intense!</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue compared it and found that Gu Daoyi had indeed not chosen the wrong name for the technique. This technique could indeed be called the Minor Void Scripture, involving the void...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Dao described in the scripture was not as profound and abstruse as the Void Scripture, it was already sufficient. </p><p></p><p>Who would dare believe that this was a cultivation method created by a newborn infant?</p><p></p><p>Her son's comprehension ability was too monstrous!</p><p></p><p>With such monstrous comprehension and stunning talent that could amaze the ancient and modern times, what did it matter if he lacked a special physique? </p><p></p><p>She believed that Gu Dao Yi could still walk the invincible path, dominate the eight wastelands, suppress the nine heavens, be unrivaled in the world, attain the Dao and become an emperor, and even ascend to the immortal realm, achieve the Dao and eternal life, look down upon the cycles of time, and become imperishable and indestructible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Dao Yi woke up leisurely and saw the shock remaining on his mother's beautiful face. He asked knowingly, "Mother, how is the 'Minor Void Scripture' I created?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Ming Yue had thousands of words she wanted to say in her heart, but in the end, she only uttered two words: "Extremely good!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's face was adorned with an innocent and brilliant smile. </p><p></p><p>Ji Ming Yue reached out her slender jade-like hand to caress Gu Dao Yi's cheek. Her divine sense activated a token to contact the Void Emperor who had just left.</p><p></p><p>She instantly explained the situation to the Void Emperor, and then saw the figure of the Void Emperor appear once again in the Chengdao Palace. This time, he arrived in his true body, with a majestic stature that could crush myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor appeared in front of Ji Ming Yue and took Gu Dao Yi into his arms. His eyes, deep as the universe and starry sea, looked towards Gu Dao Yi.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi also looked at him, with curiosity in his eyes, not startled at all, neither servile nor overbearing, not at all like a newborn infant.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Void Emperor suddenly burst into laughter: "Good, good, good! The divine son of our Gu family is truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Gu Dao Yi could speak as soon as he was born, he was not surprised at all; but learning that just by holding Gu Dao Yi for ten breaths, Gu Dao Yi had comprehended the Dao and even created the "Minor Void Scripture", the Void Emperor was shocked!</p><p></p><p>He had already learned the contents of the Minor Void Scripture. It was indeed derived from his Void Scripture and could be considered a simplified version, allowing cultivation up to the Great Sage realm.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty of cultivating the Void Scripture was extremely high. The Void Emperor had always been troubled by the inability to spread the Void Scripture widely within the Gu family. The same was true for the other Emperor Scriptures, with very few people able to comprehend and cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>If one first cultivated the Minor Void Scripture and then the Void Scripture, the threshold would be greatly reduced, and the number of people in the Gu family who could cultivate the Void Scripture would increase by at least tenfold, effectively enhancing the Gu family's strength.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could see how monstrous Gu Dao Yi's comprehension ability was, simply defying the heavens!</p><p></p><p>If Gu Dao Yi were to finish studying his Void Scripture and he were to give Gu Dao Yi some teachings, wouldn't Gu Dao Yi be able to create a cultivation method comparable to or even more powerful than the Void Scripture?</p><p></p><p>At the very least, he could create an enhanced version of the Minor Void Scripture, further lowering the threshold for cultivating the Void Scripture and strengthening the Gu family's power.</p>

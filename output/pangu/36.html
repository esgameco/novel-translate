        <div class="content">
            <p>Fifteen minutes later, Gu Dao Yi finally finished his lecture on the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Transcending the mortal and entering the sacred realm, not bad at all." Gu Dao Yi's gaze fell upon Huang Wei Yang, a hint of a smile flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Huang Wei Yang was still consolidating her cultivation, having already stepped into the mid-stage of the Sacred Realm. Her strength had increased more than tenfold compared to before.</p><p></p><p>This was not only an improvement in her cultivation, but also her comprehension of the Great Dao, her understanding of mystical divine abilities, and so on, causing her combat power to soar.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, the Nine Heavens Phoenix had its eyes closed in contemplation, with phoenix illusions dancing around its body, enveloped by countless Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>Her supreme imperial weapon was the nine-colored magnificent robe she wore, called the Phoenix Dao Robe. Like the imperial weapons of other supreme experts at the Imperial Realm, it was an illusion, evolved from the imprint on her body.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's gaze shifted away from Huang Zhao Yue and glanced at the Void Emperor, Thunder Abyss God-Emperor, Xuan Emperor, Tai Yi Ancient Emperor, Yu Hua Ancient Emperor, Heng Yu Dao Venerable, and Chi Yan Dao Venerable.</p><p></p><p>He found that they were all still contemplating and showed no signs of awakening for the time being.</p><p></p><p>He also looked at the surrounding Gu family patriarchs, clan elders, supreme elders, and countless Gu family cultivators, and discovered that they were all still struggling to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity that was difficult to encounter in all ages. Everyone treated it seriously and strived to comprehend, wanting to gain more insights into the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>They were very clear that this might be the greatest opportunity and fortune in their lives. If they could seize it, they might be able to defy the heavens and change their fate, rising from then on.</p><p></p><p>Eight supreme experts at the Imperial Realm each lectured on the Dao once, and a divinely gifted son with heaven-defying comprehension lectured eight times in a row. This was an extremely rare heaven-defying opportunity even in ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Each Dao lecture would be accompanied by the descent of Great Dao Flowers, the rise of Great Dao Golden Lotuses, and the lingering of Great Dao Sounds, which could better help them comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this place was an ancient land of enlightenment, with ancient tea trees of enlightenment present. Their comprehension was temporarily enhanced by a great deal, making it easier for them to absorb the wonders of the Dao and gain more.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the ancient land of enlightenment was completely silent. It was filled with people everywhere, yet there was not a single sound. All was still, and a falling needle could be heard.</p><p></p><p>Not only the ancient land of enlightenment but also, with the Void Emperor's intentional spread, the contents of this Dao debate were transmitted in real-time to the Gu family's territory, resounding throughout the Divine Continent and causing countless Gu family cultivators to fall into a frenzy.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor's true body presided over the forbidden area, manipulating everything. He also secretly activated the supreme formation, isolating the inside and outside of the Divine Continent, preventing the debate from spreading to the outside world and blocking the outside world's prying eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, wait a moment." At this time, the Void Emperor's voice rang out in Gu Dao Yi's mind.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi nodded slightly. He stopped looking at the others, closed his eyes, and began to sort out the insights he gained from listening to and lecturing on the Dao this time.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen imperial scriptures possessed by the ancient Gu family included the imperial scriptures of the eight supreme experts at the Imperial Realm present. This Dao debate allowed Gu Dao Yi to gain immensely, and various...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The comprehension of the Great Dao was just one aspect. He also thoroughly comprehended the eight Emperor Realm scriptures, saving himself a great deal of time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Gu Dao Yi had planned to comprehend all of the Gu family's Emperor scriptures before starting to create the Undying Method and develop his own techniques and physique.</p><p></p><p>Now, Gu Dao Yi had comprehended a total of ten Emperor scriptures, including the techniques of the eight Emperor Realm powerhouses present, as well as the Fuxi Heavenly Emperor's Fuxi Dao Scripture and Maitreya Dao Lord's Maitreya Source Classic.</p><p></p><p>This gave Gu Dao Yi a terrifying accumulation of foundation.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family still had four Emperor scriptures that he had not yet comprehended, and the Primordial Ji family also had four Emperor scriptures. Gu Dao Yi planned to thoroughly comprehend all eight of these Emperor scriptures, and then create his own techniques and physique. As for the Undying Method, it was more of an incidental matter.</p><p></p><p>He could create it now, but the Void Emperor wouldn't mind waiting a bit. If he created it after some time, the Undying Method could be even more perfect.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi immersed himself in sorting out his Great Dao insights. Countless flashes of inspiration appeared, endless Dao marvels surged forth, and boundless Dao rhymes derived. In Gu Dao Yi's mind, infinite scenes appeared, each depicting a version of him comprehending the Dao, techniques, and creating methods.</p><p></p><p>Countless terrifying divine abilities, Dao methods, and marvelous techniques were comprehended by him. Each one, if released to the outside world, could cause a sensation and countless cultivators to fight over them.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Dao Yi looked down on them. With a single thought, all the scenes were extinguished. New scenes emerged one after another, with the versions of him in the scenes continuing to comprehend and create techniques.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi had high standards and great ambitions. The techniques he created had to be at least at the level of supreme marvelous arts and world-dominating Emperor methods, such as the Sand Flowing Between Fingers and the Eternal Cosmos Method.</p><p></p><p>Techniques below this level, with Gu Dao Yi's current accumulated foundation, he could easily create many of them casually. They posed no difficulty for him whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>He would not engage in such matters. They would only consume his energy and waste his time. His energy and time needed to be used in more worthwhile places.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Dao Yi finished sorting out his insights, he had a general outline in his heart regarding the path he wanted to walk, his Dao, his techniques, his physique, and so on.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to spend some more time perfecting them and accumulating a bit more foundation before he could create them all.</p><p></p><p>In order to reach the highest of all heavens and be invincible throughout the ages, he didn't mind spending more time.</p><p></p><p>Time was what Gu Dao Yi lacked the least. He was only three years old. For him, a year could accumulate countless foundations and bring about endless changes. But for other cultivators, especially the powerful ones, a year passed in the blink of an eye without any sense of it.</p><p></p><p>His heaven-defying comprehension ability was his greatest advantage!</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>As Gu Daoyi woke up, the various Dao images reflecting the heavens began to dissipate.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi glanced at them and immediately understood. He didn't care about the dissipation of the Dao images, as they were merely formed from the Dao rhyme, Dao meaning, Dao wonder, and so on that had dispersed while he was comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, you're finally awake." Huang Weiyang's voice rang in Gu Daoyi's ears, her tone full of joyful surprise. </p><p></p><p>"How long was I comprehending the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"Half a quarter of an hour."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi nodded slightly. As soon as he came out, he discovered that the time didn't match, which is why he asked.</p><p></p><p>In the Fuxi space, he comprehended the Dao for nine days without eating, drinking, or sleeping. Although he was an ordinary person, nourished by the Dao Qi, he didn't feel the slightest bit of fatigue or hunger. Now, he was still in high spirits and looked radiant.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding crowd was still there. If he had comprehended the Dao for nine days, these people should have dispersed. They couldn't have stayed here to watch the whole time, after all, they didn't know how long he would be comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, did you obtain the inheritance of Emperor Fuxi?" The stunningly beautiful girl in the pink dress asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi nodded gently. </p><p></p><p>A trace of shock appeared on Huang Weiyang's face. Although she had guessed it early on, hearing Gu Daoyi personally admit it still shocked her greatly.</p><p></p><p>She was born in the ancient era. Emperor Fuxi was also a supreme being of the imperial realm in the ancient era. He had attained the Dao tens of thousands of years earlier than her mother, the Nine Heavens Phoenix. She had heard many legends about Emperor Fuxi.</p><p></p><p>She never thought that in this era, she would meet a descendant of Emperor Fuxi, and this person was someone she was willing to follow.</p><p></p><p>How could Huang Weiyang not be shocked?!</p><p></p><p>Their conversation was not deliberately concealed. The countless descendants of the Gu family surrounding them all heard it and couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Son is so amazing!"</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-defying! The Divine Son's comprehension is simply heaven-defying!"</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Fuxi's inheritance has finally reappeared after several eras."</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha~ The Divine Son was born into our Gu family. This is the Dao blessing our Gu family."</p><p></p><p>"With the Divine Son here, our Gu family will surely achieve immortal glory."</p><p></p><p>After the shock, the numerous disciples of the Gu family discussed enthusiastically, their expressions full of excitement as they began to imagine the future.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Gu family had shaken the Primordial world for countless years and had never declined. Several supreme beings of the imperial realm had emerged from it, and its foundation was unfathomably deep.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that the Gu family was also the most top-notch among the ancient aristocratic families, and now there was still an Emperor guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Below that, there was the Sixth Patriarch Gu Yuanwu, a quasi-emperor with stunning talent and world-shaking aptitude. He had a good chance of attaining the Dao and becoming an Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Then there was the current head of the family, Gu Taichu, known as the White-Robed God King. With a white robe of unparalleled elegance, it was said that he was about to break through to the Great Sage realm. His potential was even greater than the Sixth Patriarch's, and his hope of attaining the Dao and becoming an Emperor was even higher.</p><p></p><p>And now, their Gu family's Divine Son had been born. His comprehension was heaven-defying. In the future, barring any accidents, he would certainly attain the Dao and become an Emperor, or even an immortal, overlooking the cycles of time and forging the Gu family's immortal glory to its pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions, Gu Daoyi had already risen and was walking out with Huang Weiyang, his expression calm.</p><p></p><p>He had comprehended the ancient Fuxi stele at the ancient Dao comprehension site. Next...</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He needed to go see the悟道 ancient tea tree, to see if this 悟道 ancient tea tree was still useful to him.</p><p></p><p>If it was useful, 顾道一 planned to come to the 悟道 ancient land more often to speed up his comprehension of the 顾 family's emperor scriptures, and then in one fell swoop create an immortality method. </p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, invincible methods, immortality methods, emperor scriptures, supreme techniques and the like were all extremely profound, abstruse and esoteric, requiring powerful cultivation to create.</p><p></p><p>After one's cultivation becomes powerful and experiences rich, with deeper insights into the Great Dao and deeper accumulation, one can create certain targeted techniques and produce methods of immense power.</p><p></p><p>But there are exceptions, such as those with extremely high enlightenment who can create some incomparably powerful techniques even at lower levels of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>而顾道一's enlightenment defied the heavens. As long as he was willing, he could gain insights from seeing anything, comprehending the profound Dao anytime and anywhere, creating all kinds of techniques.</p><p></p><p>As long as given time, he could create many powerful techniques such as immortality methods and invincible methods.</p><p></p><p>顾道一 did not plan to rely on himself for everything. </p><p></p><p>He was born into an ancient family in the desolate era, was the divine son of the 顾 family, of lofty status and highly regarded. He could view all the techniques in the 顾 family's Dao repository and learn all the emperor scriptures and supreme arts.</p><p></p><p>This was the shortcut!</p><p></p><p>Absorbing the insights of countless past sages, transforming them into his own accumulation, standing on the shoulders of one giant after another, he could more quickly create immortality methods, invincible methods, and even more powerful techniques.</p><p></p><p>顾道一 walked in front with hands clasped behind his back, the incomparably beautiful young lady 凰未央 in a pink dress walking a bit behind him, heading towards the 悟道 ancient tea tree. Countless 顾 family disciples automatically made way, lining up on both sides, respectfully performing the rite of focused gaze.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the divine son pass by without the slightest intention of stopping, 顾清瑶 bit her silver teeth, parting her red lips slightly:</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son, please stay your steps."</p><p></p><p>She was very confident in her constitution, innate talent and enlightenment, feeling she had the qualifications to become 顾道一's follower, and had been waiting for 顾道一 to take the initiative to recruit her.</p><p></p><p>But 顾道一 showed not the slightest intention of recruiting her.</p><p></p><p>顾清瑶 had no choice but to take the initiative to speak. She had set her sights on 顾道一 and was determined to become his follower. No one else was worthy of her following.</p><p></p><p>顾灵霜 beside her looked at 顾清瑶 in surprise, immediately understanding her intentions, and suddenly felt a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>This 顾清瑶 was unwilling to become her sister's follower and wanted to become the divine son's follower.</p><p></p><p>顾灵霜 thought the same. She also wanted to pull her sister to become the divine son's first followers together, as this would have great benefits. </p><p></p><p>But 顾灵泷 did not come, so her qualifications were a bit lacking and she could not speak the words of wanting to become the divine son's follower.</p><p></p><p>顾道一 did not stop. 凰未央 glanced at 顾清瑶, clearly aware of 顾清瑶's intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son, I am willing to become your follower, to follow you in conquering the world, to give my all for you. Please accept me."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, 顾清瑶 knelt on one knee, her slender waist straight, saying respectfully.</p><p></p><p>PS: Ten updates every day! Ten updates every day! Ten updates every day!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers! Asking for monthly tickets! Asking for review tickets! Asking for rewards!!!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, add rewards!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Beneath the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree, there were a total of eight imprints of supreme beings at the Emperor Realm, four of which belonged to the Emperor Realm members of the ancient Gu family from the Desolate Era.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao speculated that there should be more than eight Emperor Realm supreme beings under the imprints of the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree. After all, this tree had existed since ancient times, even during the Divine Ancient Era, while the Gu family only obtained the tree in the Primordial Era.</p><p></p><p>This immortal divine medicine had spiritual awareness. Perhaps out of certain considerations or an agreement with an Emperor Realm supreme being from the Gu family, the eight revealed imprints were either from the Gu family's Emperor Realm members or those on good terms with the ancient Gu family.</p><p></p><p>According to the timeline of the imprints, the closest to the current period was the Void Emperor, followed by the Profound Emperor from the Middle Ancient Era, the Hengyu Dao Venerable and Chiyan Dao Venerable from the Ancient Era, the Taiyi Ancient Emperor and Yuhua Ancient Emperor from the Distant Ancient Era, and the Leiyuan God Emperor and Nine Heavens Phoenix from the Primordial Era.</p><p></p><p>Among them, the Void Emperor, Hengyu Dao Venerable, Taiyi Ancient Emperor, and Leiyuan God Emperor were all Emperor Realm supreme beings from the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Phoenix was on good terms with the Leiyuan God Emperor, while the Chiyan Dao Venerable was close to the Hengyu Dao Venerable, both being Emperor Realm supreme beings from the same era.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yuhua Ancient Emperor and Taiyi Ancient Emperor were not from the same era, the Yuhua Ancient Emperor had once received the Taiyi Ancient Emperor's grace to defy fate and rise to prominence, thus having a very good relationship with the ancient Gu family.</p><p></p><p>As for the Profound Emperor, he was a great emperor of the demon race from the Middle Ancient Era. His strength was extremely powerful, but less than 10,000 years after attaining the Dao, he disappeared. The world speculated that he had already died, leaving the emperor's position vacant.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Emperor was able to attain the Dao and become an emperor, and the ancient Gu family played a significant role in this. The two sides had an excellent relationship, and the Gu family allowed the Profound Emperor to comprehend the Dao under the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>The Middle Ancient Era was a period of decline for the ancient Gu family, with no Emperor Realm supreme beings emerging. However, no force dared to underestimate the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>This was because the foundation of this ancient family was too deep. Emperor Realm supreme beings appeared continuously in the Desolate, Primordial, Distant Ancient, and Ancient Eras, leaving countless hidden powers and even suppressing the fortune with several Emperor Weapons.</p><p></p><p>As for the titles of the Emperor Realm supreme beings, they varied in each era. The Divine Ancient Era called them Supreme Lords, the Desolate Era called them Sacred Venerables, the Primordial Era called them God Emperors, the Distant Ancient Era called them Ancient Emperors, the Ancient Era called them Dao Venerables, and from the Middle Ancient Era to the present, they were called Great Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Mirror, Hengyu Furnace, Taiyi Sword, Leiyuan Tower - four of our Gu family's eight Ultimate Dao Emperor Weapons have appeared here."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Ultimate Dao Emperor Weapons suspended above the heads of those Emperor Realm supreme beings under the tree, Gu Dao sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>He had previously learned about the Gu family's foundation, knowing how many Emperor Realm and Quasi-Emperor experts they had produced and how many Emperor Scriptures and Emperor Weapons they possessed. This was the first time he saw the Ultimate Dao Emperor Weapons, albeit only as imprints.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Gu family had produced five Emperor Realm experts, leaving behind five Ultimate Dao Emperor Weapons, and had also obtained three more from the outside world. These eight Ultimate Dao Emperor Weapons suppressed their fortune.</p><p></p><p>This was the Gu family's confidence. Even if an Emperor Realm supreme being came to attack, there was no need to</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor made his move, and the mere awakening of the Supreme Dao Divine Weapon was enough to slay the incoming enemies.</p><p></p><p>Generation after generation of accumulation allowed the Gu family to continue flourishing and prospering, striking awe across the myriad realms for countless eons.</p><p></p><p>The stunning girl in a pink dress standing beside Gu Daoyi at this moment had flickering eyes, looking at the figure under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree with great shock, constantly murmuring the words "Mother".</p><p></p><p>Since being sealed in the Divine Source in the ancient times, Huang Weiyao had never seen the Nine Heavens Phoenix again. She firmly believed that her mother was not dead and missed her very much.</p><p></p><p>After emerging from the Divine Source, Huang Weiyao had been cultivating and rarely interacted with the outside world. She didn't even know that the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree could leave behind Emperors' imprints, otherwise she would have come to meet her long ago.</p><p></p><p>After following Gu Daoyi, she learned that he was going to the Ancient Land of Enlightenment. Huang Weiyao then temporarily inquired about the situation, and from then on, her heart was filled with infinite anticipation.</p><p></p><p>This time, following Gu Daoyi here, she actually saw the imprint of the Nine Heavens Phoenix, making her extremely excited, wishing she could rush over and throw herself into her mother's embrace.</p><p></p><p>Two clear tears slid down from the corners of Huang Weiyao's eyes. Overjoyed to the point of tears, she couldn't help but walk forward, while extending her slender, fair, and delicate fingers, wanting to touch the imprint of the Nine Heavens Phoenix.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Gu family disciples who were paying attention here all gasped in unison.</p><p></p><p>Eight Emperors appearing together!</p><p></p><p>What a glory this was?</p><p></p><p>It could be said to shock ancient and modern times!</p><p></p><p>"As expected of our Gu family's divine son, an unparalleled existence with heaven-defying comprehension. Walking under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree actually caused eight Emperor realm supreme beings to appear at the same time."</p><p></p><p>"Terrifyingly impressive, I, Gu Laosan, am completely convinced!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Void Emperor has never received such treatment!"</p><p></p><p>"Witnessing history again, I feel deeply honored."</p><p></p><p>"First creating the invincible law, then causing eight Emperors to appear together, what earth-shattering events will happen next?"</p><p></p><p>The Gu family disciples exclaimed one after another, their faces full of shock, their eyeballs nearly falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>As disciples of the primordial Gu family, they were very clear about what this scene meant - it was supreme glory.</p><p></p><p>It represented the recognition of eight Emperor realm supreme beings!</p><p></p><p>Since the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree was moved into the primordial Gu family, no one had been able to make all the Emperor realm imprints appear together.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor had also once comprehended the Dao under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, but he only awakened the imprints of four Emperor realm supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Now, among the nine leaders of the younger generation of the Gu family, all of them had triggered the imprint of one Emperor realm supreme being. The strongest one had even triggered the imprints of two Emperor realm beings and was praised as the most promising genius of the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>But compared to the divine son, that person was far too inferior!</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the fifth update, continuing the explosive releases!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards! Your support is the motivation for my explosive updates!</p><p></p><p>Please, dear family members, support me.

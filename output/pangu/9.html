            <p>The other treasure of the Enlightenment Ancient Land was the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, Emperor Fuxi, after comprehending the great Dao of Heaven and Earth, felt that something was still missing in the world. So he crafted the first ancient stele, which was vaguely connected to the myriad ways of Heaven and Earth and could be used to test the strength of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators at the Physical Realm could not accurately calculate their own physical strength, but this kind of ancient stele could.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this type of ancient stele spread throughout the Xuanhuang World, and various major forces began to craft them. However, smaller forces were limited by materials and their attainments in artifact crafting, making it difficult for them to produce.</p><p></p><p>Later generations, in order to commemorate Emperor Fuxi's achievement in creating this type of ancient stele, named it the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>The Fuxi Ancient Stele recorded the names of the top ten thousand cultivators in terms of physical strength over countless years, allowing them to gain fame and pass down through the ages.</p><p></p><p>Every one who could leave their name on the Fuxi Ancient Stele was an unrivaled genius, often with very high achievements. Later generations of cultivators, by testing themselves on the Fuxi Ancient Stele, could also know the gap between their physical realm and those unrivaled geniuses, stimulating their fighting spirit and spurring them to catch up.</p><p></p><p>The Enlightenment Ancient Land also had other places to test cultivation, from the Divine Ability Realm to the Sealed Emperor Realm, but none were as popular as the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>Because the Gu family of the Desolate Ancient had the largest number of clan members at the Physical Realm, and the Fuxi Ancient Stele had records of all ages, challenging the Fuxi Ancient Stele and breaking records could make one famous for ten thousand generations.</p><p></p><p>The other treasures for testing cultivation were all crafted by the Gu family themselves and were not connected to the treasures of other supreme forces in the Xuanhuang World, nor did they have rankings.</p><p></p><p>Today was the day of testing on the Fuxi Ancient Stele, and many descendants of the Gu family stood in front of it, eager to test their physical cultivation and even challenge the records.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the Gu family descendants stepped forward to be tested. Their results were all good, with extraordinary physical strength far surpassing ordinary cultivators, but none of them made it onto the ranking.</p><p></p><p>To get on the ranking, one had to squeeze out the unrivaled geniuses already on the list. These were the strongest ten thousand cultivators at the Physical Realm recorded by the Fuxi Ancient Stele over the ages. How easy could it be to surpass them at this realm and push them down?</p><p></p><p>Before long, hundreds of Gu family descendants had tested themselves on the Fuxi Ancient Stele. Occasionally, exclamations of surprise could be heard from the surrounding Gu family disciples, some shocked by the physical cultivation of the testers. The testers, hearing the exclamations, would also show a proud expression.</p><p></p><p>A Gu family descendant punched the Fuxi Ancient Stele, which lit up and displayed a few numbers. Seeing the tested cultivation, his eyes instantly lit up.</p><p></p><p>His physical cultivation had made a big leap compared to the last test, stronger than the hundreds of Gu family disciples before him.</p><p></p><p>The corners of his mouth curled up, already prepared to hear the cheers and shocked discussions, then show off for a bit and leave with a high profile.</p><p></p><p>But he waited and waited, yet didn't hear any discussion, not even a sound of talking, which surprised him a little.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that his physical cultivation was so high that it shocked the onlookers into silence?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sound of footsteps arose. This Gu family descendant turned to look and was instantly stunned.</p><p></p><p>He...</p><p></p><p>Yang's smile faded, and he walked silently to the side with a long face, becoming one of the onlookers in the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the newcomer, he was indeed nothing special. Everyone's attention was drawn away, and probably no one noticed his physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was a stunning young lady dressed in a white palace gown. She carried a divine sword on her back and walked gracefully towards the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>She had a flawless, fair face, red lips, a straight nose, eyebrows like blue-black ink, eyes like autumn water, exquisite features, a slender waist, jade-like bones, and a graceful figure, along with waist-length straight silver hair. What a stunning female sword immortal.</p><p></p><p>Like a lotus emerging from clear water, naturally beautiful without adornment!</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingyao has come to test herself again. I wonder if she can make it onto the list this time?"</p><p></p><p>"Her physical cultivation was already close to the top ten thousand on the Fuxi Ancient Stele last time she tested. She has also cultivated a renowned body tempering technique during this period, so she will definitely make it onto the list."</p><p></p><p>"I think so too. Gu Qingyao has a proud personality and has refused the recruitment of three leaders. How could she come to test herself again without absolute confidence?"</p><p></p><p>More and more members of the Gu family gathered around the Fuxi Ancient Stele, all attracted by Gu Qingyao, discussing amongst themselves.</p><p></p><p>This shows how popular Gu Qingyao is.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao, true to her name, has a pure, proud, and cold nature. She is exceptionally talented. Although she is not one of the nine young leaders of the ancient Gu family, she is still a prominent heavenly maiden.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao is only fourteen years old this year and just turned fourteen last month. However, she had already cultivated to the peak of the physical realm several years ago. In order to build a strong physical foundation and successfully challenge the Fuxi Ancient Stele to make a name for herself, she has been suppressing her cultivation and practicing one powerful body tempering technique after another.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, Gu Qingyao's physical cultivation was very close to the last place on the Fuxi Ancient Stele. She only needed to refine it slightly to surpass it, but she was not content with being at the bottom, which could be surpassed at any time.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Gu Qingyao spent another half a year cultivating body tempering techniques, greatly increasing her physical strength. Now, she has come to challenge with full confidence.</p><p></p><p>Her goal is to break into the top 9,500!</p><p></p><p>The young and famous Gu Qingyao, who is also stunningly beautiful, possesses a powerful physique called the Heavenly Yin Body. It had a great reputation in ancient and middle ancient times, producing a quasi-emperor, three ancient sages, and seven great sages in succession.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao is the first Heavenly Yin Body since the middle ancient times. Her future achievements will be at least that of a great sage. If she has the opportunity, becoming an ancient sage will not be difficult, which is enough to shake the Xuanhuang world.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that Gu Qingyao is very proud and has refused the recruitment of many leaders, believing that they are not qualified enough for her to follow.</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please give flowers!

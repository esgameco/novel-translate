        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Gu Daoyi didn't pretend to be humble or say anything when praised by the Void Emperor. He only slightly raised the corners of his mouth, showing that he was in an excellent mood.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Daoyi's reaction, the Void Emperor was even more satisfied and felt that even Gu Taichu couldn't compare to Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>Presumably, if Gu Taichu knew about the Void Emperor's evaluation, he would also be happy. Parents always hope their children will be more outstanding and excellent than themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, should we inform the elders about Daoyi's monstrous comprehension?" Ji Mingyue asked.</p><p></p><p>She couldn't make this decision because it was of great importance. The elders held high positions and wielded great power in the Gu family, with cultivation and attainments that could create and transform. They were also extremely concerned about Gu Daoyi's situation.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Daoyi lacked a special physique, many elders were disappointed in him. However, the powerful outsiders also believed he posed no threat and had no intention of suppressing him. They even paid much less attention to Gu Daoyi, some not even caring about him at all.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Daoyi's monstrous comprehension were to spread unintentionally, it might cause another upheaval. Those who didn't want the Gu family to continue flourishing would secretly seek opportunities to attack and kill Gu Daoyi, thus strangling the Gu family's hope for immortality.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor pondered for a moment and said, "I will inform some people, and they will not spread it carelessly."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Mingyue slightly opened her red lips, wanting to say something but stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Mingyue, don't worry. I understand your concerns, but these thoughts are unnecessary," the Void Emperor reassured.</p><p></p><p>"With me here, who dares to lay a hand on Daoyi?"</p><p></p><p>"If anyone dares to reach out, I will sever their hand, then start an imperial war, killing until the myriad heavens collapse and are destroyed, until the myriad realms are drenched in blood, until no one in the world dares to make a move."</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor's tone was as calm as the void, unperturbed, but extremely domineering, with a murderous aura soaring to the heavens. Ji Mingyue even saw visions of blood flowing for millions of miles and the destruction of myriad worlds.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue knew that the Void Emperor had the confidence and strength to do so.</p><p></p><p>Back when the Void Emperor attained the Dao, there were even Forbidden Zone Supremes who tried to obstruct his path. However, the Void Emperor slaughtered one Supreme and injured two others, his battle prowess shocking the myriad heavens.</p><p></p><p>After attaining the Dao, the Void Emperor's killing intent did not diminish. He frequently entered and exited Forbidden Zones, fighting until all the Forbidden Zones in the world were silent and didn't dare to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor had lived for over 80,000 years and had slain more than one Supreme and Ancient Emperor. His prestige was resounding, shaking ancient and modern times, revered by the myriad heavens.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the Void Emperor entering his twilight years in his second lifetime, making it extremely difficult to live to a third lifetime, the powerful outsiders wouldn't dare to openly covet the Gu family of the Divine Continent. Even so, the Ancient Emperors and Supremes didn't dare to provoke the Void Emperor easily.</p><p></p><p>With the Void Emperor's battle prowess, it was still very likely for him to drag a few Supremes, Ancient Emperors, and Immortal Matriarchs to die with him.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Void Emperor made his stance clear, willing to start an endless imperial war to protect Gu Daoyi to the death, then perhaps no one would dare to make a move.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to clash with the Void Emperor to the death!</p><p></p><p>In any case, the Void Emperor had less than 500 years of lifespan left.</p><p></p><p>In this short time, let alone Gu Daoyi, even Gu Taichu couldn't attain the Dao and become an emperor. They could wait until after the Void Emperor's death to make their move.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi listened with shining eyes. This was an emperor, their Gu family's Void Emperor, with unparalleled dominance.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"Great Emperor, you will not die." Gu Dao Yi suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor and Ji Mingyue were both stunned. Why was Gu Dao Yi saying this?</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good. Dao Yi, don't worry, of course I won't die. I will hold on until your father successfully proves his Dao." </p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor laughed heartily, thinking Gu Dao Yi was worried about something.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi shook his little head and said, "I will create an immortality method for you!"</p><p></p><p>"I will let you live to a third lifetime!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's words were shocking!</p><p></p><p>By the time his father Gu Taichu proved his Dao, who knew how long that would take. Before then, Gu Dao Yi wanted to keep the Void Emperor alive.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Void Emperor, the strongest of the Gu family, was still alive, the outside world would not dare to do anything to him, his father, or the Gu family. Otherwise, if an Emperor at his peak went to war, it would shake the myriad realms and cause them to bleed.</p><p></p><p>If the Void Emperor did not die, then Gu Dao Yi would always have the best Dao protector. He would not be in mortal danger and could grow up safely and steadily.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's comprehension was heaven-defying. He believed that he could create an immortality method before the Void Emperor's lifespan was exhausted, letting him live to a third lifetime, and even a fourth, fifth lifetime...</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue's face was full of shock. Little Dao Yi really dared to think of such things! Then her face was full of pride - this was her son.</p><p></p><p>From his expression and tone, it could be seen that Gu Dao Yi was infinitely confident. She no longer needed to have any worries.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor was also surprised. He did not say it was impossible, nor did he criticize Gu Dao Yi for having wild ideas. Gu Dao Yi's comprehension was monstrous and even heaven-defying. It was possible.</p><p></p><p>"I look forward to the day you create the immortality method."</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor laughed again, full of gratification, and left the Chengdao Palace.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, the Void Emperor appeared in the Void Immortal Palace and summoned the many Gu family elders to come.</p><p></p><p>Very quickly, streaks of flowing light descended, revealing the figures of the Gu family elders one by one.</p><p></p><p>When they saw the Void Emperor, they were suddenly shocked. The Emperor had actually appeared in his true body. What major event had occurred? Could it be that the Gu family was about to undergo a huge change?</p><p></p><p>"There is no need for alarm."</p><p></p><p>"I called you here to talk about one matter."</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor spoke, his voice shaking the universe, his majestic aura pressing down on the myriad realms, causing the many elders' expressions to turn solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi's status as a divine son remains unchanged. He is additionally crowned as the chief leader. All of the Gu family's resources will be devoted to Gu Dao Yi to help him grow."</p><p></p><p>As soon as he finished speaking, the many elders were greatly shocked and wanted to ask questions, but then they heard the Void Emperor speak again:</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi's talent is stunning through the ages, his comprehension monstrous and heaven-defying. He deserves such treatment. This is the Minor Void Scripture he just created. You all contemplate it for a while."</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor imprinted the Minor Void Scripture into the minds of the many elders, along with the situation that had just occurred, then disappeared.</p><p></p><p>He left behind the many elders, their faces full of shock.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Huang Weiyang was in a daze, not knowing when she had started staring.</p><p></p><p>They had only walked a few steps, not even reaching the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree, yet Gu Daoyi had already attained enlightenment. Moreover, he had manifested such a terrifying Dao phenomenon, creating who knows what kind of incredibly powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>He truly was an unparalleled genius with heaven-defying comprehension!</p><p></p><p>If Gu Daoyi were to sit under the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree to cultivate, how terrifying would that be?</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang suspected that with the blessing of the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree, Gu Daoyi would very likely create an invincible technique that would shock the heavens and earth, make ghosts and gods weep, and shake the myriad worlds for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>Biting her slightly dry pink lips, Huang Weiyang's face was full of bitterness. Watching that invincible figure standing on the Primordial Chaos Sea, creating and destroying myriad worlds with a wave of his hand, she no longer knew what to say.</p><p></p><p>She herself was an unmatched genius, having cultivated to the peak of the Sealed Emperor realm at only 122 years old, just one step away from stepping into the Sacred Dao realm and becoming a transcendent Sage.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation speed could be considered extremely fast. In the entire Xuanhuang World, there were very few who could be compared to her, let alone surpass her.</p><p></p><p>Her comprehension was also extremely terrifying. She could comprehend various techniques extremely quickly and with ease. Even with the Emperor Scriptures, given enough time, she could thoroughly comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>However, in front of Gu Daoyi, Huang Weiyang suffered one invisible blow after another. Compared to Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension, she felt like she was just trash.</p><p></p><p>Standing at the Sealed Emperor realm, she was unable to create such an invincible technique, let alone comprehend such a peerless and invincible technique at the age of three. She felt that she would most likely need to be at the Quasi-Emperor stage to comprehend it, or at least at the Ancient Sage realm to have some understanding of it.</p><p></p><p>Right now, she had no clue at all.</p><p></p><p>"This child is so terrifying!" </p><p></p><p>Hidden in the void, the Sixth Patriarch Gu Yuanwu had his mouth wide open, shocked by the scene in front of the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, hearing about it in person is not as good as seeing it with one's own eyes. Previously, he had some doubts, thinking that there couldn't possibly be such a heaven-defying supreme existence in the world, so he had been hesitant to show himself.</p><p></p><p>But after personally witnessing Gu Daoyi take a few steps towards the ancient Enlightenment Tea Tree and cause such a commotion, manifesting the highest level Dao phenomenon and seemingly comprehending and creating an invincible technique, Gu Yuanwu was instantly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"In front of Gu Daoyi, anyone would feel ashamed of their inferiority. He is a natural-born immortal, an undying immortal." Gu Yuanwu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>He had the same thought as Huang Weiyang, feeling that his comprehension had been trampled on the ground and rubbed harshly by Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>He had long broken through to the Quasi-Emperor realm and had gone extremely deep into it, yet he still hadn't created his own invincible technique.</p><p></p><p>And what about Gu Daoyi?</p><p></p><p>Not yet having stepped onto the path of cultivation, he had attained enlightenment and created a technique at only three years old, manifesting such an invincible Dao phenomenon. This comprehension was absolutely heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu's eyes flickered. He really wanted to go and consult Gu Daoyi, asking him for some guidance. He had been stuck at this bottleneck for several thousand years.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Gu Yuanwu's thoughts were a bit unenlightened. He was already nearly twenty thousand years old, the Sixth Elder of the ancient Gu family. His cultivation had reached the Quasi-Emperor realm, and his prestige shook the</p><p></p><p>In the primordial world, asking him to seek advice from a three-year-old child was somewhat beneath his dignity.</p><p></p><p>Within the forbidden land.</p><p></p><p>The eyes of the Void Emperor were blazing.</p><p></p><p>He had mastered the extremes of the void, and even though he was far away, it seemed as if he was right before his eyes, his gaze able to see everything that happened in the ancient land of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>After a long silence, the Void Emperor sighed with emotion:</p><p></p><p>"If heaven does not give birth to Gu Daoyi, it will be like an eternal night for all eternity!"</p><p></p><p>His cultivation was unfathomably profound, having already reached the deepest levels of the Emperor Realm. With a single glance, he could see how extraordinary and terrifying the Dao Phenomenon evolved by Gu Daoyi's enlightenment was.</p><p></p><p>This time, the evolution of the Dao Phenomenon was different from the last time. The last time was the comprehension of Fuxi's heritage, while this time it was Gu Daoyi's independent creation of a method.</p><p></p><p>Creating a method before even cultivating, and creating an invincible method on the first attempt, was too shocking and unorthodox.</p><p></p><p>If this were to spread, it would definitely shake the myriad realms, causing a great uproar. The myriad realms of all eternity would tremble because of this. Those powerful beings who had relaxed their attention on Gu Daoyi would once again cast their eyes upon him, waiting for an opportunity to move and wanting to strangle Gu Daoyi, never allowing him to grow up safely.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, what could they use to fight against Gu Daoyi?</p><p></p><p>In this life, which concerned immortality, those supreme beings, holy emperors, great emperors, and ancient emperors from the major forbidden areas might become restless, putting pressure on the Gu family and even personally taking action to assassinate Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever wants to lay a hand on Daoyi, this Emperor will slaughter them!" The Void Emperor's voice was ice-cold, causing the void to tremble and his aura to shake the nine heavens and ten earths.</p><p></p><p>Although he had entered his later years with a lifespan of less than five hundred years, he was still at his peak. His peak combat strength, if not the greatest in the world, could at least rank in the top two.</p><p></p><p>Whoever dared to obstruct Gu Daoyi's Dao, he would kill them, killing until there was no one left in heaven or on earth who dared to lay a hand on Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was not only related to his living out a third lifetime and the eternal glory of the Gu family, but he was also his grandson. Although not a direct grandson, he was very close to being one, as he and Gu Taichu had a relationship like father and son.</p><p></p><p>In front of the ancient tree of enlightenment,</p><p></p><p>The many disciples of the Gu family were all exclaiming in amazement, staring intently at Gu Daoyi and the invincible Dao Phenomenon that reflected heaven and earth. Even if they could not fully comprehend it, just grasping a bit of the surface would allow them to benefit immensely.</p><p></p><p>Today, they had already been shocked many times, and could only say that Gu Daoyi truly lived up to being the divine son of the Gu family, a peerless genius with a heaven-defying comprehension, not to be viewed as an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>Not seen for three years, and now appearing for the first time, he had come to the ancient land of enlightenment and achieved enlightenment twice.</p><p></p><p>Once under the ancient stele of Fuxi, obtaining the heritage of Emperor Fuxi; once in front of the ancient tea tree of enlightenment, seemingly creating an invincible method.</p><p></p><p>Countless disciples of the Gu family were extremely grateful that they were born in the same era as Gu Daoyi, able to witness this peerless genius step by step reach the invincible and supreme position, standing atop the myriad realms of all eternity, ruling over all domains.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the third update, continuing the explosive updates!</p><p></p><p>Seeking flowers, seeking evaluation tickets, seeking monthly tickets, seeking rewards! Your support is my motivation to update explosively!</p><p></p><p>Please, dear family members, support me, this little author is kneeling in thanks here!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and add rewards!</p>

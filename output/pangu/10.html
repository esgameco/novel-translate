        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Feeling the gazes of countless members of the Gu family, a faint smile appeared on Gu Qingyao's flawless, fair face.</p><p></p><p>She raised her slender, fair hand and gently struck the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking Realm Palm!"</p><p></p><p>This gentle palm strike now erupted with unparalleled, overwhelming power, heavily slamming into the Fuxi Ancient Stele, causing it to tremble violently and emit a loud "boom" that resounded throughout the entire Divine Land.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, a striking light shone from the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>998,000 jin!</p><p></p><p>A trace of excitement flashed in Gu Qingyao's beautiful eyes. Her palm strike had unleashed a force of nearly 1,000,000 jin, a significant improvement from her test half a year ago, successfully making it onto the rankings.</p><p></p><p>Her gaze swept across the Fuxi Ancient Stele, and sure enough, her name was there, breaking into the top 10,000 in the Physical Realm since ancient times.</p><p></p><p>Rank 9,632: Gu Qingyao!</p><p></p><p>"Wow! Gu Qingyao is too powerful. She actually possesses a force of nearly 1,000,000 jin in the Physical Realm."</p><p></p><p>"It's terrifying! Ordinary cultivators who have cultivated to the peak of the Physical Realm only have a force of 100,000 jin, and typical geniuses at most have 1,000,000 jin, but Gu Qingyao has a force of nearly 10,000,000 jin."</p><p></p><p>"How horrifying! Another peerless genius has emerged from our Gu family in the Desolate Ancient Era!"</p><p></p><p>"In the previous test, Gu Qingyao only had a force of over 700,000 jin. Her improvement in this half-year is too great. She directly increased her physical strength by over 200,000 jin. Could it be that her Yin Body has begun to awaken?"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, 998,000 jin. This number can rank in the top five among the younger generation. In other words, barring any unexpected circumstances, Gu Qingyao will be a leader ranked in the top five of the younger generation in our Gu family of the Desolate Ancient Era."</p><p></p><p>The younger members of the Gu family from all around discussed endlessly, their gazes towards Gu Qingyao extremely complex, filled with admiration, envy, shock, jealousy, adoration...</p><p></p><p>The men looked at Gu Qingyao with adoring eyes, each of them with shining eyes, becoming Gu Qingyao's lapdogs and fanboys, secretly vowing to win over Gu Qingyao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao was a super high-potential stock. Not only was she as beautiful as a celestial maiden, but she also had extremely high potential. In the future, she would at least become a Great Sage. Based on today's performance, the probability of her achieving the realm of Ancient Sage was very high, and even becoming a Quasi-Emperor was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>If they could capture Gu Qingyao's heart, they could become a Sage just by being a kept man.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Gu Qingyao was too aloof, a proud goddess who could only be admired from afar and not defiled. Even several leaders could not recruit her, so they probably had no chance at all.</p><p></p><p>The women's gazes towards Gu Qingyao were mostly filled with admiration, seeing her as a role model and a target to chase after; there were also those who were envious and jealous, but they did not dare to show it.</p><p></p><p>Not only in the Enlightenment Ancient Land, but Gu Qingyao's test results this time also caught the attention of many high-level members of the Gu family in the Desolate Ancient Era. They were very satisfied with her achievements in the Physical Realm and regarded her as a key cultivation target, a prospective leader.</p><p></p><p>As long as her cultivation reached the required level, she could compete for the position of one of the nine leaders of the younger generation in the Gu family. If successful, she would receive countless resources from the Gu family of the Desolate Ancient Era and be vigorously cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao stood in front of the Fuxi Ancient Stele, her demeanor peerless and as if from the heavens. At this moment, her gaze had already calmed down, ignoring the surrounding discussions and gazes, ready to leave.</p><p></p><p>Although she did not enter the top 9,500 on the Fuxi Ancient Stele, she was still very satisfied and decided to practice a bit more.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After his physical body's strength broke through the threshold of ten million jin, he began to work on breaking through to the next major realm.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingyao, have you considered the matter I mentioned to you last time?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a gentle voice rang out in the ancient land of enlightenment, and a woman wearing a green dress with a beautiful and dignified appearance appeared.</p><p></p><p>"How can Gu Lingshuang still have the idea of recruiting Gu Qingyao? Didn't she see the scores and rankings on the Fuxi ancient tablet?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows? She probably thinks that Gu Qingyao is young and has a low cultivation level, so she's easy to deceive."</p><p></p><p>"Shh~ keep your voices down, do you have a death wish? Gu Lingshuang is the younger sister of Gu Linglong, and Gu Linglong is the ninth leader of our Gu family. If she hears you, we'll all be in trouble."</p><p></p><p>As the twin sister of Gu Linglong, the ninth leader of the ancient Gu family, Gu Lingshuang's talent was not as good as Gu Linglong's, but it was still higher than the vast majority of cultivators in the Gu family, and she had already cultivated to the Dao Platform realm.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Lingshuang, go back and tell Gu Linglong that I appreciate her kind intentions." Gu Qingyao shook her head with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingshuang sighed, pursed her red lips, and continued to persuade: "Qingyao, think about it again. Your potential is extremely high. If you have my sister's support, you will get a lot of cultivation resources, and you will definitely become one of the nine leaders in the future."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao's talent was obvious to all, and her Tianyin body was extremely powerful, so Gu Lingshuang had repeatedly tried to recruit her, wanting Gu Qingyao to become a follower of her sister Gu Linglong.</p><p></p><p>Now that Gu Qingyao had shown even higher potential, Gu Lingshuang was even more reluctant to give up. If she had a peerless genius like Gu Qingyao as a follower, Gu Linglong's position within the family would be greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>And Gu Qingyao could also get Gu Linglong's support, giving her countless cultivation resources to help her quickly break through realms and grow up to help each other in the future.</p><p></p><p>"No need." Gu Qingyao still refused.</p><p></p><p>"The person I am willing to follow must be someone who will dominate an era and suppress the nine heavens and ten earths, an unparalleled figure."</p><p></p><p>A strange light flashed in Gu Qingyao's beautiful eyes as she revealed her true thoughts for the first time. She had been waiting for this person to appear.</p><p></p><p>Her future was already brilliant and glorious, with extremely high achievements. Only someone with much higher potential than her and destined to have far greater achievements than her was worthy of her following.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Linglong was the ninth leader of the ancient Gu family, she did not have this qualification. In terms of potential alone, Gu Linglong's future achievements might not even be as high as Gu Qingyao's.</p><p></p><p>At least, in terms of physical realm achievements, she could not compare to Gu Qingyao.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Lingshuang was extremely surprised, and many of the younger members of the Gu family were also shocked. Gu Qingyao's requirements were too high.</p><p></p><p>Someone who could dominate an era and suppress the nine heavens and ten earths, an unparalleled existence, would have to be at least a supreme emperor.</p><p></p><p>But even the strongest leader of the Gu family today did not dare to claim that he would definitely become an emperor.</p><p></p><p>Just as Gu Lingshuang was about to say something, a phoenix came from the horizon, instantly attracting everyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>On top of that phoenix, a figure like a young immortal stood proudly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi had arrived!</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please give flowers!

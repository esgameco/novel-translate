        <div class="content">
            <p>The Imperial Palace, the residence of the most powerful people in the ancient Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu was one of the most powerful people in the ancient Gu family.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient Gu family, he was called the Sixth Patriarch, with the cultivation of a quasi-emperor, and his status was even above the many Gu family elders.</p><p></p><p>He was originally in seclusion, but when the Emperor of the Void issued an order, Gu Yuanwu naturally had to take action. He originally thought it was making a fuss over a trifle, just a God's Son comprehending the Dao, yet he had to make a trip.</p><p></p><p>Who hasn't been a God's Son when they were young?</p><p></p><p>When Gu Yuanwu was young, he was also a God's Son of the Gu family, a peerless genius of his generation, pushing forward bravely, advancing courageously, and killing his way to a formidable reputation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had broken through to the quasi-emperor realm as early as more than 14,000 years ago, shaking the nine heavens and ten earths, and was called one of the most hopeful powerhouses to attain the Dao in the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>However, after learning the details of the matter, Gu Yuanwu's face changed, from initially dismissive, to shocked, to dazed and doubting that he had misheard, and finally becoming excited and agitated.</p><p></p><p>Their ancient Gu family had produced Gu Daoyi, an unparalleled genius surpassing all ages, destined to have an immortal and glorious future, and reach the pinnacle of prosperity.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family only needed to do one thing, which was to protect Gu Daoyi's Dao. As long as Gu Daoyi grew up, the Gu family could be glorious forever.</p><p></p><p>Their Gu family's old patriarchs, elders, grand elders, disciples and so on would all benefit, gaining great advantages from Gu Daoyi, and wouldn't it be easy to break through realms by rubbing off some of Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension?</p><p></p><p>When one attains the Dao, even the dogs and chickens ascend to heaven!</p><p></p><p>In front of the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>Countless Gu family cultivators rushed over upon hearing the news. When they saw the thirteen top-level Dao phenomena, they were all extremely shocked, their scalps tingling and their hearts surging with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>After inquiring, the ignorant cultivators finally understood how earth-shattering it was for Gu Daoyi to comprehend thirteen top-level Dao phenomena reflected by the Fuxi Ancient Stele, and they were even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>Everyone held their breath, concentrated with all their attention, watching this scene, not daring to even breathe heavily, for fear of disturbing Gu Daoyi's Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Some talented Gu family disciples, upon seeing the thirteen top-level Dao phenomena, had a flash of realization in their eyes. They had some breakthroughs just by observing the Dao phenomena, so the God's Son comprehending so many top-level Dao phenomena must have heaven-defying gains.</p><p></p><p>"Too heaven-defying, the God's Son's comprehension is too heaven-defying!" Gu Lingshuang pursed her dry pink lips, secretly thinking in her heart.</p><p></p><p>She finally understood why Gu Daoyi could sit firmly in the position of the Gu family's God's Son even with a mortal body, recognized by the Emperor of the Void and the patriarchs and elders.</p><p></p><p>They had long known that Gu Daoyi's comprehension was heaven-defying!</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't sister come yet?" Gu Lingshuang anxiously called out in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The God's Son appeared before them for the first time, already displaying such earth-shattering performance. His future was limitless, and barring any accidents, he would certainly attain the Dao and become an emperor.</p><p></p><p>Although she and her sister had good talent, with her sister Gu Linglong even being one of the leaders of the younger generation in the Gu family, compared to the God's Son, they were still far behind.</p><p></p><p>If they could become followers of the God's Son and grab onto his coattails in advance, then they would also have boundless</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingshuang still wanted to become Gu Daoyi's woman if possible, so that she could bind the divine son. Unfortunately, Gu Daoyi was only three years old now and didn't seem interested in her yet. </p><p></p><p>Gu Lingshuang decided to discuss with her sister how to curry favor with him. They were a pair of incomparably beautiful twin sisters coveted by countless cultivators. Surely the divine son wouldn't be able to resist.</p><p></p><p>If her countless admirers knew about these thoughts of hers, they would probably be heartbroken.</p><p></p><p>"He really succeeded!" </p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao's eyes sparkled with excitement as she murmured to herself.</p><p></p><p>The person she wanted to follow had appeared!</p><p></p><p>The Fuxi Ancient Stele contained the Dao of Emperor Fuxi and his legacy. This information had been passed down for countless years, but geniuses who could truly comprehend Fuxi's Dao and successfully enter Fuxi's space were extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>According to records, even those unmatched geniuses and peerless talents could only comprehend part of Emperor Fuxi's legacy. The number and quality of Dao phenomena they derived were far inferior to Gu Daoyi's.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely that Gu Daoyi had completely comprehended Emperor Fuxi's legacy. His comprehension ability was too heaven-defying. Countless unmatched geniuses had stated that no one could do it as the time Emperor Fuxi gave was too short.</p><p></p><p>But Gu Daoyi did it!</p><p></p><p>This proved that Gu Daoyi's comprehension ability was countless times higher than those geniuses and talents.</p><p></p><p>Those unmatched geniuses who entered Fuxi's space all achieved great accomplishments later on, without any premature deaths. They at least became ancient saints, and a few even became quasi-emperors.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was countless times stronger than those geniuses. Barring any accidents, he was certain to prove his Dao. In the future, he would dominate the nine heavens, suppress the ten lands, and reign supreme over all realms for eternity.</p><p></p><p>This was the kind of person Gu Qingyao wanted to follow!</p><p></p><p>None of the other leaders of the Gu family were worthy of her allegiance, not even the most outstanding one.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder I, Huang Weiyao, am willing to follow him!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyao stood not far behind Gu Daoyi, guarding his Dao. She was closest to him and personally witnessed all this. The shock in her heart took a long time to subside.</p><p></p><p>Her beautiful eyes were filled with extraordinary splendor as she looked at Gu Daoyi, and a hint of special thoughts arose in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The divine son of the Gu family in this generation was truly too outstanding and heaven-defying. His comprehension ability was extremely heaven-defying, the greatest in all eternity!</p><p></p><p>Before she was sealed, Huang Weiyao lived in the Primordial Era and had seen her mother, the phoenix, who was one of the Ten Fiends. She had also seen some other supreme god-emperors. But the achievements of those emperor-level powerhouses at this age paled in comparison to Gu Daoyi's.</p><p></p><p>"If you were born in the Primordial Era, you would definitely be the supreme celestial venerate; born in the Primordial Era, you would definitely be the strongest celestial emperor...... Born in the current era, you will become the unparalleled celestial emperor!" Huang Weiyao murmured in her heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Daoyi slowly woke up.</p><p></p><p>PS: Ten updates every day! Ten updates every day!

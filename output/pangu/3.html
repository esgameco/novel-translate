        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"I have comprehended the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"I have created a technique!"</p><p></p><p>"I have achieved success!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi exclaimed repeatedly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Held in the embrace of the Gu Family's Great Emperor, feeling the supreme and powerful aura of the Great Emperor, and sensing the laws of the Great Dao surrounding him, countless brilliant insights and infinite wonders of the Dao appeared in Gu Daoyi's mind, as if he was roaming in the ocean of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>He took some time to analyze, and then deduced a cultivation technique, which was a simplified version of the technique practiced by the Gu Family's Great Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Gu Family's heritage in the Desolate Ancient times had lasted for countless years, producing several Great Emperors and even seizing some from the outside world. They possessed more than a dozen Emperor Scriptures, and the Great Emperor's scripture was called the "Void Scripture".</p><p></p><p>The Void Scripture was the Dao-proving technique of the Gu Family's Great Emperor. He previously learned the Gu Family's techniques and went out to train and kill, eventually finding his own path and creating a technique most suitable for himself.</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor of the Gu Family had an extremely resounding title in the Xuan Huang World - the Void Emperor!</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor proved the Dao with endless void, mastering the ultimate limits of space. He possessed heaven-defying means and extremely powerful combat strength. He was invincible in the Innate Realm, once slaying a Supreme with a single Void Realm, staining it with endless blood and shocking the Xuan Huang World.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's comprehension was heaven-defying. Just by comprehending the aura of the Void Emperor for a while, he had already gained insights into a simplified version of the "Void Scripture", which he named the "Minor Void Scripture".</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had comprehended the Dao after being born with heaven-defying comprehension. He felt extremely thrilled, as heaven-defying comprehension could truly do as one wished.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi believed that if he could finish reading the entire Void Scripture, with his heaven-defying comprehension, he would definitely be able to comprehend an even more profound technique, perhaps even stronger than the Void Scripture.</p><p></p><p>When someone with heaven-defying comprehension stands on the shoulders of giants, it's not as simple as one plus one being greater than two, but rather greater than ten, greater than a hundred...</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the "Minor Void Scripture", Gu Daoyi only needed to move his thoughts, and the technique would automatically circulate. He could then cultivate this technique to completion.</p><p></p><p>As long as he was willing, Gu Daoyi could embark on the path of cultivation relying on the Minor Void Scripture, then advance by leaps and bounds, reaching a very high realm in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Gu Daoyi was unwilling. Cultivating to a profound realm and then changing techniques would be somewhat troublesome. He would rather integrate myriad techniques to create the most suitable one for himself before stepping onto the path of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Daoyi came back to his senses, the Great Emperor of the Gu Family had already disappeared. He was in his swaddling clothes, with his mother Ji Mingyue carefully attending to him, a smile always hanging on her beautiful face, but with a hint of worry between her brows.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi knew the reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Mother was worried about Father. Gu Taichu was trapped in a forbidden area. Although his life was not in danger, he would inevitably suffer.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's gaze shifted away from Ji Mingyue and glanced around the Chengdao Palace, still extremely satisfied with his current situation.</p><p></p><p>His father was the patriarch of the Desolate Ancient Gu Family, and his mother was the Divine Maiden of the Desolate Ancient Ji Family. Gu Daoyi held an extremely high status in both of these ancient family clans.</p><p></p><p>He also had the "grandfather" Void Emperor, the Desolate...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Although the Gu family's current strength is not as great as the Gu family's, their ancestors also produced many great emperors in the past, with imperial weapons guarding them and quasi-emperor level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Chengdao Palace, this is a powerful quasi-imperial weapon, engraved with quasi-imperial level Dao runes. Many inspirations flashed through Gu Daoyi's mind, and many wonderful Dao principles appeared. As long as he was willing, he could easily create a batch of techniques and divine powers with it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi did not do this. Techniques and divine powers are refined rather than numerous. Even if the techniques and divine powers he creates now are not weak, and those below the sage level can use them with great power, he looks down on them.</p><p></p><p>Under the influence, Gu Daoyi has a clear understanding of the cultivation system of this world.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation system has a total of twenty major realms, namely: Physical Realm, Spirit Sea Realm, Divine Power Realm, Grotto-Heaven Realm, Dharma Image Realm, Nascent Soul Realm, Yang God Realm, True Soul Realm, Dao Platform Realm, Venerable Realm, Marquis Realm, King Realm, Emperor Realm, Great Power Realm, Sage Realm, Sage King Realm, Great Sage Realm, Ancient Sage Realm, Quasi-Emperor Realm, and Great Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>Each realm has nine heavenly layers, with the exception of the Great Emperor Realm, which has no division of nine heavenly layers.</p><p></p><p>The later the realm, the stronger the power. However, due to the great changes in the world before the ancient times, the strong were shackled with a lifespan lock. Even the strongest emperors such as Great Emperors, God Emperors, and Supreme Beings could only live for 50,000 years.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, all the Great Emperors, God Emperors, and Supreme Beings are aiming to become immortals and ascend to the immortal realm, so as to live forever and look down on the cycle of time. However, the immortal gate is not open, the immortal path is hidden, and no one has become an immortal for countless ages.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's comprehension is extraordinary. Before he was born, he already had a goal. He wants to be invincible in this world, then break the lifespan shackles and attain the Dao to become an immortal.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing his gaze, Gu Daoyi looked at his mother Ji Mingyue, wanting to speak, but not knowing how to speak.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue discovered this scene and said with a smile, "My son Daoyi, you want to speak as soon as you are born? Wait a few more days."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the way Ji Mingyue spoke, Gu Daoyi naturally comprehended and immediately called out, "Mother, I can speak. I learn as soon as I am taught."</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue was a little shocked. Her son Gu Daoyi actually opened his mouth and spoke. His voice was very crisp and childish, but clear and smooth.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Gu Daoyi is one who is born with knowledge?</p><p></p><p>Before Ji Mingyue could ask, Gu Daoyi continued, "Mother, I just comprehended the Dao in the arms of the Great Emperor and created a technique. I call it the 'Minor Void Scripture'. Do you want to hear it?"</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue's red lips opened into an O shape, her face full of shock, her eyes full of disbelief and incredulity.</p><p></p><p>Her throat moved, gulping down a few mouthfuls of saliva, before asking in a daze, "Really?"</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please give flowers!

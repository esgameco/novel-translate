        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"As our child, you bear a heavy responsibility from the moment you were born. It doesn't matter if you don't have a special physique. With us and the Gu family's cultivation, you can still rise up and overcome everything."</p><p></p><p>"Throughout history, those who have become emperors with ordinary bodies are no longer a minority. You must not be discouraged. You are the divine son of the Gu family, the future invincible one."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the baby in her arms, Ji Mingyue spoke solemnly. She wanted to cultivate an invincible belief in Gu Daoyi, not to be discouraged from now on.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue was fully aware of Gu Daoyi's situation and the reaction of the Gu family elders. She did not blame anyone. As a mother, she would never give up on cultivating Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>Her husband was the world-renowned White-Robed God King, unparalleled in combat power. Even if Gu Daoyi was only an ordinary body, with their careful cultivation, he would surely have great achievements in the future.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ji Mingyue suddenly noticed that the baby's mouth was slightly open, as if saying "good". Ji Mingyue instantly understood and smiled, her beauty peerless.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gu Daoyi so intelligent, Ji Mingyue felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>A smile also appeared on Gu Daoyi's little face. His face was not wrinkled, but fair and round, lustrous, with distinct features. He was the embryo of a peerless handsome man.</p><p></p><p>"When my Daoyi grows up, he will definitely be able to charm countless goddesses and heavenly maidens," Ji Mingyue said with a smile, completely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi did not want his mother to worry, so he responded to her. Seeing this, he also breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He was very satisfied with the name Gu Daoyi. In his previous life, he was called by this name, so naturally, he hoped to be called this in this life as well.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was worried that his parents would give him some common names, such as Changsheng, Changge, Xiaoyao, Zhantian, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Later, his father Gu Taichu made the decision to name him "Gu Daoyi". Ji Mingyue and many Gu family elders were also very satisfied, so it was decided.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Gu Taichu, Gu Daoyi felt a little headache. This was his father. Although he had never met him, Gu Daoyi still had deep feelings for him.</p><p></p><p>In the past few years, in order to give him a stronger origin while in the womb, Gu Taichu had sacrificed a lot for him. Three years ago, he even went out to forcibly enter a forbidden area to seize a "Dao Bearing Fruit", but unfortunately, he was trapped inside.</p><p></p><p>Because the Gu Family Emperor was still alive, even if Gu Taichu forcibly entered the forbidden area, he would not die, at most he would be trapped. Gu Daoyi decided to find an opportunity to rescue his father in the future.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared silently in Chengdao Palace, dressed in purple, with a supreme and powerful aura all over his body, as if he could crush myriad worlds. Although hidden and not released, it captured people's minds. Anyone who saw him would have to worship him.</p><p></p><p>The person who came was none other than an incarnation of the Gu Family Emperor.</p><p></p><p>He had been paying attention before and after Gu Daoyi's birth, worried that enemies would launch a surprise attack. In the end, it was a false alarm, but he would rather have a real enemy attack.</p><p></p><p>Many Gu family elders left disappointed because Gu Daoyi did not have a special physique. Although the Gu Family Emperor was also a little disappointed, he did not give up because of this.</p><p></p><p>What does it matter if he has an ordinary body? He can still attain the Dao and become an emperor!</p><p></p><p>In the Xuanhuang world, there were once...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>There have been nine mortals who have attained the Dao. Among them, one had the most tortuous path. With a mortal body, he became an emperor after ten thousand defeats, shaking the ancient and modern times, with a prestige that will last for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can hold out until Gu Taichu attains the Dao, shielding him from those who would obstruct his path, then Gu Taichu can protect the Dao for his son Gu Daoyi. In this way, the Gu family can prosper endlessly, remaining incomparably glorious and splendid.</p><p></p><p>"Great Emperor!" </p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue discovered the incarnation of the Gu family's Great Emperor and hurriedly paid her respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mingyue, there is no need for such formalities."</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's Great Emperor spoke, and as his words fell, an invisible great power lifted Ji Mingyue up.</p><p></p><p>He had fought battles all his life, killing countless people, causing the reputation of the ancient Gu family to rise to another level. But time is like a blade that slays even the proudest, and even the Great Emperor cannot resist the passage of time. He had already entered his later years.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at this time, Gu Taichu appeared, emerging from among the Gu family's younger generation with an unrivaled bearing. Dressed in white, he was peerless, sweeping through the three thousand Dao prefectures with no equal, his name shaking the primordial realm.</p><p></p><p>He had no offspring, and Gu Taichu was the most valued among the Gu family's younger generation. He went to great lengths to protect his Dao, only wanting to cultivate another Great Emperor for the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>In his early years, Gu Taichu's parents had both passed away. He and Gu Taichu had a relationship of both teacher and father. He passed on all he had learned in his life, the torch being passed from one to another, continuing the Gu family's glorious splendor.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue and Gu Daoyi had an extremely close relationship with the Gu family's Great Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ji Mingyue nodded and no longer stood on ceremony. The look in her eyes as she gazed at the Gu family's Great Emperor held a trace of expectation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor's achievements touched upon the workings of creation, and his power was unrivaled. Perhaps he could create an ultimate physique for Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's Great Emperor understood her meaning and shook his head slightly. He could create a physique for Gu Daoyi, but it could not be the ultimate one. It would be better to let Gu Daoyi cultivate with a mortal body; his future achievements might be even higher.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue was a bit disappointed but didn't mind too much.</p><p></p><p>"Mingyue, let me have a good look at Daoyi." The Gu family's Great Emperor spoke.</p><p></p><p>Ji Mingyue handed the infant in swaddling clothes over, and the Gu family's Great Emperor took him in his arms, a kind smile appearing on his stern face.</p><p></p><p>He carefully looked Gu Daoyi over, growing more and more satisfied the more he looked. Gu Daoyi was extraordinary from birth, without a physique that would leave him slightly flawed. But after some honing, his future achievements would be limitless.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, the Dao produces one, one produces two, two produces three, three produces all things. All things are all Daos. When you understand the source and realize the Dao, that will be the day you soar and transform into a dragon."</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's Great Emperor softly spoke as he looked at Gu Daoyi's pure gaze, then looked at Ji Mingyue and said, "Daoyi's status as a divine son will not change."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Great Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Taking back Gu Daoyi, Ji Mingyue was endlessly grateful, a smile appearing on her incomparably beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family's Great Emperor nodded slightly, and his incarnation dispersed within the Hall of Dao Attainment.</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please give flowers!

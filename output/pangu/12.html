            <p>"The Fuxi Ancient Stele is used to test the strength of the physical body. The Divine Son hasn't cultivated yet, so why is he approaching the Fuxi Ancient Stele?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. How can we fathom the thoughts of the Divine Son?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think it's possible that the Divine Son wants to comprehend the Fuxi Ancient Stele?"</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? Although the Fuxi Ancient Stele contains part of Emperor Fuxi's Great Dao, there have only been a few throughout history who have thoroughly understood it. Even the most outstanding geniuses can only comprehend the superficial aspects."</p><p></p><p>"I also think it's impossible. The Divine Son is only three years old. In the past three years, there has been no movement, and he seems ordinary. Perhaps the Divine Son just wants to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Many of the Gu family members whispered to each other, all with puzzled expressions, curious about what Gu Daoyi was doing at the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingshuang sighed softly, secretly complaining that the Divine Son had poor taste, actually ignoring her, a stunning beauty. Her appearance was only slightly inferior to Gu Qingyao, but her figure was much more voluptuous and alluring than Gu Qingyao's.</p><p></p><p>A trace of unusual color flashed in Gu Qingyao's beautiful eyes. She did not agree with the views of those Gu family members. This Divine Son was not a simple character.</p><p></p><p>The girl in the pink dress was a young phoenix, one of the Ten Fiercest Beasts, and a supreme princess. Yet she was willing to let Gu Daoyi ride on her back and followed closely behind him, seemingly becoming Gu Daoyi's follower. </p><p></p><p>The Ten Fiercest Beasts were all extremely proud beings. They would not simply follow orders from the Gu family elders or the Void Emperor. Gu Daoyi must have convinced the girl in the pink dress.</p><p></p><p>To be able to make the young phoenix, a princess among the Ten Fiercest Beasts, willingly follow him, Gu Daoyi, even if he was only a mortal body, must have some heaven-defying aspects.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gu Daoyi really seemed to want to comprehend the Fuxi Ancient Stele, a bold idea emerged in Gu Qingyao's mind. She couldn't help but want to gasp, but she forcibly held it back.</p><p></p><p>If her guess was true, then Gu Daoyi being the Divine Son of the Gu family would be well-deserved, not relying on the relationship with the family head, the White-Robed Divine King Gu Taichu.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor would not allow the Gu family head and elders to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was not clear about everyone's thoughts. He simply wanted to come and comprehend the Fuxi Ancient Stele. He was temporarily not interested in the stunning beauties like Gu Qingyao and Gu Lingshuang.</p><p></p><p>He was still young. When he grew up, it wouldn't be too late to talk about these things. Putting the cart before the horse was not feasible.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he already had a stunning beauty in a pink dress. In all aspects, Huang Weiyang was superior to Gu Qingyao and Gu Lingshuang.</p><p></p><p>He understood the Void Emperor's intention. This was equivalent to his child bride, cultivating their feelings would naturally lead to a successful marriage.</p><p></p><p>With Huang Weiyang by his side, Gu Daoyi's standards had been raised.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi circled the Fuxi Ancient Stele twice, his eyes flashing with bright lights. Many insights arose in his heart, and various profound mysteries appeared in his mind. He simply sat cross-legged in front of the Fuxi Ancient Stele and entered a state of comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Dao was a great fortune and opportunity that countless cultivators sought after. But for Gu Daoyi, whose comprehension was heaven-defying, it was not an exaggeration to say that he could comprehend the Dao at any time.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, as long as he focused on comprehending something, he would naturally enter a state of comprehending the Dao. Sometimes, he only needed to take a casual glance, hear certain words, or pass by somewhere to enter...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a state of enlightenment, he comprehended various profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>A stunningly beautiful young girl in a pink dress stood behind Gu Daoyi, her energy subtly separating the surroundings to prevent anyone from interrupting Gu Daoyi's enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Can he succeed?"</p><p></p><p>"He will definitely succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang's beautiful eyes flashed, filled with extreme anticipation.</p><p></p><p>She had heard many of Gu Daoyi's deeds and had personally witnessed how unbelievably perceptive Gu Daoyi was, and she was completely convinced by him.</p><p></p><p>A certain extremely powerful magical art that she had been painstakingly comprehending, Gu Daoyi only needed to look at it once to gain some understanding. After that, he meditated on the spot for half a quarter of an hour, and when he woke up, he pointed out the difficulties and profundities within it.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Daoyi's help, Huang Weiyang quickly succeeded in cultivating this extremely powerful magical art, greatly increasing her strength.</p><p></p><p>There were many instances like this. The many techniques, magical arts, and profound skills that she cultivated were all pointed out by Gu Daoyi one by one, filling in the gaps and breaking through the shackles of difficulties.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but her cultivation speed also increased by many times. In just one month, she rose from the seventh level of the Fenhuang Realm to the peak of the ninth level of the Fenhuang Realm, only one step away from the Great Power Realm.</p><p></p><p>According to the original estimate, she would need at least two years to cultivate to this point.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding members of the Gu family all held their breath and watched Gu Daoyi's enlightenment, none of them daring to make a sound for fear of disturbing the Divine Son, which would be a great sin.</p><p></p><p>The news of Divine Son Gu Daoyi's enlightenment in front of the Fuxi Ancient Stele quickly spread throughout the entire Enlightenment Ancient Land and spread towards the entire Divine Continent, with more and more cultivators rushing over.</p><p></p><p>One was out of curiosity about this Gu family's Divine Son, whom they had only heard of but never seen. The second was to see the legendary Ancient Ten Fierceness and the Phoenix Chick. The third was to find out what Gu Daoyi could comprehend from the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was true enlightenment or just pretense, everything would be known once Gu Daoyi woke up.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang's gaze swept coldly around, and all the members of the Gu family retreated a few steps, leaving enough space for Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>A hint of satisfaction flashed in Huang Weiyang's beautiful eyes. From beginning to end, she never spoke, as it was her nature, and Huang Weiyang did not want to change it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Huang Weiyang's expression trembled, and she immediately looked at Gu Daoyi, her stunningly beautiful face showing a shocked expression, her phoenix lips gradually opening wide.</p><p></p><p>"He really did it..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Gu Daoyi had already comprehended the critical moment.</p><p></p><p>His entire body was enveloped in a hazy purple aura, which was a thick meaning of the Dao, the profundities of the Dao, and endless rules and runes danced around him, constructing one after another wonderful scene and strange phenomenon, the light was dazzling, illuminating the sky.</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely immersed in enlightenment, connecting with the Dao marks, Dao meanings, Dao profundities, Dao rhythms, Dao principles... contained in the Fuxi Ancient Stele, and entered a strange space that seemed to be the great Dao space of all Fuxi Ancient Steles.</p><p></p><p>Here, he saw the Fuxi Emperor of the ancient times!</p><p></p><p>PS: Is anyone reading this? Is writing original xuanhuan fantasy on Feilu really a dead end?</p><p></p><p>If no one reads the ten updates every day, the little author can only leave.</p><p></p><p>Please support the little author, who kneels and thanks you here!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

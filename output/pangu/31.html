        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The ancient emperors Taiyi, Yuhua, and the supreme Hengyu Daozun all fell silent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>They knew each other quite well and had some understanding of each other's Dao. With their profound cultivation and keen insight, they heard the same question.</p><p></p><p>After listening to Leiyuan Shenhuang's discourse on the Dao, Gu Dao described Leiyuan Shenhuang's Dao of Thunder in a way that was even more profound than Leiyuan Shenhuang himself, making Leiyuan Shenhuang's understanding seem biased in comparison.</p><p></p><p>This shocked the supreme emperors.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but glance at the Gu family cultivators around them, from the younger generation to the various patriarchs and ancestors. None of them had fully comprehended the Dao of any of these supreme beings, and they were still immersed in contemplation, their brows furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Yet Gu Dao not only comprehended their Dao as soon as they spoke, but also innovated and comprehended their Dao to a deeper level. He even lectured these supreme emperors on their own Dao in a way that convinced them.</p><p></p><p>In other words, after listening, Gu Dao comprehended and surpassed Leiyuan Shenhuang in his corresponding Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was simply astounding!</p><p></p><p>He truly deserved to be called a peerless prodigy with heaven-defying comprehension!</p><p></p><p>In terms of comprehension, not only were the other Gu family cultivators far behind Gu Dao, even these supreme emperors had to admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>Chi Yan Daozun, Xuan Di, Xu Kong Dadi and the others exchanged glances, and a shocking thought suddenly arose in their minds: "If Gu Dao is willing, could he quickly attain the Dao and become an emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Previously, they didn't have this idea, as it was too heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, countless supreme beings, god emperors, Dao lords, ancient emperors, and great emperors had competed. The myriad worlds had seen countless era-defining prodigies and unrivaled geniuses. The average age of attaining the Dao was three thousand years old, which was very short compared to the lifespan of one hundred thousand years at the imperial realm.</p><p></p><p>If one's talent and comprehension were top-notch even among the imperial realm, then the time to attain the Dao could even be around two thousand years old.</p><p></p><p>However, throughout the ages, those who attained the Dao within one thousand five hundred years could be counted on one hand, and those who did so within a thousand years were almost non-existent.</p><p></p><p>Although there were some legends in ancient history about those who attained the Dao within a thousand years, upon serious investigation, they could all be proven false.</p><p></p><p>For example, among the eight imperial realm experts present, the fastest to attain the Dao was Xu Kong Dadi, who took over one thousand eight hundred years. Next were Taiyi Guhuang, Hengyu Daozun and Xuan Di, who all took around two thousand years. Jiu Tian Fenghuang, Leiyuan Shenhuang, Chi Yan Daozun and Yuhua Guhuang all did it within three thousand years.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Dao attained the Dao within a hundred years or even ten years, it would be unparalleled in ancient and modern times, an achievement that would shock the ages.</p><p></p><p>The supreme emperors felt this was possible.</p><p></p><p>They had comprehended their respective Dao extremely deeply and had long attained the Dao. After becoming emperors, they had contemplated for at least one hundred thousand years. Yet even at this level, they were no match for Gu Dao.</p><p></p><p>For example, Leiyuan Shenhuang originally belonged to the top tier of god emperors, but had not yet entered the realm of celestial emperors. However, after countless years of discussing the Dao with the various imperial realm experts, this imprinted body's understanding of the Dao...</p><p></p><p>Here is the English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wu has already reached the Heavenly Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>If his true body had not died and he had retrieved his branded body and gained insights into the Great Dao, he could have instantly elevated his combat power to the Heavenly Emperor realm and been called the Thunder Abyss Heavenly Emperor.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, the Heavenly Emperors were still in the Emperor realm, comparable to the Divine Emperors among the Great Emperors. They were many times stronger than ordinary Emperors. Although they couldn't kill with a raise of their hand, they didn't need many moves either.</p><p></p><p>The current Void Great Emperor is at this stage.</p><p></p><p>As for Gu Dao Yi, his current insight into the Thunder Dao is even deeper than the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor's. Doesn't this mean that as long as Gu Dao Yi is willing, he can quickly attain the Dao and become an Emperor, even entering the Divine Emperor stage and being very powerful at that level?</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi's understanding of the Great Dao has reached an extremely profound level, so there will be no bottlenecks or shackles to speak of on his cultivation path.</p><p></p><p>The essence of cultivation is practicing the Dao. The realms were pioneered by predecessors to allow later generations to better comprehend the Great Dao and enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor had almost fully digested the essence of the Thunder Dao explained by Gu Dao Yi. He originally wanted to ask about the remaining two key points but inexplicably asked:</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, you couldn't really attain the Dao and become an Emperor within a hundred years, or even a Divine Emperor, right?"</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings at the Emperor realm, such as Tai Yi Ancient Emperor, Heng Yu Dao Venerable, Xuan Emperor, and Yu Hua Ancient Emperor, immediately looked at Gu Dao Yi, their gazes burning with anticipation for his answer.</p><p></p><p>The Void Great Emperor was especially expectant. If Gu Dao Yi could attain the Dao within a hundred years, although it would be too shocking, if he could achieve this epoch-making feat, it would make things much easier for him.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Dao Yi shouldering the Ancient Gu Family, he could live out his third life with peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>The Undying Law, although heaven-defying, could allow an Emperor to live out their next life, but it could not be accomplished in one fell swoop. There would be a transformation period in between, which was also the most vulnerable time.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, using the Undying Law to live out the next life was simpler and better than forcibly transforming and defying the heavens to live out the next life by relying on one's own strength. This was because after passing the transformation period, one could recover their peak combat power.</p><p></p><p>However, the Undying Law was not so easy to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Gu Dao Yi's eyes flickered slightly. He smiled and nodded, saying, "More or less."</p><p></p><p>Attaining the Dao within a hundred years?</p><p></p><p>That was underestimating him too much.</p><p></p><p>As long as Gu Dao Yi wanted, he could attain the Dao and become an Emperor with a single thought!</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, he could attain the Dao using the Void, the Thunder, the Tai Yi...</p><p></p><p>He was now incomparable to his past self. After listening to the Seven Emperors' teachings on the Dao, his understanding of their Daos had reached an extremely profound level, to the point where he could attain the Dao at any time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he also had deep insights into the Daos of Emperor Fu Xi and Emperor Maitreya. Although he couldn't become a Divine Emperor with a single thought, he could still attain the Dao with a single thought.</p>

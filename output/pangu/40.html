        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Gu Dao felt that this enlightened ancient tea tree was very intelligent, but he did not refuse this fate.</p><p></p><p>Because the Enlightenment Bracelet was indeed of great use to him, it could accelerate his growth and greatly reduce the time needed to accumulate his foundation.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he only needed to casually help the ancient tea tree break its shackles.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao also wanted to see if the Elixir of Immortality could truly attain the Dao and become an emperor after taking form and cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir of Immortality was already born with innate advantages. Once it broke free from its restraints and shackles, and attained the Dao to become an emperor, its combat power would likely be extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>"An eternal green lotus in the ancient sky!" The ancient and hoary voice of the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree rang out again, with only seven short words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao's eyes flashed, and his heart trembled slightly.</p><p></p><p>He had heard these seven words before, which spoke of a supreme being at the Emperor Realm among the demon race. It was said that he was the incarnation of the Primordial Green Lotus of the Elixir of Immortality, who had attained the Dao and became an emperor.</p><p></p><p>His combat power had once been unmatched in the world, reaching the level of a Divine Emperor, and his prestige was peerless.</p><p></p><p>This Demon Divine Emperor and the Mysterious Emperor existed in the same era of the Middle Ancient Times, only that the Mysterious Emperor was in the early period of the Middle Ancient Times, while this Demon Divine Emperor was in the mid to late period.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that the legend is very likely true."</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao spoke to himself in his heart, but a look of interest appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Middle Ancient Times was tens of thousands of years ago from now. Although that Demon Divine Emperor was unparalleled and lived for three lifetimes, he should have reached the end of his lifespan.</p><p></p><p>As early as a hundred thousand years ago, there was no trace of that Demon Divine Emperor, and the emperor's position was also vacated.</p><p></p><p>People suspected that he had most likely died.</p><p></p><p>Almost no one thought that the Demon Divine Emperor would slash himself with a sword and enter the forbidden zone, because he was too proud and disdained to do so after living for three lifetimes.</p><p></p><p>There were also legends that he had found the path to immortality, embarked on a journey, and disappeared into the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao withdrew his thoughts and was about to have Huang Weian take him out of the ancient land of enlightenment when he saw two people appear beside him.</p><p></p><p>He happened to recognize both of them.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Elder of the Ancient Gu Family: Gu Yuanwu!</p><p></p><p>The Third Elder of the Ancient Gu Family: Gu Changge!</p><p></p><p>As the divine son of the Gu family, Gu Dao's comprehension was unparalleled, and his status in the Ancient Gu Family was extremely high, almost comparable to the Void Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao basically knew how deep the foundation of the Ancient Gu Family was, what supreme opportunities and fortunes they had, and how many powerhouses there were.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Third Ancestor and Sixth Ancestor." Gu Dao bowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Divine Son~"</p><p></p><p>The Third Ancestor Gu Changge and Sixth Ancestor Gu Yuanwu returned the greeting, their tone carrying a hint of respect.</p><p></p><p>Although they were Quasi-Emperors with prestige that shook the Primordial World, they were truly not worthy in front of Gu Dao.</p><p></p><p>This person was an unparalleled and peerless genius who could suppress eight emperors during debates, and would attain the Dao and become an emperor in at most a hundred years. No one would doubt this now.</p><p></p><p>For Quasi-Emperors, a hundred years passed in the blink of an eye. They looked at Gu Dao as if they were looking at a supreme emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Do the two Elders have any important matters for coming here?" Gu Dao asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weian stood beside him, dressed in a pink dress, her face exquisitely beautiful like carved jade, her temperament graceful and elegant. At this moment, she obediently and sensibly took two steps back, a</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Gu Changge looked at Gu Yuanwu and shrugged, indicating for him to speak first.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu smiled helplessly. This time, the third brother had become the protector of the divine son Gu Daoyi, turning misfortune into a blessing. The twists and turns of life were truly unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, the Emperor has commanded me to come here to announce some decisions regarding you. You have the right to decide whether to listen here."</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu stated his purpose, his voice loud and full of vigor, but it did not travel outside, as he had isolated it. Only the four of them could hear it.</p><p></p><p>"Speak." Gu Daoyi nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>Gu Yuanwu immediately removed the barrier and looked at the countless Gu family cultivators in the ancient land of enlightenment. With a solemn expression, he said:</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor decrees that the divine son Gu Daoyi is virtuous and talented, with extraordinary aptitude and unparalleled comprehension. In seven years, a tenth birthday banquet will be held, inviting the strong and proud heroes of the Xuanhuang world to come and celebrate, and he will be officially appointed as the chief leader."</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor decrees that the divine son Gu Daoyi is also conferred the title of Gu Family's Sword Wielding Lord, able to mobilize all resources of the Gu family. Seeing the divine son is like seeing the Emperor of the Void."</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor decrees that the divine son Gu Daoyi is also conferred the title of Gu Family's Cauldron Presiding Lord, wielding all the great powers of the Gu family and able to mobilize all its forces."</p><p></p><p>The loud and majestic voice resounded in the ancient land of enlightenment and throughout the entire Divine Continent, awakening countless Gu family cultivators who were still comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the cultivators and all the powerhouses of the Gu family looked towards the ancient land of enlightenment, their hearts stirred by raging waves that took a long time to calm down.</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators of the Gu family were shocked by the three orders from the Emperor of the Void. The Emperor of the Void treated the divine son Gu Daoyi too well, far surpassing the treatment even the previous family head Gu Taichu had received.</p><p></p><p>Before Gu Daoyi was born, he was already made the divine son of the Gu family. Once he began cultivating, he would receive the best nurturing and enjoy the best resources and treatment from the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Now, at only three years old, Gu Daoyi was actually conferred the titles of Gu Family's Sword Wielding Lord and Cauldron Presiding Lord, able to mobilize all the resources and forces of the Gu family. Seeing him was like seeing the Emperor. It could be said that the Emperor of the Void had officially established Gu Daoyi's identity and status, second only to himself.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at the tenth birthday banquet, the Emperor would invite the proud heroes and powerhouses of the Xuanhuang world, conferring upon Gu Daoyi the title of chief leader, spreading his name across the myriad domains.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of the Void was too partial to the divine son Gu Daoyi!</p><p></p><p>This was the first thought that surfaced in the minds of countless Gu family cultivators, but they quickly smiled bitterly. No one went to envy or be jealous.</p><p></p><p>The divine son Gu Daoyi was worthy of these identities and deserved such a supreme status.</p><p></p><p>Today, they had all witnessed how terrifyingly and unnaturally high Gu Daoyi's comprehension was, and they were certain he could lead the ancient Gu family towards immortal glory.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor is really generous, tsk tsk."</p><p></p><p>Ancestor Gu Changge was also surprised when he heard this. He didn't know beforehand and sighed with emotion at the Emperor of the Void's magnanimity.</p><p></p><p>PS: Begging for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Upon hearing these words, the entire hall was shocked!</p><p></p><p>"This little girl has quite the discerning eye and no small amount of courage."</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang's lips curled up slightly, her gaze falling on Gu Daoyi in front of her, wondering if he would accept Gu Qingyao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao had immense potential and a powerful physique. With some cultivation, she would at least become an Ancient Saint in the future. With Gu Daoyi's assistance, it wouldn't be difficult for her to become a Quasi-Emperor, and she might even have some hope of transcending and becoming an Emperor.</p><p></p><p>He should accept her, right? </p><p></p><p>After all, this little girl had a face as exquisite as a carved jade statue.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, Gu Qingyao actually said it out loud in front of everyone." Gu Lingshuang exclaimed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Gu Qingyao with surprise in her eyes. Wasn't she afraid that the Divine Son would refuse?</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingshuang was also anxious, blaming her sister for not arriving sooner. If the Divine Son agreed, then Gu Qingyao would become his first follower.</p><p></p><p>She had already reserved this position for her sister.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingshuang couldn't help but look at that figure, who seemed like a young immortal banished from heaven, with complex emotions. She both wanted the Divine Son to agree and didn't want him to agree.</p><p></p><p>The potential Gu Qingyao displayed was even greater than her sister's. If even Gu Qingyao didn't succeed, could her sister succeed?</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingyao actually wants to become the Divine Son's follower!"</p><p></p><p>"Tsk, Gu Qingyao is very proud. She rejected the recruitment of three leaders in a row, but now she's actively throwing herself into the Divine Son's arms."</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu~ My goddess! If Gu Qingyao becomes the Divine Son's follower, how can I pursue her?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe! Look at yourself, are you worthy? Even if Gu Qingyao didn't throw herself at the Divine Son, she still wouldn't look at you."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Although I also have thoughts about Gu Qingyao, I have self-awareness. We're not worthy of her. We can only think about it in our hearts."</p><p></p><p>Countless members of the Gu family discussed spiritedly. None of them thought that the Divine Son was unworthy of having Gu Qingyao as a follower. Instead, they wondered if Gu Qingyao had the qualifications to follow him.</p><p></p><p>Based on the potential the Divine Son had displayed, it would probably be extremely difficult to become his follower.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi finally stopped and turned to look at Gu Qingyao, saying indifferently, "Gu Qingyao, you're not bad."</p><p></p><p>A hint of joy appeared on Gu Qingyao's face.</p><p></p><p>"But you're still lacking a bit right now."</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao's expression turned gloomy.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Divine Son still rejected her.</p><p></p><p>Pursing her red lips, Gu Qingyao said with a determined expression and a resounding voice, "Divine Son, please give me a chance!"</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's eyes flashed. He decided to give Gu Qingyao a hand. She still had potential, and her appearance was acceptable. She could be his backup.</p><p></p><p>"When your physical strength breaks through to one million jin, you can come find me at the Imperial Dao Palace on Tianxian Island."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Gu Daoyi left with Huang Weiyang.</p><p></p><p>A hint of joyous surprise flashed in Gu Qingyao's beautiful eyes. The Divine Son had really given her a chance.</p><p></p><p>It was just that for her, breaking through to one million jin of physical strength was too difficult, almost impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>"Gu Qingyao, your physical body has reached its peak. Cultivating more body tempering techniques won't allow you to break through the shackles. However, your goal..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"The body cultivation technique you practiced before is not yet perfect. If you can truly cultivate it to perfection, you will have a chance to break free from the shackles." Gu Dao Yi's words drifted from afar.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao was both surprised and delighted. She looked up and found that Gu Dao Yi and Huang Weiyang had already disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Divine Son, for your guidance!" Gu Qingyao's tone was extremely respectful, and her face was full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, her physical strength could not advance an inch further, stuck at 998,000 jin. She had tried cultivating new body techniques but found them to be of no use.</p><p></p><p>The threshold of one million jin of physical strength was a major hurdle. Whether one could break through it or not would greatly influence one's future achievements. Gu Qingyao naturally wanted to break free from the shackles, but she had been unable to find a way and had no choice but to come and test herself.</p><p></p><p>She had planned to spend another half a year cultivating her body after the test. If she still could not break through the shackles, she would have no choice but to advance to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Divine Son had pointed out a direction for her. As long as she continued to pursue it, she would succeed one day.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Son, please wait for me at the Imperial Dao Palace," Gu Qingyao said to herself in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Beside her, Gu Lingshuang looked at Gu Qingyao with a complicated expression, wanting to say something but stopping herself. In the end, she said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao's appearance and potential were slightly better than Gu Lingyue's. If even Gu Qingyao was rejected by the Divine Son, did her sister Gu Lingyue have a chance?</p><p></p><p>"We are the twin sisters renowned for our beauty. We still have a great advantage over Gu Qingyao," Gu Lingshuang said softly in her heart.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Son had already left, and her sister had not yet arrived. Gu Lingshuang guessed that Gu Lingyue should be in seclusion and had not received the news in time.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, Gu Lingshuang quietly left, preparing to go back and discuss with Gu Lingyue.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, countless younger members of the Gu family, seeing that the Divine Son Gu Dao Yi had disappeared, finally straightened their bodies and looked at each other, finding that each other's expressions were very complex.</p><p></p><p>Today's events were truly too shocking!</p><p></p><p>The famous celestial maiden of the ancient Gu family, Gu Qingyao, had a physical strength of 998,000 jin and left her name on the Fuxi Ancient Stele, shaking the Divine Continent.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, the Divine Son arrived and pondered the Dao in front of the Fuxi Ancient Stele, displaying his heaven-defying comprehension and obtaining the inheritance of Emperor Fuxi.</p><p></p><p>The celestial maiden Gu Qingyao wanted to become a follower of the Divine Son Gu Dao Yi, but the Divine Son rejected her, stating that she was not yet qualified.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao was the celestial maiden and divine woman in their hearts, aloof and incomparably cold and beautiful. She took the initiative to throw herself into the Divine Son's arms, wanting to become his follower, but was rejected by the Divine Son.</p><p></p><p>How could the gap between people be so huge?!</p><p></p><p>Countless younger members of the Gu family looked at the exquisite and graceful, extremely beautiful silver-haired girl, feeling heartbroken and silently crying out in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>They had paid many courtesies to Gu Qingyao, but Gu Qingyao did not even give them a glance, let alone acknowledge them; the Divine Son had only met her once, yet Gu Qingyao took the initiative to follow him, throwing herself into his arms, willing to give everything for the Divine Son.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today's ten updates are complete.

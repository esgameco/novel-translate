        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Under the gaze of the masses,</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi finally spoke, taking the lead.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi greets the Great Emperor and the ancient Great Emperors."</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi first stood up, respectfully bowed to everyone, and then sat down.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings at the Emperor Realm were very satisfied with Gu Dao Yi's performance.</p><p></p><p>From beginning to end, Gu Dao Yi showed maturity and stability, with a broad mind and a grand vision. He did not display any arrogance or youthful sharpness and passion. Instead, he returned to simplicity, with a dao heart as firm as a rock, possessing a calmness that would not bend under the pressure of myriad heavens or change color when countless worlds collapsed.</p><p></p><p>He did not seem like a three-year-old child at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the title "ancient Great Emperors," they accepted it, as it should be.</p><p></p><p>In their respective eras, they were Divine Emperors, Ancient Emperors, and Dao Venerated Ones, but from the Middle Ancient Era to the present Golden Age, those at the Emperor Realm were all called Great Emperors, so it was not wrong to call them ancient Great Emperors.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha~"</p><p></p><p>The Void Great Emperor laughed heartily and then said, "Dao Yi, they are all our own people. There's no need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>"My Gu family has produced such an immortal. It is truly a blessing from the heavens," the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor also laughed, his laughter shaking ancient and modern times like rolling thunder.</p><p></p><p>"With Dao Yi here, the immortal glory of our Gu family is just around the corner. However, the matter of protecting the Dao will have to rely entirely on you, Void," said the Heng Yu Dao Venerate with excitement, then solemnly spoke to the Void Great Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Above his head, the Heng Yu Furnace radiated endless brilliant light, spewing primordial Mysterious Yellow Qi, as if it contained a Mysterious Yellow world, possessing the terrifying power to overturn myriad heavens and worlds.</p><p></p><p>The ancient and vast Void Mirror revolved with countless Dao principles, extending to the ends of the void, rising and falling in myriad heavens and worlds, suspended high above the Void Great Emperor's head, as if he was holding up the myriad heavens and worlds.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, Heng Yu. Dao Yi is my precious grandson. Even if I die, he will not," the Void Great Emperor declared resoundingly, his words spreading through ancient and modern times.</p><p></p><p>Heng Yu Dao Venerate was an Emperor Realm expert of the Gu family in the ancient era, many generations higher than the Void Great Emperor, but at their level, they had long discarded such formalities and addressed each other as peers.</p><p></p><p>Heng Yu Dao Venerate nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Void, even if you wanted to die, Dao Yi would not agree. Hahaha~" The laughter of the Thunder Abyss Divine Emperor rang out once more.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Yi Ancient Emperor, the Feather Transformation Ancient Emperor, the Scarlet Flame Dao Venerate, the Mysterious Emperor, and others all laughed.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Dao Yi's abilities, he definitely would not let the Void Great Emperor die just like that. Even if the Void Great Emperor's lifespan was limited, Gu Dao Yi's heaven-defying comprehension would surely create a corresponding immortality method to let the Void Great Emperor live another lifetime.</p><p></p><p>All the supreme Emperor Realm experts firmly believed this, and the Void Great Emperor also had unwavering faith in this.</p><p></p><p>"Void, we are so envious of you. If only Dao Yi had been born in our era," the Feather Transformation Ancient Emperor sighed, his eyes full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>The other ancient Great Emperors nodded deeply in agreement. Back then, they were constrained by their lifespans. A hundred thousand years was really too short. If they engaged in too many battles, the accumulated dao injuries in their bodies might not even allow them to reach the limit of a hundred thousand years.</p><p></p><p>Even if refining the immortality medicine could let them live another lifetime, a lifespan of a hundred and sixty to two hundred thousand years was still too</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In short, the most powerful beings at the Emperor Realm all hoped to possess a longer lifespan, in order to match their strength and status.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this was extremely difficult!</p><p></p><p>Those with sufficient strength could defy the heavens and live out a third lifetime by themselves, but it was nearly impossible to live out a fourth lifetime.</p><p></p><p>If there was a supreme existence like Gu Dao Yi with heaven-defying comprehension, it was very likely that he could find a way for them to achieve immortality, allowing them to live forever without needing to pursue the illusory path of becoming an immortal.</p><p></p><p>"This is also the will of fate." The Void Emperor said as such.</p><p></p><p>The other supreme beings at the Emperor Realm did not refute him, as it was indeed so.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor's lifespan was originally coming to an end, and it was uncertain whether he could even successfully protect Gu Tai Chu's Dao. However, he happened to wait until the descent of Gu Dao Yi, which instantly brought endless hope.</p><p></p><p>Heaven-defying comprehension represented infinite possibilities!</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor indeed showed some signs of having a destined fate.</p><p></p><p>Because they frequently interacted, they were quite familiar with the Void Emperor's situation. It was very difficult for the Void Emperor to defy the heavens and live out a third lifetime by himself.</p><p></p><p>This was because in his first and second lifetimes, the Void Emperor had engaged in too many conquests and battles with numerous powerful beings at the Emperor Realm. He had even charged into various forbidden zones, leaving many Dao injuries in his body.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor's strength was extremely formidable, having already reached the pinnacle of the Divine Emperor realm. He suppressed and healed his injuries, always maintaining a peak state, and even his lifespan was not reduced.</p><p></p><p>However, these Dao injuries had not actually fully recovered. If he wanted to defy the heavens and live out a third lifetime, all the accumulated Dao injuries would erupt, and at that time, even with the Void Emperor's immense strength, it would be very difficult to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Another reason was Gu Tai Chu.</p><p></p><p>If the Void Emperor successfully lived out a third lifetime, he would have to start cultivating from the beginning. Even if his cultivation speed was extremely fast, it was unlikely that he would attain the Dao before Gu Tai Chu. He would also face attacks from various powerful enemies.</p><p></p><p>The White-Robed Divine King Gu Tai Chu had already cultivated to the peak of the Saint King realm. At the fastest, he had the hope of attaining the Dao and becoming an Emperor within five hundred years. At the slowest, it would take several thousand years.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered great opportunities and fortuitous encounters, Gu Tai Chu's cultivation speed would soar, and he would have the hope of attaining the Dao within five hundred years.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor was racing against time. He wanted to protect Gu Tai Chu until he successfully attained the Dao while he was still alive. For this, he was willing to give up living out a third lifetime.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor had swept through the world, his strength nearly invincible in the current era, but he had also made many enemies because of this.</p><p></p><p>Those great enemies did not dare to act rashly while he was alive, but once he died, they would definitely take action. Even if they did not dare to easily attack the ancient Gu family, they would definitely launch brutal attacks when Gu Tai Chu was attaining the Dao.</p><p></p><p>No matter in which era, if there was no one to protect the Dao, it would be extremely difficult to attain it, because the number of Emperor positions was limited, and other powerful beings would not willingly let you take an Emperor position.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Tai Chu's strength, he could naturally sweep away those competitors for the Emperor positions, but if Emperors from forbidden zones or other Emperors of the current era attacked, his chances of survival would be slim.</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the second update, continuing the explosive updates!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

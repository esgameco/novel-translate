        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Huang Weiyao's lips curled up slightly, feeling a little proud in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Daoyi had a heaven-defying comprehension ability, he was still just a three-year-old child with limited experience. She only used a small trick to attract Gu Daoyi's attention.</p><p></p><p>In this cruel and competitive golden era, Huang Weiyao had already prepared herself for failure. She didn't expect the ancient Gu family to give her a surprise - they actually had a descendant with heaven-defying comprehension born into this world.</p><p></p><p>After just one month of interaction, Gu Daoyi's figure had already been deeply imprinted in Huang Weiyao's heart. She was impressed by him and had other ideas.</p><p></p><p>She was not satisfied with just being Gu Daoyi's follower, even if it was only in name. She wanted more.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi was still young now, so it was inconvenient to discuss these things with him. But she had the advantage of being close to him. When Gu Daoyi grew up, she would be his childhood sweetheart, and certain things would happen naturally.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyao knew that her thoughts were a bit utilitarian, but she didn't care. For the sake of achieving the Dao and becoming an immortal, these things were nothing.</p><p></p><p>Besides, she believed that feelings would develop over time.</p><p></p><p>She and Gu Daoyi would spend countless years together and would definitely develop deep feelings. She wouldn't do anything to let Gu Daoyi down, so this was completely acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi didn't know what Huang Weiyao was thinking in her heart. If he knew, he would probably laugh out loud a few times.</p><p></p><p>He was a three-year-old child?</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi just smiled. He was fully aware of what Huang Weiyao was thinking and had no intention of refusing.</p><p></p><p>After transmigrating to this fantasy world, he had heaven-defying comprehension and was also the divine son of an ancient family. Gu Daoyi felt that he should enjoy himself properly.</p><p></p><p>For example, marrying more celestial maidens, goddesses, holy maidens, and princesses, and finding some beautiful confidantes.</p><p></p><p>He had the qualifications for this. Even without him making any moves, those celestial maidens and goddesses would take the initiative to throw themselves into his arms. Whether to accept them or not was entirely up to Gu Daoyi's mood.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Dao Comprehension Ancient Tea Tree?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi looked at the ancient tree that had existed since ancient times, curiosity in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the Dao Comprehension Ancient Tea Tree had existed since the Divine Ancient Era. The Gu family rose to prominence in the Desolate Ancient Era and only captured this immortal medicinal herb in the Primordial Ancient Era. From then on, the Dao Comprehension Ancient Tea Tree had always been with the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>From the Primordial Ancient Era until now, the Gu family's ability to be so prosperous and glorious was partly due to the Dao Comprehension Ancient Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Comprehension Ancient Tea Tree was only six zhang tall, and its trunk was a full meter thick, winding up to the sky like a coiled dragon. Its bark was cracked, like the opened scales of a coiled dragon.</p><p></p><p>Its trunk was full of ancient charm, having experienced the baptism of time. It was surrounded by the brilliance of the Great Dao, and countless order Daos were intertwined, as if connecting to the origins of all Daos.</p><p></p><p>The branches and leaves of the Dao Comprehension Ancient Tea Tree were sparse, with only one hundred and eight tea leaves and nine tea fruits on it. But the whole tree was crystal clear and shining. Each tea leaf was very peculiar, with different shapes - goddesses, immortals, heavenly swords, true dragons, divine phoenixes, small cauldrons, small furnaces, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi looked over...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, Gu Daoyi discovered that the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree was indeed extraordinary. Each tea leaf embodied a different Dao, emanating enchanting Dao light and meaning, resembling small worlds hanging on the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree.</p><p></p><p>The nine tea fruits were even more profound and mysterious. With just a single glance, Gu Daoyi felt an urge to comprehend the Dao, as countless wondrous Dao principles surfaced in his mind. This was partly due to the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree's power, but more so because of his heaven-defying comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>The nine tea fruits exuded a dreamlike Dao light, with infinite Dao principles intertwining and blending, resembling nine grand worlds revolving around the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree at the center.</p><p></p><p>Upon careful observation, one would discover that the one hundred and eight tea leaves were actually arranged in an orderly manner. Between every twelve tea leaves, there was a single tea fruit, as if the small worlds were guarding the grand worlds, and the grand worlds were guarding the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree. The ancient tea tree seemed to be the center of all the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>In Gu Daoyi's eyes, this Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree flowed with endless Great Dao, enveloped by various mysterious and profound forces, making it an ideal place for comprehending the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi felt that this place should be able to help him.</p><p></p><p>"Weiyang, I heard that even the Elixir of Immortality has a spirit. This Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree should have one too, right?" Looking at the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, Gu Daoyi suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>Standing beside him, dressed in a pink dress, Huang Weiyang blinked her eyes and said playfully, "You'll know once you try."</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi shrugged helplessly and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyang immediately followed. She was inseparable from Gu Daoyi, like his little follower.</p><p></p><p>As they approached the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, Gu Daoyi's mind became increasingly clear, with countless wondrous Dao principles surfacing. His gaze fell upon the base of the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree, and Dao phenomena naturally appeared around his body.</p><p></p><p>The Chaos Sea surged with turbulent waves, boundless and endless. The Chaos Qi rolled and churned incessantly, each strand possessing the immense power to crush ancient eras. Each drop of seawater seemed to contain a universe, forming a world.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a towering figure descended above the Chaos Sea, exuding an invincible and supreme aura that suppressed the raging Chaos Sea, making it calm and tranquil. Even time and space came to a standstill at this moment, turning an instant into eternity.</p><p></p><p>The towering and invincible figure lightly tapped the Chaos, instantly opening up the heavens and earth within the Chaos Sea. A supreme world was born, surrounded by myriad realms, with countless living beings flourishing and numerous powerful figures vying for supremacy.</p><p></p><p>The figure raised his right hand slightly, and the supreme world and myriad realms simultaneously collapsed, turning into golden grains of sand that flowed back into his hand. Each grain emanated vast Dao meaning, containing infinite Dao principles and possessing immeasurable power.</p><p></p><p>The myriad realms of the Chaos Sea were born and destroyed!</p><p></p><p>PS: Is anyone reading this? It seems writing original Xuanhuan novels on Feilu is a dead end.</p><p></p><p>If no one reads even with ten updates a day, this little author can only leave.</p><p></p><p>Please support me, dear readers. This little author is kneeling and thanking you here!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

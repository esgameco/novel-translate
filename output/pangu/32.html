        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The saying that his comprehension defies the heavens is not an empty phrase!</p><p></p><p>For Gu Daoyi, attaining the Dao in a single thought is not a question of whether he can, but whether he wants to.</p><p></p><p>Right now, Gu Daoyi simply does not want to attain the Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Emptiness, Thunder, Taiyi, and others are not Gu Daoyi's Dao. His ambition is great, his pursuit is lofty, and he wants to walk an extremely difficult path.</p><p></p><p>This path is extremely difficult even for Gu Daoyi; for others, it is completely impossible.</p><p></p><p>However, Gu Daoyi is confident that he can make it through. Therefore, he is not in a hurry to attain the Dao. If he were to attain the Dao through these paths, his ultimate strength would be limited.</p><p></p><p>One can see Gu Daoyi's future from the heights of the Emptiness Emperor, the Thunder Abyss God Emperor, and the Taiyi Ancient Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Once he attains the Dao, if he wants to turn back and cultivate anew, even with his heaven-defying comprehension, he will face considerable trouble. It is better to walk the most correct path from the beginning.</p><p></p><p>With his heaven-defying comprehension, Gu Daoyi already has a plan for his future path in his heart. He only needs to follow it step by step.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss~"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Daoyi's answer, the Dao Venerable-level powerhouses such as Chiyan Dao Venerable, Hengyu Dao Venerable, and Xuan Emperor couldn't help but gasp.</p><p></p><p>They had already made some guesses in their hearts. After getting confirmation from Gu Daoyi, they were still shocked.</p><p></p><p>Attaining the Dao within a hundred years!</p><p></p><p>Since time immemorial, such a heaven-defying figure has never appeared. There is not the slightest record in ancient history. Even before the Divine Ancient Era, there has never been any mention of such a supreme existence.</p><p></p><p>Let alone a supreme existence that attains the Dao within a hundred years, there has never been a supreme powerhouse who attained the Dao within a thousand years. Those who claim to have attained the Dao within a thousand years are all fake.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Daoyi succeeds, he will truly be the first since the creation of the world, achieving an unprecedented feat that will crown him unrivaled throughout the ages.</p><p></p><p>The several Dao Venerable-level powerhouses glanced at each other, all seeing the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi said he could attain the Dao within a hundred years, and these Dao Venerable-level powerhouses actually did not find it the least bit inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>They had already been deeply convinced by Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension, believing that such a supreme existence should attain the Dao within a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Although there has never been such a supreme existence since ancient times, it does not mean there isn't one now or in the future.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Golden Great Era?"</p><p></p><p>Many Dao Venerable-level powerhouses murmured simultaneously, their eyes revealing a yearning look, but also feeling immense pressure.</p><p></p><p>These Dao Venerable-level powerhouses could attain the Dao in the Primordial Era, the Distant Ancient Era, the Ancient Era, and the Middle Ancient Era, but in this Golden Great Era, can they still attain the Dao?</p><p></p><p>In this era, the path to immortality will appear, and various invincible figures will emerge one after another. It has only been a few years since the beginning, and a supreme existence with heaven-defying comprehension like Gu Daoyi has already appeared.</p><p></p><p>In the future, there will be other heaven-defying supreme...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Are you there? </p><p></p><p>To be born in this world is both glorious and sorrowful. Countless heavenly prodigies and demons vie for supremacy, but in the end they all become mere foils for the existence of Gu Daoyi who defies the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Becoming a speck of light in Gu Daoyi's endless halo, becoming a white bone among the countless skeletons under Gu Daoyi's feet. </p><p></p><p>How pitiful and lamentable!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the countless Gu family cultivators listening around were all dumbfounded, and surging waves of shock arose in their hearts. They all thought they had misheard.</p><p></p><p>Attaining the Dao within a hundred years? </p><p></p><p>What a joke!!</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the Seven Emperors lectured on the Dao, they listened with rapture, immersed in it and unable to extricate themselves. Everyone had some gains to a greater or lesser extent.</p><p></p><p>Then it was the Divine Son's turn to lecture, and surprisingly he spoke of Thunder Abyss God Emperor's Thunder Dao, and it was even more profound and abstruse than Thunder Abyss God Emperor's own Dao.</p><p></p><p>This shocked the countless Gu family cultivators to the core. A three-year-old child who had not cultivated actually surpassed an Emperor Realm supreme expert in the Dao he specialized in. It was earth-shattering!</p><p></p><p>Because it was too profound, they forced themselves to listen for a while, but did not gain much.</p><p></p><p>As they gradually came to their senses, they heard the Seven Emperors conversing with Gu Daoyi, and an extremely bold idea suddenly surfaced in their minds. </p><p></p><p>The Divine Son's insights into the Thunder Dao surpassed the Thunder Abyss God Emperor's. Then did he also surpass the other Emperor Realm supreme experts in the Void Dao, Taiyi Dao, Heavenly Fire Dao and so on?</p><p></p><p>If so, did that mean the Divine Son already had the foundation to attain the Dao?</p><p></p><p>Countless Gu family cultivators had just thought of this when they heard Gu Daoyi admit that he could attain the Dao within a hundred years. How could they not be shocked to the core!</p><p></p><p>They had already tried their best to have a high opinion of the Divine Son Gu Daoyi, thinking that he would break the record of all ages and become the first supreme existence to truly attain the Dao within a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that they still underestimated Gu Daoyi and looked down on his heaven-defying comprehension too much.</p><p></p><p>As this thought flashed through their minds, the vast majority felt a surge of bitterness in their hearts. Was this the gap between them and the Divine Son?</p><p></p><p>It was a completely insurmountable chasm that could never be crossed in their lifetimes!</p><p></p><p>They didn't even have the hope of attaining the Dao in their entire lives, while the Divine Son Gu Daoyi could easily do it within a hundred years.</p><p></p><p>Only a small number of people were extremely excited at this moment. They were Gu Daoyi's little fangirls, such as Gu Qingyao.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing that Gu Daoyi could attain the Dao within a hundred years, she was both shocked and overjoyed, ecstatic beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Son is the supreme god in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Gu Daoyi, who was surrounded by the Seven Emperors, his transcendent bearing made Gu Qingyao infatuated. She silently said in her heart.</p><p></p><p>PS: Currently the fifth update, continuing the burst of updates!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, rating tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

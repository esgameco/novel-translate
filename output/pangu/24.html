        <h1>Chapter 24</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The gazes of seven emperor-level powerhouses, including Lei Yuan Divine Emperor, Tai Yi Ancient Emperor, Heng Yu Dao Venerable, and Yu Hua Ancient Emperor, all turned towards Gu Dao Yi. Even the Nine Heavens Phoenix Queen looked over, a trace of pleading appearing in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Unrivaled in the present world and invincible in her life, the softness in her heart was stirred by her daughter. She desperately wanted to communicate with Huang Wei Yang, and her only hope now rested on Gu Dao Yi.</p><p></p><p>The eight emperors appeared because of Gu Dao Yi, shocked by his heaven-defying comprehension and unparalleled talent. Gu Dao Yi had no cultivation, so his voice could not reach the past, and the seven emperors could not hear him. But by observing Gu Dao Yi's actions, they understood what he intended to do.</p><p></p><p>The eight emperor-level powerhouses gazed at him with fervent eyes, wanting to know if there was a limit to this young sage's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>The eight emperors under the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree were all imprints, emperor-level imprints from different eras. Even though they knew Gu Dao Yi's comprehension defied the heavens, they could not make preparations or leave behind contingencies for later generations.</p><p></p><p>Their true selves would never know about everything happening here.</p><p></p><p>Even if Gu Dao Yi pioneered a method to help people communicate across time and space, he could only interact with their imprints. Their true selves had long disappeared or died, whereabouts unknown.</p><p></p><p>This was still relying on the profound power of the Enlightenment Ancient Tea Tree. Without it, there would be no medium connecting the two sides.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Void Emperor was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the Divine Son's words and seeing him enter enlightenment with the eight emperors simultaneously looking at him, the surrounding Gu family disciples understood what the Divine Son intended to do. They held their breaths in anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Countless gazes converged on Gu Dao Yi, all curious if this Divine Son could impromptu pioneer a method to help people communicate across time and space. This was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>No one doubted Gu Dao Yi's ability to attain enlightenment and create techniques on the spot, but that had great randomness. This time, a specific method was designated, one that even great emperors could not pioneer. The difficulty would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>If he could accomplish this, then Gu Dao Yi's comprehension was truly heaven-defying to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Son will definitely succeed."</p><p></p><p>Amidst the crowd, Gu Qing Yao, dressed in a white palace gown, with silver hair reaching her waist and a divine sword on her back, murmured to herself.</p><p></p><p>She had already left earlier but immediately heard the news of Divine Son Gu Dao Yi attaining enlightenment and creating an invincible technique. She instantly regretted leaving and missing this moment.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qing Yao promptly rushed back to the Enlightenment Ancient Land, just in time to witness this historic moment of the eight emperors appearing together. Her heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>All of this made Gu Qing Yao even more determined in her belief. She must become the Divine Son's follower, willing to give her all for him and become his sharpest sword.</p><p></p><p>Huang Wei Yang regained consciousness, her pretty face stained with tear tracks as she looked at Gu Dao Yi, who had his eyes closed in enlightenment. Her eyes were filled with gratitude and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Dao Yi, thank you~"</p><p></p><p>Huang Wei Yang whispered in her heart. As a follower, she had not done anything for Gu Dao Yi yet, but he was already helping her greatly in return.</p><p></p><p>Such kindness, without...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In order to repay him, she could only offer herself.</p><p></p><p>In the future, she was willing to support Gu Daoyi a little, to shelter him from the wind and rain, to protect his path, and to allow Gu Daoyi to grow up smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Time passed by minute by minute, and countless people waited quietly. There were even endless streams of people rushing over, just to see the scene of the eight supreme beings at the Emperor Realm appearing in person, and to witness with their own eyes the creation of the dharma gate by the Divine Son Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>"Buzz~"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a buzzing sound rang out between heaven and earth, as if the Great Dao was trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the next instant, all the Dao principles, Dao rhymes, Dao meanings, etc. surrounding Gu Daoyi's body were boiling, intertwining together. Countless order Dao principles merged, and immeasurable Dao light soared into the sky, evolving into a new Dao phenomenon in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A long river surged from the void, permeated with the breath of years, vast and mighty, causing this space-time to come to a standstill.</p><p></p><p>The River of Time!</p><p></p><p>Then, a figure came from the future, going upstream against the River of Time, arriving at this timeline. The figure was tall and mighty, with unparalleled breath, possessing an invincible aura that could suppress the heavens and the earth and reign supreme over all the ancient worlds.</p><p></p><p>The people observing this scene were all stunned. Although the features of that tall and invincible figure were blurry and unclear, it could be vaguely seen that it bore some resemblance to Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>"Gulp~"</p><p></p><p>Countless people couldn't help but swallow, once again shocked to the core, with unparalleled waves surging in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Son had really done it!</p><p></p><p>In just half a quarter of an hour, he created a space-time dharma gate with an extremely high designated difficulty. His comprehension was truly heaven-defying!</p><p></p><p>Countless members of the Gu family looked at the figure of the young immortal in exile, surrounded by endless Dao principles and immeasurable Dao light. Their Dao hearts were struck again, and the area of their psychological shadow reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, something seems a bit off?"</p><p></p><p>A member of the Gu family suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>Other members of the Gu family quickly noticed that something was indeed off. The scale of this evolved Dao phenomenon was too grand, even the River of Time had appeared. It didn't seem quite like an auxiliary dharma gate used for cross-space-time communication.</p><p></p><p>Countless members of the Gu family gasped, and a bold idea emerged in their minds.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Divine Son had created another invincible dharma?</p><p></p><p>Previously, the Chaos Sea Opening Heaven and Earth was the most supreme Dao phenomenon, signifying the birth of a supreme technique, an invincible dharma. This time, the future self arriving by going upstream against the River of Time was also no less inferior, also being the most supreme Dao phenomenon.</p><p></p><p>In the forbidden area, the Void Emperor had a bright light in his eyes. He couldn't help but sigh lightly:</p><p></p><p>"This child, I told you to create an auxiliary dharma gate, but you directly created an invincible dharma."</p><p></p><p>With his insight, he could naturally see the extraordinariness of this dharma gate. It was definitely another invincible dharma that was not inferior to the "Sand Flowing Between Fingers".</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the seventh update, continuing the explosive updates!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards!

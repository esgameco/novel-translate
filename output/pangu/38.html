        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>"Forget it, forget it. I'll let you off the hook today," the Ancient Emperor Taiyi spoke first. Although he was completely convinced, his mouth was still very stubborn.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were countless of his juniors here. He, the mighty Ancient Emperor Taiyi, whose name shook the ages, how could he admit defeat in public?</p><p></p><p>"Dao One, let's stop the guidance for today. This old man has nothing more to teach you."</p><p></p><p>"Little Dao One, I have already imparted all my lifelong knowledge to you. I hope you can carry it forward and make it flourish."</p><p></p><p>"Dao One, I know you are very eager, but this emperor is a bit tired today. Let's discuss the Dao another time."</p><p></p><p>"This emperor's cultivation has reached the extreme realm, so I won't bully you. When you attain the Dao, this emperor will discuss the Dao with you again."</p><p></p><p>The Great Emperor of the Void, the Divine Emperor of Thunder Abyss, the Eternal Universe Dao Venerable, and others' eyes lit up, and they also spoke up one after another.</p><p></p><p>It was one thing for the countless Gu family juniors to know, but it was another thing for them to admit it.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao One blinked, feeling a little embarrassed, but still obediently nodded. Today, he had already shown off enough, so he had to take care of the face of the old seniors to some extent.</p><p></p><p>"Uh..."</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyao was a little caught off guard. She didn't expect that a group of supreme beings at the Emperor Realm would be so stubborn and shameless to say such words, seriously damaging their image in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyao looked at her mother, Huang Zhaoyue. This Nine Heavens Phoenix was about to say something stubborn, but feeling her daughter's gaze, she secretly sighed and had to swallow the words that had surged to her throat back into her stomach, and then said some superficial words.</p><p></p><p>The countless Gu family juniors who were observing around were all stunned, looking at each other in dismay, not expecting the plot to take such a big turn.</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking about it, they understood the situation of the supreme beings at the Emperor Realm. It was a bit embarrassing now, but who let them be at a disadvantage from beginning to end?</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha!!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Ancestor Gu Changge laughed loudly and unscrupulously, as if he had seen something extremely funny.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Ancestor Gu Yuanwu and many clan elders and patriarchs' expressions changed. They were about to stop Gu Changge, but in the end, they did nothing.</p><p></p><p>Because those supreme beings at the Emperor Realm who were discussing the Dao under the tree had already looked over.</p><p></p><p>The laughter of the Third Ancestor Gu Changge stopped abruptly. An embarrassed look appeared on his face. He lowered his head and searched the ground with his eyes, as if there was a heaven-defying opportunity on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Humph!!"</p><p></p><p>The snorts of the supreme beings at the Emperor Realm came, causing Gu Changge to bury his head even deeper, wishing there was a crack in the ground to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, little third child, why don't you continue laughing?"</p><p></p><p>"Little third child, is it very funny?"</p><p></p><p>"Changge ah, laugh one more time for me to hear."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Emperor of Thunder Abyss, the Ancient Emperor Taiyi, and the Eternal Universe Dao Venerable spoke one after another, their tones extremely unfriendly.</p><p></p><p>How come they didn't find this kid so annoying before?</p><p></p><p>The voices of the Profound Emperor, the Nine Heavens Phoenix, the Ancient Emperor of Feather Transformation, and the Scarlet Flame Dao Venerable also followed, their tones also extremely bad, their faces almost dripping with gloom.</p><p></p><p>Everyone pretended not to see, and even if they did see, they had to pretend not to.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>He knew that Gu Changge was being ungrateful and laughed out loud in public, showing that his wings had hardened and he didn't take them seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Changge, you have disappointed me greatly." The voice of the Void Emperor rang out in the mind of Gu Changge, the Third Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Gu Changge's expression changed again, feeling very annoyed. He shouldn't have been so unrestrained earlier, not expecting these ancient emperors to be so petty.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Abyss God Emperor, Taiyi Ancient Emperor, Hengyu Dao Venerable and other emperor realm experts were all branded and couldn't do anything to him, but the Void Emperor was different.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor was still alive, a true supreme expert of the emperor realm, and his combat power was originally among the top few in the world, reaching the Divine Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, after discussing the Dao under the ancient tea tree of enlightenment, he had made great gains, and his combat power was likely to be further elevated, truly invincible in the world.</p><p></p><p>Although he, as the Third Patriarch of the Gu family, was an unrivaled expert at the 8th level of the Quasi-Emperor realm, he was still far, far inferior to the Void Emperor. The Void Emperor could suppress and kill him with a flick of his finger.</p><p></p><p>Although the Void Emperor wouldn't kill him, he had just publicly offended many emperor realm supreme experts and the Void Emperor. The Void Emperor wouldn't let him off easily.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor, Changge knows his mistake."</p><p></p><p>Gu Changge admitted his mistake without any hesitation, very much like a seasoned schemer. It wasn't the first time he had made a mistake.</p><p></p><p>He was almost 40,000 years old, and in the future, he could at most cultivate to the peak of the Quasi-Emperor realm. There was almost no hope for him to prove the Dao and become an emperor, so his mentality was better.</p><p></p><p>"You, oh you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing him admit his mistake, the Void Emperor didn't know what to say. After thinking for a while, he said:</p><p></p><p>"You have offended them. If I don't give you some punishment, it won't be easy to explain to them. How about this, I have two choices here."</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, Emperor."</p><p></p><p>"First, go and guard the Canglan Ancient Land for a thousand years. Second, protect Dao Yi for a thousand years."</p><p></p><p>"Emperor, I choose the second one."</p><p></p><p>The Third Patriarch Gu Changge chose the latter without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Guarding the Canglan Ancient Land was not a good job. Although there was no danger, it was very boring. Gu Changge didn't want to go at all.</p><p></p><p>He would rather go and protect that little guy Gu Dao Yi. Gu Dao Yi had a heaven-defying comprehension ability. Staying by his side, he might be able to gain great opportunities and increase his chances of proving the Dao and becoming an emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>In the forbidden area, the Void Emperor had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He deliberately gave these two choices, predicting that Gu Changge would choose the second one, which was also what he hoped for.</p><p></p><p>Because Gu Changge had no hope of breaking through to the Emperor realm, he was quite decadent and had been lying flat and being lazy, which the Void Emperor didn't want to see.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor also wanted to use Gu Dao Yi's heaven-defying comprehension to see if he could push Gu Changge to the Emperor realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, how to get along well with Gu Dao Yi and get his help was Gu Changge's business.</p><p></p><p>PS: Please give flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards! Your support is my motivation to release more chapters!</p><p></p><p>Please support me, dear family members. The little author is kneeling in thanks here!</p><p></p><p>Three things about reading: read, collect, and reward!</p>

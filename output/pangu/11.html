        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The Phoenix spread its wings and came at extreme speed, arriving in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Auspicious light and aura surrounded the Phoenix, and a casually released wisp of breath made the void tremble and nearly tear apart.</p><p></p><p>This was a Nine Heavens Phoenix!</p><p></p><p>Comparable to a True Dragon, it was one of the Ten Ancient Fiends, but at this moment, it was being stepped on by Gu Dao Yi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Phoenix he was riding was a young Phoenix, not the one from the Ten Ancient Fiends, which was an extremely powerful being at the Emperor Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family had also produced a Great Emperor in ancient times, who had a deep friendship with the Nine Heavens Phoenix. The Nine Heavens Phoenix wanted to become a Battle Immortal, so it sent its only offspring to the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>It hoped that the Gu family would seal it, keeping it for the future Golden Age to re-emerge and compete for the path to immortality. The Great Emperor of the Gu family agreed, and this news was little known.</p><p></p><p>Just fifty years ago, this Phoenix broke free from the seal and had been cultivating in a forbidden area of the Gu family. It now had the cultivation of the Sealed Emperor Realm, and with one more step, it would become a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>When Gu Dao Yi was born and showed his heaven-defying aptitude, the Void Emperor let this young Phoenix follow Gu Dao Yi to protect his safety.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, the Great Emperor of the Gu family naturally had conditions for agreeing to shelter the Phoenix's offspring. When the Golden Age arrived, the young Phoenix would have to follow the Gu family's divine son, joining hands to advance together and become life and death partners, contending for the Great Dao together.</p><p></p><p>The previous generation's divine son of the Gu family was the White-Robed God King Gu Tai Chu, and this generation's divine son was Gu Dao Yi, with a gap of more than a hundred years between them.</p><p></p><p>The young Phoenix was named Huang Wei Yang. After meeting Gu Dao Yi, it was convinced by Gu Dao Yi's heaven-defying aptitude and was willing to follow him.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss~ The rumors are actually true. Our Gu family really has a Nine Heavens Phoenix!"</p><p></p><p>"Who is the person coming? He actually rides a Phoenix from the ninth heaven."</p><p></p><p>"That figure looks so small. Could it be our Gu family's divine son of this generation, Gu Dao Yi?"</p><p></p><p>On the Dao Comprehension Ancient Land, many disciples of the Gu family were discussing and were very curious about the Nine Heavens Phoenix and Gu Dao Yi.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Heavens Phoenix was a legend in the Gu family, and few people knew about the secrets of ancient times. Seeing a young offspring of the Ten Fiends in person gave them a huge shock.</p><p></p><p>The young offspring of the Ten Fiends meant that this was a son or daughter of an Emperor, with an extremely noble identity. Although the Gu family was an ancient family of the desolate era, few had an identity comparable to it.</p><p></p><p>But someone was actually riding the young offspring of the Ten Fiends, and it was the rumored divine son, which shocked people even more.</p><p></p><p>During these three years, Gu Dao Yi had been staying in the Imperial Dao Palace. Apart from the Void Emperor, many elders, and his mother Ji Mingyue, no one had seen him, so naturally, these people had not seen him either.</p><p></p><p>And being able to ride the young Phoenix, and being so young, in the entire desolate era Gu family, except for that divine son who was born three years ago, there was no second person qualified.</p><p></p><p>Countless disciples of the Gu family were curious about what was going on with this member of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew that when Gu Dao Yi was born three years ago, he was just an ordinary mortal body without any special physique, too useless.</p><p></p><p>After all, Gu Dao Yi was the only offspring of the White-Robed God King Gu Tai Chu and the divine woman Ji Mingyue of the desolate era Ji family. Both husband and wife had extremely strong special physiques, but Gu Dao Yi had no special physique. The probability of this was very low, but it actually happened.</p><p></p><p>Three years</p><p></p><p>In the past, Gu Daoyi was also able to cultivate, but his innate talent was unknown.</p><p></p><p>If his talent was not outstanding and he continued to serve as the Gu family's divine son, countless descendants of the Gu family would not accept it.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family is an ancient family from the primordial times. One cannot do as they please just because they have a good father. Unless Gu Taichu attains the Dao and becomes an emperor, even if Gu Daoyi is ordinary, his role as the divine son of the Gu family would not cause controversy.</p><p></p><p>While everyone was discussing in low voices, Gu Daoyi, riding a young phoenix, had already arrived above the ancient enlightenment land. Countless people looked at him and were instantly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Although Gu Daoyi was only three years old, his height was no different from a seven or eight-year-old child. He wore a moon-white splendid robe, his features were exquisitely sculpted, naturally handsome, and spiritually clever. His black hair was casually draped behind his back, and every strand was crystal clear.</p><p></p><p>His skin was like white jade from the ninth heaven, and his body exuded a lofty immortal aura, possessing a transcendent temperament, like a young immortal banished to the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>The Gu family men felt ashamed of their inferiority, while the Gu family women stared at Gu Daoyi with burning eyes, their faces full of infatuation. Their values followed their features, believing that since Gu Daoyi was so good-looking, he couldn't possibly be the "waste" rumored.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks."</p><p></p><p>As the phoenix landed, Gu Daoyi thanked it before getting off.</p><p></p><p>The young phoenix transformed into a stunningly beautiful young girl in a pink dress, saying sweetly, "Daoyi, there's no need to be polite."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the charming and gentle, extremely beautiful girl in the pink dress, Gu Daoyi smiled, with some unusual thoughts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome, Divine Son!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, countless descendants of the Gu family bowed their heads respectfully and shouted, automatically parting to make way.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of Gu Daoyi's situation, he was now the divine son. According to the rules, when they saw the divine son, they had to pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingxue and Gu Qingyao also bowed their heads in salute. The two girls kept stealing glances at Gu Daoyi with their beautiful eyes, filled with different thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi nodded slightly without saying much. He didn't introduce Huang Weiyang and directly led her towards the Fuxi Ancient Stele.</p><p></p><p>Passing by Gu Lingxue and Gu Qingyao, Gu Daoyi looked at Gu Qingyao, who had silver hair reaching her waist, carried a divine sword on her back, and had an exquisite figure. He was somewhat interested in this stunning girl.</p><p></p><p>With just one glance at Gu Qingyao, Gu Daoyi knew that she was the peerless genius who had made quite a commotion earlier.</p><p></p><p>Being able to possess nearly a million jin of great strength and make it onto the Fuxi Ancient Stele's ranking at the physical body realm was pretty good. She had potential worth cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi didn't stop, and Huang Weiyang didn't even spare a glance at the two girls, her beautiful eyes only focused on Gu Daoyi.</p><p></p><p>Gu Qingyao was stunned. When the divine son looked at her just now, she thought Gu Daoyi would say something to her, like recruiting her as a follower, but Gu Daoyi said nothing.</p><p></p><p>Did he think her potential was insufficient and unworthy of being his follower?</p><p></p><p>Gu Lingxue had a bitter look on her face. The divine son didn't even look at her. Was her charm that lacking?</p><p></p><p>She and her twin sister Gu Lingduo were both extremely beautiful. Not only in the Gu family, but they were also well-known in the Three Thousand Dao Prefectures, with countless suitors.</p><p></p><p>PS: Ten updates every day! Ten updates every day!

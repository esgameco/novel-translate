        <div class="content">
            <p>"Wonderful! Wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>"This kind of invincible technique involving time was not successfully created even by the ancient Time Dao Master who claimed to control the eternity of time."</p><p></p><p>"Who would have thought that the creator of this invincible technique would be a three-year-old child from later generations who has not cultivated? It's truly the will of heaven playing with people."</p><p></p><p>"It's indeed the Golden Age. Just a few years after the opening, a peerless demon like Dao Yi with unparalleled comprehension has appeared. Perhaps he is truly born to fulfill a destiny..."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the supreme Dao image of the Enlightenment Ancient Land reflecting heaven and earth, the Void Emperor was full of emotions.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma method that Gu Daoyi has created now is an invincible technique involving the Great Dao of Time, which is extremely terrifying. From the Dao image, he got a glimpse of it and found that Gu Daoyi has great ambitions.</p><p></p><p>If this invincible technique is completely perfected, it can borrow the mighty power of the future invincible self and summon powerful future selves to fight. Who can resist?</p><p></p><p>It's just that this invincible technique is not yet perfect, and only a part of it has been created. Even with Gu Daoyi's unparalleled comprehension, it is impossible to perfect it at this stage, because this invincible technique is inherently heaven-defying and involves the supreme Great Dao of Time.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor believes that when Gu Daoyi embarks on the path of cultivation, experiences more, sees more, and accumulates more abundantly, he will definitely be able to perfect this world-covering imperial technique step by step.</p><p></p><p>When this technique has been tempered through countless years, baptized by the long river of time, and undergone one great transformation after another, it will be interpreted to the extreme by Gu Daoyi, becoming a truly peerless and invincible imperial technique.</p><p></p><p>Now, this world-covering imperial technique still has many flaws.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Gu Daoyi has achieved what the Time Dao Master failed to achieve back then.</p><p></p><p>In the ancient times, the supreme beings at the Emperor Realm were called Dao Venerable, and those extremely powerful Dao Venerables had an even more revered title: Dao Master!</p><p></p><p>The Time Dao Master was actually one of them.</p><p></p><p>The Time Dao Master attained the Dao with eternal time, and after becoming an emperor, his combat power was unmatched. He swept through the world and further advanced to become a Dao Master-level supreme being, known as the one who controlled the eternity of time.</p><p></p><p>The Time Dao Master was one of the most powerful Emperor Realm experts in ancient times, truly worthy of the title of Dao Master. The world suspected that this Emperor Realm expert who attained the Dao with eternal time really possessed endless life and could live forever.</p><p></p><p>Back then, when the Time Dao Master wanted to create this world-covering imperial technique, it shocked the world after the news spread out. The Emperor Realm powerhouses of various forbidden zones were terrified, and the myriad realms were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>It was because the Time Dao Master was too powerful and was already the strongest in the world. If he could create an even more powerful world-covering imperial technique, he might become a War Immortal with combat power comparable to immortals!</p><p></p><p>Later, the Time Dao Master disappeared. Whether this invincible technique was created and whether the Time Dao Master died directly became the biggest mystery in history.</p><p></p><p>The Void Emperor attained the Dao with endless void and was known as the one who controlled the extremity of the void. The Dao of Space was as supreme as the Dao of Time, so he had a lot to say about this matter.</p><p></p><p>He knew that the Time Dao Master could not possibly obtain endless life and be eternally immortal, just as he could not truly transform into endless void and be undying and imperishable.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Time Dao Master died or went into hiding, the Void Emperor was...</p><p></p><p>Title: The Emperor is also Uncertain</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Ancient Land of Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The six Emperor Realm powerhouses, including Taiyi Ancient Emperor, Leiyuan Divine Emperor, and Chiyan Dao Venerable, pursed their dry lips and looked at each other, seeing the shock in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>To simultaneously shock all the Great Emperors, this was definitely an extraordinary achievement that could be said to shake ancient and modern times.</p><p></p><p>They really wanted to say, is there no limit to your comprehension?</p><p></p><p>Weren't you creating a supplementary cultivation method? How did you end up creating a world-shaking Emperor Law?</p><p></p><p>As the supreme beings of the Emperor Realm, seeing such a peerless figure with talent that stunned ancient and modern times and comprehension that surpassed all ages, they felt a bit ashamed of themselves.</p><p></p><p>Incomparable!</p><p></p><p>The beautiful eyes of the Nine Heavens Phoenix in her nine-colored splendid clothes shone, and her exquisite face was full of pleasant surprise. The comprehension of this young banished immortal was too heaven-defying.</p><p></p><p>It was just a bit of a pity that what he created was not a method to help them communicate, but it was also extremely good. This invincible law was destined to shake the myriad ancient heavens, and this young banished immortal was destined to have his name spread through the ages.</p><p></p><p>Her daughter, Huang Weiang, seemed to have a very good relationship with this young banished immortal. It seemed that he was the one she would follow in the future. The ancient Gu family had not let her down.</p><p></p><p>With Huang Weiang following this young banished immortal with heaven-defying comprehension, she would also have great achievements in the future. Barring any unexpected circumstances, at least attaining the Dao and becoming an Emperor would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Beside the Nine Heavens Phoenix, an extremely beautiful girl in a pink dress, as exquisite as carved pink jade, looked at this scene in a daze, once again subdued by Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Mother and daughter, separated by the vast space-time of ten thousand ages, at this moment stood shoulder to shoulder. Although they could not communicate, they could feel each other's hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-defying!"</p><p></p><p>"Invincible!"</p><p></p><p>These were the four words that simultaneously appeared in the minds of the onlooking members of the Gu family.</p><p></p><p>Faced with the Divine Son with heaven-defying comprehension, they could no longer think of any adjectives. These four words were their most intuitive feelings.</p><p></p><p>For the supreme beings of the Emperor Realm to create a world-shaking Emperor Law, to create a supreme wonderful technique, it would require the passage of long years and the expenditure of endless energy to possibly succeed.</p><p></p><p>But for the Divine Son, creating an invincible law was as simple as eating and drinking?</p><p></p><p>Just as countless people were extremely shocked, Gu Daoyi, who was the focus of everyone's attention, woke up and ended his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>His gaze was even more profound, as if each contained a source of the Great Dao, constantly erupting with endless Dao wonders and limitless spiritual light, making Gu Daoyi's temperament even more transcendent and true.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao image reflecting heaven and earth, the "Gu Daoyi" who had walked upstream against the river of time nodded slightly to Gu Daoyi, and then disappeared along with the river of time.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi also nodded, as if talking to himself: "Let's call it the [Eternal Taizhu Law]."</p><p></p><p>PS: Today there will still be ten updates, currently the eighth update, continuing to release explosively!</p><p></p><p>Asking for flowers, evaluation tickets, monthly tickets, and rewards! Your support is my motivation to release explosively!</p><p></p><p>Please, dear family members, support me, this little author is kneeling in thanks here!</p><p></p><p>The three things about reading: read, collect, and add rewards!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the Void Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>Many clan elders had finished comprehending the Minor Void Scripture one after another, and they looked at each other without saying a word.</p><p></p><p>"We have been blind." One of the elders in a gray robe took the lead in speaking, his tone full of self-blame.</p><p></p><p>"This is our responsibility. At that time, we only cared about physique and forgot about the matter of comprehension."</p><p></p><p>"If we old folks weren't in such a hurry to leave and stayed a little longer, we should have been able to see this shocking scene. What a pity."</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, little Dao Yi did not disappoint us. Instead, it was we who disappointed him."</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor was right. Dao Yi is the unshakable divine son and chief leader of our Gu family. All the resources of the Gu family should be tilted towards him."</p><p></p><p>"It's unbelievable! Dao Yi was just born, and he was only held by the Emperor for ten breaths before falling into enlightenment and creating the Minor Void Scripture, a great sage realm technique that greatly lowers the cultivation threshold of the Void Scripture. In the next two thousand years, the number of geniuses cultivating the Void Scripture in our Gu family will increase tenfold or even a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>One elder after another spoke, their words sincere and without reservation. This was their mistake, giving little Dao Yi a bad impression. Everyone admitted it and decided to compensate him more in the future.</p><p></p><p>After learning about what happened and comprehending the Minor Void Scripture, all the elders had unwavering faith in Gu Dao Yi, firmly believing that Gu Dao Yi could lead the Gu family to immortal glory.</p><p></p><p>All because Gu Dao Yi's comprehension was monstrous and even defied the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Just after being born, he created the Minor Void Scripture, a high-level technique that has the effect of inheriting the past and ushering in the future, which is of great help to the Gu family. As Gu Dao Yi gradually grows up, with his comprehension, he will bring countless benefits to the Gu family, making the foundation and heritage of the primordial Gu family stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>As for mere physique, it seems trivial in the light of such heaven-defying comprehension.</p><p></p><p>With Gu Dao Yi's monstrous comprehension, given time, he will surely be able to create the most suitable and invincible physique for himself.</p><p></p><p>The many elders of the primordial Gu family looked at each other and smiled, already seeing the future where the Gu family stands on top of all the heavens in the utmost glory and prosperity.</p><p></p><p>That's not all. The Void Emperor did not even mention that Gu Dao Yi was to create an immortality method for him to help him live out his third lifetime. Otherwise, the many elders of the Gu family would be even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>The many elders discussed and fixed all the treatment and resources to be given to Gu Dao Yi. From now on, it will only be more than this and will never be less.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the many elders decided that this matter could not be revealed to the outside world for the time being, so as not to arouse the vigilance of powerful outsiders. Although the Void Emperor did not care, they cared a lot.</p><p></p><p>The war of emperors is not a joke!</p><p></p><p>Millions of corpses lie across a vast expanse, one star domain after another is extinguished, countless living beings are affected and die, the heavens will bleed, myriad realms will be ravaged, and the universe will fall into great turmoil for ages to come.</p><p></p><p>The current situation of the many elders is very favorable to the Gu family. From now on, Gu Dao Yi will go from being known to being hidden.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>After this, the outside world's attention on him will greatly decrease. As long as they pay attention to controlling the information, they can give Gu Daoyi more time to grow and give the Gu family more time to accumulate their heritage.</p><p></p><p>If they can hold on until the Gu family patriarch, the White-Robed God King Gu Taichu, transcends and becomes an emperor, then the Gu family will have two emperors in one clan. Plus, with Gu Daoyi who is certain to transcend and become an emperor, the Gu family will stand above the myriad realms.</p><p></p><p>From the moment they learned of Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension, their expectations for him changed. Before his descent, they hoped he could transcend and become an emperor to continue the Gu family's glory. But now, they hope Gu Daoyi becomes an immortal sage, so that the Gu family will also have immortal glory.</p><p></p><p>After a round of deliberation, many Gu family elders simultaneously descended to Chengdao Palace. One by one, these old fellows put aside their pride to apologize to Gu Daoyi, admitting that they had underestimated him before, and promised to give him compensation.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Gu Daoyi's face. He was very satisfied with the attitude of the Gu family elders.</p><p></p><p>Although he could understand before, there was still a bit of displeasure in his heart. Now, this bit of displeasure had vanished without a trace, leaving only happiness.</p><p></p><p>The primordial Gu family was even better than he had anticipated. At least these Gu family higher-ups were all upright, frank and candid. From now on, they would all be his supporters behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Ji Mingyue also had a smile on her beautiful face.</p><p></p><p>Before, many elders had left in disappointment. Now, many elders came with great enthusiasm, one by one apologizing to her son and offering compensation. Ji Mingyue's heart was extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>It was sweeter than eating heavenly honey!</p><p></p><p>The many elders took turns holding Gu Daoyi's little hand and talking to him, expressing their importance. Before leaving, they also warned him not to reveal his comprehension to the outside world before the age of three.</p><p></p><p>This way, they could further mislead the outside world. Because the Gu family members did not understand the truth and thought Gu Daoyi was really very ordinary, those people who were paying attention to the Gu family and Gu Daoyi would also completely let down their guard.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it could also build momentum for Gu Daoyi. Let the bullets fly for a while. Three years later, Gu Daoyi would be able to embark on the path of cultivation. At that time, he would be able to display his monstrousness within the Gu family. With his heaven-defying comprehension, he would convince all the people of the Gu family, and Gu Daoyi's prestige would reach a frightening level.</p><p></p><p>Some things are more convincing and leave a deeper impression when reversed.</p><p></p><p>Although this was temporarily somewhat unfavorable to Gu Daoyi, he still agreed. In his view, these things did not matter. Since the elders requested it, then he would do it that way.</p><p></p><p>Lying low for three years was nothing. He could also quietly comprehend the Dao and increase his accumulation in preparation for creating an undying law.</p><p></p><p>Letting the Void Emperor defy the heavens and live out his third life had already become Gu Daoyi's short-term goal.</p><p></p><p>PS: Ten updates every day!

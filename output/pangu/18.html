        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>The ancient land of enlightenment was boiling!</p><p></p><p>The deeds of the divine son Gu Dao Yi quickly spread throughout the ancient land of enlightenment, causing an earth-shattering sensation.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the divine son Gu Dao Yi's heaven-defying comprehension, evolving thirteen top-level Dao phenomena, obtaining the inheritance of Fuxi, or refusing to accept the celestial maiden Gu Qingyao as a follower, all of these were astonishing.</p><p></p><p>Amidst countless discussions, Gu Dao Yi and Huang Wei Yang arrived at the area where the ancient enlightenment tea tree was located. Yes, he was brought here by Huang Wei Yang.</p><p></p><p>The ancient land of enlightenment was very large, with a diameter of 100,000 miles. The ancient Fuxi stele and the ancient enlightenment tea tree were separated by 40,000 to 50,000 miles. Gu Dao Yi didn't want to walk there on foot. As an ordinary person, he didn't know how many years and months it would take to walk there.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi and Huang Wei Yang stood 100 meters away, quietly observing the ancient enlightenment tea tree. The surrounding Gu family disciples who saw the divine son Gu Dao Yi were very excited and full of reverence, but none of them greeted him or made loud noises, fearing to disturb the divine son.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi was only three years old, with an appearance and height no different from a seven or eight-year-old boy. His features were handsome and extraordinary, and his temperament was transcendent, like a young immortal banished from the ninth heaven.</p><p></p><p>Although Huang Wei Yang was born in the ancient era, she lived in that era for a very short time, less than a hundred years. Now, she has only been in the world for fifty years, but she has already cultivated to the peak of the Sealed Emperor realm, which shows how much potential her talent and aptitude have. She is definitely an unrivaled genius of the world.</p><p></p><p>As the only offspring of the Nine Heavens Phoenix, one of the Ten Ancient Fiends, Huang Wei Yang inherited the bloodline and physique of the Nine Heavens Phoenix. She herself also had extremely high talent and comprehension. In the future, she would at least become a peak quasi-emperor.</p><p></p><p>If she had been born in the ancient era or the primordial era, Huang Wei Yang would have had a high probability of attaining the Dao and becoming an emperor.</p><p></p><p>But Huang Wei Yang was born in the current era.</p><p></p><p>This is a golden age, but also an era of great contention. Countless geniuses and prodigies will be born to compete, including imperial sons and daughters, young emperors, young supremes, and other unparalleled geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Even for Huang Wei Yang, it would be very difficult to attain the Dao and become an emperor.</p><p></p><p>Because the Mysterious Yellow World cannot bear so many emperor-level powerhouses, the number of emperor-level powerhouses that can exist simultaneously is limited.</p><p></p><p>For example, in the Desolate Ancient Era, nine emperor-level powerhouses could exist simultaneously. In the Ancient Era, eight emperor-level powerhouses could exist simultaneously. By the Ancient Era, there were even fewer, with only seven emperor-level powerhouses able to exist simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>In the Primordial Era, six emperor-level powerhouses could still exist simultaneously. By the Middle Ancient Era, only five emperor-level powerhouses could exist simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>From the Divine Ancient Era to the Middle Ancient Era, the number of emperor-level powerhouses that could exist in the same period became less and less, because there were too many emperor-level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Over hundreds of millions of years, countless emperor-level powerhouses have emerged, and emperor-level powerhouses cannot resist the passage of time, with only a lifespan of 100,000 years. However, emperor-level powerhouses have various means to prolong their lives, and can even live out a second or third life.</p><p></p><p>If they really cannot defy the heavens and live out the next life, many emperor-level powerhouses will cut themselves with a knife and seal themselves, transforming into a forbidden...</p><p></p><p>In the ancient times, there were rumors that there was a path to immortality, but it would only appear during the Golden Age. Those who couldn't wait and went to search for the path to immortality all died.</p><p></p><p>The strongest Emperors all wanted to become immortals, to have endless life and be eternal and imperishable. So they were willing to endure endless loneliness and wait for the arrival of the Golden Age.</p><p></p><p>After these strongest Emperors cut themselves with a knife, they could only be considered half an Emperor, and there would be one more Emperor position in the world for other creatures to prove their Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, as more and more of the strongest Emperors who cut themselves accumulated over the ages, the burden on the Xuanhuang World became greater and greater, resulting in fewer and fewer Emperors that could exist at the same time.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that there is only one turnip for each hole!</p><p></p><p>For example, now there are still five strongest Emperors in the Xuanhuang World. If other unparalleled geniuses and world-shaking demons want to prove their Dao and become Emperors, they either have to wait for an Emperor to die or go against the Emperor and forcibly kill an Emperor position.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, they will not be able to prove their Dao and become Emperors in their lifetime, and will eventually be mercilessly cut down by time.</p><p></p><p>It's sad and lamentable!</p><p></p><p>However, this life is the Golden Age, and it's different. Some of the strongest Emperors have already predicted that the number of Emperor positions in this life will surge, returning to the level of the ancient times of the gods, and even exceeding ten.</p><p></p><p>Just because there will be a path to immortality in this life!</p><p></p><p>When things reach an extreme, they can only move in the opposite direction. When the path to immortality appears, countless dormant strong Emperors will kill people to become immortals and compete for the opportunity to become immortals. At that time, countless strong Emperors will die.</p><p></p><p>The burden on the Xuanhuang World will be greatly reduced, and naturally it will be able to withstand more creatures proving their Dao and becoming Emperors.</p><p></p><p>It can be imagined how fierce the struggle and killing will be in this life.</p><p></p><p>Even so, after discussing with Huang Weiyao, the Nine Heavenly Phoenix still decided to let Huang Weiyao be born again in the Golden Age.</p><p></p><p>The competition for Emperor positions in this life will be a hundred times more intense than in previous periods, but one can become an immortal in this life, and that is enough.</p><p></p><p>Huang Weiyao is only a little over 120 years old now, and before she was in the form of a girl wearing a pink dress, looking like she was 14 or 15 years old.</p><p></p><p>But now she has transformed into a pink and tender loli of seven or eight years old, wearing a pink dress, looking like a pink jade carving, with a stunning face and a proud figure.</p><p></p><p>This appearance seems to be quite compatible with Gu Daoyi, like a match made in heaven.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's gaze returned from Huang Weiyao, feeling a little strange in his heart. This little girl seems to have some ideas about him.</p><p></p><p>Is this because she feels pressure from Gu Qingyao and Gu Lingshuang?</p><p></p><p>PS: Is anyone reading this? It seems that writing original xuanhuan novels on Feilu is a dead end.</p><p></p><p>If no one reads the ten updates a day, the little author can only run away.</p><p></p><p>Please support the little author, the little author is kneeling and thanking you here!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novel, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The Milo Source Scripture was the first of the Gu family's imperial scriptures that he comprehended. He had been comprehending it for three days, and just now, as he entered enlightenment again, he finally thoroughly understood the Milo Source Scripture. With this, he could create an extremely powerful cultivation technique that contained the great dao of nirvana.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi temporarily did not want to do this. He wanted to wait until he had comprehended all of the Gu family's imperial scriptures, at which point he would have a clear understanding.</p><p></p><p>And that day was coming soon.</p><p></p><p>The ancient Gu family possessed a total of thirteen imperial scriptures, five of which were created by the Gu family's emperor, while the other eight were obtained from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Having comprehended the Milo Source Scripture, and with a partial understanding of the Void Scripture, he only needed about a month to thoroughly comprehend the remaining techniques.</p><p></p><p>At that time, Gu Daoyi would attempt to create an immortality method for the Void Emperor, allowing the Void Emperor to defy the heavens and live out his third lifetime.</p><p></p><p>Closing the imperial scripture, Gu Daoyi rested with his eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, the figure of a Gu family elder appeared in the Imperial Dao Palace. Seeing Gu Daoyi resting, he did not disturb him, but silently waited.</p><p></p><p>After another ten minutes or so, Gu Daoyi slowly woke up and immediately saw the elder waiting for him. His face couldn't help but show an apologetic expression.</p><p></p><p>"I apologize for keeping you waiting for so long."</p><p></p><p>"The divine son need not be like this. The divine son has worked hard for the family, so what harm is there in this old man waiting a bit?" The elder had a gentle smile on his face and waved his hand repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Over the past three years, Gu Daoyi's comprehension ability had deeply convinced this group of Gu family elders.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Void Emperor and Ji Mingyue, only this group of elders knew how heaven-defying Gu Daoyi's comprehension ability was.</p><p></p><p>Each of them had even more fighting spirit and was filled with hope for the future. Gu Daoyi was not only the hope of the Gu family, but also the hope of this group of elders.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation levels of the Gu family elders were basically all at the Ancient Saint realm, with almost none at the Quasi-Emperor realm. This was not to say that the Gu family had no Quasi-Emperors, but rather that the Quasi-Emperors were all in closed-door cultivation, comprehending the dao, training bitterly, or out seeking great opportunities and fortuitous encounters, waiting for the day they could prove the dao and become emperors.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi's heaven-defying comprehension ability meant that in the future, he would certainly be able to greatly assist them. He was also their hope for breaking through to the Quasi-Emperor realm. All of the Gu family elders firmly believed this.</p><p></p><p>In response to the elder's words, Gu Daoyi only smiled. For these elders, he still had to show the proper etiquette.</p><p></p><p>"Daoyi, you are already three years old and can begin cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if you have other ideas, it will be up to you. We will not interfere." The elder said with a smile, his attitude amiable.</p><p></p><p>Gu Daoyi nodded, thought for a moment, and said, "This year's Fuxi Ancient Stele test is about to begin, right? I'll go take a look at the Fuxi Ancient Stele and see if I can gain any insights. After that, I'll start cultivating."</p><p></p><p>"The test for the Fuxi Ancient Stele is today. Do you need me to take you there?" The elder was all smiles.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he was very much looking forward to it. The Fuxi Ancient Stele was created by Emperor Fuxi of the ancient times and possessed immeasurable power and great utility. Later generations of major forces all refined them to test the cultivators within their forces.</p><p></p><p>Within this Fuxi Ancient Stele was contained...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many outstanding individuals have comprehended the Dao of Emperor Fuxi and gained insights from the ancient Fuxi stele, but very few have truly understood it.</p><p></p><p>The tribal elders believed that Gu Dao would certainly gain some understanding. With Gu Dao's extraordinary aptitude, they were more concerned about the extent of his gains.</p><p></p><p>..........</p><p></p><p>The Eastern Wilderness is vast and boundless, divided into three thousand Daozhu (Dao continents), with Shenzhou being one of them.</p><p></p><p>Shenzhou is one of the most prosperous and powerful Daozhu in the entire Eastern Wilderness because it is the ancestral land of the ancient Gu family.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary Daozhu is roughly a million miles in circumference, while Shenzhou is much more extensive, occupying a vast area of five million miles in circumference.</p><p></p><p>Within it, immortal mists fill the sky, and spiritual mountains, divine islands, and immortal ruins are everywhere. Countless spiritual veins and dragon veins crisscross and converge towards the nine ancestral veins in the center, making Shenzhou's spiritual energy extremely rich. It can be said to be one of the best blessed lands in the world of Xuanhuang.</p><p></p><p>In this vast land of Shenzhou, countless ancient and strange beasts, ancient exotic species, and ancient sacred beasts are hidden, all relying on the ancient Gu family for survival and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here, there are countless Gu family cultivators, among whom there are many outstanding individuals, with powerful ones as numerous as clouds and experts as abundant as rain, distributed in various important places, guarding the land of Shenzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Land of Enlightenment is one of these important places and is one of the most popular important places within the ancient Gu family, simply because there are two extremely attractive treasures here.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Land of Enlightenment is a virtual space divine island in the sky of Shenzhou, with a circumference of one hundred thousand miles. From a distance, one can always see hundreds of thousands of cultivators gathering here.</p><p></p><p>In the center of the virtual space divine island, there is a six-zhang-tall ancient tree, not lush with branches and leaves, with only a few branches and leaves on it. This is one of the important treasures of the ancient Gu family - the Ancient Tea Tree of Enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Tea Tree of Enlightenment has endless wonderful uses and can help people comprehend the mysteries and understand the Dao. Its range covers an area of one hundred thousand miles. After the ancient Gu family obtained it, they specially created this virtual space divine island for it.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Tea Tree of Enlightenment is not an elixir of immortality, but it cannot let an emperor live another life. Its main effect is to help people understand the Dao. Cultivating under the tree for one hour is equivalent to cultivating outside for a month. Cultivating within its effective range for one hour can be equivalent to cultivating outside for a day.</p><p></p><p>The tea leaves and tea fruits of the Ancient Tea Tree of Enlightenment can also help people understand the Dao, with excellent effects. The effect of the tea fruits is ten times that of the tea leaves. Unfortunately, the Ancient Tea Tree of Enlightenment only grows one hundred and eight leaves and nine tea fruits every ten thousand years.</p><p></p><p>The tea leaves of enlightenment are effective for those below the Great Sage level, while the tea fruits of enlightenment are effective for Great Sages, Ancient Sages, and Quasi-Emperors. The higher the realm, the worse the effect.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that the one who possesses this Ancient Tea Tree of Enlightenment is a top-level supreme power like the ancient Gu family, it would have been seized by emperors long ago.</p><p></p><p>(PS: Please give flowers!

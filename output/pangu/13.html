        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Fu Xi the Great Emperor!</p><p></p><p>When Gu Dao saw this supremely powerful emperor, who had made great contributions to all races in the universe, vividly appear before his eyes, it left him with an impression of majesty, supreme power, supremacy, vastness, and invincibility.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Emperor Fu Xi is still alive?</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Gu Dao's mind.</p><p></p><p>He immediately denied it. Emperor Fu Xi couldn't possibly still be alive. The ancient times were countless years away from the present. Even an emperor who lived for several lifetimes should have died long ago.</p><p></p><p>If Emperor Fu Xi was alive, it could only mean one thing - Emperor Fu Xi had become an immortal.</p><p></p><p>"You are very good," Emperor Fu Xi suddenly spoke, causing Gu Dao's pupils to slightly contract, but his expression didn't change much.</p><p></p><p>"The blood of the Gu family flows in you. It seems you are from the ancient Gu family."</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Your thoughts are correct. I am already dead, and what remains here is just a remnant thought," Emperor Fu Xi continued.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao was shocked in his heart. Emperor Fu Xi only had this one remnant thought left? What exactly did he experience back then?</p><p></p><p>"If a sage's blood can be reborn, can't an emperor be reborn with just this remnant thought?" Gu Dao spoke after careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>"It's different," Emperor Fu Xi said just three words.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao understood.</p><p></p><p>Regeneration from severed limbs, rebirth from a drop of blood, and such belonged to the way of undying flesh. The spirit and soul were complete, so one could be reborn continuously.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fu Xi only had this remnant thought left. His physical body had long turned to ashes, his flesh no longer existed, and even his spirit and soul had been extinguished. Relying on this wisp of remnant thought to be reborn was as difficult as becoming an immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Since you can enter the Fu Xi space I created, your comprehension has passed. In that case, I will give you some opportunities. Whether you can take them depends on your abilities."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Fu Xi waved his sleeve, and specks of golden light surged out, converging into a river, finally forming four jade pages, flickering with the light of the Dao, filled with endless wonders of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"These are the techniques I created. Every cultivator who enters the Fu Xi space has a chance to comprehend them. How much you can understand depends on your own fate."</p><p></p><p>"Remember, you only have ten days."</p><p></p><p>With that, Emperor Fu Xi's remnant thought dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao's eyes flashed. Emperor Fu Xi was quite good. As expected of an emperor who made great contributions, he left behind great opportunities and fortunes for later generations even after his death.</p><p></p><p>"Ten days? That should be enough," Gu Dao muttered in his heart. He then looked at the four jade pages. His comprehension was extraordinary. He had thoroughly comprehended an emperor's scripture before, and Maitreya Emperor's Maitreya Source Canon was close to an immortal scripture, but he only took three days.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao beckoned with his hand to see if he could make the four jade pages come over. Otherwise, without cultivation, it would be difficult for him to examine them.</p><p></p><p>The four jade pages flew over and landed in his hands, as if they had substance, making Gu Dao click his tongue in amazement. After a brief comprehension, he understood what techniques were used.</p><p></p><p>Without further delay, Gu Dao examined the four jade pages in his hands. The first jade page recorded Emperor Fu Xi's scripture, called the "Fu Xi Dao Manifestation Scripture".</p><p></p><p>The remaining three jade pages recorded Emperor Fu Xi's three most powerful divine arts respectively: the Fu Xi Dao Severing Sword Art, the Dao Suppressing Fist, and the Dao Commanding Seal.</p><p></p><p>"Manifesting the Dao, severing the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Tao, Suppressing Tao, Controlling Tao, Fuxi the Great Emperor had grand ambitions."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the names of these four techniques, Gu Dao Yi's expression became slightly solemn as he murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Fuxi Yandao Scripture was the emperor's scripture of Fuxi the Great Emperor, extremely powerful. The Fuxi Zhandao Sword Formula and Zhendao Fist were Fuxi the Great Emperor's attacking methods, unmatched in power, and had shaken the ancient era back then. </p><p></p><p>But what was the Yudao Seal?</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi had read the secret records about the strongest emperors from ancient times to the present in the Gu family's internal archives. Fuxi the Great Emperor did not have this ingenious technique called Yudao Seal. It should have been the Zhaidao Palm or the Pingdao Finger instead.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that this was the supreme subtle technique created by Fuxi the Great Emperor before his death, placed at the end of the four techniques. It should be the most difficult one." Gu Dao Yi thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see how powerful Fuxi the Great Emperor's four techniques really are."</p><p></p><p>With this thought emerging, Gu Dao Yi first browsed the "Fuxi Yandao Scripture", preparing to comprehend this emperor scripture first.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Tao transforms all, the Heavens perform their Tao, the Earth performs its laws, Humans perform their techniques... Myriad Tao give birth to each other, myriad laws follow each other, myriad techniques reflect each other... Tao evolves the universe, the ancestor of all things, tracing back to the origin..."</p><p></p><p>The golden characters in the emperor scripture jumped out one by one, emitting sounds like the Yellow Bell and Great LÃ¼, making Gu Dao Yi immersed in it, unable to extricate himself.</p><p></p><p>Around him, countless strange phenomena appeared. They were the endless Tao phenomena evolving. There were powerful ones opening up the Heavens, gods and demons destroying the world, the birth and death of the universe, the Great Tao returning to its origin, the reincarnation of myriad Tao...</p><p></p><p>Unknowingly, three days passed. Gu Dao Yi opened his eyes, and two rays of brilliance flashed from them.</p><p></p><p>"What a 'Fuxi Yandao Scripture'!" Gu Dao Yi sighed in admiration. </p><p></p><p>Fuxi the Great Emperor had attained the workings of creation, his cultivation was already close to immortality. This Fuxi Yandao Scripture was also close to an immortal scripture, not inferior to the Milo Source Canon of Emperor Milo.</p><p></p><p>"This emperor scripture is very suitable for me. After comprehending it, my speed of understanding other emperor scriptures and techniques will be even faster, indirectly enhancing my comprehension ability. It's really heaven-defying." Gu Dao Yi couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>His comprehension ability was already heaven-defying, and the Fuxi Yandao Scripture could help him deduce the myriad Tao and laws. Although the enhancement was not much, this was just one emperor scripture.</p><p></p><p>When he studied and researched it later, constantly improving and enhancing the profoundness of the Fuxi Yandao Scripture, its help to him would be even greater then.</p><p></p><p>"Phew~" </p><p></p><p>Exhaling a breath, Gu Dao Yi looked at the remaining three techniques and entered the state of comprehending the Tao again.</p><p></p><p>Six days later, Gu Dao Yi woke up, exhaling a long breath, his expression a bit tired.</p><p></p><p>Continuously comprehending four emperor-level techniques consumed a lot from him. Although he had heaven-defying comprehension, he ultimately lacked cultivation. Fortunately, he completed his goal.</p><p></p><p>Gu Dao Yi decided to start cultivating as soon as he returned to the Imperial Tao Palace. With his comprehension ability, his cultivation speed should be very fast. As for cultivation resources? </p><p></p><p>He didn't lack these things at all.</p><p></p><p>PS: Is anyone reading this? It seems writing original Xuanhuan novels on Feilu is indeed a dead end?</p><p></p><p>If no one reads it even with ten updates every day, this little author can only run away.</p><p></p><p>Please support me, dear readers. This little author is kowtowing in thanks here!</p><p></p><p>Feilu Novels, Fei wants you to have a good read!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of his good state, Gao Xian began sitting in meditation to cultivate the Five Phases Skill. </p><p></p><p>The Five Phases Skill circulates the forces of metal, wood, water, fire and earth, corresponding to the lungs, liver, kidneys, heart and spleen respectively. At the same time, one must visualize the corresponding Five Phases talismans in the mind's eye.</p><p></p><p>For each of the metal, wood, water, fire and earth spiritual energies, one must circulate it once, completing a full cycle of circulating through the body, which takes about three minutes. </p><p></p><p>In one cultivation session, one must complete at least thirty-six full body circulations in order to make progress.</p><p></p><p>Using one's spiritual awareness to guide the spiritual energy circulating along a fixed route within the body, while simultaneously visualizing the corresponding talismans, is extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the original host had cultivated from a young age and had a solid foundation. Gao Xian inherited these memories, so his cultivation these past few days has gone relatively smoothly.</p><p></p><p>This time, with a thought from Gao Xian, Lan Jie appeared in the depth of his mind's eye. </p><p></p><p>Through the Great Spirit Avatar Technique, he and Lan Jie share an intangible yet exceptionally close connection. Whatever he thinks, Lan Jie can naturally act according to his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian had Lan Jie help him visualize the talismans while he circulated the Five Phases Skill for thirty-six cycles.</p><p></p><p>Without an accurate timing tool, based on Gao Xian's own calculation, this cultivation session only took around thirty minutes.</p><p></p><p>The efficiency was more than four times higher than when he cultivated alone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Lan Jie's cultivation effect was even better.</p><p></p><p>Over the course of the day, Gao Xian cultivated three times, circulating the Five Phases Skill a total of one hundred and eight cycles.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the positive side of the Wind and Moon Manual, he could see that his cultivation base had solidly increased by a bit.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian was greatly delighted by this result.</p><p></p><p>Since transmigrating here a few days ago, he had not neglected his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivation is the root, and he was also very interested in transcendent powers.</p><p></p><p>However, after practicing for a few days, his cultivation base had not increased at all.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the original host had to take pills to level up - his aptitude was indeed lacking.</p><p></p><p>With Lan Jie's help visualizing the talismans, the speed of casting spells was also greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>A flame flickered on and off at Gao Xian's fingertips, as if he held a lighter that kept being turned on and off.</p><p></p><p>On his other hand, a faint wisp of mist appeared and vanished - this was the Water Controlling Technique.</p><p></p><p>At this stage, for basic spells like the Fire Controlling and Water Controlling Techniques, Gao Xian didn't even need to recite incantations or use hand seals, he could cast them instantly.</p><p></p><p>According to the original host's memories, although low-level, these two techniques formed the foundation for many other spells.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Cleansing Technique was an advanced variation of the Water Controlling Technique.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian repeatedly used all the spells he knew, reveling in the wondrous feeling of commanding transcendent powers.</p><p></p><p>After messing around like this for over a day, Gao Xian gradually calmed down from his initial excited state.</p><p></p><p>As good as Lan Jie was, she couldn't help him refine pills. For now, he still needed to find a way to refine pills himself.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it the innkeeper had reached the ninth level of Qi Condensation, just one step away from the Foundation Establishment realm. In this small Feima Town, she was renowned for her fighting ability.</p><p></p><p>Spells like the Fire and Water Controlling Techniques were low-level and useless against her. Even if she just stood there and let him attack, he probably couldn't hurt a single hair on her.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Manager Zhu was a disciple of the Lianyun Sect, and his master was an Elder of the Lianyun Sect.</p><p></p><p>The two parties had a very close relationship, not something that could be resolved through violence.</p><p></p><p>Conversely, Manager Zhu and his wife wouldn't do anything too extreme to him either. At most, they would send him back to be dealt with by his own master.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of that unseen master, Gao Xian couldn't help but shudder.</p><p></p><p>According to the original host's memories, if Manager Zhu sent him back, that master would definitely break both his legs.</p><p></p><p>Secretly leave Feima Town?</p><p></p><p>Feima Town was a newly established market town by the Lianyun Sect, located deep in the Tengshe Mountains, two to three thousand li away from the Lianyun Sect itself.</p><p></p><p>The Tengshe Mountains were filled with demonic beasts everywhere, as well as exceptionally terrifying evil spirits.</p><p></p><p>Based on the original host's memories, with his current abilities, he definitely couldn't make it out of the Tengshe Mountains alone.</p><p></p><p>"There are still eight days left, I should try my best to explore every possible solution."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian picked up the book "Essential Formulas for Refining Elixirs" and flipped through it. Over the past two days, he had received some more memories from the original host, so he could barely understand the book now.</p><p></p><p>After patiently reading for a while, Gao Xian couldn't help but throw the book away in frustration. </p><p></p><p>Even if he could barely comprehend the theory, he was still far, far away from practical application.</p><p></p><p>"This won't work, I need to find another way."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian picked the book back up, then went to a cabinet nearby and took out all the books and items inside.</p><p></p><p>There were thirteen low-grade spirit stones, a long sword made of pine-patterned fine steel, some sets of clothing, a few books, a box of ten white dew pills, and a few low-grade talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>This was the entirety of the property left behind by the original host.</p><p></p><p>He had actually gone through these things several times before, but he took them out again mainly to organize his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian's mind was exceptionally clear now, and he had a strange intuition that the items he needed were among these things.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stones were crystals naturally formed from condensed spiritual energy, the universal currency in the cultivator's world, comparable to gold in the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The thirteen low-grade spirit stones had limited purchasing power, not enough to solve his problems.</p><p></p><p>The sword was useless, as were the white dew pills, clothing, and talismans.</p><p></p><p>So it had to be these few books.</p><p></p><p>"The Theory of the Five Elements' Mutual Production and Restraint", "Mysterious Formulas from the Cavern", "Thirty-Six Methods of Refining Pills"...</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Gao Xian's heart stirred, and he picked up "Mysterious Formulas from the Cavern".</p><p></p><p>He had flipped through this book before, which recorded formulas for dual cultivation, not exactly proper stuff. At the time, he had thrown it aside after seeing the contents.</p><p></p><p>"If it's not proper, that's exactly right - it matches the Carnal Cultivation Manual perfectly!"</p><p></p><p>Actually, "Mysterious Formulas from the Cavern" was quite simple, only recording nine formulas, including details on how to refine them.</p><p></p><p>After reading the first formula, Deer Antler Powder, Gao Xian suddenly had an insight.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Carnal Cultivation Manual, and saw that a new pill formula had appeared on the back.</p><p></p><p>Deer Antler Powder: A tonic for strengthening yang and replenishing the kidneys. (Beginner 1/10).</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian was overjoyed. Learning a single pill formula wasn't that big a deal, but the key was that this formula could level up!</p><p></p><p>By consuming ten points of Human Dao spiritual light, Deer Antler Powder quickly upgraded to the Proficient level.</p><p></p><p>The fairy Lan in the Carnal Cultivation Manual began demonstrating how to select herbs, wash, soak, boil, and sun-dry them, how to grind the ingredients into powder and mix them in the right proportions, how to bake and refine them with fire...</p><p></p><p>In a short time, Gao Xian learned how to refine Deer Antler Powder, mastering all the details of the process.</p><p></p><p>"It really works!" Gao Xian was even more excited. Deer Antler Powder itself wasn't that useful, but the technique for refining it was exactly what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Deer Antler Powder: Tonic for strengthening yang and replenishing the kidneys. (Proficient 1/10).</p><p></p><p>It took ten points to level up once. Gao Xian looked at the over one hundred remaining points of Human Dao spiritual light and unhesitatingly spent them consecutively on Deer Antler Powder.</p><p></p><p>Deer Antler Powder leveled up to Master level using only fifty points of Human Dao spiritual light. But to go from Master to Grandmaster required another fifty points.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian looked at the Great Immortal Technique, which required five thousand points of Human Dao spiritual light just to level up once.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, this was too cheap.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his own life, Gao Xian gritted his teeth and forcibly leveled Deer Antler Powder up to the Grandmaster level.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the qualitative leap from Master to Grandmaster required far more Human Dao spiritual light.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found a path, so of course he would go all-out. The few dozen remaining points of spiritual light couldn't do anything else anyway.</p><p></p><p>The fairy Lan in the Carnal Cultivation Manual began refining Deer Antler Powder again.</p><p></p><p>The process was the same as before, but Lan's every movement was exceptionally graceful, with an indescribable marvelous and spiritual charm.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian's mind was shaken, gaining countless insights and experiences about refining Deer Antler Powder.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the original host's decade-plus of memories about pill refining were also awakened.</p><p></p><p>Selecting herbs, firing up the furnace to refine pills, controlling the flame temperature - scene after scene merged into Gao Xian's memories...</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After the shopkeeper Zhu and his wife walked away, Gao Xian finally let out a breath. </p><p></p><p>"That couple is so ruthless, you dare to get involved with them? You've got guts..."</p><p></p><p>Not far from the main gate, a thin old man stood there, smiling and making sarcastic remarks.</p><p></p><p>The old man's hair was in a messy bun, with dark circles under his eyes. His pale face and the greasy, wine-stained black robe gave him the look of someone indulging in alcohol and lust.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian suddenly remembered - this old man was his next-door neighbor, surname Wang, whose hobby was going to brothels to drink.</p><p></p><p>"A good-for-nothing old lecher!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian didn't want any trouble with such a person, so he pretended not to hear.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Gao Xian's honest look, old Wang became even more smug and sneered.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian turned around, closed the courtyard gate, shutting old Wang and his laughter outside. He hurried back to his room.</p><p></p><p>From the few Tao books left by the original owner, Gao Xian took out "The Essential Secrets of Pill Refining" and began reading. Although the shopkeeper Zhu was easy to talk to, pill refining was the key to establishing himself, so he had to master this skill as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>Since the original owner knew how to refine pills, perhaps by reading more he could recall the method.</p><p></p><p>But after reading for a little while, Gao Xian felt dizzy and confused.</p><p></p><p>He recognized every single character in the book, but when put together, the words became a jumbled mess that made no sense.</p><p></p><p>This reminded him of studying advanced mathematics in the past.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian put down the book helplessly. This was not something that could be learned by rote memorization.</p><p></p><p>He sat on the bed thinking for a long time but could not come up with any solution.</p><p></p><p>A little black cat jumped onto the bed and meowed at Gao Xian a couple of times.</p><p></p><p>"Are you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian stroked the little black cat's head affectionately. This little creature was really quite adorable.</p><p></p><p>After spending a few days together, Gao Xian could roughly understand the kitten's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>When it wanted to be petted, the kitten would wag its tail, and its meows would be softer and gentler. When hungry, its meows would be sharper, and it wouldn't wag its tail.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian got off the bed and went to the kitchen next door to cook rice.</p><p></p><p>The rice grains were bluish-green in color, about the size of peanuts, with a faint, jade-like translucent quality.</p><p></p><p>This was called "Qing Yu Ling" rice, rich in spiritual energy and quite expensive.</p><p></p><p>One low-grade spirit stone could only buy ten pounds of it.</p><p></p><p>And this was the lowest grade of spiritual rice.</p><p></p><p>The original owner was a pill refiner, so with his pill refining skills, he could still make a decent living.</p><p></p><p>There was a large half-jar of Qing Yu Ling rice stored at home, as well as some monster meat kept in the cellar in the courtyard where the low temperature could preserve meat for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, food was not a concern.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few days, Gao Xian had also gotten used to the lifestyle of a cultivator and was adept at cooking with fire.</p><p></p><p>The stove was made of bricks with a large iron pot, like the kind used to stew a whole goose at a rural restaurant, but even more rudimentary.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian recited a few incantations, made a hand seal, and a foot-long flame burst from his fingertip, quickly igniting the firewood in the stove.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian still felt excited every time he used the Fire Taming technique. This was real magic, not some kind of trickery!</p><p></p><p>The Fire Taming technique wasn't very powerful, just equivalent to carrying a large lighter. But even so, it completely shattered Gao Xian's previous understanding of physics.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of the Fire Taming technique that Gao Xian realized this was a real world of cultivators, where they all possessed tremendous power...</p><p></p><p>From this perspective, this place was a hundred times more dangerous than a place where everyone had guns.</p><p></p><p>Whether he liked it or not, it seemed he could not return from this world he had transmigrated into.</p><p></p><p>As a middle-aged corporate slave who had suffered society's poisons, Gao Xian had long learned to accept reality.</p><p></p><p>To use a clich√©, "Everything is for the best!"</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because Gao Xian could think this way that he could still live quite happily despite being utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>Now he didn't dwell on pill refining anymore and focused on cutting the monster meat into pieces to pan-fry, then adding water, rice, and salt to make fragrant hand-pulled rice.</p><p></p><p>The large iron pot was fixed on the stove, suitable only for steaming, boiling, and stewing, so cooking everything together in one pot was quite convenient.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the aroma of meat wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The little black cat meowed incessantly on the stove, but didn't dare get too close. </p><p></p><p>Lifting the rough wooden pot lid, the jade spirit rice grains were already large, and after absorbing water they had expanded several rounds, filling a large wooden basin that Gao Xian had.</p><p></p><p>He took out a rough clay bowl and gave the little black cat a small portion. </p><p></p><p>Gao Xian ate the remaining rice and meat in one breath.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, the jade spirit rice was truly fragrant, and the meat of the demonic beast was even more fragrant. </p><p></p><p>After eating his fill, not only were his taste buds and stomach satisfied, but the spiritual energy within was also exceptionally and warmly replenished, indescribably comfortable.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian burped contentedly, if it weren't for Mr. Zhu the shopkeeper and his wife causing trouble, this simple yet fulfilling life could be called blissful.</p><p></p><p>He stroked the little black cat burying its head in the meat and said softly, "Eat more, once you're full you won't miss home..."</p><p></p><p>The little black cat meowed twice, either in response to Gao Xian or out of enjoyment of the food.</p><p></p><p>Having eaten and drunk his fill, with spiritual energy brimming within, Gao Xian felt drowsy.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian mustered his energy and took out the Mirror of Intimacy again.</p><p></p><p>This time he looked at the other side of the mirror.</p><p></p><p>The Mirror of Intimacy was divided into two sides, one side could reflect his appearance and reveal his various abilities.</p><p></p><p>However, on the other side of the mirror was a woman.</p><p></p><p>The woman had a beautiful and delicate appearance, wearing a red cross-collared dress that reached her chest.</p><p></p><p>The dress was smooth and slightly transparent, faintly revealing the woman's snow-white skin and slender, curvaceous figure.</p><p></p><p>The key point was that this woman looked like his first love, but also resembled his colleague Sister Lan, an elegant yet sexy mature lady.</p><p></p><p>Well, those two did look alike! Only their demeanors were different, one pure and the other charming, vastly dissimilar.</p><p></p><p>There were also differences in their figures - Sister Lan wasn't fat, her white tender skin revealing the plump beauty unique to mature ladies.</p><p></p><p>As for his first love, she had a tall slender figure and taut skin, possessing the youthful vigor unique to girls.</p><p></p><p>The woman in the mirror combined the virtues of purity and sophistication. However, her mannerisms and expressions carried a seductive quality, appearing somewhat improper no matter how you looked at it.</p><p></p><p>After studying for a few days, for convenience's sake, Gao Xian called this woman Sister Lan.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that Sister Lan was actually alive, not a living person, but able to interact with him... well, like an advanced interactive AI program.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian stretched out his hand and gently tapped on Sister Lan.</p><p></p><p>In the mirror, Sister Lan raised her head and gave Gao Xian a charming smile, while text simultaneously appeared on the mirror surface.</p><p></p><p>The intimacies of life are humanity's greatest good and beauty.</p><p>Embodying an aura of charm, witnessing life's beauty, one can attain the Way.</p><p></p><p>Human Spiritual Illumination: 335</p><p>Secret Arts: Lightning Subduing Dragon Hand, Great Effigy Deity Method</p><p></p><p>Lightning Subduing Dragon Hand: When performing certain fixed simple movements, hand speed becomes extraordinarily fast, hands imbued with lightning force that delivers wondrous stimulation upon contact. (Mastery 188/300)  </p><p></p><p>Great Effigy Deity Method: Mind within resonates, spirit descends without. High and low connect, dual vital breaths combine into divinity. Thirty years of idle fantasies and obsessions coalesce into a point of true spirit, with myriad wondrous applications. (Expert 321/400)</p><p></p><p>The first time Gao Xian saw this text, he felt extremely embarrassed and even a bit angry.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Lightning Subduing Dragon Hand.</p><p></p><p>The Great Effigy Deity Method was clearly mocking him for fantasizing about beautiful women and treating his teachers like wives.</p><p></p><p>It was simply slander - he was just an ordinary, upright middle-aged man who had never done anything wrong. Damn it, just thinking about it was wrong!</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian could actually tolerate these things, but the problem was they weren't useful at all!</p><p></p><p>Human Spiritual Illumination could only strengthen the abilities on the opposite side of the mirror, completely useless for abilities like pill refinement.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that Sister Lan should be able to play some role! But exactly how to utilize her still required more research...</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed like Human Spiritual Illumination had increased by a few points?</p><p></p><p>The new book will update twice a day, once in the afternoon and once in the evening. For now, the most important thing for the new book is the reading data, so please take a look twice a day.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

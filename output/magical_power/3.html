        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian remembered clearly that his original Humane Spirit Light was 335 points. In order to experiment, he used two points of Humane Spirit Light, leaving 333 points remaining. </p><p></p><p>But how did it become 335 points again?</p><p></p><p>Where did these two additional points of Humane Spirit Light come from? Today he had only seen three people.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian couldn't help but think of the somewhat complex look in his sister-in-law's eyes when she left. Could it be related to his sister-in-law?</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, there was no way to verify it.</p><p></p><p>Gaining these few points of Humane Spirit Light wasn't of much use anyway, and there was no time to investigate it deeply now.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian tapped his fingers, allocating 300 points to the Electric Subduing Dragon Hand skill, upgrading it from the proficient level directly to the expert level.</p><p></p><p>Electric Subduing Dragon Hand: When performing fixed simple actions, hand speed becomes extremely fast, concealing electric force in the hands, able to bring intense wonderful sensations to anything touched. (1/400 expert)</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian noticed the change in the description keenly. Originally it said "certain fixed simple actions", but after upgrading to expert level, the word "certain" was removed.</p><p></p><p>In other words, as long as it was a fixed simple action, his hand speed could become extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, when allocating points just now, his fingers moved extraordinarily quickly, tapping 113 times in just two to three seconds.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, what did "intense wonderful sensations" refer to?</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman in the mirror who resembled his sister Lan also moved. She extended her tender jade-like hands and performed a few simple actions like curling her fingers, making a fist, and waving her hands.</p><p></p><p>The woman's hand movements became faster and faster, yet her beautiful face took on an increasingly charming expression, her roving eyes seeming shy yet delighted, causing Gao Xian's heart to flutter wildly, making him wish he could join the lady.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Gao Xian's hands felt numb and tingly as if electrified, swelling and heating up at the same time.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his own hands, seeing electric light flickering under the skin, while the muscles and bones inside his palms seemed to be constantly adjusting and changing.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian suddenly realized that the Electric Subduing Dragon Hand skill altered the state of his hands, allowing them to become faster and steadier.</p><p></p><p>He also understood that although the few actions of this skill were simple, they covered most scenarios involving the use of hands.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian felt energized. This skill wasn't completely useless after all.</p><p></p><p>If it could be upgraded further, perhaps more limitations could be removed, allowing his fast hands to be applied in even more environments.</p><p></p><p>But he lacked sufficient Humane Spirit Light.</p><p></p><p>The Great Puppet Divine Art could be upgraded, but what use was that?</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian felt he shouldn't act recklessly and should study it carefully first.</p><p></p><p>He grabbed the little black cat's neck and pulled it over.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian's action of grabbing the cat was extremely fast, too quick for the cat to even react.</p><p></p><p>The little black cat felt uncomfortable, meowing twice while shaking its head and tail vigorously, its fur standing on end as it struggled to break free from Gao Xian's grasp.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian used the Electric Subduing Dragon Hand skill, stroking the cat's fur gently.</p><p></p><p>"Meow...meow..."</p><p></p><p>The frantically struggling kitten immediately went limp, obediently lying beside Gao Xian, its eyes closing in comfort.</p><p></p><p>Its originally shrill meows also turned into soft, cute little sounds...</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian suddenly understood - the Electric Subduing Dragon Hand was actually a divine petting technique!</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a long time, Gao Xian basically grasped the use of the Electric Subduing Dragon Hand skill.</p><p></p><p>It could be used for petting cats or even people. With this skill, he could open a massage parlor and be guaranteed booming business and piles of money!</p><p></p><p>But it didn't solve his current problem.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian suppressed his restless emotions and took out the Romantic Treasured Mirror, his gaze falling on the Great Puppet Divine Art.</p><p></p><p>The Great Puppet Divine Art was already at the expert level, only 80 points away from the next level.</p><p></p><p>Since his Humane Spirit Light was limited...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It's no use hesitating, might as well give it a try.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian mustered his determination and added 80 points of human spiritual light to the Great Puppet Spirit Technique. </p><p></p><p>Great Puppet Spirit Technique: The heart senses the inner, the spirit descends to the outer. High and low connect, the two vital energies unite into spirit. Wondrous uses are endless. (1/5000 Grandmaster level).</p><p></p><p>Seeing the data on the mirror, Gao Xian was a bit dazed. How did he reach the Grandmaster level? The upgrade required a tenfold increase in points.</p><p></p><p>What was so special about this Grandmaster level of the Great Puppet Spirit Technique?</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian couldn't help but look towards Lan Jie in the Mirror of Wind and Moon. Lan Jie seemed to sense his gaze, shyly lowering her head and gracefully turning to walk deeper into the mirror.</p><p></p><p>A point of red candlelight appeared deep in the mirror, illuminating the pearl curtains.</p><p></p><p>Behind the pearl curtains was a brocade couch, with bright yellow mandarin duck embroidered brocade bedding and a jade pillow placed askew.</p><p></p><p>Lan Jie parted the pearl curtains, took off her embroidered shoes, and lazily lay on the couch with her back to Gao Xian.</p><p></p><p>Lying horizontally, Lan Jie's neck, shoulders, waist, hips, and legs curved beautifully, fully displaying a woman's graceful and charming figure.</p><p></p><p>Her undergarments were in disarray, revealing part of her slender calves and snowy white jade feet.</p><p></p><p>The swaying pearl curtains cast thousands of twinkling lights, behind which Lan Jie appeared even more dreamily alluring.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Lan Jie's charming beauty, Gao Xian's mouth went dry. This was way more sensual than what the Eastern teachers showed.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian suddenly realized that at some point, he had already stood in front of the pearl curtains.</p><p></p><p>Lan Jie behind the curtains seemed within reach.</p><p></p><p>"This...this...isn't right..." Gao Xian's heart was torn by intense conflict. He really wanted to go over and spend an intimate time with her.</p><p></p><p>But he was very clear that Lan Jie wasn't a real person, just a fantasy puppet spirit existing in the Mirror of Wind and Moon, an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Doing this seemed quite shameful...</p><p></p><p>As Gao Xian battled within himself, Lan Jie on the couch slowly turned towards him with a gentle smile, her beautiful eyes full of charming grace and tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Gao Xian didn't move, Lan Jie playfully beckoned him with her finger.</p><p></p><p>A light gesture, yet it stirred up towering waves that overwhelmed all of Gao Xian's rationality.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Gao Xian sat on the bed. Just now, it seemed he had entered the Mirror of Wind and Moon, making love with Lan Jie in an exquisite boudoir.</p><p></p><p>It was like a vivid dream, indescribable.</p><p></p><p>The union of the two vital energies, the communion of spirit and mind, was like entering an unsurpassed wondrous realm. Yet his inner energy circulated into spirit, then returned from spirit to energy, cycling endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian was certain that not only was this harmless to the body, it could actually refine his energy and strengthen his spirit.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique was supremely profound. Through this form of communion, his spirit, energy, and essence would become increasingly powerful, and the puppet spirit Lan Jie would also grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster level Lan Jie could even enter his mind's eye and help him condense talismans.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators practicing techniques, the first key was visualizing talismans in the spiritual world.</p><p></p><p>Only after forming the talisman could one gather and circulate the energies of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian had inherited some memories of the original host and knew that talismans were key to cultivation and spellcasting.</p><p></p><p>With Lan Jie's help condensing talismans, it would save him time and effort visualizing them, which was immensely useful!</p><p></p><p>However, such a secret technique inevitably carried certain implications that conflicted slightly with the moral education he had received.</p><p></p><p>So he felt a bit embarrassed about it.</p><p></p><p>But Lan Jie smiled at him, even beckoning him with her finger, who could resist that!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

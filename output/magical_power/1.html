        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Snake Twisting Mountain, Flying Horse Gathering.</p><p></p><p>Leaning against the wall, Gao Xian's leg twitched slightly as he was abruptly awakened from a nightmare. </p><p></p><p>The first thing that caught his eye was a strangely shaped yellow brass pill furnace, about one meter tall, shaped like a kettle without a spout. It had three toad-leg-like supports and a brick base underneath.</p><p></p><p>Below the base was a passage for making fires, connected to a chimney. More accurately, it was a rather complex wood-burning stove.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian stared blankly for a moment before sighing. This oddly shaped pill furnace was his means of making a living.</p><p></p><p>It was already the third day since he had transmigrated. He had adapted to his new body and new name, but could not get used to his new identity: a pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian stretched out his left hand and silently chanted: "Summon."</p><p></p><p>A bronze mirror of ancient elegance appeared in his hand, with the four words "Wind and Moon Precious Mirror" engraved on the handle.</p><p></p><p>This Wind and Moon Precious Mirror was a peripheral item from the novel Dream of the Red Chamber, a birthday gift from a friend. Somehow it had transmigrated with him.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the smooth mirror surface reflected a handsome, youthful face.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian usually just read some Water Margin fan fiction and watched some low-budget movies, so he couldn't find suitable words to describe his current appearance.</p><p></p><p>Phrases like "sword-like brows and starry eyes" or "jade-like countenance" seemed too clich√©d and hollow.</p><p></p><p>He could only say he looked a bit like a certain young male movie star - handsome, upright, and vigorous. Especially his black eyes, sparkling and bright as if they could shine...</p><p></p><p>It felt like there was a professional lighting crew shining lights right at him!</p><p></p><p>The only flaw was his pale complexion and dark undereye circles, making him look rather unhealthy.</p><p></p><p>"If I had this face, I could stay single for over thirty years!"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian stroked his own face with some vanity, lamenting the laborious days ahead relying solely on his own hands.</p><p></p><p>This was the only aspect of his transmigration he was satisfied with - a youthful body full of vitality and a handsome, hopeful face!</p><p></p><p>Words began appearing on the mirror's surface:</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian: Lifespan 24/66</p><p>Cultivation: Qi Refining Second Level (2/200)</p><p>Five Phase Skill Second Level Proficient (15/200)  </p><p>Fire Control Beginner (88/100)</p><p>Water Control Beginner (80/100)</p><p>Cleaning Beginner (95/100)</p><p>Featherweight Proficient (99/200)</p><p>Pure Wind Sword Beginner (33/100)</p><p>First Level Pill Refining Proficient (29/1000)</p><p>Qi Restoring Pill Proficient (55/200)</p><p>Foundation Establishing Pill Proficient (41/200) </p><p>White Dew Pill Proficient (11/200)</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian had studied for two days and basically understood the uses of the Wind and Moon Precious Mirror.</p><p></p><p>This mirror could display his personal status, quantifying his various abilities. The problem was that his Pill Refining skill was grayed out, unable to be used.</p><p></p><p>No matter what methods Gao Xian tried, he could not activate Pill Refining or change the data shown in the mirror.</p><p></p><p>According to the original host's memories, he was the pill refiner for a pharmacy!</p><p></p><p>The pharmacy provided the pill ingredients, and he provided the pills.</p><p></p><p>He currently owed the pharmacy five hundred each of the Qi Restoring Pill, Foundation Establishing Pill, and White Dew Pill.</p><p></p><p>He also had a huge problem: the original host had secretly exchanged a batch of refined pills for Blood Revitalizing Pills.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Revitalizing Pill was an extremely potent qi-cultivating pill. After taking it, the original host had broken through to the second level of qi refining, but then died somehow, leaving his body to Gao Xian.</p><p></p><p>The large quantity of ingredients used for refining had become a huge loss. How could he explain this to the pharmacy owner?</p><p></p><p>An even more serious issue was that the original host's memories were incomplete, including those related to pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had enough ingredients, he currently could not refine any pills.</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, he should have delivered the first batch of pills five days ago.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what consequences there would be for not delivering the pills on time, but he imagined there would be nothing good!</p><p></p><p>As Gao Xian was pondering solutions, he heard the courtyard gate creak open. He startled and hurried to peek out the window.</p><p></p><p>Through the cracks in the window paper, Gao Xian saw the short, fat pig-like Proprietor Zhu, followed by the tall, large-bosomed Madam Zhu.</p><p></p><p>The two stood together, almost two feet difference in their heights.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>There was one fat and one tall, this combination left an exceptionally deep impression. It also allowed Gao Xian to recognize their identities at a glance. </p><p></p><p>Gao Xian sighed and tugged at his wrinkled Daoist robe. After taking a deep breath, he pushed open the door to welcome them in.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhu, Sister-in-law, please come inside..."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian put on the professional smile he had cultivated over 20 years as a corporate drone, politely and warmly greeting the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Little Gao, how's it going?" The fat and big-eared Boss Zhu asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian said with an embarrassed look: "Brother Zhu, I'm in a hurry to break through to the second level of qi cultivation, but I haven't refined the spirit pills yet. As soon as I'm done, I'll send them right over to you."</p><p></p><p>Boss Zhu smiled and said, "Little Gao, cultivation must proceed step-by-step. You absolutely cannot be impatient. Going off the rails could cost lives."</p><p></p><p>The madam standing beside him had a cold, hard expression. She didn't say a word, but just standing there with a solemn face was oppressive. </p><p></p><p>Gao Xian felt a twinge of guilt. His own stature was actually not short - he reckoned he was at least 1.85 meters tall. Yet standing before the madam, he was shorter by half a head.</p><p></p><p>In his memory, this madam had reached the ninth level of qi cultivation and excelled at breaking bones with overwhelming martial power.</p><p></p><p>However, this madam had deep eyes and brows, well-defined facial features, and a wheat-colored skin that was tight and lustrous. Her loose blue Daoist robe could not conceal her ample bosom and long legs.</p><p></p><p>Her facial features were profound, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the movie version of Wonder Woman, just more exquisite.</p><p></p><p>Up close, Gao Xian realized the madam was very beautiful. In this dusty place, there was actually such a beauty!</p><p></p><p>Out of a man's instinct, out of over thirty years of being a shy introvert, he couldn't help but take an extra look.</p><p></p><p>The madam's brows furrowed slightly, her beautiful green eyes shifting to give Gao Xian a meaningful glance.</p><p></p><p>"What does the madam mean by that look?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian didn't understand the meaning behind her gaze, yet it didn't stop him from being humble and obedient. With a modest expression, he explained, "Brother Zhu, I'm in a hurry to break through my cultivation level so I can better refine spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>"The higher the cultivation, the better control I'll have over the fire temperature, and the higher quality the spirit pills will be."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian smiled apologetically, "Brother Zhu, Sister-in-law, I didn't mean to delay things."</p><p></p><p>Boss Zhu waved his hand and said, "Even if I don't consider your master's face, a few days' delay is no big deal."</p><p></p><p>The smile on his fat face was amiable, as if this wasn't an issue at all.</p><p></p><p>"Will giving you another ten days be enough?"</p><p></p><p>Since Boss Zhu was so reasonable, it put Gao Xian at ease too.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and nodded, "Yes, ten days will be enough. Once they're refined, I'll send them right over."</p><p></p><p>"Refine the pills well, don't let down your master's expectations of you," Boss Zhu encouraged with a pat on Gao Xian's shoulder, taking on the air of an elder's concern for his junior.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any issues with your life, you can tell me...Alright, I have something else to attend to, so I'll get going. You don't need to see me out."</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian hurriedly went to see them off. Boss Zhu smiled and hummed as he went out the door, acting very polite towards Gao Xian's conduct.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Qiniang followed behind Boss Zhu, but as she was leaving, she gave Gao Xian a deep look.</p><p></p><p>That gaze seemed to contain rather complex undertones...</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian was baffled - does the sister-in-law... have a thing for him?</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, nothing beats dumplings, but I'm not that kind of person!</p><p></p><p>No matter what he thought inwardly, outwardly Gao Xian still behaved very respectfully, bowing to see Boss Zhu and his wife off.</p><p></p><p>A new book sets sail, please give it your support! *bows*</p><p></p><p>I have an outline, so I can write a long story. Everyone can rest assured.</p><p></p><p>I hope this will be a good book!</p><p></p><p>My standard for a good book is first, of course, to have good sales. Market acceptance is needed to make money.</p><p></p><p>Second, it needs to have power.</p><p></p><p>A book that can move people to feel touched, shocked, happy, joyful, sorrowful - one that can provide extreme emotional value. Or on a rational level, expand the boundaries of imagination and impart knowledge and enlightenment - those have power.</p><p></p><p>Third, it can withstand the test of time. At least worth reading ten or twenty years later.</p><p></p><p>I've put all my ambition and determination into these words, and the rest is up to you all!</p><p></p><p>If you like this book, please give it your full support!</p><p></p><p>The forever youthful author bows in thanks.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

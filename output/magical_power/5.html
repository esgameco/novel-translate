        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Deer blood, deer antler, deer penis, mica, red stone..." </p><p></p><p>Gao Xian placed the various processed medicinal ingredients one by one into the pill furnace and started firing it up to heat them.</p><p></p><p>The furnace was shaped like a three-legged kettle without a spout. Through its internal rotating plate and manual partitions, it could be divided into eight different areas. Some were used for heating, some for steaming and decocting, and some for extracting and refining the medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>Under the furnace was a brick base with a flue connected to an external chimney. Pill refinement required a large amount of charcoal. Through this simple base coordinating with the rotating furnace, the temperature could be controlled high or low.</p><p></p><p>The furnace was engraved with the yin-yang water-fire formation array. If needed, spirit stones could also be used to activate the array. However, the cost of using the formation array was too high, and the demands on the pill refiner were also high.</p><p></p><p>The original owner was just at the qi-refining first level, so operating the furnace's formation array was extremely difficult for him. He almost always used charcoal for pill refinement. After all, he was only refining low-grade pills, so charcoal fire was sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian had raised his deer antler scatter skill to the grandmaster level and completely mastered all the basic pill refining techniques. He had also obtained all of the host's memories about pill refining. With the two complementing each other, Gao Xian went from being a novice to becoming a highly skilled pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the Fengyue Baojianjuan, sure enough, the grayed-out pill refining skill had returned to normal, and moreover, his pill refining proficiency had greatly increased, almost reaching the mastery level.</p><p></p><p>To verify what he had learned, Gao Xian decided to try refining the deer antler scatter pills first. This pill was very simple, using only common medicinal ingredients that he could find in his family's medicinal store.</p><p></p><p>After selecting the ingredients and firing up the furnace, it was at this step that Gao Xian finally understood what "wen fire" and "wu fire" meant, as well as how to control the fire intensity and extract the medicinal properties, etc.</p><p></p><p>These detailed techniques could never be learned just from reading books. Only by practicing pill refining hands-on could one grasp the degree and timing of the fire.</p><p></p><p>Pill refining was a technical process with hundreds of steps. If any single step was done incorrectly, it could greatly reduce the efficacy of the pills or even lead to a failed refinement.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian was at the grandmaster level for the deer antler scatter pills. In the world, when it came to solely comparing skill with these specific pills, there were few people stronger than him.</p><p></p><p>After half a day's work, the deer antler scatter pills were out of the furnace, filling the room with a medicinal fragrance. As the name suggested, the finished product was a pile of medicinal powder weighing over two pounds.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this pile that resembled charcoal powder, Gao Xian felt greatly emboldened and a sense of accomplishment, similar to a chef completing a signature dish. In fact, pill refining was quite similar to cooking, with various ingredients being combined, steamed, and baked. Only pill refining was even more meticulous and complex.</p><p></p><p>To put it in more high-end terms, it was a process of recombining and rebalancing the ingredients to make the energy more ordered - an entropy reduction process.</p><p></p><p>This successful pill refinement greatly boosted Gao Xian's confidence and solved his biggest problem at the moment!</p><p></p><p>After being excited for a while, Gao Xian finally remembered that the work wasn't done yet. He took some jade honey and mixed it with pine resin to make a pill coating, then hand-rolled the medicinal powder into pill-sized spheres the size of peanuts.</p><p></p><p>The outer coating could seal in the medicinal properties and fragrance, making the pills easier to store and have a better taste when consumed.</p><p></p><p>Rolling the pills was a simple motion that allowed Gao Xian's lightning-fast hands from the Dian Guang Fu Long technique to be fully utilized. In a short while, he had rolled out over 200 pills.</p><p></p><p>Pills refined by a grandmaster were sure to have extraordinary effects. However, Gao Xian didn't have an accurate estimate, as he had never refined or consumed the deer antler scatter pills before, so he wasn't sure how good the ones he made were.</p><p></p><p>To test the efficacy, Gao Xian ate one of the pills himself. A surge of warmth rose from his dantian, quickly spreading through his limbs and body, finally rushing to his crown.</p><p></p><p>This warmth was powerful yet not fierce, invigorating yet not dry. It made one feel energetic to the point of overflowing, yet the mind remained very clear without becoming frenetic from the potent effects.</p><p></p><p>"Pills refined at the grandmaster level are indeed formidable!" Gao Xian was very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>Magical items, talismans, and spells were generally divided into nine grades and thirty-six ranks, while pills were divided into nine grades but not ranks - instead going from first to ninth turn to indicate the level of refinement.</p><p></p><p>The same type of pill could have vastly different effects, from barely exhibiting its properties at the first turn to reaching the pinnacle at the ninth turn.</p><p></p><p>The deer antler scatter was a non-graded virility pill, so it couldn't undergo further refinement. However, pills made at the grandmaster level were able to bring out their full effects while removing all toxicity.</p><p></p><p>To test the effects, Gao Xian reluctantly went to find Lan Jie.</p><p></p><p>After withdrawing his consciousness from the Fengyue Baojianjuan, Gao Xian saw that his cultivation level in the Great Corpse Demon Art had increased by three points.</p><p></p><p>"With this divine pill, I can easily crush those little blue pills. If I could travel back in time, I could immediately become the savior for middle-aged and elderly men!"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian sighed, having learned the dragon-slaying technique, yet there were no dragons, which was somewhat regrettable. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Deer Horn Powder was potent. He could consume it himself to accelerate the cultivation of the Great Immortal Technique.</p><p></p><p>No, there were also many middle-aged and elderly people in this world. Even for cultivators among them, their physical abilities would be limited by the laws of nature.</p><p></p><p>Just like Old Wang next door, he was in a state of depletion and deficiency of kidney essence. This was precisely the best customer!</p><p></p><p>There was no rush to make money. The urgent task was to refine some pills.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian took out the Intimate Cultivation Manual and indeed, his pill refining skill had leveled up, unexpectedly reaching the proficient level in one go. </p><p></p><p>Pill refining was the most difficult of all his skills to level up. Such a huge increase in one go made him greatly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Including the three kinds of pills that the original host could refine, they had all been raised to the proficient level.</p><p></p><p>The grandmaster level realm was only for the Deer Horn Powder. However, many of the techniques for refining pills were universal.</p><p></p><p>After this practical operation, integrating all of the original host's pill refining techniques, Gao Xian's pill refining skill had made tremendous progress, and he was not far from the expert level.</p><p></p><p>Pill Refining Proficient (27/4000)</p><p>Qi Restoring Pill Skilled (155/200)  </p><p>Foundation Pill Skilled (161/200)</p><p>White Dew Pill Skilled (177/200)</p><p></p><p>Looking at the data in the Intimate Cultivation Manual, Gao Xian was quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, he had made tremendous progress. Based on this rate of increase, er...</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian did a rough calculation, it was too exaggerated, better not take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of his good state, Gao Xian cooked food and meat, and had a hearty meal.</p><p></p><p>The little black cat, smelling the aroma, ran out from somewhere and also had its fill.</p><p></p><p>After eating its fill, the little black cat was clearly sleepy, lying there with its eyes closed, napping.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian petted it twice, and the little black cat wagged its tail but showed no further reaction.</p><p></p><p>This made Gao Xian a little envious. Eat, sleep, play, eat again...the little cat was living such a comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he should feed it two fewer meals, so it would know the hardships of life and the vicissitudes of fate.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the abundant spiritual energy in his body, Gao Xian circulated the Five Phases Technique for thirty-six cycles of heaven, taking half an hour.</p><p></p><p>Without an accurate timing tool, Gao Xian felt that he was now circulating the Five Phases Technique more smoothly.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly due to Lan Jie's assistance.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the Intimate Cultivation Manual, he saw that the Five Phases Technique had steadily increased a little, making him very pleased.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting his state, Gao Xian went to the pharmacy next door.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard where he lived had three main rooms, one as a bedroom, with half a room as a living room and half a room as a kitchen. One remaining room was used to store medicinal ingredients.</p><p></p><p>The pill refining room was a small side room next to the main rooms, with just a pill furnace inside.</p><p></p><p>The pill furnace was considered a first-grade magic tool, actually quite valuable. It was extremely heavy and fixed on a brick platform, not easy to move.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in Feima Village, there were not many pill refiners who could use the pill furnace. Even if someone stole the pill furnace, it would be difficult to dispose of.</p><p></p><p>On the contrary, the medicinal ingredients were light and easy to take away, so Gao Xian could only keep them in the main room.</p><p></p><p>After checking the medicinal ingredients, Gao Xian wanted to sigh. The original host was really capable of self-destruction, using up all the ingredients for the White Dew Pill.</p><p></p><p>Even with his greatly improved pill refining skills, he could not make up for such a huge shortage!</p><p></p><p>He could only refine a batch of pills to send over first, and stall for some time. He needed to think of a way to replenish the consumed ingredients...</p><p></p><p>Screening the ingredients, steaming and drying, grinding and proportioning, then putting them back into the furnace for refining.</p><p></p><p>It took Gao Xian three days to complete one batch of Qi Restoring Pills.</p><p></p><p>Manually rolling the pills into pellets, he obtained over two hundred pills.</p><p></p><p>After working for three days, Gao Xian decided to go out and adjust his state. He pocketed two Deer Horn Powder pills and went to visit Old Wang next door.</p><p></p><p>Old Wang's home was even shabbier, with only two main rooms in the small courtyard, walls cracked and tiles broken, sure to leak if it rained heavily.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, a few bluestone slabs were laid out as a path. In one corner was an uncovered thatched toilet, looking quite open.</p><p></p><p>Although Gao Xian didn't have mysophobia, he didn't dare look too closely either.</p><p></p><p>Old Wang was lying on the bed, napping. He yawned and said irritably, "What are you here for, kid?"</p><p></p><p>Gao Xian encouraged himself in his heart: "Just making a living, no shame. It's not like I'm selling fake medicine..."</p><p></p><p>After mentally preparing himself, Gao Xian showed a reserved smile to Old Wang: "Dear friend, have you heard of the Deer Horn Powder?"</p><p></p><p>Thank you brothers and sisters for your rewards ~ *bows*</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

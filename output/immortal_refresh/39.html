        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This seven-star spirit fruit couldn't be from Old Man Sun's place, and then he entrusted Cloud Sea Pavilion to auction it off, right?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the seven-star spirit fruit on the stage and began to have doubts in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Chu Ning felt there was a very high possibility of that being the case.  </p><p></p><p>Don't look at the fact that he had encountered two seven-star spirit fruits in a short period of time, but according to the records in the book, this seven-star spirit fruit was not common because of its short growth period.</p><p></p><p>Based on the situation when he used the Green Wood Spring Blossom Technique before, Old Man Sun's seven-star spirit fruit should have matured three months ago, so it was normal to sell it now.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Chu Ning immediately began to seriously watch the stage. </p><p></p><p>There was still one seven-star spirit fruit growing in his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Although he knew this thing was precious, he still didn't know its exact value.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Si Kong Lan began to introduce the seven-star spirit fruit.</p><p></p><p>"The seven-star spirit fruit has an extremely short maturation period of only a few months. It generally only appears in places with extremely concentrated spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The spirit fruit absorbs spiritual energy very quickly, and once it matures past five days, it will automatically fall off.</p><p></p><p>And after the spirit fruit touches the soil, the flesh will automatically rot, leaving only the seeds. If the seeds are not taken out and put into a jade box in time, even the seeds will rot.</p><p></p><p>So although cultivating and planting this spirit fruit is not difficult, it rarely appears, because unless by chance, it is extremely difficult to obtain the seeds."</p><p></p><p>Si Kong Lan paused here, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"The seven-star spirit fruit is an excellent spirit medicine for body cultivation practitioners. Even for Foundation Establishment cultivators trying to break through, it has a very great effect.</p><p></p><p>Our pavilion cannot define its specific effects, but I think cultivators who understand should be clear about it.</p><p></p><p>The starting bid is 600 spirit stones! Each increment must be no less than 50 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Si Kong Lan smiled slightly and added:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivators should have heard that our pavilion also auctioned off a seven-star spirit fruit last time.</p><p></p><p>This is the last one for now, and our pavilion will not have any more seven-star spirit fruits for sale in the short term."</p><p></p><p>Si Kong Lan's obvious price-raising introduction immediately caused a buzz of discussion in the venue.</p><p></p><p>Even Qiu Shunyi and Lv Xingyu on the side had started chatting.</p><p></p><p>"Another seven-star spirit fruit. I heard that last time it was directly auctioned off for 1,000 spirit stones. I wonder how much it will be auctioned for this time."</p><p></p><p>"I think it might be even higher. On the way here today, I clearly felt that there were several body cultivation cultivators coming, so the competition might be more intense."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Listening to Si Kong Lan's introduction and the discussions around him, Chu Ning's expression was calm, but his heart was quite unsettled.</p><p></p><p>So Cloud Sea Pavilion had also auctioned off a seven-star spirit fruit last time. Looking at it this way, it was even more likely that it came from Old Man Sun.</p><p></p><p>And this seven-star spirit fruit was so valuable that a single one was worth as much as that spirit pattern manual.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that what the book said about this spirit fruit being extremely precious was indeed not false.</p><p></p><p>"700 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, a voice rang out from the east side of the second floor.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a voice also rang out from the southeast side, "750 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"800 spirit stones!" Soon after, another voice rang out from a different direction.</p><p></p><p>"850 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"900 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The bidding went back and forth, and Chu Ning vaguely heard that there were 5 rooms bidding. Under the competition between these people, the price of this seven-star spirit fruit also kept rising.</p><p></p><p>"1000 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, someone bid 1000 spirit stones, but this price clearly did not deter the others.</p><p></p><p>"1050 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>This voice had just fallen when suddenly a voice appeared directly behind the circular stage.</p><p></p><p>"1200 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>This person surprisingly opened directly at 1200 spirit stones, 150 higher than before. This caused a momentary stir in the venue, and the others did not immediately raise their bids.</p><p></p><p>However, this state only lasted for two breaths before someone bid again:</p><p></p><p>"1250 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>"1500 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>It was still from that direction facing the front of the circular stage, directly raising the bid to 1500 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The venue was once again...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>A murmur arose, and everyone involuntarily turned their heads towards the small private room on the second floor. </p><p></p><p>However, the barrier blocked everyone's prying eyes, and no one could see what kind of person was sitting inside.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a moment, Sikong Lan smiled and said, "1,500 spirit stones, are there any fellow daoists who would like to bid higher?"</p><p></p><p>Seemingly sensing this person's great wealth, no one else bid this time. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Sikong Lan immediately announced that the seven-star spirit fruit was sold for 1,500 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this price, there was another small stir in the venue.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's heart also became fired up.</p><p></p><p>A seven-star spirit fruit actually fetched the high price of 1,500 spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>There were certainly factors like Cloud Sea Pavilion driving up the price by auctioning one previously, as well as Sikong Lan's skillful pricing tactics today.</p><p></p><p>But this also showed the value of this spirit fruit.</p><p></p><p>And in Chu Ning's courtyard, there were still seven such spirit fruits growing, worth over ten thousand spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't auction them off and just sold them directly, the price might not be as high, but it would still be worth seven or eight thousand spirit stones at least.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the seven-star spirit fruits that Chu Ning had been cultivating with the Green Wood Spring Blossom Technique were of even better quality than the one Old Man Sun had.</p><p></p><p>After the commotion, Chu Ning suddenly felt restless. He understood the principle of "the innocent man has no worries, while the man with a hidden gem courts trouble."</p><p></p><p>If others knew that he, a cultivator in the mid-Qi Refining stage, had seven seven-star spirit fruits, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Although in general no one went to his courtyard since it was too far away, he still didn't feel very safe.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath to calm himself down, not showing any abnormality on his face, and continued watching the auction with Qiu Shunyi and the others.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Chu Ning no longer had any interest in the other auction items.</p><p></p><p>His only thought now was for the auction to end quickly, so he could hurry back to the sect and check on his precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after only auctioning off two or three more items, Sikong Lan directly announced the end of the auction, which relieved Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>He called out to Qiu Shunyi, and they headed out.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi seemed a bit reluctant, saying, "Chu Ning, don't you still need to buy talisman papers?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's buy some outside. Look how crowded it is here," Chu Ning casually replied.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi and Lv Xingyan agreed, and as they walked out, Qiu Shunyi laughed, "That works too. If we can buy talisman papers quickly outside, let's wait at the market entrance. Maybe some elders from our sect will be returning, and we can hitch a ride on their spirit boats."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning asked in surprise, "The senior fellows from our sect also come to this market?"</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi nodded and said, "Yeah, because there are many unfamiliar cultivators at Cloud Sea Pavilion's auctions every time. Our sect usually arranges some higher-cultivating elders to come here and keep watch, preventing those cultivators from causing trouble in the market. Most of our sect's elders may not leave until the afternoon market closes, but a few may return early."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning had no more hesitation. He led the two out of Cloud Sea Pavilion quickly. Then, they randomly bought a few dozen talisman papers and some jade boxes from two shops outside before hurrying with the others to the entrance of the market.</p><p></p><p>Not long after the three arrived under the market signboard, Yuan Guang also appeared with five others.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi and the others greeted them, and as Chen Youdao beside Yuan Guang was about to say something to Chu Ning, a figure flashed and landed in front of the group.</p><p></p><p>"Are you all heading back to the sect?"</p><p></p><p>It was the kind-looking Elder Chen from the Transmission Pavilion who had previously led them into the sect.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and the others all recognized Elder Chen and paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" Elder Chen nodded, then said, "Come aboard!"</p><p></p><p>The nine of them immediately boarded his spirit boat. With a casual wave of his hand, Elder Chen surrounded them with a spiritual energy barrier.</p><p></p><p>The spirit boat shot into the sky, carrying them towards Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning also felt much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>With an elder from the Transmission Pavilion escorting them back, they naturally didn't have to worry about any accidents on the way.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Elder Chen's gaze fell on them again.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, you all became new disciples within this past year, right?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

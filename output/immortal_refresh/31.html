        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The art of making talisman paper was something Chu Ning had long since mastered. At this moment, he was merely putting it into practice.</p><p></p><p>The key to making talisman paper, besides the quality of the ink bamboo, lay in the application of numerous spells. </p><p></p><p>Because talisman paper is used to create talismans for storing spiritual energy. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, throughout the entire talisman paper making process, one must continuously employ spells and spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning first picked up a few ink bamboo stalks and cast a cleansing spell, simply removing the surface impurities. </p><p></p><p>He then followed with a few blade spells, first removing the bamboo leaves, and cutting the ink bamboo into segments.</p><p></p><p>During this process, Chu Ning interspersed the use of a repulsion spell.</p><p></p><p>The bamboo leaves were all placed in a basket, while the cut segments of ink bamboo fell into a cauldron.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning was successfully recommended, Zhuang Yunde had brought him a set of tools, and this cauldron was one of them.</p><p></p><p>The next spell was a sweet rain spell, and the amount of water was not particularly large, so Chu Ning cast it effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>The cauldron quickly filled with spiritually imbued clear water.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning once again cast the repulsion spell.</p><p></p><p>Allowing the bamboo to stir inside, completing the soaking process and further removing impurities.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Chu Ning used the repulsion spell and cleansing spell in succession, fishing the bamboo out of the cauldron and cleaning out the water and impurities inside.</p><p></p><p>The blade spell was used again, and the already segmented ink bamboo was now shredded by Chu Ning and put back into the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Along with the spiritually imbued yet impurity-free water brought by the sweet rain spell.</p><p></p><p>The expression on Chu Ning's face became even more serious.</p><p></p><p>Talisman making had reached the critical simmering and production stage, and the following process would determine the quality of the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>A fireball spell ignited the specialized firewood under the cauldron, and Chu Ning began simmering the shredded ink bamboo.</p><p></p><p>During this process, he also cast an auxiliary "simmering spell".</p><p></p><p>Mainly to more quickly cook the ink bamboo into a pulp, allowing the bamboo fibers to fully release.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the auxiliary spell, the ink bamboo quickly simmered into a pulp.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning carefully extended his spiritual power to sense the bamboo fibers and other impurities within.</p><p></p><p>Cleansing spell!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning instantly cast the cleansing spell, removing every last trace of impurities from the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>During this process, the pulp in the cauldron gradually became whiter.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning had completely removed all the impurities, the entire pulp was pristine white.</p><p></p><p>Using the repulsion spell, Chu Ning separated a portion of the pulp from the cauldron and poured it into a mold.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in spiritual power, the pulp evenly and thinly adhered to the mold's surface.</p><p></p><p>Drying spell!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cast another spell, drying out half the moisture in the paper, causing a milky-white sheet to peel off, which he set aside.</p><p></p><p>However, this paper sheet was not true talisman paper, as it still lacked the most crucial step.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning did not rush to do it, instead repeating the previous steps to make a few more sheets of paper.</p><p></p><p>After using up all the pulp, Chu Ning cleaned out the cauldron again and began simmering once more.</p><p></p><p>This time, however, he did not simmer bamboo, but bamboo leaves.</p><p></p><p>The previously cut bamboo leaves were all put into the cauldron at once and, under Chu Ning's simmering spell, quickly turned into a cauldron of green liquid.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning's expression became even more solemn.</p><p></p><p>The most critical step in making talisman paper was using the repulsion spell to evenly coat the liquid onto the paper he had just made.</p><p></p><p>Only after completing this step could the talisman paper be used to hold spiritual power and energy for making talismans.</p><p></p><p>And this step was also the most difficult - if there was even the slightest unevenness, the entire sheet would be ruined.</p><p></p><p>"Hopefully the spirit source body can play a role in this process!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered inwardly, and the repulsion spell was cast again.</p><p></p><p>He carefully enveloped the bamboo leaf liquid and began coating it onto the paper he had just made.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps due to being overly nervous, Chu Ning had just begun coating when the repulsion spell went slightly awry.</p><p></p><p>The enveloped bamboo leaf liquid splashed onto one area, immediately ruining that sheet of paper.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head helplessly, Chu Ning had no choice but to try again. </p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning felt a bit better. He applied the bamboo leaf juice to about half of the paper, but still ended up wasting it.</p><p></p><p>After wasting two sheets of paper in a row, Chu Ning couldn't help but slightly furrow his brows.</p><p></p><p>He didn't rush into casting the spell again. Instead, he sat cross-legged and circulated his inner energy for a small cycle before restarting.</p><p></p><p>With his spirit replenished, Chu Ning focused his mind, and his whole body relaxed.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Chu Ning felt he had entered an extraordinarily profound state. </p><p></p><p>It was as if the bamboo leaf juice was completely under his control, yet at the same time, it felt as if he had already immersed himself within the juice.</p><p></p><p>Then, almost instinctively, Chu Ning gently sprinkled the contained bamboo leaf juice onto the paper, bit by bit. The entire process was swift and smooth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if Chu Ning had done this a thousand times before.</p><p></p><p>After finishing one sheet, Chu Ning didn't stop, but naturally moved on to the next.</p><p></p><p>Until at one point, Chu Ning realized there was no more bamboo leaf juice left in the cauldron. As the spell ended, he withdrew from that profound state.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning looked at the papers again, they were all covered with a thin, pale green layer.</p><p></p><p>"Could this really be the effect of the Talisman Source Spirit Body?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly surprised, not expecting to complete this crucial step so quickly and smoothly.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't dare delay any further.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of focused spiritual sense, he swiftly cast the "Drying Spell".</p><p></p><p>The original moisture in the paper, combined with the water from the bamboo leaf juice, was rapidly dried up.</p><p></p><p>The thin green layer disappeared, and all the juice had fully permeated into the paper.</p><p></p><p>The originally milky-white paper had now turned a pale yellow color.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning's heart couldn't help but feel invigorated.</p><p></p><p>After drying all the talisman papers, Chu Ning used his Blade Aura Technique to cut them into small, standard talisman paper sizes.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a stack of pale yellow talisman papers was neatly arranged in front of Chu Ning!</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that Chu Ning finally touched the papers, picking one up to examine it, a faint smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>The talisman papers were successfully made!</p><p></p><p>And it only took two attempts!</p><p></p><p>Such a success rate would be unimaginable for ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>With a slight contemplation, Chu Ning understood the reasons behind it. The Talisman Source Spirit Body was naturally one of the most important factors.</p><p></p><p>The reason he could complete the final step so quickly and succeed on the first try was absolutely related to this innate talent.</p><p></p><p>Another crucial factor was the exceptionally high quality of the Ink Bamboo he cultivated.</p><p></p><p>After Zhuang Yunde came to inspect the Ink Bamboo, Chu Ning divided his bamboo into two parts for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>One part was handed over, with a lower frequency of casting the Green Wood Evergreen Technique.</p><p></p><p>The other part was kept for his own use, with a higher casting frequency.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there was a huge difference in quality between the two.</p><p></p><p>The part handed over to the sect only slightly exceeded the standard.</p><p></p><p>But the part kept for his own use was of much higher quality.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't cultivate all of it to an extremely high quality, as he needed to conceal his abilities appropriately.</p><p></p><p>For a newly joined disciple to grow Ink Bamboo of decent quality was still acceptable.</p><p></p><p>But if the quality far surpassed even some senior disciples, anyone would become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had continuously demonstrated his compatibility with cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen Technique, being slightly better than others at cultivating the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique should also be reasonable.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning tidied up the area where he had just made the talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>If nothing unexpected happened, Zhuang Yunde would come to collect the Ink Bamboo tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if his proposal would be accepted.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 59</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"To think that my first attempt at talisman making had a success rate of over 40%." </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the small stack of talisman papers before him, his face a mix of surprise and delight.</p><p></p><p>Within this period of time, Chu Ning had attempted to draw 40 talisman papers, and an astonishing 18 of them were successful.  </p><p></p><p>He had not neglected to understand the relevant knowledge about talisman making during this period.</p><p></p><p>Normally, for a talisman maker to achieve a success rate of around 40% in producing talismans is already considered qualified.</p><p></p><p>A 50% success rate in talisman making is considered an excellent standard for a talisman maker.</p><p></p><p>"This innate talisman body constitution is indeed formidable!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning could not help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning could clearly feel that as he continued attempting, his success rate in talisman making was still increasing.</p><p></p><p>This was because his success rate towards the end was clearly higher than at the beginning.  </p><p></p><p>If it were not for his spiritual sense being unable to sustain itself any longer, he would have wanted to continue trying.</p><p></p><p>"The real drain in talisman making is not on spiritual power, but on spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning silently thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He actually did not realize this initially.  </p><p></p><p>But ever since cultivating this Spirit Refining Art, he became extremely sensitive to his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>After attempting talisman making around five times, Chu Ning felt changes in his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking about it again, Chu Ning felt this was normal.</p><p></p><p>After all, the spiritual power consumed by infusing into the spirit pen was not much.</p><p></p><p>But focusing wholeheartedly on doing one thing undoubtedly consumed a lot of spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>As for most disciples at the Qi Refining stage,</p><p></p><p>Because they had not cultivated the secret methods of spiritual sense, they could not even clearly sense changes in their spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had not paid attention, but this spiritual sense was actually being consumed unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>If he adopted the methods of spiritual sense control from the Spirit Refining Art, concentrating his spiritual sense in the talisman making process,</p><p></p><p>Would his consumption of spiritual sense possibly be reduced?</p><p></p><p>The more Chu Ning thought about it, the more he felt this approach was worth trying.</p><p></p><p>However, feeling the fatigue in his mind, Chu Ning had to temporarily suppress this idea for now.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning began cultivating the Spirit Refining Art again to recover his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>This time, the speed of recovering his spiritual sense was still not fast.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised Chu Ning was that although it took longer, the effect was good.</p><p></p><p>His proficiency in the Spirit Refining Art also increased by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>"So consuming spiritual sense, then cultivating the Spirit Refining Art, can strengthen spiritual sense?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning vaguely realized this possibility, which made him secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Because this meant that there was now a way to accelerate the cultivation of the Spirit Refining Art.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this was true or not, it needed to be verified later on.</p><p></p><p>By now, it had reached noon.</p><p></p><p>Following his usual schedule, he first cooked and ate spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>After resting for a while, he returned to the table in his room, preparing to continue practicing the art of talisman making.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning was full of energy, his spiritual sense having recovered to its peak state.</p><p></p><p>Pondering the idea of using spiritual sense for talisman making from the morning, as he grasped the spirit pen and prepared to make talismans,</p><p></p><p>He released his spiritual sense, consciously focusing it on the talisman paper and spirit pen.</p><p></p><p>As the spirit pen descended, instantly, a profound feeling surged into Chu Ning's heart.</p><p></p><p>That feeling was as if every line on the talisman paper, every drop of talisman ink on the spirit pen was completely under his control.</p><p></p><p>Almost without any obstruction, Chu Ning completed the making of a Wood Talisman in one go.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not stop, immediately starting on the next talisman.</p><p></p><p>Five, ten, twenty...</p><p></p><p>Sixty!</p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning used a full sixty talisman papers before feeling some fatigue from his spiritual sense being consumed.</p><p></p><p>Although his expression showed some tiredness, Chu Ning's smile was even brighter.</p><p></p><p>"My method was indeed effective.</p><p></p><p><div></p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"By controlling the range of his spiritual sense dispersion, he indeed consumed one-third less spiritual sense!"</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning briefly checked the talismans he had successfully made, his mouth slightly opened wide. </p><p></p><p>32 talismans!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning used 60 talisman papers, yet he actually made 32 wood-element talismans, with a success rate of over 50%!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning could even clearly feel that the quality of these 32 wood-element talismans was higher than the 18 he made in the morning!</p><p></p><p>This was no longer talisman making, he was simply printing talismans!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt a little excited in his heart. Each of these talismans could sell for 2 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>In other words, just from today's work, the talismans he made could sell for nearly a hundred spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for the slight loss of talisman paper and ink, in Chu Ning's view, it didn't matter at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning even had an unreal feeling in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Is talisman making really so difficult? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that Mu Ling's rapid destruction of talisman papers was intentional?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside, Mu Ling, who was making talismans with a brush, was feeling vexed looking at the ashes in front of her.</p><p></p><p>"Achoo!"</p><p></p><p>After sneezing, Mu Ling muttered doubtfully to herself, </p><p></p><p>"Who is talking about me?"</p><p></p><p>However, she soon picked up the obviously exquisite talisman brush again and lightly bit her lip.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe that despite drawing these talismans every day recently, my success rate is still not even 40%. Let's go again!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning holed up in his room every day, repeating the process of cultivation and talisman making.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, he also understood the importance of alternating labor and rest.</p><p></p><p>So he did not solely cultivate the Spirit Cultivation Technique, but also practiced the Green Wood Evergreen Skill and the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique without neglecting them.</p><p></p><p>In order to prevent the two next door from detecting anything,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cultivated the Green Wood Evergreen Skill and the Spirit Cultivation Technique in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After all, these two only required sitting meditation to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, Chu Ning went to the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>The only thing that left Chu Ning feeling a bit puzzled was that</p><p></p><p>the speed of his Spirit Cultivation Technique varied, sometimes fast and sometimes slow.</p><p></p><p>It was not always as fast as when he first released his spiritual sense.  </p><p></p><p>Sometimes it was the same as before releasing his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes it was even faster than his recent spiritual sense cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how much Chu Ning pondered it, he could not figure it out, so he stopped thinking about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, over these past few days, as he continuously used and cultivated his spiritual sense,</p><p></p><p>the progress of this Spirit Cultivation Technique had sped up considerably compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Five days, and he had gained 8 proficiency points.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was not only Chu Ning's Spirit Cultivation Technique that had improved, but also his talisman making success rate.</p><p></p><p>"Seventy percent!</p><p></p><p>If outsiders knew about this success rate, they would probably be so shocked their eyes would pop out."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could not help but inwardly sigh as he walked out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Although over the past few days, his talisman making success rate did not increase as rapidly as that first day,</p><p></p><p>it still rose a little every day.</p><p></p><p>And after five days, Chu Ning, who had never dealt with wood-element talismans before,</p><p></p><p>could now stably achieve a 70% success rate in making them.</p><p></p><p>Because this talisman making success rate was too heaven-defying, for today's talisman assessment, Chu Ning did not plan to go all out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he did not plan to underperform either.</p><p></p><p>Although he had a false spiritual root, having such an affinity for wood-element skills and spells meant he had a bit of talent in talisman making, which was not unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>As for controlling this success rate,</p><p></p><p>for Chu Ning now, it was undoubtedly an easy task.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

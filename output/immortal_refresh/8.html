        <h1>Chapter 8</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>No matter what, being able to cultivate faster is always better. Chu Ning stood up and soon saw Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi on the distant path. </p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning stood up, the two of them also saw him.</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang called out to him from afar, and Chu Ning quickly caught up.</p><p></p><p>"Did Old Cao leave first?" </p><p></p><p>As soon as Chu Ning walked up to them, Shang Zhaoxiang smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>Then, without waiting for Chu Ning to open his mouth, he continued, "Old Cao has an eccentric personality. Over the years, the new disciples following him have suffered no small hardship.</p><p></p><p>It's one thing that he doesn't teach simple spells, but he is also extremely demanding with time.</p><p></p><p>So you need to be mentally prepared. Basically, for those following him, it takes more than a year before they can independently cultivate spirit fields."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi were both a bit puzzled after hearing this. The quick-mouthed Qiu Shunyi asked first, "Isn't it three months?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang shook his head and said, "The premise for three months is being able to complete Qi Condensation and enter the first level of Qi Cultivation, as well as mastering a few basic spells for cultivating spirit plants.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Catalyzing Spell that helps seed growth, the Purification Spell that removes weeds and impurities, the Sweet Rain Spell that keeps spirit plants well-hydrated. You don't need to master them perfectly or completely, but at least be able to use one or two.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if you can grasp the Green Wood Vernal Spell, that would be best."</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating martial arts or spells both take time. Following Old Cao, the cultivation time is at most half of others', and he doesn't really teach spells either. Do you think you can complete it in three months?"</p><p></p><p>When Shang Zhaoxiang said this, Qiu Shunyi's gaze towards Chu Ning was instantly filled with sympathy.</p><p></p><p>Qi Condensation? Green Wood Vernal Spell? I can already do a little bit.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered inwardly, but timely showed a hint of nervousness on his face and asked, "Then if we don't pass the assessment, why does it take more than a year?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang explained, "Because in another three months, there will be the sect-wide disciple advancement assessment. Disciples from each area will advance, and the vacant spirit fields will be reassigned.</p><p></p><p>Since all the spirit fields will be reassigned, you'll naturally have to wait another year."</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't the sect manage this?" Chu Ning asked with a bitter expression.</p><p></p><p>This expression wasn't faked. He was fine with the first level of Qi Condensation and the Green Wood Vernal Spell, but there were other spells too.</p><p></p><p>"They do manage it!" Shang Zhaoxiang answered.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you go to the Practice Hall every half month for lectures? If they don't teach spells, you can ask the guiding disciples there, and they will teach you.</p><p></p><p>But for the time aspect, the sect can't really manage that."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Shang Zhaoxiang paused and added, "I know you might ask why the sect doesn't let you cultivate together first before assigning you to different Halls."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi nodded, and Shang Zhaoxiang then said, "This is mainly due to events from the past hundred years. Previously, there was centralized teaching and cultivation first, and after a few months, disciples would be assigned to different Halls.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the past fifty to sixty years, the number of servant disciples in the sect has drastically decreased. Many tasks in the Hundred Arts Hall have to be done by new disciples.</p><p></p><p>For example, cultivating spirit fields - if you don't follow us to learn for two to three months first, the sect wouldn't dare to let you cultivate the spirit fields."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning pondered and asked, "Then Senior Martial Brother Shang, what was the reason for the drastic decrease in servant disciples in the sect in recent decades? Was it because fewer people were recruited?"</p><p></p><p>"The sect only said there were sect missions arranged, without giving a precise explanation," said Shang Zhaoxiang. After hesitating for a moment, he continued, "There is also a rumor circulating privately among the servant disciples.</p><p></p><p>They say the sect discovered another treasure land elsewhere, with even better spiritual energy than the Green Creek Mountains where we are now. Many disciples were selected to go pioneer that place.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was only those at the eighth or ninth level of Qi Condensation, but now I've heard it's the seventh level, or even the sixth level of Qi Condensation."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Even those at the sixth or seventh layer of Qi refining have a chance."</p><p></p><p>There was a tinge of envy in Shang Zhaoxiang's words, clearly quite regretful that he himself was not selected. </p><p></p><p>"There's such a good opportunity!" Qiu Shunyi's eyes lit up upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning also timely showed an interested look, but subconsciously felt some wariness. Why did he feel there was something unusual about this?</p><p></p><p>"Before fully understanding the ins and outs behind this, it's better to keep a low profile. Even if you reach the sixth or seventh layer of Qi refining, don't casually let others find out, to avoid being selected," Chu Ning cautioned himself inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shang Zhaoxiang's voice came again.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, not everyone is like Old Cao. Most of us are still happy to guide the new disciples properly."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Shang Zhaoxiang smiled at Chu Ning, "I'll be teaching Shunyi anyway. If you have any questions about cultivation methods, you can ask me. After you refine your Qi into your body, you can also come learn spells and such from me."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, gratitude showed on Chu Ning's face. "Thank you, Senior Martial Brother Shang!"</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang then continued, "You don't need to overthink it. I'm different from Old Cao - he's alone without family, but I have a big family outside the sect. I can't get close to the higher-ups anyway, so I just want to get closer to you new disciples, which can be considered planting a good karmic seed for my family."</p><p></p><p>With this explanation for his earnest motives, Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi expressed repeated thanks to this warm-hearted senior martial brother.</p><p></p><p>Chatting idly, they had returned to the courtyard entrance. Chu Ning bade them farewell and went back to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He started a fire to cook, doing some chores. In the afternoon, Old Cao chased him out to the fields again to watch for pests and birds.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was happy to go, since he could cultivate in the fields anyway.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Chu Ning thought it was because the spiritual energy was denser in the fields, but after carefully sensing it this time, he realized it wasn't so.</p><p></p><p>Instead, the spiritual energy was even denser in the courtyard where they lived compared to the fields.</p><p></p><p>But that also made sense, since their residence was closer to the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning continued choosing the spot from that morning for cultivation. What surprised him a little was that this time, his cultivation did not progress as rapidly as in the morning.</p><p></p><p>He sat in meditation for a longer period, but his proficiency only increased by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating in his room that night, it increased by another 1 point.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Chu Ning rose early to practice the Nine Ox Tempering Body Art, then started making breakfast.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was because Shang Zhaoxiang had mocked him the other day, or because Chu Ning had made breakfast early, but Old Cao left later today, almost at the same time as the neighboring Shang Zhaoxiang.</p><p></p><p>When the three arrived at the fields, Old Cao first checked on the growth of the spiritual rice.</p><p></p><p>This time, he did not avoid Chu Ning. Instead, he boasted, "I cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art on these yesterday. After just a day, you can already see their growth is different from the others. I'll cast it on the other rice paddies today, and in about half a month, it'll cover everything, boosting the spiritual rice's yield and quality."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Old Cao led Chu Ning forward.</p><p></p><p>But when they reached a corner, he stopped in his tracks, muttering in puzzlement, "Hm, what's going on with this patch? I remember casting the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art here yesterday too, but there's no change in growth at all."</p><p></p><p>Trailing behind, Chu Ning's heart skipped a beat upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>This patch was right where he had chosen to cultivate yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my cultivation absorbed the spiritual energy gathered by his Green Wood Spring Bloom Art?" A guess flashed through Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

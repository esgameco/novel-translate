        <h1>Chapter 49</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>On the way back to the courtyard from the outer gate, Chu Ning was pondering the information he had heard from Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>According to Mu Ling's account, she heard from an elder of the sect that Qingxi Sect would increase its efforts in training menial disciples. </p><p></p><p>Originally, basic skills like talisman making, pill refining, and weapon forging were only taught to inner and outer disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, after this season ends, menial disciples would have the opportunity to learn some basic refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Ling also mentioned that even for menial disciples, there would be limitations, as there were so many menial disciples in Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>For example, for the menial disciples in the Spiritual Herbs Chamber, since they cultivated wood-attribute martial arts, they would naturally be more suited for talisman making.</p><p></p><p>But the menial disciples in Area D basically had no chance to compete, while those in Area C could have opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still need to find a way to be promoted to an Area C disciple," Chu Ning carefully calculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Chu Ning met all the hard requirements for promotion to an Area C disciple, such as reaching the middle stage of Qi Refining and being able to instantly cast several cultivation techniques related to spiritual farming.</p><p></p><p>However, meeting these requirements did not guarantee promotion to an Area C disciple.</p><p></p><p>Qingxi Sect held a promotion exam once a year, and the number of promotion spots was very limited.</p><p></p><p>Only by outperforming others in the promotion assessment could one obtain a spot.</p><p></p><p>As for the timing of the promotion assessment, Chu Ning knew it would be in three months.</p><p></p><p>Three months after Chu Ning joined the sect, he completed the spiritual field assignment left behind by disciples who had just been promoted.</p><p></p><p>"I originally wanted to keep a low profile, but now it seems I need to properly compete for what should be competed for."</p><p></p><p>After entering his own courtyard, Chu Ning's expression became more serious.</p><p></p><p>This time, he would not be competing with new disciples like Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he would be competing with all the menial disciples in Area D, including many senior martial brothers who had joined the sect years ago.</p><p></p><p>As a newly joined disciple, Chu Ning's participation in the promotion assessment would undoubtedly draw attention from others.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Chu Ning could not be bothered by such concerns.</p><p></p><p>For a menial disciple to break through to the fourth level of Qi Refining within a year or so was not earth-shattering.</p><p></p><p>As for his ability to cast martial arts techniques, he would use the excuse he had given before.</p><p></p><p>After truly entering Area C and lying low for some time, people would naturally forget about him.</p><p></p><p>And such an opportunity, if missed, would not come again.</p><p></p><p>Having made up his mind, Chu Ning barely hesitated before deciding to participate in the promotion assessment in three months.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Chu Ning spent his time farming and cultivating, with nothing particularly special happening.</p><p></p><p>One evening, as Chu Ning was returning from the fields, he unexpectedly noticed that the courtyard gate of his neighbor Qi Chongmao was open.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that someone has come to investigate Qi Chongmao's disappearance again?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde had said that the sect would not thoroughly investigate the disappearance of a menial disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Law Enforcement Hall had already investigated ten days ago, so why would someone else be investigating now?</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Chu Ning unconsciously slowed his pace.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he vaguely heard the sound of conversation coming from the courtyard, and it seemed like someone was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, Chu Ning maintained a calm demeanor, pushed open the gate, and prepared to enter his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait, Junior Martial Brother!" a voice suddenly called out from behind him as he had just stepped into the courtyard, causing him to stop.</p><p></p><p>Turning around, Chu Ning saw a man and a woman walking out of Qi Chongmao's courtyard next door.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man was of average build, around forty years old, with thick eyebrows and big eyes, looking a bit simple-minded. </p><p></p><p>The woman appeared slightly younger in age. Although not stunningly beautiful, she had a graceful demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's initial perception was that the fluctuations of spiritual power from the two of them were even stronger than his own, having reached the sixth level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>"This junior brother, my wife and I have just been arranged by the sect to live in this courtyard, so we'll be neighbors from now on," said the middle-aged man. Hearing this, Chu Ning was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect that within just a month, the sect had directly arranged for people to move into Qi Chongmao's courtyard, and it was even a married couple.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had occasionally seen some female disciples in Area D, but this was the first time he had seen a married couple.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to speak, the woman had already opened her mouth first:</p><p></p><p>"You haven't even introduced yourself, how would others know who you are?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man smiled sheepishly, and after the woman finished speaking, she turned her head and smiled at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, my name is Lu Yunfang, and this is my husband Lu Hongping. We just came back from outside and were arranged to live in this courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing their introductions, Chu Ning cupped his hands in salutation, "Chu Ning greets Senior Brother and Senior Sister."</p><p></p><p>Then, with some surprise, he asked, "Just now, Senior Sister mentioned that you two came back from outside?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we usually stay at a cultivating family clan..."</p><p></p><p>As Lu Yunfang explained, Chu Ning gradually understood the situation.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the two of them had previously been stationed at a spiritual field belonging to a cultivating family clan under the sect's jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>That family clan had many spiritual fields, but previously they had suffered a decline in population, with few cultivators possessing spiritual roots, so gradually these spiritual fields could not be properly tended.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the couple Lu Hongping had been arranged by the sect to be responsible for the fields outside.</p><p></p><p>In recent years, that family clan had slowly produced a few more cultivators, and the couple had been wanting to return to the sect for a long time, but never had a suitable opportunity.</p><p></p><p>This time, with Qi Chongmao's disappearance and no one tending to the spiritual field, they were called back.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunfang then smiled and continued, "There's nothing else, just wanted to greet you."</p><p></p><p>After she finished speaking, Chu Ning did not say much in response, timely displaying an unsociable manner, and politely saw the couple off.</p><p></p><p>Although this married couple seemed very warm-hearted, given the previous example of Qi Chongmao, Chu Ning still felt a sense of vigilance in his heart. After all, not everyone who appeared kind-hearted was necessarily harmless.</p><p></p><p>He lit a fire to cook, boiling some spiritual rice, and Chu Ning ate a big bowl of it.</p><p></p><p>Feeling a slight inflow of spiritual power circulating within his body along with the fragrant taste, he began his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As usual, Chu Ning first cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>Then he cultivated the Green Wood Evergreen Skill for a while, and finally, he cultivated the Spirit Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's mud pill palace was still swirling in a mist-like state, without any condensation, meaning he was still unable to utilize his spiritual sense for perception.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not dwell on it, only continuing to cultivate according to the incantations of the Spirit Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>After completing all his cultivation for the day, it was already late at night. Chu Ning returned to his room and went to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Thinking for a moment, he took out a few items from his storage bag and placed them beside his pillow: an attack talisman, a defensive talisman, and his black wooden sword of unknown material.</p><p></p><p>These few items were placed within his immediate reach.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the incident with Qi Chongmao, even within the sect, Chu Ning had become increasingly cautious.</p><p></p><p>Especially today, with two new people moving into the neighboring courtyard.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

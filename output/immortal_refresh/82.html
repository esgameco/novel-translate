        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not rush to make talismans, but instead began by sitting in meditation to cultivate the Refining Spirit Technique. </p><p></p><p>Since he was going to try the talisman making methods recorded on the spiritual talisman manuals, naturally he needed to adjust his spiritual sense to its optimal state.</p><p></p><p>After all, continuously making talismans consumes quite a bit of spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>After slowly opening his eyes, he felt his current spiritual sense state was excellent. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out a mid-grade talisman pen, talisman ink, and talisman paper from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>After reviewing the method for making the Yin Thunder Talisman in his mind, Chu Ning focused his spiritual sense and began writing.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that the difficulty of making these initial mid-grade talismans was somewhat higher than low-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Even with Chu Ning's utmost concentration and use of his spiritual sense perception, he still failed on his first attempt at making the talisman.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was not in the least bit rushed.</p><p></p><p>Since he could make the Geng Gold Sword Talisman, renowned as the first mid-grade offensive talisman, this Yin Thunder Talisman was naturally no problem.</p><p></p><p>After two attempts, on the third try Chu Ning successfully completed making the Yin Thunder Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Then, striking while the iron was hot, Chu Ning used 20 sheets of talisman paper in one go.</p><p></p><p>"The success rate for making these initial mid-grade talismans is only 40% now, the difficulty has indeed increased.</p><p></p><p>It's only because I used my spiritual sense perception, otherwise having a 30% success rate would already be decent."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning set aside the 8 successful Yin Thunder Talismans and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that as long as he continuously practiced making the same type of talisman, the success rate would greatly improve.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning quickly took out another 20 sheets of talisman paper and began making talismans again.</p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning's success rate improved somewhat, completing 9 talismans successfully.  </p><p></p><p>If this was back when he was at the sect, Chu Ning would have persisted until raising the success rate to at least 60% before stopping.</p><p></p><p>But the current Chu Ning did not choose to continue, instead beginning to make another type of talisman - the Clear Wind Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Three days later at the market opening, his shop would naturally need to have all varieties of talismans available.</p><p></p><p>After using 100 sheets of talisman paper to complete making two types of talismans, Chu Ning finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he had expended quite a bit of spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>These initial mid-grade talismans also consumed more spiritual sense compared to the initial low-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>If they were initial low-grade talismans, with his current spiritual sense, making 150 talismans at once would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating the Refining Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>Of course Chu Ning would not miss this opportunity to greatly increase his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>He took out the black sword with some anticipation and placed it on his crossed legs.</p><p></p><p>Ever since discovering the wondrous use of the black wooden sword, all of Chu Ning's efforts had been focused on reaching the sixth level of Refining Qi in order to break through.</p><p></p><p>So he had not yet tried using the black wooden sword to cultivate the Refining Spirit Technique when his spiritual sense was greatly depleted from making talismans.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning wanted to try using these two methods that could bolster his spiritual sense together to see what effect it would have.</p><p></p><p>Closing his eyes to cultivate the Refining Spirit Technique, the spiritual sense he had expended within his Spiritual Embryo gradually recovered.</p><p></p><p>After a while, one drop of spiritual sense liquid had fully recovered.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the gaseous vortex surrounding it continued swirling.  </p><p></p><p>No one knows how long passed, but another portion condensed into liquid form and merged into that drop of spiritual sense liquid.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning, who had his eyes tightly closed, opened them at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Then, the first thing he did was check his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow-grade Low-rank), Second Layer (505/900)]  </p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art, First Scroll, Deathless Bones 169/600]</p><p>[Refining Spirit Technique, First Layer 135/1000]  </p><p></p><p>"It went up 1 point! Cultivating this way, the proficiency in the Refining Spirit Technique really can increase faster."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the increased proficiency in the Refining Spirit Technique with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>Using the normal methods, cultivating the two techniques separately, he would need 2-3 sessions per day to increase the proficiency by 1 point.  </p><p></p><p>But now, with the spiritual sense consumption from making talismans combined with the black wooden sword's effects, one session of cultivation increased Chu Ning's proficiency by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>Although it was because this session's cultivation time was quite long, it still made Chu Ning extremely delighted.</p><p></p><p>This meant his previous guess was completely correct - combining the two methods could greatly increase the Refining Spirit Technique's proficiency.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do it this way from now on!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made up his mind. Since he had to make talismans every day to earn spirit stones anyway, he could take this opportunity to bolster his spiritual sense at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Killing two birds with one stone!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning felt very curious about just what material this black wooden sword was made from.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out the spiritual plant encyclopedia jade slip given to him by He Changfeng and carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>There were far too many types of spiritual plants recorded, numbering in the thousands.</p><p></p><p>Previously at the sect, Chu Ning had only had time to browse through a small portion.</p><p></p><p>There was still a lot of content he had not seen, so he wanted to see if he could find any relevant clues here.</p><p></p><p>After going through over 1,200 types of spiritual plants one by one, Chu Ning's gaze suddenly brightened.</p><p></p><p>The description of one spiritual plant caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>Black Xiao Iron Soul Wood.</p><p></p><p>Just a cursory glance at this spiritual plant's introduction and Chu Ning immediately began reading it carefully.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, Chu Ning picked up the black wooden sword resting on his legs, circulated the Green Wood Evergreen Skill, and slowly channeled his spiritual power into it.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning used his spiritual sense to perceive the changes in this black wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Chu Ning first showed a look of sudden realization, followed by an expression mixed with delight and worry.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning had basically confirmed that this black wooden sword in his hand was indeed made from Black Xiao Iron Soul Wood.</p><p></p><p>This type of spiritual plant had two extremely special characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>One is that it is hard and heavy, ordinary things can hardly cut through it. </p><p></p><p>When Old Man Sun told Chu Ning before, this black wooden sword has a simple spell array carved into it, so infusing spiritual power would make it lighter.</p><p></p><p>In fact, it's not because of the effect of this spell array. </p><p></p><p>Rather, when this black xiao iron soul wood senses wood-attributed spiritual power, it will become lighter.</p><p></p><p>The spell array on it has another use.</p><p></p><p>This brings up another characteristic of the black xiao iron soul wood.</p><p></p><p>Once this spiritual plant is cut down, the spiritual energy accumulated over the years will automatically emanate from the wood. If this spiritual energy can be absorbed and refined, it has the effect of strengthening one's spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>As for this little spell array here, it is actually used to lock the spiritual energy of the black xiao iron soul wood from leaking out.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning practiced the Soul Refining Technique, he activated the spell array and could absorb the spiritual energy within this wood to strengthen his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>After figuring these things out, Chu Ning was undoubtedly both happy and worried.</p><p></p><p>He was happy that he finally knew the origins of this black wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the item he bought from Old Man Sun for just ten spiritual stones would turn out to be something so significant.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know which high-level cultivator made this huge black xiao iron soul wood sword, and how it ended up abandoned and dusty outside.</p><p></p><p>His worry was that the jade slip mentioned that the black xiao iron soul wood has no fixed location for growth, nor any cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>So under normal circumstances, it would be extremely difficult to find.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once the wood's spiritual energy is completely used up, its effect of strengthening spiritual awareness would also be gone.</p><p></p><p>The jade slip also mentioned that as the wood's spiritual energy is consumed, its color would gradually fade, and its toughness would decrease.</p><p></p><p>When the wood's spiritual energy is completely dispersed, the wood would turn back to its original color, and its toughness would be no different from ordinary wood.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had just carefully examined this wood and found that compared to when he first got it, there was indeed a slight change in color.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this color change was extremely subtle, so Chu Ning, who hadn't thought about it before, didn't notice it.</p><p></p><p>"This black xiao iron soul wood sword is so big, I hope it can support my cultivation for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, carefully putting away the jade slip and black xiao iron soul wood sword into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he thought it was just an ordinary piece of wood, so Chu Ning would casually toss it around or use it for practice.</p><p></p><p>He even used it to practice his Object Expulsion Technique.</p><p></p><p>But now that he knew this was a treasure, Chu Ning naturally carefully put it away.</p><p></p><p>The night passed without incident.</p><p></p><p>Early the next morning, although he didn't need to open the market, Chu Ning still got up as usual.</p><p></p><p>He first went to the courtyard and performed the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique on all the green spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the vines so full of vitality, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, the courtyard would be covered in green spirit fruit vines in about ten days.</p><p></p><p>This put Chu Ning, who was used to the courtyard being filled with vines before, much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten that the Thorny Entanglement Technique played a significant role when he faced Qi Chongmao before.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Green Wood Evergreen Technique, the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Technique, talisman making, and the Soul Refining Technique, Chu Ning ate breakfast before leaving the market and heading towards the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>His purple spirit bamboo had just been planted, and he hadn't performed the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique on it yesterday.</p><p></p><p>The golden spirit fruit seeds given by Gu Xiaoqing also needed to be planted in time. It would be such a waste to leave the spirit fields idle.</p><p></p><p>For Chu Ning, who had just arrived at the Yan Ji Market, everything was difficult at the start. </p><p></p><p>He had too many things to do.</p><p></p><p>Over the next two days, Chu Ning shuttled between the market and the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>During the day, he spent about half his time in the spirit fields, planting golden spirit fruits and cultivating the purple spirit bamboo.</p><p></p><p>In the evenings, he would return to the market, cultivate the green spirit fruits a bit, and then begin his cultivation and talisman making.</p><p></p><p>During these two days, Chu Ning not only made the Yin Thunder Talisman, but also the Cleansing Wind Talisman, Adamantine Talisman, Qi Absorption Talisman, and Earth Escape Talisman.</p><p></p><p>He also made the Beast Binding Talisman given to him by Liao Yunming.</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few demonic beasts in the mountains near Yan Ji Market, so this Beast Binding Talisman would naturally have a market.</p><p></p><p>As for the Geng Metal Sword Talisman, Chu Ning only made a few and had no plans to sell them yet.</p><p></p><p>He had already tried out the Geng Metal Sword Talisman he made for Mu Ling before, finding a deserted place to test it.</p><p></p><p>He immediately decided that this would be his final trump card, not to be sold until a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>With each talisman he made, Chu Ning's spiritual awareness would be depleted to about seventy or eighty percent, leaving him feeling a bit fatigued.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Chu Ning would use the black xiao iron soul wood sword to practice the Soul Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>With Chu Ning's targeted cultivation, his proficiency in the Soul Refining Technique rose quickly, increasing by more than 2 points per day.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and it was once again market day at Yan Ji Market, which happened every three days.</p><p></p><p>This morning, Chu Ning didn't go around to other places like last time before opening late.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he opened his door early and hung out his sign.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing was the second to open her door. When she saw that Chu Ning had opened even earlier than her, her beautiful eyes showed a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>As her gaze swept over the sign Chu Ning had hung up, she was slightly taken aback. It read:</p><p></p><p>"Various high-quality beginner and intermediate-grade talismans for sale.</p><p></p><p>Yin Thunder Talisman, Qi Absorption Talisman, Cleansing Wind Talisman, five low-grade spirit stones each. </p><p></p><p>Beast Binding Talisman, Earth Escape Talisman, six low-grade spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>Adamantine Talisman, seven low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

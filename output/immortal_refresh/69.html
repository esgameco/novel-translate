        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good!" </p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming said the word "good" three times, looking at Chu Ning with an appreciative gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Originally, I only thought your talisman talent was decent, so you could go to the market to practice and then return to the pavilion to learn more advanced talisman arts. </p><p></p><p>I never expected that your talisman talent would exceed my expectations.</p><p></p><p>You can indeed learn the Spiritual Talisman Dharma Sutra!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Liao Yunming directly took out a jade slip from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"This is the jade slip of the Spiritual Talisman Dharma Sutra. However, according to the sect's rules, you cannot take things of this level out of the sect.</p><p></p><p>Just close your eyes and relax, I will directly transmit the contents of this jade slip to you."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning listened and immediately closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming then brought the jade slip close to Chu Ning's forehead and formed a hand seal.</p><p></p><p>A white light flashed, enveloping the entire jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the white light condensed into a ball and entered Chu Ning's mind, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning felt that he had gained knowledge about the Spiritual Talisman Dharma Sutra in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Executive Liao!" Chu Ning bowed in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming nodded slightly, then took out another jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He engraved something on it in front of Chu Ning, and then handed it over to him.</p><p></p><p>"I have engraved a talisman called the Binding Beast Talisman on this jade slip. This is also an initial mid-grade talisman.</p><p></p><p>It is very effective against low-level demonic beasts. After you learn it, you can sell it in the market, and it should do well."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly accepted it and bowed again to express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his gaze turned to He Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>The implication in his eyes was very straightforward.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Talisman Pavilion has made its gesture, so our Spiritual Plant House...</p><p></p><p>Even Liao Yunming was now looking at He Changfeng with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, He Changfeng knew that it would be inappropriate for him not to make a gesture as well.</p><p></p><p>He took out something from his storage bag with a wave of his hand - a palm-sized shield.</p><p></p><p>"Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield, a mid-grade defensive magic treasure!"</p><p></p><p>As He Changfeng's words fell, Chu Ning's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>A magic treasure, and even a mid-grade defensive one at that - this was definitely a good item.</p><p></p><p>Generally, magic treasures were used by Qi Condensation and Foundation Establishment cultivators, while Golden Core cultivators and above would refine magic artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Magic treasures were divided into initial, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he attended an auction at the Cloud Sea Pavilion, a set of high-grade metal magic treasures, the Golden Feather Swords, was auctioned off for 700 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>However, among magic treasures, defensive ones were rarer than offensive ones, so the price of this mid-grade defensive treasure might not be lower than that of the Golden Feather Swords.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's eyes light up, He Changfeng smiled slightly.</p><p></p><p>As he handed the shield to Chu Ning, he said:</p><p></p><p>"You cultivate wood-attribute spells and magic arts, so you will generally be at a disadvantage against gold-attribute and fire-attribute spells.</p><p></p><p>The main material used to forge this Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield is Frost Spirit Bamboo, mixed with a considerable amount of silver crystal, and it also has two defensive magic formations added.</p><p></p><p>It has better defensive effects against gold-attribute and fire-attribute spells. You just need to infuse it with spiritual power, and the shield will automatically expand to block attacks."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Executive He!" Chu Ning happily accepted it.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, a crying child will have milk to drink, and it's true.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this defensive treasure, He Changfeng also gave Chu Ning a large storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This was to make it easier for Chu Ning to trade spiritual plants in the market.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning did not refuse, as his previous storage bag was only suitable for small items, not for storing a large quantity of spiritual plants.</p><p></p><p>After bidding farewell to the two executives, Chu Ning did not leave the outer gate directly.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the Hundred Arts Pavilion, he turned and walked back towards the residential area for outer gate disciples.</p><p></p><p>Since he was about to leave the sect, it was only appropriate for him to say goodbye to the few people he was familiar with, both emotionally and ethically.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde would probably also be leaving soon, so the two of them should bid each other farewell before going out.</p><p></p><p>And there was also Senior Sister Mu Ling - he could no longer earn spirit stones from her.</p><p></p><p>No, he could no longer help her buy talisman papers, he should inform her.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning first went to Zhuang Yunde's residence. </p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Chu Ning, Zhuang Yunde's round face was full of smiles as he opened his mouth and said, "Oh, Junior Brother Chu has come? Didn't you already get settled into accommodations at the outer gate? Is it far from me?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head slightly, and then explained the matter of the two supervisors arranging for him to go out.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhuang Yunde was slightly surprised, but immediately said, "Then congratulations to Junior Brother, you've gotten a good assignment."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly puzzled. "Senior Brother Zhuang, having to run out beyond the sect, how is that a good assignment?"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother is unaware," Zhuang Yunde smiled and shook his head. "Outer sect disciples can receive a fixed 10 spirit stones per month, but if the sect sends them to towns and markets, the amount is tripled. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Junior Brother Chu is simultaneously responsible for the Spirit Plant Room and the Talisman Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As far as I know, these two places have a fixed monthly contribution to the sect. In some special circumstances, you can even pay a reduced portion."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Zhuang Yunde smiled meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"With your skills in spirit plants and talismans, it shouldn't be difficult to cultivate good plants or produce more talismans, right? Even if you can't produce more, since you're only at the fourth level of qi refining, it should be acceptable to pay less, no?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked up at him in surprise. </p><p></p><p>This Senior Brother Zhuang really has an eye for places to gain benefits, doesn't he?</p><p></p><p>However, listening to Zhuang Yunde's explanation, it did seem that he had lucked into a pretty good assignment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's expression of understanding, Zhuang Yunde continued smiling, "It's just this one time that the sect suddenly needs to mobilize more disciples for some reason. Otherwise, such assignments outside are usually closely watched by many at the outer gates."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, believing Zhuang Yunde's words.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother, for letting me know." After speaking, Chu Ning said with some regret, "It's just a pity that we'll both be leaving the sect, otherwise there would be many things I could seek guidance from Senior Brother on."</p><p></p><p>What Chu Ning said was true. Although Zhuang Yunde pursued benefits, he understood many matters of the sect quite thoroughly and didn't hide too much.</p><p></p><p>In Chu Ning's interactions with him so far, he had actually gained quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, the small portion he had shared with Zhuang Yunde didn't amount to much.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning reached into his storage bag and took out 20 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang, these are some talismans I just learned to make - the Fire Talisman, the Black Ice Talisman, the Earth Armor Talisman, and the Rejuvenation Talisman. They're all low-grade beginning talismans. Senior Brother may not value them much, but please accept this small token from your Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a hint of surprise flashed across Zhuang Yunde's face. He didn't expect that in this short time apart, Junior Brother Chu had already mastered the creation of so many talisman techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although the talismans Chu Ning gave were low-grade beginning level, the quantity was not small, totaling a few dozen spirit stones in value.</p><p></p><p>As Zhuang Yunde accepted them, his expression was also quite sincere as he said, "Thank you, Junior Brother. You may not know, but because everyone has to go out on assignments, spirit pills, talismans, and magic tools have all become scarce items recently, whether in the sect or in the markets. These talismans are quite timely for me."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Zhuang Yunde showed some concern, "But Junior Brother Chu gave all these talismans to me, what about yourself..."</p><p></p><p>Me? I still have a bunch in my storage bag. It's not difficult to draw twenty talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately smiled and said, "Senior Brother need not worry, I have a small amount left. And the place I'm going isn't dangerous, so I won't need them for now. It's just a pity my study time was too short, so I can't produce more or higher-grade talismans, otherwise I could give some more to Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde immediately waved his hand, "Junior Brother, there's no need for such words. This gift already shows your kind intentions."</p><p></p><p>After a slight pause, Zhuang Yunde's voice rose again, using voice transmission, which caused Chu Ning some surprise.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

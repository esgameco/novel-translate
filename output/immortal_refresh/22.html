        <h1>Chapter 22</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Is this the Seven Star Spirit Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning opened his mouth with a slight surprise, and Old Man Sun also revealed a hint of a smile in his tone as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Correct, this is the Seven Star Spirit Fruit. This old man obtained it unintentionally, and it took me quite some effort to cultivate it properly."</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it is no ordinary object."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning inwardly sighed, but did not ask further about what was so miraculous about this Seven Star Spirit Fruit, or how Old Man Sun had obtained it.</p><p></p><p>Under Old Man Sun's watchful gaze, Chu Ning performed a hand seal and cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique.</p><p></p><p>His Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique could not be cast instantly yet, after all, this spell was far more advanced than spells like the Catalyzing Spell.</p><p></p><p>However, since Chu Ning practiced it almost every day, his proficiency with this spell was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning's use of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique consumed less spiritual power than an average person.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why, even after using the Catalyzing Spell 10 times earlier, he still dared to agree to cast a spell now.</p><p></p><p>Watching Chu Ning perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, Old Man Sun's eyes also lit up from the side.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know this Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, just observing the spell's effect of gathering spiritual energy, he could tell that Chu Ning's spell was formidable.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique 10 times consecutively.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the seven-colored leaves of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit were visibly emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Old Man Sun was overjoyed and repeatedly thanked Chu Ning. He then took out three spirit stones and a small jade bottle.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Wu, these are three spirit stones and a Qi Restoring Pill, including today's payment.</p><p></p><p>I'm advancing you one spirit stone for tomorrow. I hope you'll come on time tomorrow and keep this matter confidential."</p><p></p><p>Wu was the surname Chu Ning had casually made up earlier, as he had revealed a different level of cultivation than when he was in the sect, so he naturally would not use his original name.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "Since I've agreed to it, Shopkeeper Sun, I'll naturally come on time. For now, I trouble you to provide me with a place to meditate and recover my spiritual power."</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, please follow me, Daoist." Old Man Sun led Chu Ning to a room to rest.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning poured out a pill from the small jade bottle and, after confirming it was indeed a Qi Restoring Pill, swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Restoring Pill was considered a basic medicinal pill in the cultivation world, with particularly good effects for cultivators in the early and middle stages of Qi refining.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had also seen it before when he was in the Skill Transmission Chamber.</p><p></p><p>After meditating for less than a quarter of an hour, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes, feeling his spiritual power had fully recovered. He couldn't help but reveal an unusual expression.</p><p></p><p>"The effects of this Qi Restoring Pill are indeed remarkable, able to replenish spiritual power very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Actually, if I had only cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique 10 times, my spiritual power would have been more than enough, and I wouldn't have needed to recover it so urgently.</p><p></p><p>Next time I get another Qi Restoring Pill, I should save it for when I really need it later."</p><p></p><p>After recovering his spiritual power, Chu Ning bid farewell to Old Man Sun, who once again reminded him, and only let Chu Ning leave after receiving his affirmation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning went outside the market town, having already passed the appointed time he had agreed upon with Qiu Shun Yi and the other person. He then used the Wind Riding Technique to head towards the mountain.</p><p></p><p>It was a hundred li journey, but with Chu Ning riding the wind, he returned to the courtyard in less than an hour.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Chu Ning would first check on the growth of the Ink Bamboo and Spirit Rice in the two spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>Then he would go to Old Man Sun's place in the market town to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning continuously cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique for several days, the Seven Star Spirit Fruit visibly ripened at an astonishing speed.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning came for the last day to complete the spell casting, beneath the seven-colored leaves, the fruit was plump and round, faintly revealing a reddish hue.</p><p></p><p>Just by getting a little closer, one could sense the rich spiritual energy it emanated.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Old Man Sun was extremely warm and welcoming towards Chu Ning, even specially preparing spirit tea to entertain him in the shop.</p><p></p><p>As they drank tea, Old Man Sun took out two spirit stones and a small vial.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist Chu, I've already given you nineteen spirit stones previously. Here are two more spirit stones and two Qi Restoring Pills.</p><p></p><p>The extra spirit stone and Qi Restoring Pill are this old man's thanks for your efforts in coming back and forth these ten days."</p><p></p><p>"Then I thank Shopkeeper Sun." Chu Ning did not decline and accepted them directly.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Sun chuckled, "In the future, if there are similar matters, I hope Daoist will provide your support once or twice more."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled but did not leave in a hurry this time. Instead, he said to the other party:</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper Sun, I don't know if I can get a discount for purchasing items from your shop using these spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, whatever Daoist wants, this old man will naturally give you a good price."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Sun's smile grew wider when he heard Chu Ning wanted to buy things.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning immediately said, "I want to buy some offensive and defensive talismans. Also, I'd like to ask if you have any books on talisman scripting for sale here."</p><p></p><p>"I do have offensive and defensive talismans, with different grades available.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"For beginner-level low-grade attack talisman, two low-grade spirit stones per talisman. For beginner-level low-grade defense talisman, one low-grade spirit stone per talisman. </p><p></p><p>As for books on talisman-making, I don't have any. Those are usually closely-guarded secrets of major sects and cultivator clans. Even if some big stores have them, the prices are shockingly high."</p><p></p><p>After listening to the old man Sun's words, Chu Ning didn't really mind. He himself didn't have high hopes of finding talisman-making methods here. So he said:</p><p></p><p>"Then get me two attack talismans and two defense talismans each."</p><p></p><p>Old man Sun took out two talismans from each of two boxes, then said to Chu Ning: </p><p></p><p>"The Sword Talisman and Body Protection Talisman are quite good among the beginner low-grade attack and defense talismans. It'll be 9 spirit stones in total for you, fellow cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded. This price was indeed a favor to him. During this period in the market, he didn't waste his time and had some understanding of the prices of many things.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning asked: "Do you have any magic treasures suitable for driving with wood-attribute cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I have a relatively complete collection of magic treasures related to the wood attribute, especially low-grade ones." </p><p></p><p>The old man Sun smiled, turned around and took out a sword from the shelf behind him.</p><p></p><p>"This flying sword is quite basic. It's forged from fine iron, and a simple wood-attribute array was carved on it during the forging process. It's quite suitable for cultivators of wood-attribute methods to wield. The price is 30 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>30 spirit stones? Too expensive!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this price, Chu Ning gasped in shock. He didn't even have 30 spirit stones on him in total.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he earned 21 spirit stones from old man Sun. He also took on some missions like catalyzing and purification in the market, earning probably around 2 spirit stones including what he got from Shopkeeper Song on the first day.</p><p></p><p>Old man Sun more or less saw through Chu Ning's thoughts and said with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, an ordinary flying sword would only cost around 20 spirit stones. Since you specified one more suitable for wood-attribute methods, the price is naturally a bit higher."</p><p></p><p>This sword required 20 spirit stones. Unless he didn't buy any talismans at all.</p><p></p><p>However, as he was preparing to walk the path of talisman-making, he did want to buy some talismans to try them out if there was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Never mind then." Chu Ning shook his head, planning to consider it another time.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I also have a wooden sword here," old man Sun suddenly seemed to remember something and said.</p><p></p><p>He then turned around and took out something black and dusty from the corner of the shelf behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Strictly speaking, it can't be considered a sword, only a sword-shaped magic treasure made of wood."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, old man Sun cast a purification spell, clearing away the dust on the surface to reveal its true appearance.</p><p></p><p>It was a dark black wooden sword, larger in shape than an ordinary flying sword. </p><p></p><p>An ordinary flying sword was probably around 15 inches long and 1 inch wide, but this wooden sword was a full 20 inches long and over 2 inches wide. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was twice as thick as a regular flying sword or wooden sword.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning reached out to pick it up, thinking a wooden sword would be very light. But as soon as he grabbed it, he was slightly stunned, unable to lift this wooden sword with just a casual pull.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is 21 inches long, 2.5 inches wide. I don't know what kind of wood it's made of, but it's very heavy.</p><p></p><p>However, there's a simple array carved on it. As long as you infuse it with spiritual power to control it, it will become as light as an ordinary flying sword.</p><p></p><p>Then, when attacking a target, it will regain its weight, dealing some damage to the opponent.</p><p></p><p>But since it's made of wood and not sharp, the damage it can cause is limited. It's quite useless.</p><p></p><p>It's been sitting here for years. At first there were still people inquiring about it, but in recent years almost everyone has forgotten about it."</p><p></p><p>After old man Sun finished speaking, Chu Ning exerted force to finally lift the wooden sword. He then infused it with a bit of spiritual power, and indeed felt the wooden sword become much lighter.</p><p></p><p>"It is quite interesting," Chu Ning said, then asked old man Sun, "How much are you selling this for?"</p><p></p><p>Old man Sun waved his hand and said, "I accidentally acquired this for 10 spirit stones. If you want it, I can just transfer it to you at the original price."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, took out 17 whole spirit stones from his body, and added some spirit stone fragments worth around 2 spirit stones to hand everything to old man Sun.</p><p></p><p>Old man Sun didn't mind that Chu Ning included some fragments and accepted it straightaway. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning separated the four talismans and kept them in different locations, holding the wooden sword as he left the shop.</p><p></p><p>He didn't linger in the market, quickly leaving and using a wind-riding technique to head directly back to his sect.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the path Chu Ning usually took back to his sect, a figure was hiding behind a dense bush.</p><p></p><p>"This kid hasn't come by today, seems a bit later than the previous two days."</p><p></p><p>Starting today, the update time is slightly adjusted. Two chapters will be released together at noon, so the reading experience is more coherent.</p><p></p><p>During the new book period, following the updates is very important. Please continue to support.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

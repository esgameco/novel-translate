        <h1>Chapter 41</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had cultivated to the fifth level of Qi refinement, and with the addition of practicing the Nine Evolution Body Tempering Technique, his eyesight was naturally excellent. </p><p></p><p>Although he was slightly surprised to see someone outside the courtyard at first, he quickly realized that it was Qi Chongmao, who lived next door.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao also saw Chu Ning, but he did not leave. Instead, he waited at the courtyard gate.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stepped forward and saluted him. Qi Chongmao politely returned the salute and said, "Junior Martial Brother Chu, you're back. I was waiting for you."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was a little surprised. Although Qi Chongmao was amiable and had the appearance of a kind old man, they usually did not interact much. Why would he suddenly seek him out today?</p><p></p><p>As he thought this, Chu Ning asked, "May I ask what instructions Senior Martial Brother Qi has for me?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao smiled and pointed to the iron vine on the wall of Chu Ning's courtyard, asking, "It's nothing important. I just wanted to ask where you got this high-quality iron vine. I see that your iron vine not only grows quickly but also grows well. I thought I could plant some in my courtyard as well, to add some decoration."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was taken aback, not expecting that Qi Chongmao was looking for him over such a trivial matter. So he told the truth, "I got the seeds for this iron vine from the mountain behind us. As for why it grows quickly and has good quality, it's because I was practicing the Catalyzing Technique and the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique at the time, so I applied some spells."</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao looked enlightened. "Ah, I see. One of these days, I'll go and get some seeds too and plant them. When winter comes and it gets colder, having something like this in the courtyard will make it feel less bleak and desolate."</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly with Chu Ning for a while, Qi Chongmao headed back to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Watching Qi Chongmao leave, Chu Ning shook his head. This senior martial brother clearly did not just arrive and had been waiting specifically to ask about how to grow the iron vine. They had opportunities to cross paths before, so why didn't he ask then?</p><p></p><p>Huh? Chu Ning's expression became slightly suspicious as he thought about this. That's right, he had grown this iron vine for a long time, and Qi Chongmao had seen it before. He had even complimented it once or twice, so why didn't he ask about it earlier?</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was puzzled, but after thinking about it for a while, he didn't sense anything amiss. After all, there was nothing special about the iron vine.</p><p></p><p>So he shook his head and entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to push open the door, Chu Ning's pupils suddenly contracted.</p><p></p><p>Someone had entered his courtyard!</p><p></p><p>Because he had planted the Seven Star Spirit Fruit in the courtyard, Chu Ning would always leave a subtle mark on the courtyard door whenever he went out, tying an iron vine tendril to it. As soon as the door opened, the tendril would fall off.</p><p></p><p>Today, Chu Ning had been gone for a long time to the market, so he naturally didn't forget this precaution.</p><p></p><p>But now, the mark he had left was gone.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly entered the courtyard and looked around, but didn't notice anything out of the ordinary. He circulated his spiritual energy to sense if anyone else was present, but found no one else in the courtyard. Chu Ning then hurried to the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>To conceal the Seven Star Spirit Fruit, Chu Ning had planted the iron vines very densely in the back courtyard. The seemingly random arrangement of the vines actually formed a hidden path. Normally, Chu Ning would follow this path to reach the area where the Seven Star Spirit Fruit was planted.</p><p></p><p>However, this time Chu Ning did not immediately proceed along the usual path. Instead, he carefully observed his surroundings, and his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The iron vines looked normal, but judging from the appearance of the flowers, some of the vines had clearly been pulled apart.</p><p></p><p>Following the path formed by the vines, he made his way to the area beside the Seven Star Spirit Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart sank to the bottom.</p><p></p><p>The iron vines beside the Seven Star Spirit Fruit had also been disturbed.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The small petal of the Clematis flower that he had plucked before leaving was originally pressed under a leaf, but now it had fallen to the ground. </p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Spiritual Fruit had been discovered!</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about this, Chu Ning's hair stood on end.</p><p></p><p>Today in the market town, he had seen the auction for the Seven Star Spiritual Fruit, so he fully understood its value.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also knew that if the Seven Star Spiritual Fruit was discovered by others, they would definitely covet it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a person's name suddenly appeared in his mind. </p><p></p><p>That person had just appeared outside his courtyard, and it seemed he had lingered there for some time.</p><p></p><p>The most likely scenario was that he had just come out of the courtyard.  </p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao probably intended to leave the courtyard directly after coming out, but happened to run into Chu Ning returning.</p><p></p><p>So he simply waited for Chu Ning to leave before asking about that Clematis matter.</p><p></p><p>And Qi Chongmao, having seen the Seven Star Spiritual Fruit but not mentioning a word about it, his intentions were self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Chu Ning immediately began to calm down.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao had entered the sect a few years before him and appeared to be at the fifth level of Qi Refining, so in terms of cultivation realm, Chu Ning was not inferior to him.</p><p></p><p>However, since Qi Chongmao reached the fifth level of Qi Refining earlier, his cultivation was naturally deeper.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning went over the skills he had at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>In terms of spells, he still only knew the Thorny Vine Spell and the Vine Armor Spell, both of which he could cast instantly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how proficient Qi Chongmao was with these two spells, or whether he had cultivated any other spells.</p><p></p><p>He did have a few talisman papers left, but only one each of the Sword Talisman, Body Protection Talisman, and Lightfoot Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning regretted a little that he didn't buy more talisman papers when he went to the market town this time.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Chu Ning felt that the other party was unlikely to resort to outright robbery, at least not openly.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were clear rules in the sect that disciples could not provoke or fight each other.</p><p></p><p>This was also why outer disciples could not enter the living quarters of servant disciples without special circumstances.</p><p></p><p>What he needed to guard against first was the possibility that the other party would take the opportunity when he was away to steal the Seven Star Spiritual Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't rule out the possibility that the other party might go to extremes and attempt an outright robbery.</p><p></p><p>For the next half-day, Chu Ning did not leave his courtyard, nor even the rear courtyard, focusing entirely on considering the various possibilities that could occur.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Chu Ning used a Voice Transmission Talisman to summon Qiu Shunyi to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He gave Qiu some spirit stones to buy a few talisman papers for him in the market town.</p><p></p><p>This Voice Transmission Talisman was actually given to him by Mu Ling, who had specially given Chu Ning a few to facilitate communication between them.</p><p></p><p>Although Qiu Shunyi was a little puzzled, after Chu Ning gave a suitable excuse, he readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Chu Ning did not leave his courtyard again, not even to tend to the Spirit Bamboo and Purple Caltrop in the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>These two spirit plants were not like Spirit Rice, which required constant vigilance against pests and birds.</p><p></p><p>Not tending to the spirit fields would at most mean that he couldn't use the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, slowing down their quality improvement.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was confident that with his current level of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, he could make up for the delay of these ten-odd days by performing it more frequently later on.</p><p></p><p>During these few days, Chu Ning practiced spells and the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique during the day.</p><p></p><p>At night, he would cultivate the Green Wood Evergreen Technique in the rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Worried that using the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique for cultivation might affect the Seven Star Spiritual Fruit, Chu Ning chose the most ordinary method of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As a result, his progress in the Green Wood Evergreen Technique also slowed during these few days.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, his proficiency in the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique improved rapidly.</p><p></p><p>After seven days of this, Chu Ning noticed something amiss.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

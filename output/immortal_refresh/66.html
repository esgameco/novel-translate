        <h1>Chapter 66</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Upon returning to his own courtyard, Chu Ning couldn't wait to start taking things out from his storage bag. </p><p></p><p>Today's harvest was really huge.</p><p></p><p>A mid-grade talisman pen, basics of low-grade talisman making, high-grade talismans, the Qingmu Sword Manual...</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at this pile of good stuff on the table, and after feasting his eyes on them, he thought for a moment and put away all the other items, leaving only the jade slip on the basics of low-grade talisman making.</p><p></p><p>As for the Qingmu Sword Manual, it would be better to try it out after moving to the outer sect quarters.</p><p></p><p>It was more important to first take a look at these basics of talisman making to improve his talisman crafting skills.</p><p></p><p>After all, to be honest, he was able to obtain so many benefits today thanks to revealing his decent innate talent for talisman making.</p><p></p><p>The contents of this jade slip on the basics of low-grade talisman making were written in great detail. As Chu Ning read through it, he couldn't help being drawn in.</p><p></p><p>Previously when he made the Wood Escape Talisman, he relied more on his intuition and the innate talent of his talisman spirit body.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't really understand some of the basic knowledge and principles behind talisman making.</p><p></p><p>For example, even the most basic grading of talismans was something Chu Ning only had a vague understanding of before.</p><p></p><p>According to the jade slip, talismans are graded as low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade.</p><p></p><p>Each grade is further divided into low-rank, mid-rank, and high-rank, and talismans of different grades require different types of talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>The regular talisman paper Chu Ning used before could only be used to make low-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>To make mid-grade and high-grade talismans, one would need mid-grade talisman paper and high-grade talisman paper respectively.</p><p></p><p>Some special talismans even required using spirit plants or demon beast hides to draw them.</p><p></p><p>Top-grade talismans all required using special demon beast hides.</p><p></p><p>There were also corresponding grades for talisman masters - those who could make talismans of a certain grade with a success rate of over 50% were called low-grade, mid-grade, high-grade, and top-grade talisman masters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, since there was a big difference between the low, mid, and high ranks within the low-grade talismans, the cultivation world also used the terms first-grade, second-grade, and third-grade talisman masters to distinguish the levels of low-grade talisman masters.</p><p></p><p>These were just introductions to the basic knowledge of talismans. The contents of this jade slip went far beyond that.</p><p></p><p>It included a more detailed systematic introduction to talismans, and as Liao Yunming said, it also contained many insights and experiences.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning gained a lot from reading it.</p><p></p><p>For half a day, Chu Ning spent his time studying the basic knowledge in this jade slip.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even look at the few talisman making methods attached after that.</p><p></p><p>Only after finishing all the knowledge introductions did Chu Ning slowly put down the jade slip and sink into contemplation, digesting and comprehending the knowledge.</p><p></p><p>With his innate talent as a talisman spirit body, his ability to comprehend talisman making was naturally extremely strong.</p><p></p><p>So he was able to digest this knowledge very quickly.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Chu Ning finally came out of his contemplation, a smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>He didn't choose to continue reading the few talisman making methods in the jade slip.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he took out the talisman pen and talisman ink he had before, along with a large stack of blank talisman paper, from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first use the Wood Escape Talisman to verify what I've comprehended."</p><p></p><p>Saying this softly, Chu Ning picked up the talisman pen and slowly infused it with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Dipping the ink, putting down the brush, moving it around, and lifting the brush, Chu Ning completed the making of a Wood Escape Talisman in one go.</p><p></p><p>A flash of green light, and the talisman was successfully made as expected.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning started drawing talisman after talisman non-stop.</p><p></p><p>After making 20 talismans this way, Chu Ning put down this pen and took out the mid-grade talisman pen gifted by Liao Yunming from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The infusion of spiritual power was extremely smooth - Chu Ning felt that as soon as he infused his spiritual power, it went straight to the pen tip.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's a mid-grade talisman pen!"</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning enveloped it with his spiritual sense, he also felt it was much smoother and easier.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the brush, it was as if aided by divine forces. In just a short while, Chu Ning drew another 20 talismans.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Paper.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until then that Chu Ning finally put down his talisman pen. </p><p></p><p>Looking at the two stacks of wood escape talismans in front of him, Chu Ning's face was full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>"Using an ordinary talisman pen to make wood escape talismans achieved an 80% success rate!</p><p></p><p>And using a mid-grade talisman pen to make them, the success rate was actually 90%!!"</p><p></p><p>Such a success rate is often only achievable by intermediate talisman masters making low-level talismans.</p><p></p><p>"Talisman Source Spirit Body!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning silently chanted these four words in his heart, once again marveling at the powerful innate talents of the spirit body.</p><p></p><p>Although he had already recognized the formidable talents of the Tiger Wood Spirit Body when he previously cultivated the Green Wood Everspring Skill.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the jade slip again, Chu Ning began reading the talismans that came with it.</p><p></p><p>The talismans built into this jade slip were all low-grade beginner talismans.</p><p></p><p>There were offensive ones like the Blazing Fire Talisman and Profound Ice Talisman, defensive ones like the Earth Armor Talisman, and healing ones like the Rejuvenation Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there was even one related to the cultivation of spiritual plants.</p><p></p><p>Used to enhance the quality of spiritual plants, it was called the Evergreen Talisman.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning didn't pick and choose, comprehending the talisman-making methods of each talisman one by one before immediately starting to make them.</p><p></p><p>For three days, Chu Ning confined himself completely in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He didn't go out the main gate or the side gate, single-mindedly making talismans.</p><p></p><p>Taking the low-grade beginner talismans from the basic talisman jade slip, he constantly experimented with them.</p><p></p><p>When tired, he would cultivate. When his state recovered, he would make talismans.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning once again entered the state of disregarding sleep and food like a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>It also allowed Chu Ning to somewhat experience the kind of crazed talisman-making state that Mu Ling had.</p><p></p><p>This stuff is really addictive.</p><p></p><p>In three days, Chu Ning learned all five kinds of talismans.</p><p></p><p>Although the success rate was only 40%, Chu Ning had absolute confidence.</p><p></p><p>Just give him about half a month more, and he could definitely raise the success rate of making all five talismans above 60%!</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly made Chu Ning marvel again at the might of the Talisman Source Spirit Body.</p><p></p><p>On the fourth day at dawn, after Chu Ning got up and as usual cultivated the Spirit Refining Technique, Green Wood Everspring Skill, and Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>He didn't choose to make talismans, but instead came to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Previously I didn't really want to reveal too many of my capabilities in front of the neighbors Lu Yunfang and Luo Hongping.</p><p></p><p>I still haven't figured out their relationship with Qi Chongmao, but I always felt the two seemed to pose a threat to me.</p><p></p><p>But now, they have moved to the C District to live in the past couple days.</p><p></p><p>I don't need to have any reservations, it's time to study this Azure Wood Sword Technique."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, then casually took out a jade slip from his storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>It was the Azure Wood Sword Technique that He Changyou had given him before.</p><p></p><p>At that time, He Changyou had specifically mentioned that this skill was very suitable for someone who had cultivated the Green Wood Vernal Skill to practice.</p><p></p><p>This piqued Chu Ning's curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the jade slip, Chu Ning examined its contents.</p><p></p><p>It was then that he realized, although this Azure Wood Sword Technique was named a sword technique, it did not actually require using a sword.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the attacks released by this skill resembled swords, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>And after Chu Ning finished reading it, he finally understood.</p><p></p><p>Why He Changyou said this skill was very suitable for someone who had cultivated the Green Wood Vernal Skill.</p><p></p><p>Because the principle behind the Azure Wood Sword Technique had some similarities with the Green Wood Vernal Skill.</p><p></p><p>The Green Wood Vernal Skill acted on spiritual plants, helping them condense and absorb the spiritual qi of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>While the Azure Wood Sword Technique's skill, if struck on a cultivator's body, had the effect of extracting their spiritual qi and power.</p><p></p><p>Not only did it work on cultivators' bodies, but even if used on protective force fields,</p><p></p><p>It could also attract the spiritual qi within, thereby augmenting itself and increasing its attack power.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

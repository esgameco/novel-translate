        <h1>Chapter 100</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's gaze was somewhat scorching. </p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Inexhaustible Bone Realm to perfection, he indeed refreshed his innate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>What he obtained was precisely his innate secret technique - the Thundering Step!</p><p></p><p>Almost simultaneously, information about the Thundering Step appeared in Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>The biggest advantage of this step was speed - fast as thunderclap, which was the reason for its name.</p><p></p><p>It included various stepping techniques, with two ways of usage. </p><p></p><p>One was to rely entirely on one's powerful physical body to unleash an astonishing speed.</p><p></p><p>This speed had nothing to do with magic power, only related to the degree of physical strength.</p><p></p><p>The other way was to coordinate with the magic power circulation of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, fully unleashing the speed of these steps for even more astonishing effects.</p><p></p><p>According to the information in the Thundering Step secret technique, if one could perform the Heavenly Gangs Fist while coordinating with the Thundering Step, it would increase the Heavenly Gangs Fist's attack power by 50%!</p><p></p><p>After fully understanding the Thundering Step, Chu Ning couldn't help but laugh heartily. </p><p></p><p>Previously, when using the Heavenly Gangs Fist, his biggest problem was how to get in close range. </p><p></p><p>To kill Qi Chongmao and Cao Dongxin, he used escape talisman spells, which had certain limitations as the talismans needed activation time and were not very convenient.</p><p></p><p>If the opponent knew he had cultivated body refining techniques and also used escape arts or talismans, it would be easy for them to evade.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago against Old Master Liu, Chu Ning waited for the opponent to approach, then blocked with his Silver Crystal Bamboo Shield before counterattacking with the Heavenly Gangs Fist.</p><p></p><p>With these two methods, he lacked the initiative.</p><p></p><p>But now with the Thundering Step added, he had much more initiative.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning was eager to try it out.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first try the pure physical speed without using magic power."</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Chu Ning fiercely stepped off the ground, his body darting out. At the same time, his right fist swung out, directly smashing into a huge boulder inside the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a tremendous sound, the boulder over a person's height instantly shattered into pieces.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning calmly stood before the shattered rocks, recalling his strike just now.</p><p></p><p>"Without using magic power, the Thundering Step's speed is much faster than a low-grade Wood Escape Talisman, but a bit slower than a mid-grade Earth Escape Talisman. </p><p></p><p>As for the Heavenly Gangs Fist's might, it didn't just increase by 50%, I feel it almost doubled."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly realized that this was not solely due to the Thundering Step, but also because of his enhanced physical body.</p><p></p><p>The secret technique mentioned increasing attack power by 50% was based on equal physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning's gaze immediately turned to another huge boulder.</p><p></p><p>Circulating his magic power, Chu Ning "whooshed" out in a sprint!</p><p></p><p>The Thundering Step!</p><p></p><p>This was the more powerful Thundering Step, coordinated with the magic power circulation of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>In just the blink of an eye, Chu Ning appeared in front of another boulder a few zhang away.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Gangs Fist struck out, with only a muffled sound, not as loud as before.</p><p></p><p>However, this boulder, larger than the previous one, mostly turned into stone powder with some small debris scattered on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Delight filled Chu Ning's gaze at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Thundering Step's speed almost doubled, already far surpassing the speed of a mid-grade Earth Escape Talisman. Perhaps it has even reached the speed of a high-grade Escape Talisman."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then looked at the pile of shattered rocks.</p><p></p><p>"And when used with the Heavenly Gangs Fist, the 50% increase in attack power mentioned was actually compared to not circulating magic power.</p><p></p><p>Calculated this way, the Heavenly Gangs Fist's might is now more than twice as powerful as before."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at his fist, extremely satisfied. </p><p></p><p>He was absolutely confident that if he encountered Old Master Liu and the others now, there would be no need for such trouble. He could directly use the Thundering Step coordinated with the Heavenly Gangs Fist to take them down one by one with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual deserves its reputation as the foremost body refining technique."</p><p></p><p>Thinking carefully, Chu Ning realized that the reason few cultivated it nowadays, besides the difficulty of breaking through bottlenecks, was likely also because its innate divine abilities had been lost.</p><p></p><p>From his own cultivation experience, the body refining effects were excellent, naturally. </p><p></p><p>But the true might could only be unleashed by coordinating with these innate secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Seven Star Spirit Fruits may no longer be useful for breaking through my next bottleneck. For the next stage, I will likely need to find other spirit medicines."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head with some regret.</p><p></p><p>For the upcoming Inexhaustible Tendon realm cultivation, the difficulty would increase.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning began cultivating according to the Inexhaustible Tendon method of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>Then, looking at the proficiency levels, he saw that the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual had indeed changed:</p><p></p><p>[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Rank Lower), Third Layer (32/2100)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Scroll, Inexhaustible Tendon 0/1500]</p><p>[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 376/1000]</p><p></p><p>The Inexhaustible Tendon progress bar had appeared, but this round of cultivation did not make any progress.</p><p></p><p>Recalling how when breaking through from the Undying Skin to Inexhaustible Bone realm, his initial cultivation speed was extremely fast, Chu Ning quickly understood that this was because the effects of the three Seven Star Spirit Fruits had been completely absorbed during his previous breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>There were no residual effects left.</p><p></p><p>Since he had roughly grasped his current cultivation state, Chu Ning naturally had no need to linger here any longer.</p><p></p><p>He surveyed the entire cave, his gaze falling on the not fully matured Blood Mist Grass and the pool of Spirit Spring water in the center.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Mist Grass was still far from maturity and could only grow in places with a Spirit Spring. Digging it out now would be useless, so he would leave it be for now.</p><p></p><p>As for the Spirit Spring water, after his absorption, its spiritual energy had greatly diminished and would take years to recover.</p><p></p><p>Pondering this, Chu Ning dug up some mud from the cave and gathered some of the rocks he had smashed earlier to the cave entrance. He used the rocks to block the entrance and filled the gaps with mud.</p><p></p><p>Then from his storage pouch, he took out some Iron Vine seeds and scattered them, using an incantation to make them immediately grow.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Vine was extremely hardy and would naturally grow after his incantation catalyzed it. It wouldn't be long before it covered this entire rocky area.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Iron Vine was an extremely common plant, so even if someone came here, they wouldn't be suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Back at the stone crevice entrance by the waterfall, Chu Ning took out his Pursing Wind Shuttle and called for Spirit White to fly back.</p><p></p><p>"Whee!"</p><p></p><p>But Spirit White called out to Chu Ning instead, refusing to hop onto the shuttle.</p><p></p><p>It cried out towards the deeper areas of the western mountain range.</p><p></p><p>"Go over there."</p><p></p><p>Then Chu Ning heard its voice transmit through its spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly stunned - where was this little guy leading him again?</p><p></p><p>Though puzzled, after a moment's thought, Chu Ning still nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Hop on, let's go over."</p><p></p><p>Heading in that direction was still within this mountain branch's range. As long as they were in these mountains, barring any high-level demonic beasts, there shouldn't be too much risk.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be there's another treasure ground over there?"</p><p></p><p>He was also curious why Spirit White suddenly wanted to go there.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning agree, Spirit White happily hopped onto the Pursing Wind Shuttle.</p><p></p><p>"Whee!"</p><p></p><p>It called out, pointing Chu Ning in the direction.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the shuttle took off into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Flying for about a quarter-hour along the direction Spirit White pointed, they had now approached the deeper areas of the mountain branch.</p><p></p><p>This made Chu Ning hesitate - he didn't know why Spirit White was leading him here, but he no longer had much desire to venture deeper.</p><p></p><p>Although he had broken through repeatedly, going too deep alone still didn't feel very safe.</p><p></p><p>"Little White, where are you taking me? How much further?"</p><p></p><p>"Whee!" Spirit White called out, seeming unable to properly express itself and growing anxious, calling out incessantly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could vaguely make out that the distance shouldn't be too far.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after flying another two or three li, </p><p></p><p>"Whee!" Spirit White called out towards the ground, signaling Chu Ning to descend.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately guided the Pursing Wind Shuttle down, and man and beast landed before a cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Another cave?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cave entrance a few zhang away, Chu Ning was slightly taken aback, but immediately his expression changed slightly. </p><p></p><p>Because on the ground at this cave entrance, he clearly saw several huge footprints.</p><p></p><p>"A demonic beast's den?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning almost instantly reacted, wondering in his heart why Ling Xiaobai had brought him here.</p><p></p><p>Yet he saw Ling Xiaobai actually let out a loud "wu" call towards the cave.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a white pillar of light was also sprayed into the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaobai, you..."</p><p></p><p>"Howl!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a roar rang out.</p><p></p><p>And at this time, upon hearing the roar, Ling Xiaobai quickly leapt back a step, coming to Chu Ning's side and rear.</p><p></p><p>"Bullying me, taking revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai's voice entered Chu Ning's ears, making him feel somewhat amused yet exasperated.</p><p></p><p>But soon, he could no longer laugh, his face turning somewhat unsightly.</p><p></p><p>Because at the same time, a huge figure appeared at the front and rear of the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>This was an ape-like demonic beast, but its body was a full one zhang tall.</p><p></p><p>Its body was covered in jet-black fur, speckled with red fur, like blotches of blood on its body.</p><p></p><p>On its head, there was also a sharp horn.</p><p></p><p>A blood-blotched unicorn ape, Chu Ning recognized this type of demonic beast at a glance.</p><p></p><p>He had previously studied the demonic beasts in these nearby mountain ranges, and this demonic beast belonged to the extremely rare high-grade first-level demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>A high-grade first-level demonic beast could match a cultivator in the late Refining Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>And what truly made Chu Ning's face look somewhat unsightly was that this type of demonic beast usually lived together as male and female mates.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, another slightly smaller blood-blotched unicorn ape figure appeared at the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Swish!"</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning was still considering whether to summon the Chasing Wind Crossbow and leave, after all these were two demonic beasts equivalent to the seventh level of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ling Xiaobai had already sprayed out a white light, directly attacking one of the demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The horns of those two demonic beasts also almost simultaneously shot out two yellow lights.</p><p></p><p>One went to meet Ling Xiaobai's sprayed white light, while the other directly attacked Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't that these blood-blotched unicorn apes didn't attack Ling Xiaobai, it was mainly that after this little thing shot out a white light, it immediately scurried behind Chu Ning to hide.</p><p></p><p>As if it had determined that Chu Ning would definitely protect it, and would be able to block this attack.</p><p></p><p>"Pah!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning indeed did not disappoint Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>Just as the black light was about to attack, a silver-white shield immediately stood upright in front of Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>With a flash of silver-white light, the Silver Frost Bamboo Shield blocked that yellow light.</p><p></p><p>However, the light within also instantly dimmed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the blood-blotched unicorn ape's attack was not weak, and although his mid-grade defensive artifact could block it, it could not withstand it for too long.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning did not dare let the two demonic beasts launch attacks, waving his hand to release several rays of light that shot towards the two demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>These were the true talisman spells stored in Chu Ning's talisman ring!</p><p></p><p>At the same time the true talisman spells were activated, Chu Ning's two hands also released two cyan sword rays, which was the Azure Wood Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, the tops of the two blood-blotched unicorn apes' heads had already shot out yellow lights again.</p><p></p><p>Two rays of spell light collided with the yellow lights in mid-air, while the remaining red light plus Chu Ning's two cyan sword rays swiftly shot towards the bodies of the two demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>The two blood-blotched unicorn apes clearly did not expect Chu Ning to have so many attacks.</p><p></p><p>Unable to dodge in time, both demonic beasts were hit simultaneously.</p><p></p><p>However, the two demonic beasts had tough hides, and the few attacks only slightly broke through some skin and flesh, not causing too much damage.</p><p></p><p>"Howl!" "Howl!"</p><p></p><p>The two blood-blotched unicorn apes, struck by the attacks, immediately roared furiously.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the horn of the blood-blotched unicorn ape that came out later again shot out a yellow light towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>While the slightly larger blood-blotched unicorn ape that came out first directly charged at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Earth spells were only one of the blood-blotched unicorn apes' means of attack; these demonic beasts' true trouble was their formidable physical bodies.</p><p></p><p>Whether in defense or in completely relying on their physical bodies to charge, for ordinary cultivators, both were extremely difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the charging blood-blotched unicorn ape, although Chu Ning already knew that after completing the Perfect Bone Unbinding cultivation, his physical body would be powerful, he had no intention of directly clashing head-on with the demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, dodging the demonic beast's charge, while simultaneously releasing a few more cyan sword rays - two sword rays met the female blood-blotched unicorn ape's earth spell attack.</p><p></p><p>While the remaining ones struck the charging blood-blotched unicorn ape's body.</p><p></p><p>The cyan sword rays still could not directly injure the blood-blotched unicorn ape's body, instead further provoking the demonic beast's bestial nature.</p><p></p><p>This demonic beast turned around and charged at Chu Ning again.</p><p></p><p>As for Ling Xiaobai, it had long nimbly dodged to the side.</p><p></p><p>However, this little fellow did not flee, but continued spraying out ice spells from the side, attacking the female demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the true talisman spells and Azure Wood Sword Technique he released could not inflict fatal injuries on the two demonic beasts, Chu Ning's gaze flickered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing a handful of talismans, Chu Ning successively activated several of them.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, intermingled with golden, crimson, and white spells erupted from the talismans, attacking the male blood-blotched unicorn ape.</p><p></p><p>Even the blood-blotched unicorn ape's powerful body could not help being stalled by this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, if Chu Ning rode the Chasing Wind Crossbow to flee, he could have done so completely.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning, who had just broken through, also had the idea of trying out his innate divine abilities and secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't injure them, I'll just use the Cloud Stepping Talisman to dodge and escape..."</p><p></p><p>While thinking this in his heart, Chu Ning's figure flashed as he swiftly shot towards the female blood-blotched unicorn ape.</p><p></p><p>His speed was so fast that it even produced a tearing sound.</p><p></p><p>Thunder Tread Steps! Heaven's Bane Fist!</p><p></p><p>Before the female blood-blotched unicorn ape could react, Chu Ning's fist, carrying a fierce force, heavily struck its body.</p><p></p><p>"Howl!"</p><p></p><p>With a miserable, shrill howl, this female blood-blotched unicorn ape was directly flung away, smashing into the rock at the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>Its life force was extinguished!</p><p></p><p>Under Chu Ning's use of the Thunder Tread Steps combined with the Heaven's Bane Fist, the blood-blotched unicorn ape that even true talisman spells could not directly injure was actually killed with a single punch!</p><p></p><p>"Awoo!"</p><p></p><p>The other male blood-blotched unicorn ape had just withstood a wave of spell attacks and, seeing this, let out a mournful howl.</p><p></p><p>A yellow light shot out from its horn, but it did not attack Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>This yellow light actually traveled along the horn into its body, and instantly the black-red fur took on a yellow glow.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, this blood-blotched unicorn ape charged at Chu Ning with even more ferocity than before.</p><p></p><p>Its speed was even faster than before by a few points.</p><p></p><p>It was fast, but Chu Ning was faster!</p><p></p><p>Using the Thunder Tread Steps, Chu Ning flashed to meet the blood-blotched unicorn ape's charge.</p><p></p><p>However, his quick, agile steps allowed him to directly bypass the blood-blotched unicorn ape's front, coming to its side.</p><p></p><p>Heaven's Bane Fist!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning struck out with another punch, smashing into the blood-blotched unicorn ape's neck area.</p><p></p><p>The yellow glow flickering on the blood-blotched unicorn ape's body instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, this blood-blotched unicorn ape also flew away, heavily crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Only after the two blood-blotched unicorn apes fell to the ground did Chu Ning finally relax slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Wu!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ling Xiaobai came running over, calling out to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Receiving Ling Xiaobai's telepathic voice, Chu Ning immediately laughed and scolded, "Only now you come forward, earlier you hid faster than anyone else. When did you become a high-grade first-level demonic beast too? Just one level lower than humans, far inferior to others."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's words, Ling Xiaobai bared its teeth in an extremely displeased look.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then laughed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was intentionally teasing Ling Xiaobai with those words.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even among demonic beasts of the same level, there were differences.</p><p></p><p>For example, these high-grade first-level blood-blotched unicorn ape demonic beasts only had the strength of the seventh level of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>While the white ice spell Ling Xiaobai sprayed out already showed a hint of the sixth level of Refining Qi standard.</p><p></p><p>From this point of view, Ling Xiaobai's attack was not weak.</p><p></p><p>If it could truly advance to become a high-grade first-level demonic beast, its strength would definitely not just be at the seventh level of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>It might even reach the eighth or ninth level of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, as Chu Ning walked towards the corpse of the blood-blotched unicorn ape, he said to Ling Xiaobai, "Now, you can tell me why you brought me here."</p><p></p><p>"Wu!" Ling Xiaobai called out while transmitting its voice to Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 67</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's truly a higher-level spell!" </p><p></p><p>After reading through it, Chu Ning's eyes were already faintly glowing.</p><p></p><p>If he could first bind the opponent with the Thorny Binding spell, then use this Cyan Wood Sword Technique, that sustained damage...</p><p></p><p>Of course, this Cyan Wood Sword Technique also had its shortcomings, which was its lack of burst damage output. </p><p></p><p>This was also an obvious difference between wood-type spells and metal-type or fire-type spells.</p><p></p><p>However, for Chu Ning, he completely ignored this shortcoming for now.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first higher-level spell in his cultivation journey!</p><p></p><p>After memorizing the key points of the technique, Chu Ning put the jade slip back into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, he chanted incantations and made hand seals, pointing outwards.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a faint cyan sword-shaped spell flew straight out from Chu Ning's hand.</p><p></p><p>Heading directly towards the iron vines not far away.</p><p></p><p>Upon contact, more than a dozen iron vines snapped instantly.</p><p></p><p>After cutting through nearly twenty iron vines, the cyan sword light finally disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Chu Ning was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't surprised that he could cast the Cyan Wood Sword Technique so easily.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was a wood-type spell, and he had such profound attainments in the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art.</p><p></p><p>For him, quickly comprehending and learning this Cyan Wood Sword Technique was not too difficult or unexpected.</p><p></p><p>What really surprised him was that this Cyan Wood Sword Technique was just a spell he had just learned as a beginner.</p><p></p><p>So its power was still vastly inferior to the true Cyan Wood Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>This could be seen from how faint the cyan light was.</p><p></p><p>Yet what surprised Chu Ning was that even so, with just one strike, it cut through twenty iron vines.</p><p></p><p>This was far more powerful than his full-force Blade Aura Technique.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I still underestimated the might of this Cyan Wood Sword Technique!"</p><p></p><p>The surprise in Chu Ning's eyes quickly turned to excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Cyan Wood Sword Technique's lack of burst damage was relative to equal-level metal-type or fire-type spells.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, relative to its sustained damage output.</p><p></p><p>But after all, this was an entry-level higher-realm spell!</p><p></p><p>How could a spell's attack power be weak? It was naturally far beyond what the entry-level Blade Aura Technique could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Originally planning to practice the Cyan Wood Sword Technique in the courtyard, after seeing this, Chu Ning immediately headed out.</p><p></p><p>This courtyard was no longer suitable for practicing the Cyan Wood Sword Technique, otherwise the iron vines he had painstakingly grown would probably be cut down in just a few strikes.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the rear mountain, Chu Ning no longer held back.</p><p></p><p>One Cyan Wood Sword Technique after another flew out, the surrounding iron vines instantly cut into shreds by Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>And as the sword techniques were cast repeatedly, Chu Ning's casting speed also rapidly increased.</p><p></p><p>The cyan color of the sword aura also gradually deepened from faint to dense.</p><p></p><p>With his innate spirit wood body's cultivation talent, coupled with his mastery of the Azure Wood Spring Bloom Art that had become an innate divine ability, the two complemented each other.</p><p></p><p>Under their combined effect, Chu Ning's proficiency in the Cyan Wood Sword Technique visibly improved at an astonishing pace.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Chu Ning practiced talisman scripting while also cultivating the Cyan Wood Sword Technique.  </p><p></p><p>His proficiency in both rapidly increased.</p><p></p><p>Fifteen days later, Chu Ning had successfully raised the talisman creation success rate for all five talismans in the jade slip to sixty percent.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning would not be satisfied with this. For the next half month, he continued practicing unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>Another ten days later, Chu Ning had already raised the talisman creation success rate for all five talismans to nearly eighty percent!</p><p></p><p>This speed undoubtedly greatly satisfied Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>One must know that during these twenty days, he had also concurrently practiced the Cyan Wood Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He was still unable to cast this basic advanced spell instantly, but its destructive power could already be fully unleashed. </p><p></p><p>And with his talent, being able to cast it instantly was obviously just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Of course, during this month Chu Ning didn't slack off either. </p><p></p><p>Besides occasionally going to the Talisman Pavilion to seek guidance on talisman-making knowledge, and chatting with Qiu Shunyi who found him midway, he spent almost all his remaining time wholeheartedly cultivating.</p><p></p><p>However, today, his single-minded cultivation of the past month had to come to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Because yesterday afternoon, He Changyou had sent him a voice transmission talisman, telling Chu Ning to go see him early in the morning. </p><p></p><p>It was mainly about his future arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Although He Changyou asked to meet him at the Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning didn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was now a disciple of both halls, so perhaps the other party wanted to assign him a task together with Liao Yunming.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning hurried to the Talisman Pavilion, he immediately saw He Changyou and Liao Yunming in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly went forward and saluted the two of them.</p><p></p><p>Before he could catch his breath, He Changyou's next words made Chu Ning turn pale with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, you should know a little that recently many of our sect's disciples need to go and complete sect missions. </p><p></p><p>Now we lack disciples in both the Spirit Plant Hall and the Talisman Pavilion, so Executor Liao and I have decided to send you out on a mission."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning felt as if he had been struck by thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my hidden cultivation base has been discovered? But even so, I'm only at the fifth level of Qi Refining!</p><p></p><p>Didn't they say before that only those above the sixth level of Qi Refining would be assigned that mission?"</p><p></p><p>These thoughts flashed quickly through his mind, but a chill rose from the depths of his heart.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning felt as if he had plunged into an ice cave.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he first entered the sect and learned from Shang Zhaoxiang that the number of servant disciples had greatly decreased in recent years due to the sect missions, Chu Ning had been extremely wary of these so-called sect missions.</p><p></p><p>And after learning more details from Zhuang Yunde, Chu Ning became even more worried.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhuang Yunde said that many disciples did return and even became inner sect disciples, this only made Chu Ning more apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>Because it also meant that quite a few disciples, even outer sect disciples, had perished during this secret mission.</p><p></p><p>He had only joined the sect for less than two years, so how could it be his turn already?</p><p></p><p>Was it because he had joined the outer sect?</p><p></p><p>He Changyou's words instantly extinguished the joy Chu Ning felt when he joined the outer sect a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>However, as someone with experience from two lifetimes, Chu Ning still had great mental fortitude.</p><p></p><p>Although his heart was in turmoil, he could still maintain a relatively calm expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Suppressing the palpitations in his heart, Chu Ning showed a puzzled look towards He Changyou and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Executors, I'm only a mid-level Qi Refining disciple, and I haven't joined the sect for very long. Do I really have to go on a mission like the other senior disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" He Changyou nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Although you haven't been in the sect for long and your cultivation isn't high, you're quite skilled in spirit plant cultivation and talisman-making, making you a very suitable candidate."</p><p></p><p>"......" Chu Ning wanted to say something, but for a moment he couldn't refute it.</p><p></p><p>However, when Liao Yunming spoke up, Chu Ning's gaze brightened.</p><p></p><p>No, it seemed they weren't talking about what he thought.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The people standing inside the spirit field began turning their heads and observing the conditions of others. </p><p></p><p>In fact, during the intervals when they were practicing the Qingmu Chunhua technique earlier, everyone had already taken a look.</p><p></p><p>Quite a few people, especially those who were obviously lagging behind, more or less had an idea in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>But now, when it truly ended and everyone began observing each other's cultivation conditions, the expressions on some people's faces became much more complicated.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou did not give everyone too much time to wait. He walked into the spirit field, passing through row by row. </p><p></p><p>For those whose cultivation was very ordinary, he didn't even spare them a glance.</p><p></p><p>Only for those who were passable did He Changyou pause briefly. </p><p></p><p>Among them were Chu Ning, Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang and others.</p><p></p><p>After making a round, He Changyou returned to his original standing position.</p><p></p><p>"The ten people I call out, bring your bloodwood over here," He Changyou's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the six who would be promoted would be selected from these ten people.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the small number of people He Changyou had paused to observe earlier all had a hint of anxious color on their faces.</p><p></p><p>As for the majority of the others, they were more or less filled with a sense of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Ming, Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang, Chen Jinhua, Chu Ning, Jiang Dawei, Liu Qingshan..."</p><p></p><p>As He Changyou called out the names, the ten people came forward from the fields carrying their bloodwood.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the entire field was filled with discussions.</p><p></p><p>"Who is Luo Hongping? I've never heard of this name Lu Yunfang before."  </p><p></p><p>"Those two went to outer cultivation families before."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, who is Chu Ning?"</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of it, a very unfamiliar name."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions, Chu Ning and the other nine were already standing in a line before He Changyou. </p><p></p><p>He Changyou asked the ten to place their bloodwood in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"You're all spirit planters, so you can feel for yourselves if there are any differences."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, four of the ten had slightly darkened expressions as they sighed.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the bloodwood everyone planted was not very tall, but the four whose bloodwood was taken out were noticeably shorter compared to the other six.</p><p></p><p>The disciple ranked sixth named Jiang Dawei was both relieved and surprised as he looked towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Because Chu Ning's bloodwood was actually taller than his.</p><p></p><p>Even compared to the other four senior disciples, it was no less impressive.</p><p></p><p>Not just him, others also noticed this point.</p><p></p><p>Including Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang and a few others, their gazes also fell on Chu Ning after sizing each other up.</p><p></p><p>At this time, He Changyou also nodded in satisfaction towards Chu Ning and said slowly:</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, your talent in techniques has exceeded my expectations. At the fourth layer of Qi refinement, you're almost on par with the other senior disciples."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning also let out a slight sigh of relief. He should be secure in the third district.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what he truly cared about was not the planting in the third district, but the talisman crafting techniques.</p><p></p><p>After speaking to Chu Ning, He Changyou began to announce loudly:</p><p></p><p>"The promotion assessment for the third district of the Spirit Planting House has concluded. The following six are promoted: Lu Ming, Luo Hongping, Lu Yunfang, Chen Jinhua, Jiang Dawei..."</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was intentional to keep Chu Ning low-profile or to highlight this new disciple's name, but He Changyou left Chu Ning for last.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the first five names, the gazes of those in the fields and at the edges all turned towards this direction.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was waiting for the last name to be announced.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Changyou's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, those standing in the fields began discussing animatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Who is Chu Ning? How come I've never heard of any outstanding disciple from the fourth district with this name?"</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin exchanged glances, their eyes filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, he was actually promoted to the third district. He only joined the sect a year and a half ago, and he's directly promoted to the third district."</p><p></p><p>As Shang Zhaoxiang spoke, the news quickly spread.</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Chu Ning is a new disciple who joined the sect only a year and a half ago."</p><p></p><p>"Entering the third district just a year and a half after joining the sect, he's so monstrous. Is he really not a fake spirit root?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The core disciple?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's spiritual sense was continuously growing stronger, and his hearing became increasingly acute, so these discussions naturally entered his ears. </p><p></p><p>This made him inwardly smile bitterly.</p><p></p><p>After entering the sect, he had been trying to keep a low profile, but he didn't expect this promotion assessment to attract so much attention.</p><p></p><p>With a silent sigh in his heart, Chu Ning could only console himself for now.</p><p></p><p>"I can only try to keep an even lower profile in the future days. There are so many talents in Qingxi Sect, they should soon forget about me, this miscellaneous disciple.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time just made people feel that I have some talent in wood-type spells. </p><p></p><p>I didn't expose my level or other skills, so it's still acceptable."</p><p></p><p>These thoughts flashed quickly through Chu Ning's mind, before being interrupted by He Changfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>"The other disciples must also practice diligently and not slack off."</p><p></p><p>After saying that to the other disciples, He Changfeng turned to Chu Ning and the others, "You six come to the Spirit Plant Chamber tomorrow, I have something to instruct you."</p><p></p><p>With that said, He Changfeng turned and left. </p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled at Chu Ning and also left with him.</p><p></p><p>Once they were gone, the eyes of the many miscellaneous disciples turned towards this place, with Chu Ning naturally drawing the most attention.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from Chu Ning, everyone else who came for the promotion assessment had been in the sect for many years.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Chu Ning had only joined the sect a year and a half ago before successfully getting promoted, these people's gazes held envy or jealousy.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed inwardly again, he really didn't want such a high profile, but he had no choice but to strive for the Rank C qualification.</p><p></p><p>He didn't linger either, quickly leaving while carrying the bloodwood tree he had just cultivated.</p><p></p><p>After walking a short distance, he saw two figures waiting for him up ahead.</p><p></p><p>Looking closely, it was Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Junior Brother Chu!" Before Chu Ning could speak, Shang Zhaoxiang had already smiled and spoken first.</p><p></p><p>"It's been over a year since we last met, I didn't expect Junior Brother Chu's cultivation to have progressed to such a level."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning hurriedly cupped his hands, "Senior Brother praises me too much, it was just by chance."</p><p></p><p>"This is real, hard-earned skill, not just chance," Shang Zhaoxiang shook his head, then pointed to Cao Dongxin beside him, "We're waiting here not just to congratulate you, Old Cao also has something to say to you."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at Cao Dongxin with some puzzlement, the latter's face was full of conflicted and complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>However, after meeting Chu Ning's gaze, Cao Dongxin still gritted his teeth and said, "Junior Brother Chu, I've offended you before, I hope you don't take it amiss."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly stunned, he never expected that Cao Dongxin was waiting for him just to say this.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that with Chu Ning revealing his strength and successfully promoting to Rank C, Cao Dongxin realized his future development would far surpass his own.</p><p></p><p>So he specially waited here to lower his head to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"In this cultivation world, strength really is what talks," Chu Ning felt endless admiration in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning's gaze swept over Cao Dongxin, his heart jolted.</p><p></p><p>Although the envy in the other party's eyes was deeply concealed, under Chu Ning's keen perception, he still detected it.</p><p></p><p>He even faintly sensed a hint of madness beneath that deeply buried envious gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, I'll test him!"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind. He didn't respond to Cao Dongxin's words, only cupping his hands to Shang Zhaoxiang.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Shang, I'm a bit fatigued from casting spells earlier, so I'll take my leave first."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Chu Ning directly left.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he swiftly released his spiritual sense, perceiving everything behind him.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin's expressions were also extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>"Old Cao, Old Cao, you really misjudged things greatly this time," Shang Zhaoxiang shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a gloomy look flashed across Cao Dongxin's dark face, revealing a hint of viciousness.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning continued walking forward with a calm expression.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, a chill had also taken root.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After finishing planting about half an acre, Chu Ning went ashore, preparing to return to the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>At this time, a person also came out from the neighboring field and walked onto the path.</p><p></p><p>"You must be the new junior brother, right?"</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning had a chance to size up the other person, he had already spoken first. Chu Ning hurriedly cupped his fists in greeting:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings senior brother."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer smiled and also cupped his fists in return: </p><p>"Junior Brother Chu need not be so courteous. I'm Qi Chongmao, in charge of the neighboring spirit field. I live right next door, so we're neighbors."</p><p></p><p>"I look forward to senior brother's guidance in the future." Chu Ning cupped his fists again, while also sizing up the other person.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Chongmao looked to be around fifty or sixty years old.  </p><p></p><p>However, considering the age-defying effects of wood-element cultivation arts like the Evergreen Art, it was hard to determine his exact age.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, he was dressed in a coarse cloth robe, with the pants legs casually rolled up, clearly looking like a farmer, which surprised Chu Ning a bit.</p><p></p><p>After all, most cultivators used spells for farming, and even laborer disciples were rarely seen in such attire.</p><p></p><p>As they walked towards the courtyard together, the two chatted casually and got a basic understanding of each other's situations.</p><p></p><p>Arriving outside the courtyard, Chu Ning smiled as he watched Qi Chongmao enter his own courtyard before returning to his own.</p><p></p><p>This Qi Chongmao was quite different from Cao Dongxin.  </p><p></p><p>Though not as talkative and warm as Shang Zhaoxiang, he gave Chu Ning the impression of being amiable and easy to get along with.</p><p></p><p>This put Chu Ning considerably more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Although there were all sorts of reasons for cultivating spirit rice, Chu Ning hadn't intended to get too close to anyone.  </p><p></p><p>But since they were neighbors, it was better to have an amicable relationship than a reclusive one.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Chu Ning spent his time in the middle-grade spirit fields of this district, continuously catalyzing the spirit rice and grain.</p><p></p><p>Since each seed required the use of a catalyzing spell to grow, despite Chu Ning working non-stop, the progress was not very fast.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning had intentionally controlled the pace somewhat.  </p><p></p><p>Although not many people had previously worked these few acres of spirit fields, it was still adjacent to Qi Chongmao's planting area.  </p><p></p><p>If he finished planting the entire spirit field all at once, anyone would know he was concealing his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>So what would normally take about a week, Chu Ning didn't finish planting all five acres of spirit rice until the afternoon of the tenth day.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chu Ning finally understand the sect's arrangements regarding spirit field acreage allocations.  </p><p></p><p>With his cultivation at the fourth level of Qi Refining plus proficiency in the catalyzing spell, it still took seven or eight days.</p><p></p><p>For those at Elder Qiu's level, it would take at least half a month.  </p><p></p><p>If they were given much more area, they truly wouldn't be able to plant it all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what Chu Ning was planting now was the higher-grade spirit rice commonly consumed by cultivators, superior to the red spirit rice planted by Qiu Shunyi and others.</p><p></p><p>After nearly ten days of non-stop cultivation of the catalyzing spell, Chu Ning became increasingly adept at it. He felt it was necessary to also plant some spirit bamboo next!</p><p></p><p>The planting area for spirit bamboo was the high-grade spirit fields in District D. Fields of this quality tended to be more isolated.  </p><p></p><p>After all, large-scale planting required some distance, as certain spirit plants could affect each other's growth if too close together.</p><p></p><p>So any high-grade or above spirit fields in District D were divided into independent 5 or 10 acre plots.  </p><p></p><p>The 5 acres of high-grade spirit fields allocated to Chu Ning was located in a small valley not too far from his residence.</p><p></p><p>Early that morning, Chu Ning set out with the spirit bamboo seeds.  </p><p></p><p>Arriving at the fields, instead of grabbing a handful like before, Chu Ning took out just 5 seeds to test first.</p><p></p><p>These spirit bamboo seeds were specially cultivated by someone in the sect, requiring a considerable amount of time, so they were quite precious to Chu Ning now.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the catalyzing method for spirit bamboo was different from spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning used his Driving Force Art to evenly bury the 5 seeds in the soil, then sat down in the center and began performing hand seals to catalyze them.</p><p></p><p>After a while, 5 sharp bamboo shoots emerged from the ground, indicating the seeds had been successfully catalyzed.  </p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning did not stop there, continuing the catalyzing spell until the shoots were half an inch above the soil before finally stopping, nodding in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>His more practiced catalyzing spell was indeed different. If this was ten days ago, achieving this level would have taken more time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning could clearly feel that the time required for his hand seals was significantly shorter.</p><p></p><p>"These 5 acres of spirit bamboo..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ling bamboo shoots were planted, and who knows, maybe my catalyzing technique could transform into an innate magical ability, allowing me to cast it instantaneously."</p><p></p><p>This thought crossed Chu Ning's mind, but his hands didn't stop, as he took out another 10 ling bamboo seeds. This time, he planned to try catalyzing 10 seeds at once.  </p><p></p><p>In this spirit field, since almost no one would come to inspect it, Chu Ning could use his full power without worrying about being discovered.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because his catalyzing technique had reached a certain level, Chu Ning completed the catalyzation quite easily this time.</p><p></p><p>Through continued experimentation, Chu Ning found that his current catalyzing technique could handle catalyzing up to 16 ling bamboo seeds at once as the limit. </p><p></p><p>However, to be on the safe side, Chu Ning still chose to catalyze 10 seeds at a time.</p><p></p><p>After all, he currently had ample time for planting, so he wasn't in a rush.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to risk any accidents by catalyzing too many seeds at once, which could damage the seeds.</p><p></p><p>The planting density for ink ling bamboo was lower than for spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>However, because Chu Ning could catalyze fewer seeds each time, and the catalyzation took longer, the planting progress was actually slower compared to when he planted spirit rice previously.</p><p></p><p>It took him a full day just to plant less than half an acre.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning spent six whole days before he managed to complete planting half of the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>"It's a bit slow!"</p><p></p><p>For Chu Ning, who was eager to finish planting the ink ling bamboo so he could cultivate using the Green Wood Spring Technique, this speed was unsatisfactory.</p><p></p><p>However, the only good news for Chu Ning was that through constant use over these past few days, his catalyzing technique had improved again.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could easily catalyze 20 ink ling bamboo seeds, so the remaining half of the spirit field should go faster.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning scattered 20 bamboo seeds and rapidly formed hand seals to cast the catalyzing technique on the ground.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, an extremely profound feeling welled up in Chu Ning's heart.</p><p></p><p>Although no one had told him, a thought inexplicably surfaced in his mind:</p><p></p><p>His catalyzing technique had reached a new realm. </p><p></p><p>He could cast it instantaneously!</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind, making him slightly excited. He immediately took out another 20 spirit rice seeds and scattered them.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, with a circulation of spiritual power and a thought, he cast it!</p><p></p><p>Instantaneously!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't need hand seals, but the catalyzing technique was directly released.</p><p></p><p>The bamboo seeds germinated and broke through the soil even faster than before, quickly revealing pointed bamboo shoots on the surface.</p><p></p><p>After the catalyzing technique transformed into an innate magical ability that could be cast instantaneously, its power had also increased!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning could sense that the spiritual power consumption of the instantaneous catalyzing technique was about one-fifth less than before.</p><p></p><p>"Is this what happens when a spell reaches a certain realm and transforms into an innate magical ability?"</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>If the catalyzing technique could be cast instantaneously, what about his other spells?</p><p></p><p>The Wood Spirit Body was effective for cultivating all wood-based spells.</p><p></p><p>Purification Technique, Green Wood Spring Technique, and even the Thorns Technique and Rattan Armor Technique he would cultivate later.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning became even more eager.</p><p></p><p>After the catalyzing technique could be cast instantaneously, Chu Ning's planting speed increased dramatically.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, he no longer needed to form hand seals; on the other, the catalyzation time was faster.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, it consumed less spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Chu Ning to use 20% more catalyzing techniques at the same cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Combining all these factors, the speed nearly doubled.</p><p></p><p>So in the situation where he had only completed planting half of the 5-acre spirit field in 6 days previously, Chu Ning finished planting the remaining half in just 3 and a half days.</p><p></p><p>All in all, it only took 10 days to plant this 5-acre field, a speed not slower than when he planted spirit rice before. This undoubtedly delighted Chu Ning greatly.</p><p></p><p>And with the ink ling bamboo planted, the real benefit for Chu Ning was that he had a way to increase his cultivation speed again.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the past month, he hadn't had many good opportunities to cultivate using the Green Wood Spring Technique.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could finally use this method to accelerate his cultivation again.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 88</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Being able to accumulate so many spirit stones was of course thanks to the continuous sale of low-grade and mid-grade talisman papers over the past few days. </p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the sect had previously set a quota of 500 spirit stones per month for the talisman shop in Yanjizhuang, mainly considering the sale of low-grade talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning had sold a large number of mid-grade talisman papers over the past few days. </p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Chu Ning also knew that this was the only wave of earning spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the number of talisman papers he could sell daily would naturally not be as many as these past few days.</p><p></p><p>But even so, it was enough to make Chu Ning delighted, since he had already earned these spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Having earned so many spirit stones, Chu Ning did not hesitate and directly took out the spirit stones to begin cultivation.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, due to his continuous drawing of talismans over the past few days, the speed of his cultivation in the Qingmu Changchun Gong and Jiuxuan Lianti Scriptures had been somewhat delayed.</p><p></p><p>The good news was that during the process of his spiritual sense constantly being used, consumed, and recovered, his spiritual sense was continuously strengthening.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the proficiency of the Spirit Refining Technique was also increasing continuously.</p><p></p><p>It had been eleven days since he came to this town. The proficiency of the Qingmu Changchun Gong had only increased by 11 points, and the progress of the Bukugu stage had only increased by 9 points.</p><p></p><p>However, the proficiency of the Spirit Refining Technique had increased by nearly 30 points.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's priority was to catch up on his cultivation of qi.</p><p></p><p>Holding the spirit stones, Chu Ning cultivated one after another.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation lasted for half a day.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Gong (Yellow Grade Low-Rank), Second Layer (521/900)]  </p><p>[Jiuxuan Lianti Scriptures, First Scroll, Bukugu 179/600]</p><p>[Spirit Refining Technique, First Layer 149/1000]</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning spent a total of 30 low-grade spirit stones, and the proficiency of the Qingmu Changchun Gong increased by 10 points.</p><p></p><p>After entering the sixth layer of qi cultivation, Chu Ning needed to spend 3 low-grade spirit stones to increase 1 point of proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Calculating this way, Chu Ning couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>4,200 spirit stones seemed like a lot, but when used, the consumption was also considerable.</p><p></p><p>Just for cultivating from the sixth to the seventh layer, if purely using spirit stones, the consumption would be over a thousand spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Next, Chu Ning continued to cultivate the Jiuxuan Lianti Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the proficiency of the Buxiu stage was 300. After cultivating to 150, he encountered a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>In the end, he forcibly broke through the bottleneck with the help of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning wanted to try if the Bukugu stage followed the same pattern, whether he would encounter a bottleneck after reaching 300 proficiency.</p><p></p><p>However, at the current cultivation speed, it would still take a few months.</p><p></p><p>Over the next two days, elders at the executive level of the Qingxi Sect gradually arrived, inspecting the area around the town for any remaining members of the Yin Mo Sect.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning remembered Lin Changqing's previous reminder and did not go out.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he cultivated and made talismans, spending his time within the town.</p><p></p><p>In the middle, there was a market day in the town, and Chu Ning sold talisman papers as usual.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the beast calamity being blocked, the number of beasts in the area had decreased, and the number of people buying talisman papers was indeed much lower.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning spent a whole day and only sold less than a hundred low-grade spirit stones' worth.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Lin Changqing came to the town and told everyone that no other members of the Yin Mo Sect had been found in the area, and it was likely just a temporary act by some low-level disciples.</p><p></p><p>As for the high-level beasts, there were only occasional low-level ones, which the Qi Condensation executors did not bother to eliminate.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they left them for the various clans and wandering cultivators to hunt.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Chu Ning did not rush to go out and waited for another day.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the third day in the morning, when Chu Ning saw that everyone in the town was moving about as usual, and there were already many clan disciples and wandering cultivators coming to the town, that he left the town, intending to see how his twenty mu of spirit fields were doing.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning carefully left the town, using the Wind Riding Technique to head towards the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>Holding a Vajra Talisman in his left hand and a Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield in his right hand.</p><p></p><p>Although Lin Changqing and Du Han had said that the area around Yanjizhuang was extremely safe at the moment, Chu Ning still did not dare to be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>After all, the sect had only said that the appearance of the Yin Mo Sect disciples was a coincidence, but Chu Ning was clear that they must have had some ulterior motive.</p><p></p><p>It's just that Chu Ning had not figured out why low-level disciples would appear here.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if there were no Yin Mo Sect disciples or beasts, there were still some wandering cultivators in the area.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was also not sure if some unscrupulous person might suddenly attack him.</p><p></p><p>The journey was uneventful, and Chu Ning only took a little time to reach the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>After taking a look, the protective formation around the spirit fields was still there, and Chu Ning was slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the beasts had not yet come this close to the town.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that beasts had appeared but were killed by others.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out the formation plate and opened the formation to enter the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, however, his expression became extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>He saw that in these spirit fields, whether it was the purple crystal bamboo shoots or the golden yuan fruit seedlings, half of them were now missing here and there.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, nearly half of the spirit plants had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>What made Chu Ning feel extremely puzzled was that the disappearance of these spirit plants was completely random, with some missing here and some missing there.</p><p></p><p>Even those that were not missing had some signs of being gnawed on.</p><p></p><p>"Beasts?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning almost instantly reacted, feeling both alert and extremely puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had just seen from the outside that the protective formation around these spirit fields was not damaged in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>How could beasts have entered this formation?</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he activated a Vajra Talisman to protect himself, while slowly infusing spiritual power into the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield in his other hand.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Power.</p><p></p><p>As long as he encountered danger, he could activate this protective talisman at any time. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning's left hand grasped three beast-trapping talismans.</p><p></p><p>After completing all this, Chu Ning finally looked around.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't discover anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some demonic beast that wandered in and then left?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, but still found it quite strange. </p><p></p><p>If a demonic beast had entered and exited, the protective formation should have been damaged.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning cautiously walked towards the center of the spirit field, extending his divine sense to probe the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>However, after walking for a long time and almost covering the entire spirit field, Chu Ning still didn't discover anything.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to reach the edge of the spirit field, Chu Ning's steps suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>Within the range of his divine sense, about one zhang (3 meters) away underground, a small white demonic beast was curled up there.</p><p></p><p>This demonic beast's body rose and fell slightly, seemingly sleeping soundly.</p><p></p><p>Because its body was completely covered by the spiritual soil, Chu Ning couldn't see it with his naked eyes.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't happened to sense it with his divine sense at this moment, he would not have discovered it at all.</p><p></p><p>There really was a demonic beast!</p><p></p><p>With almost no hesitation, Chu Ning swiftly activated a beast-trapping talisman and threw it towards the white demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Just as the beast-trapping talisman was about to completely envelop it, the sleeping white demonic beast suddenly became alert.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, it leapt up and fled outwards at an extremely fast speed.</p><p></p><p>It actually managed to dodge the spiritual power binding formed by the beast-trapping talisman.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as the white demonic beast fled out, another beast-trapping talisman had already descended.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had been prepared, and the moment after activating the first beast-trapping talisman, he had continuously activated multiple talismans.</p><p></p><p>Completely surrounding all the possible escape routes of the white demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>So no matter which direction the white demonic beast tried to flee, it would get the same result.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't have much else, but he had plenty of talismans.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Chu Ning slightly surprised was:</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual power binding formed by the beast-trapping talisman fell on the demonic beast, it only bound it for a moment.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, the white demonic beast had completely broken free.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, this demonic beast faced Chu Ning, opened its mouth and spat out a white beam of light.</p><p></p><p>Even though Chu Ning already had the protection of a Diamond Body Talisman, he didn't show the slightest negligence at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He decisively infused his spiritual power into the silver crystal frost bamboo shield he was grasping.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, this palm-sized magic treasure suddenly enlarged and blocked in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Shhh!"</p><p></p><p>The white beam of light struck the silver crystal frost bamboo shield and instantly disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>This intermediate defensive magic treasure directly blocked the small demonic beast's attack.</p><p></p><p>And seizing this opportunity, Chu Ning finally got a clear look at the appearance of this white demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>It was about the size of a quail, dragging a long tail behind it. </p><p></p><p>On its head were four ears and a pair of curved horns resembling those of a goat.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast was completely snow-white, with only a pair of jet-black eyes that were as brilliant as gems.</p><p></p><p>After the white beam it spat out was blocked, a hint of fear appeared in the little demonic beast's eyes as it turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>But just as it turned around,</p><p></p><p>Several more beast-trapping talismans descended in succession, binding it tightly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had seized the chance to rapidly activate several more beast-trapping talismans.</p><p></p><p>The little demonic beast struggled, but could no longer break free.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning casually activated a Geng Gold Sword Talisman.</p><p></p><p>A golden light flashed, and without hesitation, he slashed it towards the little demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he constantly made hand seals, condensing a cyan sword incantation in his palm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the spell from the Geng Gold Sword Talisman had already struck the little demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>The little demonic beast's body flashed with white light, actually blocking most of the power from the Geng Gold Sword Talisman.</p><p></p><p>However, the weakened sword light still managed to hit the little demonic beast, causing wounds that bled on its back.</p><p></p><p>"Wuu!"</p><p></p><p>The little demonic beast let out a groan.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, this white little demonic beast raised its head.</p><p></p><p>Its pair of eyes looked at Chu Ning, with a pleading expression.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the little demonic beast's gaze was so spiritually aware, Chu Ning was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The cyan wood sword incantation he was about to unleash paused slightly, and for a moment he didn't directly release it.</p><p></p><p>The white little demonic beast saw this and kept nodding at Chu Ning, begging for mercy.</p><p></p><p>This made Chu Ning extremely surprised, and he couldn't help but mutter to himself:</p><p></p><p>"What kind of demonic beast is this, to have such spiritual awareness?"</p><p></p><p>Judging from the power of its spell attack, it should at most be a mid-tier first-grade demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>But in theory, a demonic beast of this level should not possess such intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice suddenly rang out in Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>This made Chu Ning greatly alarmed. He stared at the white little beast and blurted out:</p><p></p><p>"You can speak?"</p><p></p><p>Today a reader commented that my classification of demonic beasts was too unclear and hard to reference, so I took a careful look and agreed it made sense to adjust it a bit.</p><p></p><p>First-grade demonic beasts are equivalent to the Qi Condensation realm, with the initial, middle, and late stages corresponding to the early, middle, and late Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Second-grade demonic beasts are at the early Foundation Establishment stage.  </p><p>Third-grade are middle Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Fourth-grade are late Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>And so on. Thanks everyone for the valuable feedback.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

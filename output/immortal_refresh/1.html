        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Alas, this world is too dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning lay on the ground of the dilapidated temple, reflecting on the ordeals he had gone through in the one month since he had crossed over.</p><p></p><p>Starting out as an orphan who grew up begging for food from families was already quite miserable, but who knew that on that very day, the village would encounter cultivators battling, causing many ordinary people to lose their lives in the senseless calamity. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was fortunate to preserve his life, but he also realized this was a cultivation world. Whether seeking a peaceful life or longevity, the only path was cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Chu Ning embarked on the path of seeking immortality. Over a month had passed, yet he had not caught even a glimpse of it.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he found this ruined temple today, otherwise he would have had to spend another night exposed on the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Hm? Someone's coming?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Chu Ning vaguely heard the sound of conversation coming from outside the dilapidated temple, and it was already approaching.</p><p></p><p>His body instinctively curled up slightly behind the incense case.</p><p></p><p>Although there was empty space under the incense case, so he couldn't really hide, Chu Ning still tried his best not to draw the other party's attention.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't know who they were or if they posed any danger.</p><p></p><p>His vigilant gaze fixed on the outside, Chu Ning tightened his grip on the incense ash in his left hand and the stick in his right.</p><p></p><p>There was no fire lit inside the temple, but Chu Ning had already stayed for a long time and grown accustomed to the darkness. With a sliver of moonlight, he could make out the general shapes from under the incense case.</p><p></p><p>Two figures entered the dilapidated temple, and their conversation became clearer.</p><p></p><p>"Cai Fu, what kind of path did you choose? If there wasn't conveniently a temple here, we would have had to suffer outside tonight."</p><p></p><p>A young man's voice came through, laced with a hint of dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Soon, another voice that sounded quite young and meek responded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master is right to scold me. I thought this was the closest path to Qingxi City."</p><p></p><p>It's unknown if it was because of the scolding or because of what the one called Cai Fu said, but the young master's tone softened considerably.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, once we settle down in Qingxi City, we'll wait for the Qingxi Sect's selection to begin. I'll participate and pass the selection to officially join the sect and cultivate, transcending mortality for immortality."</p><p></p><p>Cai Fu immediately agreed, "Young Master, with your brilliant talents, you'll definitely pass the selection."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's heart raced a little. He never expected to hear news about cultivation here and perked up his ears to listen carefully.</p><p></p><p>The young master sounded quite pleased after hearing Cai Fu's words, his speech growing more excited.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I happened to find my family's body cultivation method this time. It must be my ancestors guiding me, otherwise I would not have been determined enough to sell everything to go to Qingxi City."</p><p></p><p>"I just don't know if I'll have this body cultivation method practiced by the time of the selection, or if it will have any impact."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Cai Fu reassured him, "Young Master, don't worry. Keep practicing these days and you'll definitely make it."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The young master gave a light acknowledgment before saying, "Cai Fu, go gather some kindling to start a fire."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's brow furrowed slightly. If they started a fire, they would inevitably discover him.</p><p></p><p>Although the two didn't seem like bad people, logically they shouldn't do anything to him. But he was worried they might chase him out.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master." The servant Cai Fu responded, but in the next moment, his tone suddenly changed as he shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>Had he been discovered? Chu Ning tightened his grip again.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning soon realized the other party wasn't referring to him.</p><p></p><p>Because the one called Cai Fu was clearly shouting towards outside the temple, and the young master who had his back to the entrance also turned around at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Someone's there?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning opened his eyes and looked outside, then saw...</p><p></p><p>A cold gleam flashed as Cai Fu thrust a dagger straight into the young master's stomach.</p><p></p><p>"You...you...why?"</p><p></p><p>The young master slowly turned his head, only managing to utter those words before collapsing to the ground, dead.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't close his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Inside the dilapidated temple, Cai Fu's gloomy voice rang out. </p><p></p><p>"Why? Our family has served yours for generations, toiling to attend to you all. You obtained the family's secret cultivation method, but why do you always hide and not let me watch whenever you cultivate? </p><p></p><p>Why can't I participate in the selection to enter the immortal sect?"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying this gloomy voice, a cold wind blew into the ruined temple from outside.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was chilled by the cold wind and couldn't help but shiver.</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning only made a faint sound, it still caused Cai Fu to quickly turn around.</p><p></p><p>He lit a tinder stick and approached the incense table area.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately felt a sense of impending doom. If the two had discovered him earlier, at most they would have chased him out of the temple. But now that he had witnessed their evil deeds, he was undoubtedly in danger of being killed to eliminate witnesses.</p><p></p><p>Lying on the ground, he could only allow himself to be slaughtered.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning slowly stood up, his face showing fear as he pleaded to the other party:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't see anything! I didn't see anything!"</p><p></p><p>When Cai Fu saw that Chu Ning was just a wandering child of fifteen or sixteen years old, he immediately felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Stinky beggar, do you think I'll believe you?"</p><p></p><p>His face was covered in a vicious grin. One hand held the tinder stick, the other a dagger, as he slowly closed in on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took a step back, but there was the incense table behind him, so he had nowhere to retreat.</p><p></p><p>As Cai Fu was about to reach him, Chu Ning's eyes suddenly widened, staring at something behind Cai Fu as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>"You...you're not dead?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's words, Cai Fu turned around in horror to look behind him.</p><p></p><p>There was no one there. Realizing he had been tricked, Cai Fu quickly turned his head back, only to be met with a face full of incense ash.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>With his eyes blinded by the incense ash, Cai Fu instinctively dropped what was in his hands and went to rub his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Chu Ning gripped the rod with both hands and struck it forcefully against Cai Fu's head.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of Cai Fu staggering back while clutching his head, Chu Ning snatched up the fallen dagger and lunged forward, stabbing it forcefully into Cai Fu's abdomen!</p><p></p><p>"You, you..."</p><p></p><p>Cai Fu uttered the same doubting words as the young master, then slowly collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The difference was, with his eyes caked in incense ash, he died with his eyes open.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning retreated two steps back, the dagger pointing outwards, taking deep breaths to calm his violently fluctuating emotions.</p><p></p><p>Even with his decent psychological fortitude from his reincarnation, he was still somewhat frightened at this moment.</p><p></p><p>After a few minutes, when Chu Ning's emotions had stabilized somewhat, he kicked Cai Fu again to confirm he was truly dead, before finally letting out a long breath of relief and preparing to quickly leave the ruined temple.</p><p></p><p>But after taking a few steps, Chu Ning stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"They just mentioned some kind of body refining technique, didn't they?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the conversation between the two earlier, Chu Ning mustered his courage and carefully searched Cai Fu's body, finding a map and some scattered silver pieces.</p><p></p><p>He then approached the young master and retrieved the items hidden in his bosom and bundle.</p><p></p><p>He found some gold and silver, as well as a small booklet.</p><p></p><p>By the light of the tinder stick, Chu Ning saw a few words written on it:</p><p></p><p>'Nine Yin Body Refining Technique'</p><p></p><p>As he casually flipped it open, before Chu Ning could take a closer look, a line of text appeared in his mind:</p><p></p><p>[Nine Yin Body Refining Technique (0/100)]</p><p></p><p>A golden finger? </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning inwardly rejoiced. At this moment, he couldn't be bothered with examining it carefully. He quickly pocketed it and swiftly left the ruined temple.</p><p></p><p>New author, new book, please support~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

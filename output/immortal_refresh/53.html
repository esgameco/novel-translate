        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde hesitated for quite a while, then slowly opened his mouth and said:</p><p></p><p>"It's a sect mission, but we don't believe it's something like clearing wasteland, because it's very obvious that this mission has a certain level of danger. </p><p></p><p>As for what exactly this mission is and where it's going, I'm also not clear on that."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Zhuang Yunde paused slightly, then continued: "And as for what you said about no one coming back, that's also not absolutely true."</p><p></p><p>His gaze flickered slightly brighter. </p><p></p><p>"From what I know, there are still quite a few people who have returned.</p><p></p><p>And without exception, these people have all been accepted as inner sect disciples, even including those who were originally menial disciples."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning was somewhat taken aback and couldn't help but exclaim in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, are you saying that those menial disciples who were selected to participate in the mission, those who returned were also accepted as inner sect disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde nodded slightly, then added:</p><p></p><p>"And don't ask me why, because I don't know either."</p><p></p><p>Although Zhuang Yunde said this, Chu Ning's eyes were still full of shock and puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>From a menial disciple to an inner sect disciple, the gap in between was immense.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that those assigned as menial disciples were basically pseudo-spirit root disciples with four or five spiritual attributes.</p><p></p><p>And for such disciples, perhaps they could still stand out a bit in the early Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>But upon entering the middle Qi Refining stage, they would clearly be left behind by disciples with three spiritual roots or above.</p><p></p><p>As for three spiritual root disciples, in Qingxi Sect, unless they had some other outstanding talents, they would generally be outer sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>What inner sect disciples meant - without exception they were people of exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling was a relative of a Golden Dan Elder of the sect, but because her cultivation talent was insufficient, Elder Mu had placed her in the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>From this, it can be seen that in Qingxi Sect, to truly become an inner sect true disciple was absolutely not simple.</p><p></p><p>Those were disciples with great hope of forming their Natal Spiritual Foundation.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, menial disciples only needed to participate in the mission and return alive to become inner sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>That...</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's expression changed slightly at this moment. It wasn't that he envied these people becoming inner sect disciples, but rather he was thinking about just how dangerous this mission must be.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a slight smile appeared on Zhuang Yunde's face as he said:</p><p></p><p>"If I'm able to return, perhaps I'll have a chance to tell you about these things."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Since you know participating in the mission is so dangerous, Senior Martial Brother, did the sect force you to go?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not like that," Zhuang Yunde shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, if you're able to enter the outer sect as a menial disciple, there is still a certain degree of autonomy to choose. This time, choosing to go was my own request.</p><p></p><p>I've been stuck at the ninth level of Qi Refining for too long. Not to mention forming my Natal Spiritual Foundation, even just fully completing the Qi Refining stage seems unattainable for a very long time, so..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning let out a slight sigh in his heart, as he had understood Zhuang Yunde's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>It was very clear that this Senior Martial Brother Zhuang was unwilling to remain stuck at his current boundary. Even though his life was comfortable, he still wanted to take a chance.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating immortality, contending for the Great Way?</p><p></p><p>Even after leaving Zhuang Yunde's courtyard, Chu Ning was still constantly pondering over this matter in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He was thinking about what he would do if he encountered such a situation himself.</p><p></p><p>Then very quickly, he figured it out.</p><p></p><p>A dog's life is most precious.</p><p></p><p>If one wants longevity, the prerequisite is preserving one's life.</p><p></p><p>Having understood this point, Chu Ning's heart immediately felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Zhuang Yunde had also told him.</p><p></p><p>If in the future he truly wanted to have more choices, he would need to find a way to rid himself of the status of a menial disciple and enter the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>However, for Chu Ning, these matters were still somewhat distant for now.</p><p></p><p>At present, what Chu Ning needed to do first was complete the advancement to the third district.</p><p></p><p>Thus, after leaving Zhuang Yunde's place, Chu Ning took the initiative to go find He Changyou.</p><p></p><p>"You want to participate in the third district advancement assessment? If I recall, you were a new disciple who joined a year and a half ago, right?"</p><p></p><p>He Changyou looked at Chu Ning, somewhat surprised yet also with a few hints of satisfaction on his face.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"After entering the sect for a year and a half, you've been able to reach the fourth level of Qi refinement. I remember you previously chose to cultivate the Ink Bamboo, so your cultivation of spells should also be quite good." </p><p></p><p>While speaking, He Changyou took out a jade slip from his storage bag, seemingly to register Chu Ning's application information.</p><p></p><p>"Although the fourth level of Qi refinement doesn't give you much of a chance in the promotion test for District C, I still encourage you to participate and treat it as practice. Our Spirit Plant House does need new seedlings to emerge continuously."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, He Changyou put the jade slip back into his storage bag, and continued:</p><p></p><p>"Your performance has been decent. Go and compare yourself with those senior martial brothers. There will be an assessment for you all in half a month."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Executive Minister!" Chu Ning cupped his hands in a salute, then took his leave.</p><p></p><p>His relationship with He Changyou was not as good as with Zhuang Yunde, so naturally he couldn't converse much further with He Changyou at this point.</p><p></p><p>In the following half a month or so, Chu Ning did indeed use spirit stones to increase his cultivation level, just as he had told Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was not trying to consolidate the fourth level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>Rather, he wanted to continue solidifying his fifth level of Qi refinement, preparing for the next step of breaking through to the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>After all, with the Ink Bamboo harvested, he could no longer rely on casting the Green Wood Vernal Bloom Technique for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although there was still the Iron Vine in the courtyard, its speed could not compare to the Ink Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating with one spirit stone per day, plus using the Iron Vine to cast the Green Wood Vernal Bloom Technique, Chu Ning's speed was not slower than before. In fact, it was slightly faster, increasing his proficiency by about 5 points every two days.</p><p></p><p>Half a month passed in the blink of an eye. Early this morning, Chu Ning ended his cultivation and checked his progress:</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Vernal Bloom Technique (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), Second Layer (400/900)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Volume, Deathless Bones 140/600]  </p><p>[Spirit Refining Technique, First Layer 101/1000]</p><p></p><p>The proficiency of the second layer of the Green Wood Vernal Bloom Technique had reached 400.</p><p></p><p>According to Chu Ning's previous estimation, if 200 was enough to reach the fifth level of Qi refinement, then 500 should allow him to reach the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could obtain a spirit field to plant spirit herbs in District C next, filling the remaining 100 proficiency should be quick.</p><p></p><p>As for his progress in body and spirit refining, it was normal. Chu Ning couldn't find a way to speed it up for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Feeling energetic and full of vigor, Chu Ning pushed open the courtyard gate and went out. The promotion test for District C was today.</p><p></p><p>"Creak!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the neighboring courtyard's gate also opened, and Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang came out as well.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning, Lu Yunfang greeted him warmly as usual.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu, you're up so early during the farming offseason?"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, she blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you're up early to attend the promotion test for District C too?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. "Senior Martial Brother and Sister, you're also going to take the promotion test?"</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunfang nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The temporary fields we were in charge of have been harvested. Those few fields are not enough for my husband and I to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"So of course we're going to attend this promotion test. But you, Junior Martial Brother Chu..."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, she looked deeply at Chu Ning, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"To reach the fourth level of Qi refinement in such a short time, and even participate in the promotion test, your talent is enviable."</p><p></p><p>Luo Hongping also nodded repeatedly, his eyes fixed on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning inwardly lamented. He didn't expect that despite keeping a low profile, he would end up drawing attention from the two of them at this time.</p><p></p><p>He could only shake his head with a difficult expression.</p><p></p><p>"I was just lucky. The sect's executive minister said I happened to be well-suited for the Green Wood Vernal Bloom Technique."</p><p></p><p>"But for this promotion test, I'm just going to try my luck. How could I really compare with Senior Martial Brother and Sister?"</p><p></p><p>The three of them exchanged insincere remarks, then headed together toward the location of the assessment.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 13</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning finished harvesting all the rice grains, and then carried them back to Cao Dongxin's courtyard, it was already approaching nightfall. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cooked the meal, then skillfully finished the other chores, and went to take a shower before returning to his own room.</p><p></p><p>Over the past two months, Chu Ning had already become adept at dealing with Cao Dongxin's various unreasonable demands, with extremely precise time management. </p><p></p><p>He did the various chores very efficiently, without giving Cao Dongxin any opportunity to find fault.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Chu Ning cooperated very well in completing all the tasks required of him, Cao Dongxin did not take too much advantage either.</p><p></p><p>So, Chu Ning was generally able to ensure relatively sufficient time for cultivation in the evenings.</p><p></p><p>After returning to his room and slightly adjusting his state, Chu Ning sat cross-legged on the bed and began cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Gong.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of the Qingchu Huangshu and Lingshu arts, but having already reached the third level of Qi refinement, Chu Ning's speed of absorbing spiritual energy was faster than before.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivation method circulated, streams of wood-attribute spiritual energy invisible to the naked eye drilled into Chu Ning's body, entering his dantian.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's dantian contained three layers of energy rings.  </p><p></p><p>The bottom two layers were extremely condensed, while the topmost layer was also approaching that state.</p><p></p><p>As stream after stream of spiritual energy entered, the topmost energy ring became more and more condensed.</p><p></p><p>Until a certain moment, this layer of energy ring could no longer accommodate so much spiritual energy, seeming to want to separate upwards.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's mind jolted, and he directly withdrew from the cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>The third level of Qi refinement was complete!</p><p></p><p>Without a fourth level Qi refinement method, he could not continue to break through further at this moment, which left Chu Ning slightly regretful.</p><p></p><p>He could sense his own state, without any bottleneck or the like. As long as he had a fourth level Qi refinement method, he could push through directly to the fourth level in one go.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that as long as you obtain the qualification for an independent spirit field, and cultivate to the second level of Qi refinement, you can request the complete Qingmu Changchun Gong method from the sect, to prepare for future needs."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning felt much relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Six days later would be the assessment period, at which time obtaining the complete Qingmu Changchun Gong method would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning thought of something, his mind instantly sinking into his consciousness. In the next moment, his face revealed delight.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Gong (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), First Layer (300/300)]</p><p></p><p>[Talent Refreshed, Rewarded Talent "Symbol Source Spirit Body":</p><p>1. Greatly enhances comprehension, cultivation talent for Talisman Arts;</p><p>2. Increases success rate and quality of talisman creation.]</p><p></p><p>His talent had indeed refreshed again!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at this newly appeared talent, his gaze burning fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Among the hundred arts of cultivation, the four arts of formations, apparatus, pills, and talismans were the most common. Each of these four was not simple - being proficient in just one could allow one to establish a solid footing in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>And it was very clear that this time the rewarded "Symbol Source Spirit Body" talent was related to talisman creation.</p><p></p><p>It meant that with a little cultivation, he would have a skill to establish himself!</p><p></p><p>"Then what about my previous talent?" Chu Ning suddenly thought of this crucial matter. After focusing his mind to look, he then breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>[Jiuyin Refining Body Art (100/100)]  </p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Gong (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), First Layer (300/300)]</p><p>[Talents: Yinmu Spirit Body, Symbol Source Spirit Body]</p><p></p><p>The contents now displayed in his consciousness had changed. This complete display told him that his previous Yinmu Spirit Body talent was still there.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation talents are still there, and there is great hope of possessing the skill of talisman creation. The path of the great Way has become unobstructed!!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next morning, as usual Chu Ning got up very early. Of course he could not reveal his talents, but an appropriate display of his cultivation level was possible.</p><p></p><p>Nearly three months' time, cultivating to the second level of Qi refinement, was not excessive, right?</p><p></p><p>After all, the first three levels of Qi refinement were still relatively basic. Going further, the difficulty would increase by multiples. And among the first three levels, those with good talents could even reach the second level in just one month.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had now "spent" nearly three months, which was reasonable!</p><p></p><p>However, what Chu Ning considered reasonable appeared as a different scene in Cao Dongxin's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You...you've reached the second level of Qi Refining?" </p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin sensed the change in Chu Ning's aura and was instantly shocked as if he had seen a ghost.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were some pseudo-spiritual root cultivators who could reach the second level of Qi Refining within three months, but they were not too many.</p><p></p><p>Yet Chu Ning had now become one of them, how could Cao Dongxin not be surprised?</p><p></p><p>Being able to reach the second level of Qi Refining in just three months, even though Chu Ning's spell cultivation was not outstanding, the sect would definitely grant him the qualification to cultivate spiritual fields, and possibly even assign him a decent spiritual field in Area D.</p><p></p><p>One must know that although all fields in Area D were low-grade spiritual fields, there were still differences between them, with upper, middle, and lower grades.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the feeling of pleasure Cao Dongxin had yesterday instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Because he suddenly realized a problem - if what he was thinking was true, then after the assessment period in a few days, even though Chu Ning's current cultivation level might still be lower than his, Chu Ning's status in the eyes of the higher-ups in the Spirit Plant House might surpass his own.</p><p></p><p>After realizing this, Cao Dongxin's complicated feelings could be imagined.</p><p></p><p>His attitude also began to subtly change.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't say anything, after finishing breakfast, Cao Dongxin didn't just leave, but instead cleaned up his own bowl and chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>Then, when Chu Ning was about to wash the dishes, Cao Dongxin stopped him and directly cast a cleaning spell, making the dishes spotlessly clean.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this change in Senior Brother Cao, Chu Ning naturally understood the reason, but he didn't point it out.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it also made Chu Ning feel a greater sense of realization.</p><p></p><p>In this cultivation world, strength is indeed paramount!</p><p></p><p>Just because he had slightly revealed a talent superior to ordinary pseudo-spiritual root disciples, making Cao Dongxin realize that his own development might surpass the other's, this person immediately changed his attitude.</p><p></p><p>To survive better in this world, one must indeed first lay low and develop oneself to become stronger.</p><p></p><p>But occasionally, one must also reveal oneself a little, like now.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt this realization in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, when they came to the fields, Cao Dongxin did not instruct Chu Ning on what to do like he did yesterday.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Ning, he found a plot of field and began using the Blade Aura Technique to harvest, not wanting to miss such a good opportunity to practice the technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could not further improve his current cultivation level for the time being, so even if he cultivated his spiritual power, it would not increase. Using his spiritual power now to practice spells and then meditate to recover was a good way to refine his spiritual power and spells.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Ning displaying a stronger Blade Aura Technique compared to yesterday, wasn't it natural since he had already broken through? </p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning still understood the need to keep a low profile, so he controlled the power of the second level of Qi Refining when using his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>And the Blade Aura Technique he had cultivated was not particularly outstanding, so in terms of effect, it was still much weaker than Cao Dongxin's, which did not arouse too much suspicion from the other party.</p><p></p><p>Thus, with Chu Ning and Cao Dongxin's "normal" performance, the remaining few plots of fields left from yesterday were quickly harvested, completing the early work.</p><p></p><p>After they went ashore, Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi on the other side of the road were still huffing and puffing while harvesting the rice.</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang happened to be harvesting the plot near the road and saw Cao Dongxin and Chu Ning carrying the harvested rice back. He was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>When did Cao Dongxin change his nature and actually take the initiative to carry the harvested rice?</p><p></p><p>And the two of them had finished harvesting and were going back so early?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he couldn't help but ask: "Hey, Old Cao, how did you finish harvesting so quickly this time?"</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Shang Zhaoxiang's gaze swept over Chu Ning, and in the next moment, he exclaimed in surprise again:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Chu Ning, you've reached the second level of Qi Refining?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qiu Shunyi, who was about to use the Blade Aura Technique to harvest the rice, raised his head, and then subconsciously released his spell, which happened to be flung towards the road!</p><p></p><p>For some reason, neither Shang Zhaoxiang nor Cao Dongxin had any intention of taking action, so the blade formed by the Blade Aura Technique flew straight towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, quick, dodge!"</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Qiu Shunyi belatedly shouted.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

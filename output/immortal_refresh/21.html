        <h1>Chapter 21</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This is what my Daoist friend reminded me about," the innkeeper Song immediately responded. </p><p></p><p>"We have a total of ten spirit grass seeds, and catalyzing one seed will produce one or two spirit shards, so ten seeds will produce ten spirit shards in total."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning felt a slight puzzlement in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This price doesn't seem too bad. With ten spirit grass seeds, I probably only need to use the catalyzing technique once to get it done. I can earn ten spirit shards all at once?</p><p></p><p>Although ten spirit shards probably can't be exchanged for even a low-grade spirit stone, theoretically I seem to have gained a low-grade spirit stone."  </p><p></p><p>Perhaps noticing the puzzlement in Chu Ning's heart, the innkeeper Song explained:</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, the spirit grass seeds have an extremely strange nature and are highly sensitive to fluctuations in spiritual power. </p><p></p><p>Each seed must be planted separately, so you need to perform the catalyzing technique ten separate times for these ten seeds.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it must be an instantaneous release. If you use an incantation to slowly accumulate spiritual power instead of inputting it all at once, it will also fail to catalyze."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning finally understood.</p><p></p><p>No wonder those disciples from the Bing district were unwilling to take this task. It's not ten spirit shards at once, but one spirit shard per seed.</p><p></p><p>One spirit shard it is then, Chu Ning didn't mind anymore. Using the catalyzing technique didn't consume much of his spiritual power, so he could still profit from these spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he immediately said to the innkeeper Song: "Alright, I'll take it."</p><p></p><p>"Very good, please wait a moment, Daoist friend. Let me make some preparations!"</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper Song said, then left first.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, he came back out and brought Chu Ning to an open space beside the rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was a transparent box placed beside the open space, and Chu Ning saw a black seed inside the box.</p><p></p><p>"Daoist friend, may we begin?" the innkeeper Song asked.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning nodded, the innkeeper Song immediately went to the box and opened the lid.  </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't hesitate either, instantly releasing the catalyzing technique and a burst of spiritual power struck the spirit grass seed.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, the seed sprouted and emerged from the soil.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the innkeeper Song quickly covered the box again, then had someone carry it away directly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, another transparent box was brought out from inside.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning repeated the process, performing the catalyzing technique over and over until he completed it ten times.</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper Song then took out a small cloth bag. "Daoist friend, here are the ten spirit shards. Please accept them."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning weighed it in his hand briefly before putting it away.</p><p></p><p>Then, after a moment of hesitation, he asked the innkeeper Song:</p><p></p><p>"Innkeeper, I don't know if you have any other tasks involving spirit plants?"</p><p></p><p>The ten spirit shards he just obtained were still too little.  </p><p></p><p>It was far from enough to buy anything substantial in the market.</p><p></p><p>The innkeeper shook his head. "I only have this one task at the moment."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he hesitated for a moment, then looked at Chu Ning and said:</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Daoist friend has cultivated the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique? If so, I could introduce you to another job."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought for a moment, then nodded: "I can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to hide that he knew the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique, since cultivating the Ink Bamboo required that technique anyway.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the innkeeper didn't seem too surprised either. For someone at the third level of Qi Condensation with the ability to instantly release the catalyzing technique, knowing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique was not strange at all.</p><p></p><p>He instructed an attendant to watch the front counter, then directly led Chu Ning out of the rear courtyard. After walking for a while, they arrived at a small shop.</p><p></p><p>"Old Mister Sun, I've brought you a customer," the innkeeper called out as soon as he entered.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, a short and slightly scrawny old man stood up from a recliner.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over the innkeeper, then fell on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"What does this customer need? This old man mainly deals with wood-type items."</p><p></p><p>The old man's voice was not loud, but it immediately caught Chu Ning's attention.</p><p></p><p>Wood-type.</p><p></p><p>Due to his Tiger Wood Spirit Body, he had a special fondness for wood-type items.</p><p></p><p>Looking around, he indeed saw some wood-type artifacts and flying swords on the shelves, which greatly piqued his interest.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the innkeeper Song had already introduced:</p><p></p><p>"This customer just performed the catalyzing technique at my place. I heard that he is proficient in the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique, so I specially brought him over."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so the Daoist friend can perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique?"</p><p></p><p>The old Mister Sun glanced at Chu Ning, but showed no particular expression, as if it didn't really matter to him.</p><p></p><p>This left Chu Ning slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>From their conversation, it seemed that this Old Mister Sun clearly wanted to find someone capable of performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique.</p><p></p><p>So why didn't he have any reaction when he heard that Chu Ning could do it?</p><p></p><p>Although thinking this in his heart, Chu Ning still nodded in response.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Old Mr. Sun saw this and said indifferently, "Friend, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>The shopkeeper Song did not follow, but chose to take his leave. Old Mr. Sun did not care about him and led Chu Ning towards the backyard. </p><p></p><p>Upon arriving in the courtyard, as usual, Old Mr. Sun asked Chu Ning to perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while and seeing that the effect of the technique performed by Chu Ning was quite good, Old Mr. Sun looked at Chu Ning and asked, "I don't know how many times my friend can continuously perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique."</p><p></p><p>"How many times to perform it?" Chu Ning muttered to himself upon hearing this. Could it be that the other party wanted him to perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique over a large planting area?</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the size of this courtyard, it did not seem like there was a large area for planting things. If it was to go somewhere farther away, Chu Ning would not be willing.</p><p></p><p>So, Chu Ning asked in return, "How many times does the shopkeeper want?"</p><p></p><p>"Ten times!" Old Mr. Sun raised his finger.</p><p></p><p>"If you cannot continuously perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique ten times, you cannot take on this task from this old man."</p><p></p><p>Old Mr. Sun's voice remained calm. After hearing this, Chu Ning also calmly said, "Why don't Shopkeeper Sun first tell me what this task of yours is, and then I'll consider whether to take it or not."</p><p></p><p>"Can you continuously perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique ten times?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Mr. Sun's tone finally changed slightly, to be precise, it was tinged with a bit of excitement mixed with doubt.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning remained silent, but this had obviously answered the other party's question.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Old Mr. Sun became pensive. Finally, he gritted his teeth and still spoke, "To be honest with you, this old man unintentionally obtained a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and transplanted it here.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the spiritual energy here is insufficient.</p><p></p><p>Although I specially prepared high-quality spirit soil and tried many methods, it only managed to bear fruit, but after that, there was no way to proceed.</p><p></p><p>At this point, only the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique can promote its growth and enhance its quality."</p><p></p><p>When Old Mr. Sun said this, Chu Ning became a little interested.</p><p></p><p>At least it was not going to a faraway place, and this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit sounded quite good, he had never seen it before.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Old Mr. Sun's repeated questions to him earlier, he asked with some surprise, "Could it be that this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit requires performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique multiple times at once?"</p><p></p><p>"Precisely," Old Mr. Sun nodded.</p><p></p><p>"This Seven-Star Spirit Fruit requires continuously and uninterruptedly performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique ten times at once.</p><p></p><p>Performing it continuously for ten days, a total of one hundred times, is the only way to ensure the quality of the fruit.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely for this reason that I have not been able to find a suitable person to help complete this task."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning pondered slightly. Performing the technique ten times consecutively was certainly not a problem for him; he could even perform it more times at once.</p><p></p><p>However, doing it continuously for ten days would be a bit troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Old Mr. Sun looked at Chu Ning, who remained silent, and his gaze flickered a few times.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had found a few early-stage cultivator disciples, but many of them could not meet this requirement, so this business had not been completed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, finding a higher-level cultivator would definitely be able to complete it.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not want this treasure to be known to high-level cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was not sure whether Chu Ning could truly do it or was just deliberately probing him for amusement.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly and then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique ten times consecutively is possible, but in that case, my spiritual power would be depleted, and having to go back and forth every day would be too troublesome."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Old Mr. Sun immediately responded, "That's simple. Every time you perform the technique, I will give you a Recovery Pill to help restore your spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, for each day you come to perform the technique, I will give you two low-grade spirit stones as compensation."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning could not help but feel tempted.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had used the Catalyzing Technique ten times and only obtained ten taels of spirit shards.</p><p></p><p>But now, by performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique ten times, he could get two low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>If he came for ten days, that would be twenty spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>With twenty low-grade spirit stones in hand, he should be able to buy some decent items in the market.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's start from today then."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning agree, Old Mr. Sun was immediately delighted and led Chu Ning to a spirit fruit tree that was about half a person's height.</p><p></p><p>This spirit fruit tree had a straight and slender trunk, exuding an intoxicating fragrance.</p><p></p><p>Its leaves were not large but were seven-colored.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the seven-colored leaves, there were a few blue fruits, though not yet plump and round, one could already sense the spiritual energy nurtured within.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

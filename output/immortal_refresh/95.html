        <h1>Chapter 95</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After integrating various true talisman spells, Chu Ning began to continue exploring the methods of using this divine ability. </p><p></p><p>For example, he tried another experiment - if he wanted to replace the five true talisman spells within the talisman ring, how would he do it?</p><p></p><p>In the end, he discovered that he could only activate one of the spells, and then after an hour passed, he could integrate another true talisman spell.</p><p></p><p>He also tried integrating the same talisman, which did not affect it either.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Chu Ning chose to integrate a Diamond Talisman, a Yin Thunder Talisman, an Earth Escape Talisman, and two Geng Metal Sword Talismans into the talisman ring.</p><p></p><p>These were the highest-level talismans he could currently make, and this talisman ring combined offense, defense, and escape.</p><p></p><p>However, this was only temporary. </p><p></p><p>Next, his goal was to integrate low-level superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>Returning from the hillside to the town market, Chu Ning closed the door and immediately went to the talisman-making room.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Talisman Spell Book not only recorded low-level intermediate talismans but also three types of low-level superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>With Chu Ning's current late-Refining Qi realm cultivation, he could naturally try making these low-level superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Refining Divine Art once to adjust his spiritual sense to the optimal state, Chu Ning took out his talisman pen and other tools from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he recalled the content about low-level superior talismans recorded in the Spiritual Talisman Spell Book.</p><p></p><p>There were three types of superior talismans:</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Flame Fire Talisman, an offensive fire talisman; the Cloud-Riding Talisman, which could help cultivators fly for a period of time; and the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman, a defensive talisman.  </p><p></p><p>According to the introduction, the three talismans were ranked from easiest to most difficult to make.</p><p></p><p>Since Chu Ning had never made low-level superior talismans before, he decided to start with the simplest one, the Crimson Flame Fire Talisman.</p><p></p><p>After going through the process of making the Crimson Flame Fire Talisman in his mind, Chu Ning immediately began drawing the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Although this was his first time dealing with low-level superior talismans, with the blessing of his talisman source spirit body, it was as if he had been familiar with this talisman for a long time.</p><p></p><p>For this first talisman paper, it was not until Chu Ning was about to start drawing that a slight accident caused him to fail.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning laid out a new talisman paper, closed his eyes, and briefly recalled the process where he had failed in making the previous talisman.</p><p></p><p>Then, he dipped his brush in ink and began his second attempt.</p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning completed the entire talisman paper almost effortlessly.</p><p></p><p>However, right at the moment when the talisman patterns lit up with a crimson glow and were about to be absorbed into the talisman paper...</p><p></p><p>"Shua!"</p><p></p><p>The talisman paper suddenly burst into flames, signaling Chu Ning's second failure.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was stunned for a moment, not quite reacting.</p><p></p><p>He felt there were no issues with his previous talisman-making attempt.  </p><p></p><p>The talisman patterns had emitted a crimson glow, which to some extent represented a successful talisman creation.</p><p></p><p>So why did it suddenly catch fire at the very last moment?</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, Chu Ning took out a third talisman paper and began making it, then a fourth.</p><p></p><p>On both of those papers, the spiritual energy fluctuated slightly, and the papers were damaged before completion.</p><p></p><p>On the fifth paper, Chu Ning finally fully drew out the talisman patterns.</p><p></p><p>Then, to his surprise, just like the second paper, right at the moment when the crimson glow emerged from the formed patterns, the paper burst into flames.</p><p></p><p>Even after Chu Ning stubbornly continued and used 10 talisman papers, he finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>Out of those 10 papers, he had fully drawn out the patterns on 4 of them.</p><p></p><p>This was comparable to his initial 40% talisman success rate when first learning certain talismans. However, what puzzled Chu Ning was that those 4 papers, which he was certain should have succeeded, had all burned without exception.</p><p></p><p>Having never encountered such a situation since starting talisman-making, Chu Ning was quite confused at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He then tried making the other two types of talismans, but the result was the same.</p><p></p><p>Yet when Chu Ning drew the Diamond Talisman, a low-level intermediate talisman, there were no issues at all and he completed it easily.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because I've just reached the seventh level of Refining Qi, so my spiritual energy is unstable?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning found a possible reason, but after thinking about it, he felt that wasn't it.</p><p></p><p>After all, during the talisman-making process just now, Chu Ning did not sense any deficiency in his spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly thought of another possibility and picked up a talisman paper to examine it.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because of the quality of the talisman paper?"</p><p></p><p>As he muttered to himself, he began sensing it with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>After just a short while, Chu Ning's gaze became somewhat strange.</p><p></p><p>There was a very high possibility that the reason lay with the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>The talisman papers he had made himself from the Ink Bamboo he planted had been mostly given to Mu Ling, and he had been making new ones every day since learning talisman-making.  </p><p></p><p>Those previous talisman papers had long been used up.</p><p></p><p>The papers in his hands now were the ones Lin Changqing had brought from the sect.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, they didn't feel much different from holding them. But when he carefully sensed them with his spiritual sense, he discovered there were some impurities that had not been fully removed.</p><p></p><p>The impurities were not much and did not affect using them for low-level intermediate talismans, but they were not suitable for higher-level low-level superior talismans.</p><p></p><p>This kind of issue could never occur with the talisman papers he made himself.</p><p></p><p>Logically, it should not occur with other sect talisman papers either.</p><p></p><p>After all, the same ordinary talisman papers were used for low, intermediate, and high-level talismans, so the sect's quality requirements should be the same.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was quite obvious that this kind of talisman paper would circulate to him, there must have been some issue along the way. </p><p></p><p>"It's just not known whether the problem occurred during the recycling stage or the selling stage."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed, feeling somewhat speechless about the management of the Qingxi Sect. </p><p></p><p>Then, his expression turned strange, "Could this thing have been recycled by Zhuang Yunde?"</p><p></p><p>But in his impression, although Zhuang Yunde was a bit greedy, he had always acted cautiously.</p><p></p><p>As for the specifics, Chu Ning had no way to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't attempt to make low-grade talismans, Chu Ning decided not to try. </p><p></p><p>He might as well use these talisman papers to make lower-grade beginner talismans and mid-grade beginner talismans.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his purple crystal bamboo would be ready for making talisman paper in a while, so he didn't need to worry anymore.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the purple crystal bamboo could grow so quickly was actually thanks to Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>One day, after seeing the growth of the iron-stemmed orchids, when Chu Ning went to the spirit field, he suddenly had an inspiration.</p><p></p><p>Since this Ling Xiaobai could ripen the iron-stemmed orchids and make them bear iron orchid fruits, it should also be able to ripen the purple crystal bamboo, right?</p><p></p><p>It's just that this ten-acre field might be too much for the little guy to urinate on.</p><p></p><p>But it didn't matter, it could be ripened little by little.</p><p></p><p>So, during these two months, Ling Xiaobai had urinated all over the purple crystal bamboo in the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>However, it now seemed that it needed to be sped up even more.</p><p></p><p>Since Chu Ning had the idea of ripening the purple crystal bamboo as soon as possible, the next morning he went straight to the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>His Qingmu Changchun Gong had already reached the seventh layer of Qi refinement, so he didn't need to use the Qingmu Chunhua Art for rapid advancement and breakthrough in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, practicing with the iron-stemmed orchids in the market wouldn't have much impact.</p><p></p><p>He might as well use the Qingmu Chunhua Art on the purple crystal bamboo more, to ripen them quickly for making high-grade beginner talismans.</p><p></p><p>After entering the spirit field, Chu Ning didn't rush to use the Qingmu Chunhua Art, but instead called out to Ling Xiaobai:</p><p></p><p>"Come here, Xiaobai, come over here and urinate on these bamboos."</p><p></p><p>When Ling Xiaobai heard Chu Ning's words, its two eyes blinked pitifully.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the first time it caused trouble in this spirit field and was trapped by Chu Ning's Confinement Talisman, it knew these were Chu Ning's prized possessions, so it had been very careful.</p><p></p><p>Later, there was one time when Chu Ning actually asked it to urinate on these bamboos, and the little guy happily did so right away.</p><p></p><p>But after that, Chu Ning kept bringing it here every day.</p><p></p><p>He even forced it to drink more water, although it was the spirit-infused water from his Gan Lin Art.</p><p></p><p>However, Ling Xiaobai was still quite dissatisfied with being reduced to a fertilizer sprinkler.</p><p></p><p>It had protested to Chu Ning many times, but the protests were ineffective.</p><p></p><p>Just a couple of days ago, it had finally managed to urinate on all the bamboos in these ten acres, little by little.</p><p></p><p>But unexpectedly, today it had to start all over again.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be upset, once these bamboos ripen in a few days, I'll give you some to chew on."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ling Xiaobai wasn't moving, Chu Ning started to tempt it.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, upon hearing this, the little guy immediately sprang into action.</p><p></p><p>Running and urinating at the same time, it sprinkled several bamboos.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction, then took out a jade orchid fruit from his storage bag and tossed it over.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai caught it and happily started eating.</p><p></p><p>It was at this point that Chu Ning began repeatedly using the Qingmu Chunhua Art in the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>Both to help improve the quality of the purple crystal bamboo and to ripen them.</p><p></p><p>Around noon, Chu Ning sat down to meditate in the spirit field for a while, replenishing his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>He then prepared to leave the spirit field with Ling Xiaobai and return to the market.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, Chu Ning's gaze inadvertently swept over the hill where he used to practice the Cangmu Sword Art, and he vaguely noticed a few figures there, causing him to pause slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect's spirit field was considered to have the highest level of spiritual energy in the area, but there were also some spirit fields belonging to a Sun family of cultivators nearby.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sun family's spirit field was to the northwest.</p><p></p><p>So normally no one would come to this northeastern hill.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that Chu Ning chose to practice the Cangmu Sword Art there every day.</p><p></p><p>But now, there were figures appearing on that hill, which made him feel a bit puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning soon shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, he saw several figures rushing down from the hill, charging in this direction.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's brows furrowed slightly, and as a lone cultivator, his first thought was to avoid too much contact with others to prevent any trouble.</p><p></p><p>Although he retreated back into the spirit field's formation, Chu Ning's gaze remained fixed on the outside.</p><p></p><p>The spirit field's formation could block outside vision from seeing in, but it didn't prevent vision from inside looking out.</p><p></p><p>Very soon, four figures came running rapidly, one in front and three chasing behind.</p><p></p><p>"How could he be here?"</p><p></p><p>What made Chu Ning somewhat astonished was that he actually recognized the person in the front - it was none other than that old man Sun from Qinghe Market.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

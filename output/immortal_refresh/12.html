        <h1>Chapter 12</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Just like when cultivating other spells before, Chu Ning first went through the essential formula in his mind, circulated his spiritual power, and made the hand seals. </p><p></p><p>Then, he pointed towards the empty space.</p><p></p><p>Silently and without a sound, there was no movement in that empty space.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but be stunned for a moment. </p><p></p><p>If he didn't clearly feel the consumption of spiritual power within his body, he would have thought he didn't cast the spell just now.</p><p></p><p>"This spell consumes quite a bit more spiritual power than the purification spell earlier, yet it still failed to take effect?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning tried again stubbornly, but there was still no reaction.</p><p></p><p>After several attempts, Chu Ning finally accepted the fact that without the blessing of the Yin Wood Spirit Body, his talent was indeed very ordinary.</p><p></p><p>He was actually stumped by a simple water spell like the Sweet Rain Spell.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that in my current situation, it's best for me to cultivate wood spells. Cultivating spells of other attributes is too strenuous and the progress is too slow.</p><p></p><p>It's just not known whether there will be other talent rewards as I make breakthroughs in the future."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immersed his mind in the system again.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), First Layer (62/300)]</p><p></p><p>Through last night's cultivation, the Green Wood Evergreen Skill gained 1 familiarity point, but the purification spell, catalysis spell, and sweet rain spell he just cultivated still did not appear.</p><p></p><p>By now, Chu Ning had vaguely figured some things out.</p><p></p><p>This familiarity only worked for cultivating skills, not spells.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning had a vague feeling that even for cultivating skills, there might be certain limitations.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if he could randomly cultivate other skills and get rewards, this cheat probably wouldn't have such a loophole.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Nine Yin Body Tempering Art can also give rewards, does that mean body refining skills are useful too?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made a note of this and planned to try finding a suitable body refining skill to test it out later.</p><p></p><p>For now, his urgent task was to continue cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen Skill, improving his familiarity while also raising his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>So in the time that followed, Chu Ning returned to the routine of the previous few days.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated skills at his residence morning and night, while during the day he would go to the fields under Cao Dongxin's orders to drive away pests, clear weeds.</p><p></p><p>With more usage, the purification spell also became increasingly familiar.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Green Wood Spring Skill also became more familiar, since he used this spell every day and rapidly improved his Green Wood Evergreen Skill with its help.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally also cultivated the catalysis spell and sweet rain spell. The catalysis spell was fine.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the progress on the sweet rain spell was indeed slow. Chu Ning could cast it, but he was unsatisfied with both the amount of rainfall and the spiritual power consumption.</p><p></p><p>This also forced Chu Ning to accept the fact that apart from wood skills and spells, he was mediocre in everything else.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Chu Ning had been at Qingxi Sect for almost three months.</p><p></p><p>During these two-plus months, Chu Ning lived an extremely regimented life.</p><p></p><p>He worked at sunrise and rested at sunset.  </p><p></p><p>Days were spent working in the fields while cultivating, nights cultivating and resting.</p><p></p><p>Then every half month he would go to the Skill Transmission Chamber to learn spells and some basic knowledge about spiritual plants.</p><p></p><p>After a few times, Chu Ning also learned the oral formulas for the Blade Aura Spell, Repel Spell, and Wind Guidance Spell from Shi Yao.</p><p></p><p>The Blade Aura Spell had a certain offensive capability, but was mainly used for harvesting spiritual plants.</p><p></p><p>The Repel Spell was considered a relatively common spell in cultivation, and had some uses in the daily process of spiritual plant cultivation like sowing and harvesting, so it was considered a basic spell.</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning wanted to learn the oral formulas for other spells, Shi Yao...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, he was no longer willing to teach, only saying that being greedy leads to indigestion, and urged Chu Ning to cultivate the martial arts properly. </p><p></p><p>That day, as usual, Chu Ning and Cao Dongxin came to the field.</p><p></p><p>The red spirit rice grains had grown for two months, becoming plumper and turning completely red, ready for harvesting.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was no longer a complete novice at farming. He knew that this red spirit rice that Cao Dongxin treasured was actually not highly ranked among spirit plants. </p><p></p><p>Except for the lowly servant disciples, cultivators from the Qingxi Sect rarely ate this kind of red spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>This spirit rice was mainly used as miscellaneous grain, with a considerable portion actually used to make food for spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Harvesting this spirit rice could be done with ordinary knives, but it was too slow, so the two of them started employing the Blade Aura technique.</p><p></p><p>The Sweet Dew Technique was a spell that Chu Ning had previously demonstrated more in front of Cao Dongxin, naturally because it was the spell he was least proficient in.</p><p></p><p>Now, Chu Ning was displaying the Blade Aura technique in front of Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin employed the Blade Aura on a row of rice stalks, causing them to fall neatly in a line. Then, with a Purification Technique combined with a Repulsion Technique, he separated the grains from the straw and collected them into a basket.</p><p></p><p>He then turned to look at Chu Ning and, seeing that Chu Ning's Blade Aura had only cut down a few stalks, a slight smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Chu Ning completed Body Refinement in such a short time, it had left a bad taste in Cao Dongxin's mouth.</p><p></p><p>But now, seeing Chu Ning's poor command of the Blade Aura, which was not much better than his own initial attempts, his mind was put considerably at ease.</p><p></p><p>After he finished harvesting his portion for the day, Cao Dongxin said to Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"Harvest this entire plot today, and be sure to complete it."</p><p></p><p>Leaving those words behind, Cao Dongxin slowly walked back to his residence with his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning's Body Refinement was fast, in just three months his cultivation base could not have improved much.</p><p></p><p>Now that his Sweet Dew and Blade Aura techniques were seen to be poorly mastered, his Catalyzing and Purification techniques were naturally unlikely to be much better.</p><p></p><p>With only the first level of Body Refinement, coupled with his inadequate spell cultivation, even if the Sect assigned Chu Ning to farm independently, the fields given would not be very good, nor would their area be large.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that Chu Ning would have a harder time in the coming period compared to himself, Cao Dongxin's mood inexplicably improved.</p><p></p><p>After Cao Dongxin left, Chu Ning continued practicing the Blade Aura technique, not just to meet Cao Dongxin's demand, but because Chu Ning genuinely wanted to get better at this spell in preparation for his own future farming.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was a golden-type spell, so there were no shortcuts for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning's current Blade Aura was much better than what Cao Dongxin had seen earlier.</p><p></p><p>With the augmentation of his third-level Body Refinement spiritual power, even though his Blade Aura cultivation was not superb, harvesting these red spirit rice stalks was more than sufficient.</p><p></p><p>Yes, after over two months of cultivation, Chu Ning had already reached the third level of Body Refinement.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through 100 proficiency in the first level of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill, he entered the second level, and after 200, the third level.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with a thought, Chu Ning could see his cultivation progress in his mind:</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank, Lower Grade), First Level (299/300)]</p><p></p><p>After two months of cultivation, with only 10 days left before the three-month evaluation period, Chu Ning's first level of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill was nearly perfected at 299/300 proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning planned to make a final push tonight to gain that last point of proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when the Nine Ox Body Tempering Art reached full mastery, his talent was refreshed, granting him the Ox Wood Spirit Body.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know what changes would occur when he perfected the first level of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

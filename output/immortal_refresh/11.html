        <h1>Chapter 11</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Those who had not completed the cultivation of absorbing qi into their bodies were left in the main hall, while Chu Ning and others were taken away from the main hall. </p><p></p><p>Afterwards, they were further divided into groups based on cultivating different elemental techniques and spells.</p><p></p><p>The Plant Cultivation Room focused on practicing wood-attributed techniques. There were a total of 5 people, besides Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi, there were another 3 people.</p><p></p><p>A disciple of average build and quite a handsome appearance led the five of them to an open space behind the Cultivation Room, and only then did he speak:</p><p></p><p>"My name is Shi Yao, I am a wood-system technique cultivating disciple of the Cultivation Hall, with a cultivation level of the ninth layer of Qi Refinement."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Shi Yao said this, it immediately caught the attention of the five people.</p><p></p><p>Previously, they had only felt that Shi Yao did not seem imposing, but they had not expected that Shi Yao was actually a powerful expert at the ninth layer of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>Shi Yao saw the expressions on the five people's faces, but did not reveal any overly smug expression. Instead, he calmly said:</p><p></p><p>"You are all newly admitted disciples who have just absorbed qi into your bodies and condensed spiritual power. Let's start with some basic spells first.</p><p></p><p>You must have all heard that the three most basic spells for cultivating spiritual plants are the Catalyzing Spell, the Purification Spell, and the Sweet Rain Spell. The first two are wood-system spells, while the last one is a water-system spell."</p><p></p><p>When Shi Yao said this, one of the other three people named Yuan Guang asked:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the Evergreen Wood Technique we are cultivating is a wood-system technique. Can we also cast water-system spells?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Shi Yao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"After using our spiritual power, we can draw upon the five elemental spiritual qi. Except for very high-level spells or some spells that require a lot of spiritual power, we can cast most spells.</p><p></p><p>However, spells of the same elemental attribute as our technique are more compatible, more powerful, and consume less spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The spells I just mentioned are not too difficult. As long as you have stabilized the first layer of the Evergreen Wood Technique through cultivation, you can cast them."</p><p></p><p>After explaining this, Shi Yao paused, then said to the group:</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will first teach you the Catalyzing Spell. This spell is simpler and will also help you understand the Evergreen Wood Technique."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Shi Yao patted a pouch at his waist, and a grain of rice appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his action, Chu Ning instinctively shifted his gaze to that pouch.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a round-faced female disciple exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Is that a storage pouch?"</p><p></p><p>The other three people also turned their gazes towards it at this moment. In the Spiritual Plant Area, the cultivation levels of servant disciples were low, and their incomes were also low, so they rarely saw such treasures as storage pouches.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that none of the people following Shi Yao had one, so this was the first time they had seen it.</p><p></p><p>Shi Yao nodded but did not answer. Instead, he said to the group:</p><p></p><p>"I will demonstrate the Catalyzing Spell first, and then teach you the incantation and hand seals."</p><p></p><p>With that, he threw the seed onto the ground, rapidly formed a few hand seals, and pointed at the seed.</p><p></p><p>The grain of rice quickly cracked open, and after a moment, a seedling sprouted.</p><p></p><p>"The Catalyzing Spell aids the germination, growth, and development of spiritual plants, but it does not have the ability to change their quality. This is different from the Evergreen Wood Technique."</p><p></p><p>After explaining, Shi Yao began teaching the incantation and hand seals for the Catalyzing Spell.</p><p></p><p>Since Shi Yao determined that everyone had just absorbed qi into their bodies and had not cultivated much spiritual power yet, he did not have them practice the spell.</p><p></p><p>He only had Chu Ning and the others memorize the incantation and practice the hand seals.</p><p></p><p>After a while, when everyone had memorized them, he began sharing some cultivation insights about the Evergreen Wood Technique and the Evergreen Wood Technique.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning listened and gained quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>For example, he learned from Shi Yao that the effects of the Evergreen Wood Technique would improve as one's mastery of the Evergreen Wood Technique deepened.</p><p></p><p>However, the degree of mastery over the Evergreen Wood Technique itself was also crucial. To truly cultivate the Evergreen Wood Technique to perfection, transforming it into an innate ability that could be cast instantly without hand seals, the spiritual power consumed would be...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The power of the Catalyzing Spell was also the weakest. </p><p></p><p>Most other spells were similar in this regard.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning compared his spellcasting with Cao Dong Xin's and realized that they were still quite far from reaching that level.</p><p></p><p>It was normal that he had not reached it yet, after all, he hadn't practiced long enough. </p><p></p><p>Cao Dong Xin had cultivated this spell for decades, yet he still hadn't reached that level either. It had to be said that innate talent was truly crucial in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>After the explanation and discussion, Shi Yao gave each person some rice grains, signaling that they could leave.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stood up, but did not leave with the others. Instead, he went to Shi Yao, cupped his fists in salutation and said, "Senior Martial Brother Shi, I wonder if you could also teach the Purification Spell and the Sweet Rain Spell?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Shi Yao frowned, somewhat displeased, and said, "If I remember correctly, your name is Chu Ning, right? You have just entered the first level of Qi Refining. At your current stage, cultivating your martial arts should be the main focus. Cultivating one spell is already enough, don't bite off more than you can chew."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning hurriedly explained, "Senior Martial Brother has misunderstood. I do not intend to cultivate them right now, I only want to learn them first and comprehend them slowly.</p><p></p><p>My situation is a bit special. The Senior Martial Brother I follow has a rather eccentric temper. The time for me to cultivate martial arts is not long, so I thought I could comprehend spells while doing chores..."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you are following Cao Dong Xin?" Shi Yao suddenly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Chu Ning nodded, unsurprised that Shi Yao knew Cao Dong Xin.</p><p></p><p>Shi Yao was so knowledgeable about the Green Wood Longevity Technique and Green Wood Spring Technique, he must be very familiar with the Spirit Plant Manor.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, Shi Yao said, "I have heard of the deeds of this Cao Dong Xin."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll just teach you the other two spells. But remember, martial arts are the foundation. Solidifying your current realm and advancing to higher realms should be your priority right now."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally agreed repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>So Shi Yao taught Chu Ning the other two spells.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chu Ning leave the Practice Room feeling satisfied and head towards the Spirit Plant Area.</p><p></p><p>What he had said earlier was half-true and half-false. The real reason was that he knew he would cultivate the wood-attributed Catalyzing Spell and Purification Spell very quickly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the progress of his martial arts had stabilized at the first level. In about half a month, he might even cross into the second level.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would then be qualified to cultivate a few more spells.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sweet Rain Spell, he had never tried it before and wanted to experiment with cultivating spells of other attributes.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Cao Dong Xin had started arranging for Chu Ning to clear weeds these past two days, which took up quite some time for Chu Ning. If he cultivated the Purification Spell, it would come in handy.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning returned to the courtyard, and Cao Dong Xin was already back. After lunch, Cao Dong Xin did indeed ask Chu Ning to go to the fields and remove weeds.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning wanted to practice the spells, so he didn't hesitate and went out immediately.</p><p></p><p>In the fields, Chu Ning silently went over the essentials of the Purification Spell in his mind. The next moment, he circulated his spiritual power, locked onto a weed, and cast the spell.</p><p></p><p>The weed was instantly pulled out by a force, a complete success.</p><p></p><p>Although this was because Chu Ning had chosen an area with few weeds, and he didn't control the spiritual power consumption very well, this success rate still made Chu Ning feel amazed.</p><p></p><p>The innate talent of his Ox Wood Spirit Body for cultivating wood-attributed spells was truly formidable. He just didn't know what effect it would have when cultivating higher-level martial arts and spells in the future.</p><p></p><p>Next, Chu Ning tried the Catalyzing Spell again and succeeded as well.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of the catalyzing speed, he naturally could not compare to Shi Yao, a disciple who had received direct transmission.</p><p></p><p>But after spending some time, he did manage to catalyze the growth of the seedlings.</p><p></p><p>Now it was time to try the Sweet Rain Spell.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

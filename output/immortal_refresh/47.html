        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The first step in cultivating the Refining Spirit Technique was to sense the spirit consciousness. </p><p></p><p>This was a basic skill for cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage, but not so easy for those at the Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Chu Ning had tried it once yesterday to test the strength of his spirit consciousness, so he was familiar with it today.</p><p></p><p>As his entire mind sank into the Mud Pill Palace, Chu Ning suddenly felt the surroundings become extremely quiet, able to clearly sense every blade of grass and tree around him. </p><p></p><p>And at the location of the Mud Pill Palace, an invisible energy was slowly rotating.</p><p></p><p>This was the state when cultivating the Refining Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>After who knows how long, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He then immersed his mind into his consciousness, immediately checking the changes in his proficiency levels.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating spirit consciousness through the Refining Spirit Technique was different from his previous Qi and Body Refining cultivation. Chu Ning wanted to see if there would be any proficiency levels appearing.</p><p></p><p>Then he discovered that indeed, a Refining Spirit Technique proficiency had appeared.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Skill (Yellow Rank Lower Grade), Second Layer (244/900)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Volume, Undecaying Bones 2/600] </p><p>[Refining Spirit Technique, First Layer 0/1000]</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating this Refining Spirit Technique is really not easy. My spirit consciousness is twice as strong as a normal cultivator's.</p><p></p><p>But after a night's cultivation, the proficiency hasn't improved at all."</p><p></p><p>According to the methods recorded in the Refining Spirit Technique, when the invisible energy inside the Mud Pill Palace condenses through cultivation into a liquid drop, it is considered truly entering the door.</p><p></p><p>At that point, the spirit consciousness can be extended outwards to sense.</p><p></p><p>And as one's cultivation deepens and the liquid drop grows larger, the range of the extended spirit consciousness also increases.</p><p></p><p>After a night's cultivation, Chu Ning did not sense any signs of his spirit consciousness condensing into liquid, not even much change in that stream of energy.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a very long-term process.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, Chu Ning felt at ease.</p><p></p><p>The spirit consciousness has always been the most difficult thing for cultivators to refine.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Qi Condensation cultivators wouldn't be unable to even touch the door, only Foundation Establishment cultivators could sense, cultivate and use it.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao had cultivated for who knows how many years, yet had only just reached the first layer of the Refining Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning began to ponder another issue - the pattern of the proficiency levels appearing.</p><p></p><p>Based on his recent cultivation, skills could not be displayed, nor could cultivation earn rewards.</p><p></p><p>But now, the ones that could be displayed were Qingmu Changchun Skill, Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, and Refining Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>Corresponding to Qi Refining, Body Refining, and Spirit Refining respectively.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Chu Ning suddenly had some thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He recalled again the rewards refreshed upon reaching full proficiency.</p><p></p><p>When his Qi Refining was refreshed, it was the Yin Wood Spirit Body and Talisman Source Spirit Body.</p><p></p><p>And when the first volume of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual's Undecaying Bones realm was refreshed, it was the innate divine ability Tian Gang Fist.</p><p></p><p>It was the innate secret technique that came with the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>If he deduced based on this, then when the Undecaying Bones realm was fully refreshed, the innate divine ability rewarded would likely also be of this type.</p><p></p><p>And for the first layer of the Refining Spirit Technique being refreshed, would it be an innate divine ability related to spirit consciousness application?</p><p></p><p>Or would it directly turn that Phantom Spirit Thorn into an innate divine ability?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Chu Ning felt he had vaguely figured out the pattern of this cheat's refreshes, and correspondingly felt some anticipation.</p><p></p><p>However, from the current situation, it seemed Chu Ning would not be able to break through in Qi Refining, Body Refining or Spirit Refining anytime soon, which made him feel a bit dejected.</p><p></p><p>Of course, even saying that, he still had to cultivate diligently and do what needed to be done.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning continued carefully nurturing the Ink Bamboo and Purple Ling Grass every day.</p><p></p><p>Accumulating for this season's harvest, and in the blink of an eye, another half month passed.</p><p></p><p>In this half month, Chu Ning's fastest progress was in the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>The Undecaying Bones realm's proficiency was actually increased by him to 50 in just half a month's time.</p><p></p><p>However, these past two days, perhaps because the effects of the Seven Stars Spirit Fruit had been absorbed, the progress in Body Refining had relatively returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it would soon be time again to go exchange talisman papers with Mu Ling once a month, Chu Ning prepared to leave the mountain for a trip.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The market street.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, it was naturally to create the appearance that he went to the market street to buy talisman papers. On the other hand, he also planned to buy some talismans.</p><p></p><p>During the previous fights with Qi Chongmao, the talismans in his hands were almost used up. </p><p></p><p>After two battles, Chu Ning became increasingly aware of the importance of talismans.</p><p></p><p>Especially in his current situation where his cultivation of spells was not extensive and not very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Having talismans on him meant having a few more life-saving measures.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of talismans, Chu Ning felt a little frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Although his talisman source spirit body had been refreshed for more than half a year, he could currently only access talisman paper making.</p><p></p><p>However, he had not yet accessed the art of talisman making itself.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought that after finishing this season's work, he would see if there were other ways to find the method of talisman making.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, this talent would be too wasted.</p><p></p><p>After all, besides needing talismans himself now,</p><p></p><p>The selling price of made talismans was far higher than selling ordinary talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>After putting everything away in his storage bag, just as Chu Ning walked out of the courtyard gate, he stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>Because at the same time, he saw several figures walking out from the neighboring courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Zhuang Yunde whom he recognized in the group, he did not know the others.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at these people's cultivation levels, they seemed to be even higher than Zhuang Yunde's.</p><p></p><p>Especially the stern-faced middle-aged man leading them, he was actually a Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart instantly felt a chill, while his face revealed a hint of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Zhuang Yunde and the others also noticed Chu Ning. Zhuang Yunde spoke first:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, you came out at just the right time. We were about to look for you. This is Zhang Zhishi from the Law Enforcement Hall."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately cupped his hands in salute and slightly bowed, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Zhishi Zhang and all senior martial brothers."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhishi did not respond, only fixing his piercing gaze directly on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, Chu Ning felt an immense pressure coming from him, as if those two eyes wanted to see through him completely.</p><p></p><p>While inwardly startled, Chu Ning's back also felt a slight chill.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this Zhishi Zhang did not maintain it for long before reining in his gaze slightly.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning felt the pressure greatly reduce, he also heard the other's cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"Have you seen Qi Chongmao recently?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Qi?" Chu Ning timely showed a slightly dazed expression:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I have not seen him for some time."</p><p></p><p>Zhang Zhishi's cold voice continued:</p><p></p><p>"When was the last time you saw him? Did you notice anything unusual?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought for a moment before replying:</p><p></p><p>"It was probably over half a month ago. We happened to run into each other outside the courtyard and exchanged greetings. </p><p></p><p>I can't quite remember which specific day, and I didn't notice anything unusual."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Zhang Zhishi let out a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>"You two live right next door to each other, and your spirit fields are even adjacent. Yet you haven't seen him for so many days and didn't even go to his courtyard to check?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhang Zhishi's rather impolite words, a hint of panic showed on Chu Ning's face as he stammered:</p><p></p><p>"This disciple only joined recently and hasn't been here long. Most of the time I'm at the spirit fields tending to the Ink Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>I rarely run into Senior Martial Brother Qi, so I really didn't pay attention."</p><p></p><p>"Zhishi Zhang." Zhuang Yunde then interjected.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning only joined the sect a little over a year ago. He's now in charge of 5 mu of top-grade spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>He does indeed spend most of his time there tending to them."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhuang Yunde's words, Zhang Zhishi's gaze finally shifted away from Chu Ning, though he gave Zhuang Yunde an unsatisfied look.</p><p></p><p>"Your Spirit Plant House doesn't even know when your own servant disciples disappear. I don't know how you all are managing things."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhang Zhishi turned and left, only leaving Chu Ning and Zhuang Yunde standing there.</p><p></p><p>Watching Zhang Zhishi and the Law Enforcement disciples depart, Chu Ning also inwardly heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

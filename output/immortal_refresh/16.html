        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He went to check on his two spirit fields, and after returning, he simply tidied up the courtyard a bit. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning went back to his room and immediately took out the Qingmu Changchun Skill from his embrace.</p><p></p><p>He had been stuck at the perfect third level of Refining Qi for nearly ten days, and now he finally had a skill manual that could help him break through to the fourth level!</p><p></p><p>Upon opening it, Chu Ning indeed saw that this was the complete Qingmu Changchun Skill, containing three levels of techniques that could be cultivated up to the late Refining Qi stage.  </p><p></p><p>What made Chu Ning even more delighted was that there were two spells inside as well.</p><p></p><p>One was the offensive Thorn Technique, while the other was the defensive Rattan Armor Technique.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Qiu Shunyi had accidentally unleashed a Blade Technique, Chu Ning had thought that the auxiliary cultivation techniques he was practicing were all geared towards planting, and he needed one or two life-saving techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Qingmu Changchun Skill unexpectedly came with two techniques, which was certainly a pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Technique could stimulate the power of plants to instantly grow into thorns upon casting. Not only could it entangle and bind the opponent, but the thorns could also continuously inflict damage.</p><p></p><p>As for the Rattan Armor Technique, it could condense a rattan armor shield around the whole body for defense after casting.</p><p></p><p>Although both spells were only initial intermediate-grade, as long as he cultivated them well, he would have a means of preserving his life.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately decided that in addition to improving his main skill, he would also spend more time cultivating these two techniques.</p><p></p><p>For the rest of the afternoon, Chu Ning read through the entire Qingmu Changchun Skill repeatedly, especially memorizing the cultivation method for breaking through to the fourth level.</p><p></p><p>After nightfall, once he was sure no one else would come that day, Chu Ning returned to his room and began practicing.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had already reached the perfect third level of Refining Qi, so now was the perfect time to break through to the fourth level in one go.</p><p></p><p>Following the second level method of the Qingmu Changchun Skill, he rapidly absorbed spiritual energy into his body and guided it into his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The three layers of force rings in his dantian were already unable to hold any more spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>With this influx of energy, it began pressing against the topmost third layer of force.</p><p></p><p>As more and more spiritual energy poured in, that layer of force finally separated out into a thin ring, larger than the third layer.</p><p></p><p>Between these two layers, there was a wispy, intangible strand of force linking them, as if it could break apart at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the state of the forces in his dantian, Chu Ning focused his mind and continued absorbing spiritual energy to solidify his condition.</p><p></p><p>Only after feeling that the fourth force layer and the linking strand had become much more substantial did he finally exhale deeply and exit his cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>The fourth level of Refining Qi - he had entered the middle stage!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled with satisfaction.  </p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know the progress of that spirit root disciple who had directly entered the inner sect in the same selection batch, he believed his own cultivation speed placed him at the forefront among these new disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, as soon as that thought flashed through his mind, he immediately suppressed his smile.</p><p></p><p>There were tens of thousands of Refining Qi disciples at Qingxi Sect. Although his spirit body's talent allowed him to cultivate quickly, his overall strength was still very low, so he had to remain vigilant at all times.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then focused his mind inwards.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Skill (Yellow-rank lower-grade), Second Level (0/900)]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this display, Chu Ning was slightly surprised.  It was understandable that 900 points were needed for full proficiency, but he was caught off guard that his hour-plus of cultivation hadn't raised it by even 1 point.</p><p></p><p>When he had first begun Refining Qi, the first level had immediately gained 1 proficiency point.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Chu Ning realized this made sense - of course advancing to the middle Refining Qi stage required condensing far more energy than the initial stage, so the cultivation speed would naturally be slower.</p><p></p><p>So even with the advantage of his Wood Spirit Body, he couldn't raise the proficiency by 1 point through just this single session of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Having realized this, Chu Ning decided to test it properly to see how long he currently needed to cultivate to increase his proficiency by 1 point. </p><p></p><p>The next morning after a night of silence, Chu Ning cultivated again.</p><p></p><p>His proficiency was still stuck at 0, but Chu Ning wasn't in a hurry. First, he went to his two spirit fields. </p><p></p><p>Considering that Chu Ning and the other new disciples' spell cultivation was still incomplete, the sect had harvested and tilled the spirit fields given to them.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still some weeds that needed to be cleared by themselves. </p><p></p><p>Of course, this benefit was only for this one time. After that, they would have to take full responsibility themselves.</p><p></p><p>Including food, the sect provided rations for everyone for half a year. After half a year, they would need to exchange their harvests for food.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning tidied up the fields, then used a clearing spell to remove the scattered weeds, preparing for the formal planting.</p><p></p><p>Back at his residence, Chu Ning first cooked a pot of rice and simply stir-fried two dishes, solving the lunch issue.</p><p></p><p>What he ate was naturally ordinary rice and vegetables, without even red spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>To get spirit rice, he would have to grow and exchange his own crops.</p><p></p><p>After lunch, Chu Ning began cultivating again. This time, he finally saw a change in his proficiency.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Everspring Art (Yellow Rank Lower Grade), Second Layer (1/900)]</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning calculated in his heart that from yesterday to today, he had cultivated three times in total, which was basically equivalent to a whole day.</p><p></p><p>After all, once he started planting, he would probably only have these three time periods to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Increasing by 1 point per day, it would take 900 days of normal cultivation to reach the sixth layer of Qi Refining perfection.</p><p></p><p>Adding in the time needed to recover from daily spell usage, it would take about three years with some delays in between.</p><p></p><p>"Too slow! Although I have a Tiger Wood Spirit Body, this Green Wood Everspring Art is only a Yellow Rank Lower Grade technique, so the cultivation speed is still too slow."</p><p></p><p>Although others would be extremely envious of this cultivation speed, Chu Ning, who had reached the fourth layer in just three months, was naturally unsatisfied with this progress.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to quickly plant the spirit crops and use the Green Wood Spring Aura Art to aid and increase my cultivation speed!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had a plan in mind - this was currently the fastest way for him to increase his speed.</p><p></p><p>He had originally planned to cultivate the Thorny Vine Art and Rattan Armor Art, but he had to put those thoughts aside for now.</p><p></p><p>His top priority was to use the Catalyzing Art to quickly plant the spirit rice and spirit bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning didn't wait any longer. Taking the spirit rice seeds, he went straight to the 5 mu intermediate spirit field to begin sowing.</p><p></p><p>Since this was his first time planting alone, it was better to start with the simpler spirit rice first.</p><p></p><p>Once he was familiar with spirit rice, he could then plant the more difficult spirit bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the field, he took out a small handful of seeds, over a hundred grains.</p><p></p><p>In fact, with a Qi Refining second layer cultivation, being able to catalyze 20 seeds at once was already the limit.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning was now at the fourth layer of Qi Refining, and his Catalyzing Art was well-cultivated, so he naturally had a significant increase in quantity.</p><p></p><p>With one Catalyzing Art, after a short while, nearly a hundred seeds sprouted into seedlings.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then used a Driving Force Art, and these seedlings directly flew out, evenly landing in the field.</p><p></p><p>His Driving Force Art wasn't very effective for manipulating large objects yet, but it worked much better for things related to wood.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the enhancement from his Tiger Wood Spirit Body was comprehensive.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

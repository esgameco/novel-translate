        <h1>Chapter 86</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Lín Chāngqīng's brows slightly furrowed, while Luò Yīpíng continued speaking:</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Senior Martial Brother Dù mentioned that the number of talisman papers Chǔ Níng brought out could be used to offset the monthly payment. His response was no, but just now, we saw him take out various talisman papers to sell."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Luò Yīpíng's words, Lín Chāngqīng's gaze pierced Chǔ Níng like two sharp swords. </p><p></p><p>Immediately, Chǔ Níng felt the same oppressive feeling of directly facing the Law Enforcement Hall's Officer Zhang resurface.</p><p></p><p>What was slightly unexpected for Chǔ Níng was that this oppressive feeling was not as strong as before.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if it was because Lín Chāngqīng's cultivation was not as high as Officer Zhang's, or if it was because Chǔ Níng's own spiritual awareness had improved.</p><p></p><p>"Dù Hán, is this true?" Lín Chāngqīng looked at Chǔ Níng but asked Dù Hán.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dù Hán looked at Chǔ Níng, his brows also tightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Lín, I did promise that Chǔ Níng would not go to the beast disaster site. Previously, my nephew did ask him about talisman papers. Chǔ Níng's response was that he didn't have any talisman papers on hand."</p><p></p><p>"But we just heard that he sells talismans every day, so he must have sold quite a number," Shēn Zhèngquán casually added a remark from the side.</p><p></p><p>Lín Chāngqīng's gaze continued to stare at Chǔ Níng.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't say anything, Chǔ Níng understood his meaning - he wanted an explanation.</p><p></p><p>Chǔ Níng immediately answered in a deep voice: "In response to the officer, these talismans were drawn by me."</p><p></p><p>Lín Chāngqīng's gaze swept over Chǔ Níng's hands holding the talisman brush, his aura restrained as he calmly asked: "You can create mid-grade elementary talismans?"</p><p></p><p>Chǔ Níng nodded slightly, "With a 40-50% success rate."</p><p></p><p>"Draw one and let me see."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Lín Chāngqīng's words, Chǔ Níng nodded slightly, then gently closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Luò Yīpíng wanted to say something more, but as soon as he opened his mouth, Lín Chāngqīng's piercing gaze suddenly swept over.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Lín Chāngqīng's gaze, Luò Yīpíng immediately closed his mouth.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting his state slightly, Chǔ Níng slowly opened his eyes, dipped the talisman brush in ink again, and began drawing the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Having been provoked repeatedly by Luò Yīpíng, Chǔ Níng was a bit annoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, when his spiritual power truly infused into the talisman brush, his heart became extremely calm.</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to be further entangled in this matter, Chǔ Níng became even more focused at this moment.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the Talisman Source Spirit Body, Chǔ Níng's success rate in creating the Golden Armor Talisman had already reached 60%.</p><p></p><p>After the previous failure, Chǔ Níng did not fail this time.</p><p></p><p>The talisman lines naturally and smoothly appeared from his talisman brush.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, a golden light flashed on the talisman paper, and a mid-grade elementary talisman appeared on the table.</p><p></p><p>It was clearly a Golden Armor Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, before others could speak, Luò Yīpíng's mouth immediately gaped open.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, you... You can create mid-grade elementary talismans? But that's only supposed to be possible for second-grade Talisman Masters."</p><p></p><p>The tall disciple Dīng Bō was also surprised and exclaimed: </p><p></p><p>"Oh, this talisman really was drawn by Senior Martial Brother Chǔ."</p><p></p><p>Not just Luò Yīpíng, the gazes of everyone present towards Chǔ Níng were now extremely astonished.</p><p></p><p>After all, in their view, Chǔ Níng was only at the fourth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>For such a cultivation level to have talisman creation skills reaching that of a second-grade Talisman Master, it made them feel quite unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>Even Lín Chāngqīng's gaze towards Chǔ Níng now held a few hints of surprise.</p><p></p><p>Chǔ Níng didn't say anything, only handing over the talisman he had just drawn along with the ones he took out from his storage pouch to Lín Chāngqīng.</p><p></p><p>After the latter received them and examined them briefly, he handed the two talismans back to Chǔ Níng.</p><p></p><p>He then slowly said: "The quality is the same, it seems your talisman creation skills are quite decent."</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible? He..." </p><p></p><p>This result was clearly far beyond Luò Yīpíng's expectations, to the point where he couldn't help exclaiming again.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lín Chāngqīng frowned and swept his gaze over Luò Yīpíng and Shēn Zhèngquán.</p><p></p><p>He coldly asked: "Are you questioning my judgment? Do you want me to show you those talismans again?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Luò Yīpíng's face immediately turned flushed red, not knowing how to respond.</p><p></p><p>A hint of embarrassment also flashed across Shēn Zhèngquán's face, but he quickly cupped his hands and said: "Since the officer has already appraised them, it must be true. We previously misjudged Senior Martial Brother Chǔ. We hope Senior Martial Brother Chǔ can forgive us."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chǔ Níng's heart felt a slight chill.</p><p></p><p>"This person's craftiness runs deeper. With this, everyone will naturally find it harder to blame him, unlike Luò Yīpíng who just blurts out everything."</p><p></p><p>Before Chǔ Níng could respond, Lín Chāngqīng had already waved his hand dismissively, his expression extremely displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Enough, let this matter rest. You all made such a big fuss over this trivial matter, not even having basic trust among fellow disciples."</p><p></p><p>Upon Lín Chāngqīng's words, many people present immediately showed hints of shame on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Gǔ Xiǎoxíng, Xiè Bō, and others all revealed apologetic expressions towards Chǔ Níng.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Luò Yīpíng was indeed the most vocal in doubting, but didn't they all harbor some suspicion towards Chǔ Níng as well?</p><p></p><p>Lín Chāngqīng's gaze shifted, looking at Luò Yīpíng with great displeasure in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You seem to also be from the Hundred Arts Hall, yet you indiscriminately accused your own junior martial brother. Hmph..."</p><p></p><p>Reprimanded by Lín Chāngqīng, Luò Yīpíng's face alternated between flushed red and pale white.</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth, wanting to say more.</p><p></p><p>However, Lín Chāngqīng did not give him the opportunity, waving his hand as he walked towards Chǔ Níng's shop.</p><p></p><p>"Let's just talk about the beast disaster instead. No need to go elsewhere, we'll do it right here."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing said so, and naturally others followed him inside.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing then took the initiative to say to Chu Ning: </p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, I'm sorry, I really didn't expect your talisman-making skills to have reached this level. Just now..."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, you don't need to say that," Chu Ning immediately interrupted her. </p><p>"Just now, Senior Sister has already given me a lot of guidance."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing nodded slightly, about to say something more, when the tall Ding Bo had already walked over and put his arm around Chu Ning's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, impressive! You can actually make such high-quality initial intermediate-grade talismans."</p><p></p><p>"Earlier, I even thought you were deliberately not giving us talismans."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Ding Bo glanced at Luo Yiping standing beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Luo, what you did was improper and almost caused all of us to wrongly accuse Junior Brother Chu."</p><p></p><p>The normally talkative Luo Yiping's face was fluctuating between red and green at this moment.</p><p>But he didn't open his mouth when facing Ding Bo.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was puzzled about Ding Bo's background, Gu Xiaoqing had already introduced:</p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, this is Senior Brother Ding from the inner sect."</p><p></p><p>So he was a true disciple of the inner sect. Chu Ning understood, no wonder Luo Yiping didn't dare say much.</p><p></p><p>An inner sect true disciple, did he have an earth spiritual root or some other talent?</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking this, Ding Bo had already shouted brazenly:</p><p>"Don't call me Senior Brother. I've only condensed qi to the seventh level. I just happened to have a lightning spiritual root and was accepted into the inner sect."</p><p></p><p>A lightning spiritual root!</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Ding Bo actually had the rare lightning spiritual root, Chu Ning couldn't help but look at him again.</p><p></p><p>This lightning spiritual root was even rarer than an earth spiritual root, already on par with a celestial spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>But Ding Bo seemed completely unconcerned, still speaking brazenly:</p><p>"Haha, let's hurry inside."</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the crowd entered together. </p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan fell behind, and the two with unsightly expressions followed in after everyone else.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crowd come in, Lin Changqing directly spoke:</p><p>"This beast calamity was mainly caused by a third-grade demonic beast equivalent to the mid-foundation establishment stage coming from the Qingxia Mountain Range to this branch range, disturbing these low-grade demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>"That beast has been killed, so the beast calamity should be over. However, there are still some high-grade first-level demonic beasts lingering in this mountain range, so everyone be more careful when going out."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Lin Changqing turned to look at Du Han.</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Although there were more demonic beasts in this beast calamity, and some high-grade first-level ones, the overall level wasn't that high. The sect sent support, how did you all end up in such a sorry state?"</p><p></p><p>Du Han now looked somewhat vexed. "Master Lin, it was mainly because of a group of wandering cultivators. </p><p></p><p>The second day we went there, some wandering cultivators appeared after I left for other places.</p><p></p><p>These wandering cultivators then fought with some junior brothers and sisters over a high-grade first-level demonic beast, resorting to force.</p><p></p><p>If I hadn't happened to return for some matters, those few might have suffered losses."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing's brows furrowed slightly, then he said: "And after that?"</p><p></p><p>"The next two days were normal. We organized the various cultivator clans to defend against them, plus reinforcements came from the sect."</p><p></p><p>Du Han answered, but the anger didn't leave his face.</p><p></p><p>"But then today, some more wandering cultivators appeared to take advantage of the chaos.</p><p></p><p>And this time, there was a wandering cultivator at the ninth level of qi condensation who constrained me.</p><p></p><p>After several days, the various resources on my junior brothers were almost depleted, so they ended up injured.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Master Lin and Senior Brother Ding arrived in time..."</p><p></p><p>From Du Han's words, Chu Ning got a general idea, but his heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>Could those so-called wandering cultivators be the ones who came to the town that night?</p><p></p><p>But at that time, he only saw four people. Could they have had more companions?</p><p></p><p>As he was thinking this, Lin Changqing suddenly laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Wandering cultivators? I don't think so."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Lin Changqing casually waved his hand and took out a storage bag, pouring out a few items from it.</p><p></p><p>Then, Lin Changqing reached out and grabbed one of the iron plate-like objects.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the others looked at Lin Changqing with some puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning, upon seeing this iron plate, felt a sudden jolt.</p><p></p><p>The iron plate wasn't very large, engraved with a pattern composed of seemingly random lines.</p><p></p><p>Although the pattern was extremely crude, Chu Ning immediately recognized it.</p><p></p><p>This pattern was exactly the same as the one on the bamboo slip he had seen in Qi Chongmu's storage bag after killing him.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why is the pattern on this iron plate exactly the same as the one on that bamboo slip from Qi Chongmu?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning was extremely shocked in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't think this was a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned back to Lin Changqing, and Chu Ning waited for this enforcer's next words.</p><p></p><p>"Enforcer, does this look like some kind of identity token?" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Du Han took the initiative to ask.</p><p></p><p>Here there are some modifications to the demonic beast levels, so everyone is aware:</p><p>Today, a reader commented that my classification of demonic beasts was too unclear and hard to compare, so I took a careful look and agreed it made sense to adjust it a bit.</p><p></p><p>First-level demonic beasts are equivalent to the Qi Condensation realm, with low, middle, and high grades corresponding to the early, middle, and late Qi Condensation stages respectively.</p><p></p><p>Second-level demonic beasts are equivalent to the early Foundation Establishment stage. </p><p>Third-level are mid Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Fourth-level are late Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>And so on. Thanks everyone for the valuable feedback.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

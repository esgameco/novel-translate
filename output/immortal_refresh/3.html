        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning heard the sound and peeked over. He saw a middle-aged man in the blue robes of the Qingxi Sect standing at the very front of the line, with a gentle expression.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were deep and ancient, as if able to see through one's heart. Although he maintained a gentle smile on his face, one dared not look at him directly. </p><p></p><p>In his hand, he held a jade testing pillar, and spoke to the person standing at the very front of the line:</p><p></p><p>"Place your hand on it."</p><p></p><p>That person placed their hand on it, but the jade pillar showed no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>"No spiritual root."</p><p></p><p>After the middle-aged man spoke, that person left with a dejected expression.</p><p></p><p>"No spiritual root."</p><p>"No spiritual root."</p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He tested nearly ten people in a row, all of whom had no spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>"It seems there aren't many people with the talent for cultivation," Chu Ning couldn't help but mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of all the people of the same age from the surrounding areas who came to Qingxi City for testing today, it was estimated to be less than one in a thousand. And among the ten people tested so far, not even one had the talent.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that those with spiritual roots suitable for cultivation were truly one in a million.</p><p></p><p>At this point, it was the 11th person's turn. When they placed their hand on it, the jade testing pillar immediately lit up with five colors.</p><p></p><p>"A false five-element spiritual root, which is barely enough for cultivation, I suppose," the middle-aged man said calmly, while the person being tested was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from a few people, the rest who came for testing all looked at that person with envious eyes.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Chu Ning had also inquired and understood that in this cultivation world, single-attribute spiritual roots were called Heavenly Spiritual Roots, dual-attribute were called Earthly Spiritual Roots, and triple-attribute were called True Spiritual Roots.</p><p></p><p>These three types of spiritual roots allowed for very fast cultivation speeds, with the Heavenly Spiritual Root being the fastest.</p><p></p><p>Four-attribute and five-attribute spiritual roots were called False Spiritual Roots, with much slower cultivation speeds.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, sects generally accepted disciples with True Spiritual Roots and above for focused training, while those with False Spiritual Roots were usually taken in as servant disciples to handle miscellaneous chores like planting, raising livestock, mining, etc. while also cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some major sects had even higher standards.</p><p></p><p>But even as servant disciples of a sect, their status was completely separated from ordinary mortals. Especially servant disciples who could cultivate had the opportunity to join the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>There were even occasional servant disciples who obtained opportunities to join the inner sect or go even further.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that even when hearing about a five-element False Spiritual Root, many people were still extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>The testing line continued, and the next 7 people had no spiritual roots at all and were eliminated.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was Chu Ning's turn. He stood before the testing pillar, curiously examining the jade pillar in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Place your hand here," the middle-aged man's voice came.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning placed his hand into the groove with some anticipation. The jade pillar soon lit up, revealing four rays of blue, white, red, and yellow light.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man continued in his calm voice: </p><p></p><p>"A four-element False Spiritual Root of wood, water, fire, and earth."</p><p></p><p>As the middle-aged man's words fell, people around looked over, especially those rejected youths, their eyes filled with indescribable envy and jealousy towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning also had a False Spiritual Root, it was still better than the previous person's.</p><p></p><p>Among the first 19 people in line, Chu Ning was undoubtedly the one with the best talent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's heart was quite unsettled.</p><p></p><p>"Four types of..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The colors should represent the four spiritual roots. The green color should represent the wood attribute. I don't know if it's an illusion, but I always feel that the green light is brighter. Could it be related to my own Tiger Wood spiritual body?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had this thought, Chu Ning did not intend to bring it up. After thanking the middle-aged man, he walked out of the line and went to the group of people who had passed the test under the guidance.  </p><p></p><p>These days, he had heard a lot of information about spiritual roots, but no one had ever talked about spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual body must be a very special existence. Even if it's not my own cheat code, it must be extremely rare. </p><p></p><p>Before figuring out the specifics, I can't casually expose my secret."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The human heart is inscrutable. Keeping a low profile and lying low is the way to survive.</p><p></p><p>The test was still going on. Since there were indeed many people, it took a long time.</p><p></p><p>When the entire test was over, it was already noon.</p><p></p><p>The most sensational event was when someone tested out a dual-attribute earth spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>But this was undoubtedly extremely rare. Not to mention the earth spiritual root, even a three-attribute true spiritual root had only a dozen or so people.</p><p></p><p>Another few dozen people, like Chu Ning, had pseudo spiritual roots.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingxi Sect's selection this time has come to an end. The next selection will open in three years."</p><p></p><p>The voice echoed through the sky, and in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Under the envious gazes of the crowd, Chu Ning and the others who passed the test boarded several spiritual ships in batches, taking off into the air and disappearing in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Those left behind gazed into the sky for a long time, unwilling to leave. Everyone realized that from then on, there would be two paths: immortal and mortal.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>"So this is a magic treasure. Cultivating immortality is indeed miraculous!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning experienced a feeling completely different from flying on a plane in his previous life. As he looked at the figure in the green robe standing on the spiritual ship, he felt an inexplicable excitement and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The other youths' expressions were even more excited and eager.</p><p></p><p>A journey of a hundred miles was traversed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man who had tested Chu Ning earlier piloted the spiritual ship, arriving at the foot of a mountain range in front of a house.</p><p></p><p>Soon, another middle-aged man in his forties with a beard and short stature came out of the house and quickly approached the middle-aged man, respectfully saying:</p><p></p><p>"Elder Chen!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man nodded, then turned to the person and said:</p><p></p><p>"Executor He, these are disciples with four or five attribute pseudo spiritual roots. First, let them train at your Hundred Arts Hall. If there are good seedlings, cultivate them further."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, without waiting for the other party to open his mouth, he turned to Chu Ning and the others and said:</p><p></p><p>"This is Executor He Changyu of the Hundred Arts Hall. He will take you to the Hundred Arts Hall to be servant disciples. The sect will also arrange for people to teach you some basic cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>You must not belittle yourselves or slack off. Cultivate diligently, and one day you will be able to officially cultivate in the sect and step onto the great path."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and the others responded in unison.</p><p></p><p>Elder Chen nodded slightly. Suddenly, a jade slip appeared in his hand, which he handed to He Changyu. Without further ado, he turned and left on the wind, disappearing from everyone's sight in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he left, the originally respectful He Changyu stood up straight, looking at the group of newcomers with an imposing manner, and said:</p><p></p><p>"Now I'll assign you to different rooms - the kitchen room, the spiritual beast room, the spiritual plant room, and so on. Those in different rooms will be responsible for different tasks and cultivate different techniques."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately became serious. For him, the best option was undoubtedly to go to the room where he could cultivate wood-based techniques and spells.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't know what criteria they used for assigning rooms.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

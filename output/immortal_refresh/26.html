        <h1>Chapter 26</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning heard these words, but did not directly agree or refuse. Instead, he had a very puzzled expression on his face and asked, "Can Senior Martial Brother transmit to me the method of talisman paper making? I heard before that this method can only be taught by the sect."</p><p></p><p>"Of course it is taught by the sect," Zhuang Yunde immediately said with a serious expression. "How could I privately transmit this sect's technique?"</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning was puzzled, Zhuang Yunde soon revealed a smile again. </p><p></p><p>"However, as the disciple in charge of the Spiritual Plant Courtyard area, I have the qualification to recommend someone periodically. I can suggest to Deacon He and the Academy of Hundreds of Arts to teach one servant disciple a skill."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the recommendation is successful, that disciple can learn to make talisman paper using the spiritual plants they grow themselves. If they can master it, they can also apply to the sect to take on talisman paper making tasks."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Zhuang Yunde looked at Chu Ning with appreciation.</p><p></p><p>"For ordinary talisman paper, besides the quality of the ink bamboo, the key to making it is the purification technique to remove impurities from the pulp and the exorcism technique. I observe that Junior Martial Brother Chu has an exceptional talent for wood-based techniques, so I think highly of Junior Martial Brother's ability to learn this talisman paper making technique."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning finally understood what was going on after hearing this. This Senior Martial Brother Zhuang was actually trying to make a pay-to-play deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde's words already revealed his obvious intention. This recommendation qualification was in his hands, and he could recommend Chu Ning or someone else. After all, learning a skill from the Academy of Hundreds of Arts was not limited to just talisman paper making, it could be other skills too.</p><p></p><p>So Zhuang Yunde first picked those he thought could succeed in learning, because only then could he profit from it.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that before this, Chu Ning was just one of the candidates he had chosen.</p><p></p><p>But after seeing the quality of the ink bamboo Chu Ning cultivated, his ranking rose to first place.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this qualification could be given to Chu Ning, it was obviously dependent on whether Chu Ning would agree to give him that one-tenth reward.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning never expected to encounter a pay-to-play deal in this cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>And all of this was apparently within the rules of the sect, or perhaps the sect actually knew about the existence of such practices and even tacitly approved of them.</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking it over, Chu Ning realized that this was actually a win-win situation.</p><p></p><p>While Zhuang Yunde would profit from it, if Chu Ning could learn the talisman paper making technique, the benefits to himself would be even greater.</p><p></p><p>After all, he also had the innate talisman source spirit body talent.</p><p></p><p>Since he had a talent and higher chance of success in talisman making, there was no reason he wouldn't have an advantage in the more basic talisman paper making technique.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning immediately showed a grateful expression and said, "If that's the case, then thank you Senior Martial Brother for your kindness."</p><p></p><p>When Zhuang Yunde heard this, the smile on his face grew even more.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother shouldn't say that, this is a mutually beneficial arrangement. After going back, I'll recommend you right away. Since this recommendation needs to be made some time in advance, sometimes Deacon He also needs to come see the quality of your spiritual plants again, so a few months' lead time is needed."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded to show he understood.</p><p></p><p>The two then walked towards Chu Ning's courtyard, chatting and laughing along the way.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning recalled the matter he had planned to investigate a couple of days ago, and his heart moved.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhuang Yunde's cultivation level and status might not be comparable to Shi Yao from the Technique Transmission Hall, his experience and knowledge might not be inferior.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, from his words, he seemed more likely to be able to obtain information.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning deliberately brought up the topic and said, "Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, a few days ago I went to the market with some other martial brothers and sisters, and it really opened my eyes. In that market, there were all kinds of rare and exotic treasures, many spiritual plants and magic tools that I had never even heard of. I don't know if there is any place in our sect where we can learn more information."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Zhuang Yunde nodded. "The Technique Transmission Hall in our sect has a library repository. The inner repository is mainly about cultivation techniques and spells, while the outer repository contains miscellaneous records and strange tales."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was about to inquire further, but Zhuang Yunde's next sentence was like a bucket of cold water poured on him.</p><p></p><p>"The management of the outer repository is not strict, any outer sect disciple can go and read."</p><p></p><p>"Outer sect disciple!" Chu Ning heard this and let out a light sigh, it seemed he was out of luck.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Zhuang Yunde continued, "Junior Martial Brother, if you don't know what kind of books you want to read, I can borrow some for you."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's eyes lit up after listening. What he wanted to know most was information about the Seven Star Spirit Fruit and the Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique. </p><p></p><p>However, it was obvious that for a normally curious person, it would be more reasonable to choose only one topic.</p><p></p><p>After quickly comparing them in his heart, Chu Ning made up his mind and said:</p><p></p><p>"I mainly want to learn some knowledge about various spirit plants, since I am now affiliated with the Spirit Plant Hall. I did see some before in the Skill Transference Chamber, but those were quite ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"It seems Junior Brother mainly wants to learn about some rarer spirit plants and spirit medicines." Zhuang Yunde smiled and readily agreed. </p><p></p><p>"I'll go look, and if there are suitable ones, I'll lend them to Junior Brother to read."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally thanked him profusely again. After chatting idly for a while, he soon arrived outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After a slight inner struggle, Chu Ning still chose to continue asking:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, there is one thing I don't understand. I've heard that some cultivators take the path of body refining, reaching profoundly high levels, but it seems very rare now."</p><p></p><p>"Body refining?" Zhuang Yunde smiled and shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"It is indeed very rare now. It is said that in ancient times, everyone was mortal. After spiritual qi was born in the world, some people with extraordinary talents completed the process of guiding qi into their bodies through body refining, becoming cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Then, people imitated this method and tried to refine their bodies in various ways. Some became cultivators, but they never had a complete cultivation method. Even those who became cultivators could only let the spiritual qi circulate freely within their bodies after refining, forming a path of qi circulation suitable for themselves.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, more and more people joined the ranks of cultivators through body refining. An exceptionally talented person created the 'Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique.' It spread throughout the world, and the body refining trend reached its peak."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not expect to hear this name directly from Zhuang Yunde, and he couldn't help muttering it out loud.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde nodded and said, "This Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique is known as the greatest body refining method of all time, with excellent refining effects. </p><p></p><p>However, later on, more and more people created different cultivation methods based on the paths of qi circulation, which is our current method of guiding qi into the body through qi refining.</p><p></p><p>These methods could guide qi into the body and enter the qi refining stage faster, so fewer people practiced body refining.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, these body refining techniques were lost. The most widely spread 'Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique' has been passed down, and there are many versions circulating outside.</p><p></p><p>But very few people practice it because many places only have incomplete fragments."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde paused and continued:</p><p></p><p>"It is said that this body refining method has an extremely difficult bottleneck to break through, requiring the assistance of heavenly materials and treasures. The difficulty far exceeds that of ordinary cultivation methods by several times. Even if there are still some body refiners now, they are not practicing these ancient body refining techniques.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they rely on external forces, with senior elders from sects of higher cultivation levels using their powers to help temper their bodies. Their strength is indeed higher than that of ordinary cultivators."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Zhuang Yunde's expression became somewhat serious.</p><p></p><p>"If Junior Brother encounters such cultivators in the future, you need to be cautious and careful."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother, for the reminder," Chu Ning responded and lightly flattered him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is indeed knowledgeable to know about these things."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a smile appeared on Zhuang Yunde's face as he said:</p><p></p><p>"Some of it I heard from the Sect Leader, and some I read from miscellaneous records. To be honest with Junior Brother, I actually quite enjoy learning about these miscellaneous things, which is why my cultivation progress is slow."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right." Zhuang Yunde seemed to have remembered something.</p><p></p><p>"This information about body refining, I saw it in an ancient book in the sect. But since I'm not interested in it, I didn't bother to remember much. If Junior Brother is interested, I can bring it along for you to take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Then thank you, Senior Brother," Chu Ning said gratefully after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"After Senior Brother's explanation, I feel I should learn more about this, so I won't be at a loss if I encounter such cultivators in the future."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because he saw that Chu Ning was also very interested in these miscellaneous records, Zhuang Yunde felt a sense of kinship. After chatting for a few more sentences, he left.</p><p></p><p>The next day, when Zhuang Yunde came to the Ding District on business, he faithfully brought two jade slips containing the contents of the two books that Chu Ning wanted to read.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

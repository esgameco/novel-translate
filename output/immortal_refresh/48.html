        <h1>Chapter 48</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning raised his head again to look at Zhuang Yunde. </p><p></p><p>He found that after Zhang Zhishi and the others had walked away, the other party also seemed to have heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Zhuang Yunde turned his head and smiled at Chu Ning, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Finally they're gone. In our sect, the Law Enforcement Hall is the one everyone least wants to see. They make a big deal out of even small matters."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning also revealed a slight smile, but felt greatly amused in his heart. </p><p></p><p>This Zhuang Yunde was probably not afraid of the Law Enforcement Hall because of Qi Chongmao or anything else. </p><p></p><p>It was likely because of the transactions he had with the servant disciples.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, although Chu Ning guessed this in his heart, he naturally would not say it out loud. Instead, he asked with some curiosity:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, who is this Senior Martial Brother Qi?"</p><p></p><p>"Missing," Zhuang Yunde said in an unconcerned manner.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big deal. Our servant disciples occasionally go missing, one or two at a time. Some may have run away, some may have met with an accident."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then asked with some doubt: "Will the sect keep investigating?"</p><p></p><p>"You're thinking too much," Zhuang Yunde said with a curl of his lips. </p><p></p><p>"He's just a servant disciple. If he's missing, he's missing. The Law Enforcement Hall will come and go through the motions each time, but they generally can't find anything out. </p><p></p><p>It's just that every time something like this happens, their patrols will increase a bit on the road from the mountain gate to the town."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Zhuang Yunde smiled at Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"For you all, it's actually a good thing. Going in and out of the mountain gate will be safer. </p><p></p><p>But you don't need to worry too much either. Normally, there are very few rogue cultivators around our Green Creek Sect."</p><p></p><p>"I think it's very likely that Qi Chongmao just ran away secretly."</p><p></p><p>"Ran away secretly?" Chu Ning exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled and explained: </p><p></p><p>"Yeah, some servant disciples in the sect feel that the life is too harsh, and on top of that they have no hope of reaching the Great Path, so they run away secretly.</p><p></p><p>They go to some small cultivating clan or even the mortal world to live as a kept person.</p><p></p><p>But for these people, as long as they leave some traces behind, there's a chance the Law Enforcement Hall will investigate them, and the consequence of that...</p><p></p><p>Heh, it's really stupid."</p><p></p><p>After listening, Chu Ning revealed an expression of sudden realization and sighing. In his heart, he also muttered to himself:</p><p></p><p>"This Qi Chongmao will never be found by the sect, because he has already turned to ashes."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde did not linger for long. After chatting idly for a few sentences, he left directly.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Chu Ning slowly walked towards the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>In the previous half month, he was still somewhat worried that Qi Chongmao's matter would be discovered, but now he had completely let go of that concern.</p><p></p><p>If it was as Zhuang Yunde said, the sect would not investigate Qi Chongmao's disappearance too thoroughly internally.</p><p></p><p>As for the Law Enforcement Hall's external investigation, it had nothing to do with Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the mountain gate and meeting up with Qiu Shunyi and Lv Xingyuan who were already waiting there, Chu Ning headed towards Green River Town.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Chu Ning did indeed see more disciples from the Law Enforcement Hall, but he was completely unconcerned in his heart. In fact, he felt more relieved.</p><p></p><p>At least when they returned from buying things in the town, the journey back would not require being so apprehensive.</p><p></p><p>In fact, the road from Green Creek Sect to the town was still very safe.</p><p></p><p>There were junior disciples going back and forth every day, but it was extremely rare for any accidents to occur.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Chu Ning had experienced one incident before, so he was more cautious.</p><p></p><p>The auction at Cloud Sea Pavilion happened once every two months, so Chu Ning felt that the town was noticeably less lively than last month.</p><p></p><p>The few of them also did not spend as much time there.</p><p></p><p>After a simple look around, Chu Ning bought some talisman papers and a few talisman manuals, and then returned to the sect.</p><p></p><p>Bidding farewell to Qiu Shunyi and the others, Chu Ning went straight to the outer gate.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had been to the outer gate a few times and was quite familiar with it, but this was his first time entering the courtyard where Mu Ling lived.</p><p></p><p>The first time Chu Ning met her, he was robbed by Mu Ling on the road.</p><p></p><p>Last month, Chu Ning had just delivered...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Just outside the courtyard, he happened to run into the other party, but didn't go in. This time, he truly entered the interior. </p><p></p><p>"You came at the right time, I'm almost out of talisman papers on this side," said Mu Ling as she led Chu Ning into the room, looking quite anxious.</p><p></p><p>She had left her storage bag in the talisman making room earlier, so she didn't bring it out.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning followed her in, he was dumbstruck on the spot.</p><p></p><p>He saw that this room, which looked like a study, had a table right in the middle. </p><p></p><p>On top were talisman brushes, specialized talisman ink, several books, and stacks of talisman papers - both completed talisman slips and blank papers.</p><p></p><p>However, these were not the reasons for Chu Ning's expression. The real reason was the piles of ashes scattered all over the study floor.</p><p></p><p>Even without experiencing it himself, Chu Ning could guess that those were the ashes from failed, self-combusted talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling seemed to realize this too, letting out a light "ah" before saying:  </p><p></p><p>"Ah yes, the talisman I was studying today was quite difficult to make, wasting quite a few papers.</p><p></p><p>Wait a moment, let me tidy up."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Mu Ling's nonchalant tone, the corner of Chu Ning's eye twitched slightly.</p><p></p><p>So these were just the wasted papers from today, and she seemed to treat it as normal?</p><p></p><p>This young lady wasn't making talismans, she was burning paper!</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning thought this, Mu Ling flipped through the papers on the table and took out two talisman slips.</p><p></p><p>"Found them, cleaning talismans."</p><p></p><p>As soon as she finished speaking, Mu Ling directly activated and threw out the two slips.</p><p></p><p>Her extravagant action made the corner of Chu Ning's eye twitch again.</p><p></p><p>Even he could now perform a simple spell like cleaning magic. Surely Mu Ling wasn't incapable of it?</p><p></p><p>To use talisman slips for something like this?</p><p></p><p>The world of the wealthy really was incomprehensible to the poor.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Mu Ling looked at the now clean room after casting the cleaning spell and clapped her hands, quite satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"It's much cleaner now. </p><p></p><p>Oh right, take out the talisman papers you bought and put them here."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Mu Ling pointed at the table in front of her.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then took out the 1000 "bought" talisman papers from his storage bag and placed them on the table.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling picked up a few papers, looked them over, and nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the quality is still good. These are the spirit stones for buying papers next month."</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling said as she took 22 spirit stones from her bag and handed them to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Chu Ning's gaze was completely drawn to the few books on the table, forgetting to take the stones.</p><p></p><p><Introduction to Talisman Slips></p><p><Thirteen Low-Grade Basic Talismans>  </p><p><Fundamentals of Basic Talismans></p><p><Spirit Talisman Slips></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The talisman creation techniques Chu Ning had long wanted were right there on the table, a full four or five books worth.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling followed Chu Ning's gaze over.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his eyes fixed on those books, her bright eyes also lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Junior Martial Brother Chu, you're interested in these talismans too?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning snapped out of it and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I currently know how to make talisman papers, and I'm indeed looking for a chance to learn talisman creation."</p><p></p><p>"I can teach you," Mu Ling said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning looked up in surprise, Mu Ling shook her head again:</p><p></p><p>"Ah no, these talisman techniques were given to me by my great-aunt from our sect.</p><p></p><p>The sect has rules, I can't casually teach them to you.</p><p></p><p>Oh, I have an idea..."</p><p></p><p>Night, 8pm update with another chapter~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

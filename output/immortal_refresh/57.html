        <h1>Chapter 57</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Because he didn't want to run into Lu Hongping and Lu Yunfang next door, Chu Ning deliberately chose to set off earlier, arriving at the practice ground before the other two.</p><p></p><p>The practice ground and the cultivation room were in the same place, not far from the spirit plant cultivation area. </p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning arrived, there were already some people sitting in the practice ground. However, to Chu Ning, these people were undoubtedly unfamiliar faces, so naturally there was no need to greet them.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took a look and found that there were many vacant spots in the practice ground. Not sure if the positions in the practice ground had any order, in order to avoid unnecessary trouble, he chose a spot in the corner to sit down.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Lu Ming, Chen Jinhua and others who were promoted together with him the day before also arrived. Seeing Chu Ning's position, they also came and sat nearby.</p><p></p><p>The six newly promoted disciples occupied the corner, which also drew occasional glances from some other disciples. However, everyone seemed to know about this promotion matter, so they were not too surprised.</p><p></p><p>As disciples gradually arrived, the practice ground quickly filled up with about two hundred people.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning looked at these people with a more serious expression on his face. In this practice ground, apart from himself, the lowest cultivation level was the sixth layer of Qi Refining, and apart from the few newly promoted disciples around him, there were only a handful of disciples at the sixth layer of Qi Refining among the rest.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning thought about it and felt it was normal. The C District was not like the outer sect, where there were some disciples with good talents but had just joined recently.</p><p></p><p>All the disciples in the C District were promoted from the D District's menial disciples, their talents were not high, and they could not be promoted without a certain level of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Even with my true cultivation at the fifth layer of Qi Refining, I am at the bottom in this C District," Chu Ning muttered to himself. Moreover, his current exposed cultivation level was only the fourth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he was not surprised why everyone was so astonished when he was promoted yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was observing, the entire practice ground suddenly became much quieter. It turned out that He Changyou had entered the practice ground and sat in the front.</p><p></p><p>"Today, all the disciples of the C District are gathered here for one matter," He Changyou spoke in the same straightforward manner as the day before.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, the sect plans to increase the training of menial disciples and select some talented ones to teach them the techniques of cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone in the practice ground was slightly stunned at first, and then their faces showed delight. After all, before this, even for the C District disciples, apart from cultivating spirit plants, only a few could undertake basic work in the Academy of a Hundred Arts.</p><p></p><p>Like Chu Ning, who was responsible for making talisman papers, this was one such task. Now, hearing that they could truly cultivate, everyone was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"So it's true!" At this moment, Chu Ning's eyes were extremely bright. The information that Mu Ling had revealed to him earlier turned out to be true, and what Chu Ning didn't expect was that everything happened so quickly â€“ it was officially announced on the second day after he was promoted to the C District.</p><p></p><p>"Among the myriad arts of cultivation, the most important are undoubtedly pills, talismans, artifacts, and formations," He Changyou continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Most of us in the Spirit Plant House cultivate wood-attributed martial arts, and among these four, talisman making is the most suitable. Of course, if you are confident in the other skills, you can also choose them and tell me individually later."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, He Changyou released a stack of papers from his hand. As he casually flicked his wrist, the papers separated into individual sheets and flew in front of each person.</p><p></p><p>"The sect's classics are precious, so naturally not everyone can be taught the art of talisman making. This is a set of instructions for making the basic low-grade Wood Escape Talisman..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"After everyone takes it back, practice for five days. </p><p></p><p>Five days later, the ten people with the highest quality talisman-making and highest success rate can receive the teachings of talisman-making."</p><p></p><p>As soon as He Changyou said this, it immediately caused a stir in the practice ground.</p><p></p><p>"Five days? This Wood Evasion Talisman is just an entry-level low-grade talisman, yet it cannot be mastered in just five days. Moreover, there needs to be a certain success rate."</p><p></p><p>"We've never learned talisman-making before, and now we're expected to learn this Wood Evasion Talisman in just five days? That's too difficult."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>The discussions among the crowd naturally reached He Changyou's ears. His expression turned somewhat unpleasant, and he scanned the crowd before calmly saying:</p><p></p><p>"You seem to have forgotten what I said at the beginning - the sect is selecting people with talent. If you feel you don't have talent and are unwilling to spend these five days trying, you can return this talisman-making method to me."</p><p></p><p>As He Changyou finished speaking, the scene immediately fell silent, and no one spoke up again. Seeing this, He Changyou got up to leave, but as he was about to depart, he paused and turned to look at the crowd again.</p><p></p><p>"Those who do not achieve a 20% success rate after five days will not participate in the evaluation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, everyone looked at each other in dismay. 20%? They needed to achieve a 20% success rate within five days?</p><p></p><p>Although they had never made talismans before, they understood a little about it. Even for talisman makers who frequently crafted familiar talismans, their success rate was only around 40-50%. As for those who could achieve over 60%, that was considered an absolute talent.</p><p></p><p>After He Changyou left, the practice ground was filled with sighs. At this time, the disciple who had been standing behind He Changyou without speaking, a young man around 28 or 29 years old, slowly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to purchase talisman pens and talisman ink from the sect, you can come to me. One talisman pen, one box of talisman ink, and 50 talisman papers cost 12 spirit stones per set."</p><p></p><p>As the young man's voice fell, the crowd in the practice ground immediately erupted.</p><p></p><p>"12 spirit stones, that's so expensive!"</p><p></p><p>To the side, Jiang Dawei, who had been promoted along with Chu Ning, had an unpleasant expression on his face. Clearly, for those who had just come up from Area D, 12 spirit stones was not a small amount.</p><p></p><p>Even for Jiang Dawei, who was better at cultivating spirit fields than others, this was the income from an entire season's harvest. After all, not everyone could easily earn money through talisman papers like Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even the disciples who were originally from Area C now had pained expressions.</p><p></p><p>A fair-skinned, scholarly-looking person was the first to call out.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Liu, the sect is testing us, yet we have to buy our own talisman pens and ink? And it's so expensive..."</p><p></p><p>"Take it or leave it," the disciple called Senior Brother Liu directly cut him off.</p><p></p><p>This immediately caused the disciple's expression to freeze.</p><p></p><p>Soon, other disciples stood up and went to the disciple named Liu to purchase talisman pens and ink.</p><p></p><p>Once someone took the lead, others followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning had already made up his mind, he didn't rush to be the first in line upon seeing this. First, he saw Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang unhesitatingly join the queue. Then, after about twenty people had separated them, he finally stood up with a complicated, troubled expression and joined the end of the line.</p><p></p><p>Just 12 spirit stones, where couldn't he buy them?</p><p></p><p>What made Chu Ning a little excited was that he finally had the opportunity to truly begin talisman-making!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day, Zhuang Yunde indeed appeared on time outside the courtyard, just as Chu Ning had expected. </p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu, I've come to collect the Inkbamboo."</p><p></p><p>"Please come in, Senior Martial Brother Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning led him into the courtyard to where he had piled the Inkbamboo.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Inkbamboo in the courtyard, Senior Martial Brother Zhuang's smile grew even broader.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Junior Martial Brother has already separated the portion to be handed over to the Sect. To be able to grow Inkbamboo of such quality in your first year joining the Sect, your talent for cultivating spirit plants is truly remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The smile on Zhuang Yunde's face was very sincere. After all, when he saw this pile of Inkbamboo, he felt as if he could see another portion going into his own pocket.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning understood the meaning behind Zhuang Yunde's smile. Taking advantage of his good mood, Chu Ning tentatively voiced his idea.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, I don't know if the Sect allows any flexibility in terms of handing over the Inkbamboo harvest, such as submitting talisman papers instead?"</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Originally smiling, Zhuang Yunde looked at Chu Ning with some bewilderment upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"What does Junior Martial Brother mean? Could it be that Junior Martial Brother wants to make all these Inkbamboo into talisman papers before handing them over to the Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly, "That's exactly what I mean."</p><p></p><p>Knowing Zhuang Yunde would ask, Chu Ning explained the reasoning he had already prepared.</p><p></p><p>"To be honest with you Senior Martial Brother, I do want to try my hand at the art of talisman paper making. However, if I only use the small amount of bamboo I have left, factoring in the initial practice wastage, the talisman papers I can actually produce may not be many. But if I can use all these Inkbamboo to make talisman papers, it would be different. As the saying goes, 'practice makes perfect.' I believe that in the later stages, my talisman paper making skills will become more proficient and the success rate higher."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhuang Yunde understood Chu Ning's intention - he wanted to use more practice to offset the initial wastage. </p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment before saying seriously:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother's idea is indeed good. However, the premise is that you are truly able to master the talisman paper making technique and produce enough papers. The Sect will not consider the possibility of failure. If you cannot hand in enough talisman papers on time, you will have to hand over an additional twenty percent from next year's harvest."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Zhuang Yunde's words, Chu Ning knew there was a high chance of success. As an insider, Zhuang Yunde was well aware that this would not be an issue for him.</p><p></p><p>So he was immediately delighted inwardly, but outwardly showed a conflicted expression.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered for a while with a troubled look, then gritted his teeth and nodded, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, I still want to give it a try. If I don't practice more, this season's Inkbamboo harvest will have been grown in vain."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde didn't say anything more, then calmly calculated for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"If we convert the amount of Inkbamboo to be handed over to the Sect into talisman papers, in the ideal scenario you could probably make around 5,000 sheets. However, even for the skilled talisman makers of the Baiyi Hall, there are bound to be some mishaps, so we generally estimate around seventy to eighty percent output. Since you're a newcomer with such ambition, I can apply to the Sect to perhaps count it as seventy percent of the required amount."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning naturally expressed his gratitude profusely. He was quite familiar with Zhuang Yunde and knew he wouldn't make such an offer without confidence.</p><p></p><p>As for the market price of ordinary talisman papers, Chu Ning had already investigated it. Currently, fifty sheets could be sold for around one spirit stone on the market. Of course, if the shops were buying them back, it would probably take fifty-five to sixty sheets to exchange for one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>But either way, if Zhuang Yunde could truly get the approval, handing over ten percent less would mean earning nearly ten extra spirit stones for himself.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't forget about their deal, so he asked casually:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhuang, I don't know if you prefer spirit ink bamboo or talisman papers?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde, who had not mentioned the transaction between the two parties, felt extremely satisfied when he heard Chu Ning bring it up proactively. </p><p></p><p>This junior brother was undoubtedly still very capable.</p><p></p><p>"Recently, this storage bag has been somewhat insufficient. The spirit ink bamboo may not fit very well. If there are talisman papers, that would naturally be even better."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately promised, "Rest assured, Brother Zhuang, I will reserve 550 talisman papers first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Chu Ning did not give a discounted amount based on the quantity to be handed over to the sect, but instead added another 10% on top of 500, Zhuang Yunde was naturally even more satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, rest assured, I will try my best to request from the sect to allow you to hand in your harvest later, so you can feel free to experiment more."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Zhuang Yunde bid farewell and left.</p><p></p><p>After seeing him off, Chu Ning turned and went back to the courtyard, his face full of smiles.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde only thought that as a newcomer, Chu Ning needed practice in making talisman papers, which would require a lot of wastage.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that Chu Ning had already mastered the method of making talisman papers, and with the enhancement of the talisman spirit body, his success rate far exceeded ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, with the pile of spirit ink bamboo Chu Ning had, the number of talisman papers he could produce would naturally exceed 80%.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Chu Ning received a voice transmission talisman from Zhuang Yunde. The sect had agreed to let him use talisman papers to offset the spirit ink bamboo, calculated at 70%.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Chu Ning completely put his mind at ease and began to focus on making talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>The spirit ink bamboo he had was divided into two categories. One was the portion originally meant to be handed over to the sect.</p><p></p><p>This category had less application of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, more impurities, and consequently less pulp that could be obtained.</p><p></p><p>The other category was what Chu Ning had originally prepared for himself to make talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>This portion had fewer impurities and could yield more pulp, allowing him to make more talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>After about twenty days of dedicated work making talisman papers, Chu Ning looked at the piles of talisman papers in his room, his face filled with a joyful expression of accomplishment.</p><p></p><p>During these nearly twenty days of making talisman papers, although Chu Ning occasionally made mistakes, his success rate was frighteningly high under the enhancement of the talisman spirit body.</p><p></p><p>From the pile of spirit ink bamboo meant to be handed over to the sect, Chu Ning had produced a total of 4,800 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>As for the higher-quality spirit ink bamboo, Chu Ning had produced a total of 6,000 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Together, Chu Ning now had more than 10,000 talisman papers in front of him!</p><p></p><p>After deducting the 3,500 talisman papers to be handed over to the sect and the 550 talisman papers to be shared with Zhuang Yunde, Chu Ning still had 6,750 talisman papers left for himself.</p><p></p><p>That was worth more than a hundred low-grade spirit stones. Chu Ning had never been so wealthy before.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning immediately took out a spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had obtained spirit stones from Old Man Sun and a bandit cultivator, leaving him with 3 low-grade spirit stones that he had not used.</p><p></p><p>Since he did not have many spirit stones, Chu Ning had not used them for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, Chu Ning was ready to indulge himself.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Technique (Yellow Rank, Low-Grade), Second Layer (198/900)]</p><p></p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Volume, Immortal Skin 133/300]</p><p></p><p>After checking his progress, Chu Ning grasped the spirit stone and closed his eyes to begin cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The proficiency of the second layer of the Green Wood Evergreen Technique was 198, but Chu Ning vaguely felt that his fourth layer of Qi Refining realm had reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>If his guess was correct, once his proficiency reached 200, he was highly likely to achieve the fifth layer of Qi Refining realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

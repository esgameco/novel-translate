        <h1>Chapter 34</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At first, upon hearing this coquettish voice, Chu Ning did not realize it was calling him. </p><p></p><p>Until the other party spoke again.</p><p></p><p>"Excuse me, are you Junior Brother Chu Ning from the Spirit Plant House? Could you stop for a moment please."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning raised his head in astonishment. </p><p></p><p>He saw a petite and exquisite female disciple, wearing a blue sect robe, rapidly walking towards him from not far away on the right.</p><p></p><p>Although small in stature, her chest was full and ample in size.  </p><p></p><p>The female disciple came up to Chu Ning, slightly tilted her head up and smiled, asking: </p><p></p><p>"Are you Junior Brother Chu Ning from the Spirit Plant House?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning found it strange how she recognized him, so he just nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'm Mu Ling, also a disciple of the Hundred Arts Hall. Senior Brother Zhuang Yunde asked me to wait for you here."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the petite girl's words, Chu Ning finally realized and cupped his fist, slightly bowing his head to say:</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Sister Mu."</p><p></p><p>With this bow, he happened to see Mu Ling's bright shining eyes staring at him intently. Chu Ning couldn't help but silently wonder to himself:</p><p></p><p>Why does this senior sister seem so interested in me?</p><p></p><p>But with just my third level of Qi refinement, there's no reason for her interest.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chu Ning's sense of Qi could not discern her depth, which was clearly above the sixth level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>As he pondered this, Mu Ling had already swiftly opened her mouth to say:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, did you come to submit talisman papers as the harvest from the Ink Bamboo?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded again, now believing that Zhuang Yunde had indeed informed her about him.</p><p></p><p>"Then it's perfect, just hand the talisman papers to me. Senior Brother Zhuang is out right now, it's the same giving them to me."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Mu Ling stared at the cloth bag Chu Ning was holding, stretching out her little hand with an eager expression.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately became wary, his face showing difficulty as he said:</p><p></p><p>"This...Senior Sister, Senior Brother Zhuang specifically instructed that these talisman papers must be handed to him personally to offset against the harvest owed to the Hall."</p><p></p><p>"It's still offsetting the harvest if you give them to me," Mu Ling glared her pretty brows.</p><p></p><p>"You can't possibly think I would take advantage of a newly joined junior brother like you."</p><p></p><p>That's not necessarily true.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought to himself, feeling that something seemed amiss about this.</p><p></p><p>However, he was absolutely unwilling to just hand over the papers to Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>Leaving aside whether Mu Ling was really from the Hundred Arts Hall or not, which he wasn't clear about.</p><p></p><p>Even if she was, what if after getting the papers from him, she didn't submit them to the Hall, or submitted less than the full amount?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister would certainly not bully a newly joined junior brother like me. It's just that I've not long joined the sect, so I'm really not familiar with these rules.</p><p></p><p>I'll come back another day when Senior Brother Zhuang is here instead, and not trouble you, Senior Sister."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's words, Mu Ling's face immediately showed a pouty, inflated expression that admittedly looked quite cute.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally saw it too, but thinking about her designs on his talisman papers, he didn't find it cute at all.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, however, Mu Ling swiftly dropped the pouty look and instead showed a sweet smile.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, how about this? I won't take the talisman papers you need to submit to offset the sect harvest. But you must have spare papers too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was about to open his mouth, Mu Ling's black, bright eyes stared straight at him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't say you don't have any, or else I'll take them by force."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's expression immediately changed slightly, and his hand gripping the cloth bag tightened somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling's cultivation level was clearly higher than his.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, she brazenly stated she would rob him, showing every intention of taking action.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This gave him quite a headache. </p><p></p><p>Seeing that her threat was effective, a hint of smugness appeared on Muling's face as she continued:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't ask for it for free. I'll pay you spirit stones. If you turn in the talisman papers to the sect for recycling, you'd probably only get one low-grade spirit stone for every 55 talisman papers. But I'll give you one low-grade spirit stone for just 50 talisman papers."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Muling say she would buy them with spirit stones, Chuning finally breathed a slight sigh of relief, but asked with some confusion:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, buying one spirit stone for 50 talisman papers is the same price whether you buy from the sect or the market..."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about that, I just find it too troublesome," Muling said impatiently. "Are you selling or not?"</p><p></p><p>Chuning sighed inwardly. After you've said so much, how could I not sell?</p><p></p><p>If I don't sell, wouldn't you just take them by force?</p><p></p><p>So Chuning asked, "How many talisman papers does Senior Sister want to buy?"</p><p></p><p>"However many you have, I'll take them all!" Muling boastfully shook her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"I have plenty of spirit stones here."</p><p></p><p>Chuning looked at the spirit stones, then picked up the smaller of the two cloth bags he was holding, preparing to open it.</p><p></p><p>He had indeed brought some extra talisman papers this time, originally planning to ask Zhuang Yunde if the sect would buy them back.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't claim he hadn't made any extras, but Chuning also didn't want to reveal too much.</p><p></p><p>This small cloth bag contained the 2,050 talisman papers intended for outside the sect. He planned to claim these were all the talisman papers he had.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he prepared to separate out Zhuang Yunde's 550 papers and give the rest to Muling.</p><p></p><p>But before he could move, as soon as he opened the bag, Muling made a hand seal and instantly swept all the talisman papers into her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Chuning's expression changed slightly, but then Muling took out a talisman paper, examined it carefully, and said with satisfaction:</p><p></p><p>"The quality of these talisman papers is not bad. I'll take them first in case Junior Brother changes his mind."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Muling seemed to sense the contents of her storage bag with her spiritual power, then continued:</p><p></p><p>"There are 2,050 talisman papers in total, so 41 low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>She took out a small pile of spirit stones and handed them to Chuning.</p><p></p><p>Chuning hurriedly accepted them and put them in his pocket.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chuning put the spirit stones directly in his pocket, Muling asked in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"Oh, doesn't Junior Brother have a storage bag?"</p><p></p><p>Chuning shook his head. "This is my first season's harvest. I don't have enough spirit stones to buy a storage bag."</p><p></p><p>Muling blinked, then quickly took out a small bag from her pocket and said to Chuning:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, I have an extra storage bag here. If Junior Brother is willing to do me a small favor, I can give this storage bag to you. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Chuning didn't respond. He felt there was something not quite right about this windfall.</p><p></p><p>But Muling didn't press him, just smiling: </p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu doesn't need to agree right away. You should go see Senior Brother Zhuang first. I just saw him in his room."</p><p></p><p>With that, Muling turned and left, leaving a bewildered Chuning behind.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Chuning still headed towards Zhuang Yunde's residence.</p><p></p><p>Originally he had planned to go back to his lodgings first and get the 550 talisman papers for Zhuang Yunde before coming.</p><p></p><p>But hearing Zhuang Yunde was actually home, he decided to go find him first.</p><p></p><p>Although this forced sale by Muling wasn't a loss for him, her strange appearance left him feeling uneasy until he could clarify things with Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was still the practice ground from five days ago. Chu Ning arrived a little earlier this time. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were only more than twenty people inside the practice ground.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the expressions of these people, Chu Ning could roughly tell that they were mostly relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that those who arrived first probably had at least achieved the 20% success rate for talisman-making, which was the threshold to qualify.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, more people gradually arrived, with most of their faces full of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that even a 20% success rate in talisman-making was still too high for most people.</p><p></p><p>Soon, more and more people gathered.</p><p></p><p>The other five who were promoted along with Chu Ning also arrived, each with different expressions.</p><p></p><p>Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang had normal expressions, making it hard to tell their situation.</p><p></p><p>Lu Ming and Chen Jinhua had slight looks of disappointment on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that they either failed to reach the 20% success rate or just barely passed but had little hope.</p><p></p><p>As for Jiang Dawei, he hung his head dejectedly, looking utterly dispirited, making his result self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, He Changyou appeared again in the practice ground, accompanied by the supervising disciple with the surname Liu.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou stood in front and, after glancing over the crowd, slowly spoke:</p><p></p><p>"The five-day period has ended. Those who have achieved a 20% success rate in making the Wood Talisman, step forward."</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a small portion of people from various parts of the practice ground stood up and walked towards the front.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning waited for a moment but found that none of his five companions seemed to have any intention of getting up.</p><p></p><p>It was then that he slowly stood up and, under their astonished gazes, walked forward from the back.</p><p></p><p>"Chu... he..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Dawei, who had been hanging his head dejectedly, now lifted his head slightly, his mouth slightly agape, but he failed to complete his sentence.</p><p></p><p>The other four also revealed surprised expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It was not until Chu Ning walked to the very front of the practice ground that Lu Yunfang softly said:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that this Junior Brother Chu not only has a talent for cultivating Wood-type spells but also a talent for talisman-making."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Ming asked enviously:</p><p></p><p>"Do you think he might be able to obtain one of the top ten spots and gain the qualification to learn talisman scriptures?"</p><p></p><p>The others did not answer, for no one could.</p><p></p><p>After five days of learning talisman-making, they had already realized that the talent for it had little relation to one's cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present had enough spiritual power to easily draw dozens of talismans, but how many would ultimately succeed was hard to say.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty-seven people, not bad, a few more than I expected," said He Changyou, his gaze sweeping over the people standing in front.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Chu Ning standing at the very back, he was slightly surprised as well.</p><p></p><p>He clearly remembered that Chu Ning had just been promoted from the D-rank not long ago.</p><p></p><p>What He Changyou did not expect was that Chu Ning also seemed to have a talent for talisman-making.</p><p></p><p>However, this expression of surprise was only fleeting.</p><p></p><p>Soon, He Changyou's expression returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"The other disciples, move back and clear the front of the practice ground.</p><p></p><p>Next, we will conduct a talisman-making test. Each person will draw ten Wood Talismans on talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Those with success rates ranking in the top ten will officially gain the qualification to learn talisman scriptures."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, He Changyou had everyone spread out, with one table between each person to avoid interference.</p><p></p><p>Then, the supervising disciple with the surname Liu distributed ten talisman papers to each person.</p><p></p><p>Once everyone had taken out their talisman brushes and inks from their storage bags, He Changyou scanned them with his gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Begin!"</p><p></p><p>Following He Changyou's words, more than twenty people picked up their talisman brushes.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning calmly held his brush, took a light breath, and slowly infused it with spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>For him, the Wood Talisman was already extremely familiar.</p><p></p><p>As long as he used his spiritual sense to perceive the talisman-making process, he had a 70% chance of success.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Chu Ning did not choose to extend his spiritual sense outward.</p><p></p><p>After all, He Changyou, at the Foundation Establishment stage, was watching in front and might sense his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Without using his spiritual sense and not being fully focused at the start, Chu Ning's spiritual power fluctuated slightly halfway through drawing the first talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>Unsurprisingly, this talisman paper self-ignited and turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning "failed" on his first attempt, the other twenty-odd people also gradually failed one after another.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's gaze unintentionally glanced around, observing...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Everyone's performance was within his sight, but his heart remained unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>"After all, we're all novices, plus with so many people around. It's very difficult to immediately enter the optimal state for talisman drawing, so making mistakes is normal."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Chu Ning slightly adjusted his state, dipped his brush in ink, and began drawing on the second talisman paper. </p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning held nothing back. Although he didn't deliberately sense with his spiritual awareness, his entire mind was fully immersed in the process.</p><p></p><p>As such, this talisman was also successfully produced as naturally as a river flowing into a channel.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's successful talisman drawing naturally did not escape He Changyu's perception. </p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning was not the only one who succeeded, He Changyu's gaze still turned towards him first.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning also revealed a hint of joy at the appropriate time.</p><p></p><p>Just then, some other people also succeeded in drawing talismans, and He Changyu's gaze shifted away.</p><p></p><p>For the second talisman paper, seven people succeeded.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly caused the remaining twenty people to feel immense pressure, with looks of anxiety appearing on many faces.</p><p></p><p>The result was that for the third talisman paper, many people still failed.</p><p></p><p>On Chu Ning's side, after finishing the second talisman paper, he was in an "excellent state."</p><p></p><p>He even succeeded with the third talisman paper, becoming one of only two disciples to complete two talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>For the subsequent few talisman papers, Chu Ning controlled the pace.</p><p></p><p>He succeeded in drawing 4 out of the first 9 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Among them, there were 3 that he truly failed to produce, and 1 that Chu Ning intentionally failed.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Chu Ning was still one of only two disciples to successfully produce 4 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>When everyone picked up the last talisman paper, He Changyu's gaze swept towards the two of them.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chu Ning suddenly sensed a very familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual awareness!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart jolted.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect that at the last moment, He Changyu would release his spiritual awareness to sense his talisman drawing.</p><p></p><p>Having cultivated spiritual awareness before, Chu Ning was very clear.</p><p></p><p>This type of sensing was extremely sensitive and could detect even the slightest fluctuations in his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly put Chu Ning in a difficult position.</p><p></p><p>According to Chu Ning's previous plan, he aimed to first ensure completing 4 talisman papers out of the first 9.</p><p></p><p>This way, he had full confidence in ranking in the top ten and near the front.</p><p></p><p>After all, a 40% success rate was already very high for a novice.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning had just seen that another person also completed 4 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>So, as long as he failed the last one, he could rank near the front without seeming too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>But now, after discovering He Changyu's spiritual awareness sensing him, he hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Although talisman drawing could indeed be affected by the slightest fluctuations in spiritual power, Chu Ning was unsure.</p><p></p><p>If he intentionally caused fluctuations in his spiritual power, would He Changyu, a Foundation Establishment cultivator, be able to detect it?</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, let nature take its course," Chu Ning finally muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He decided to let the last talisman paper happen naturally and leave its success or failure to chance.</p><p></p><p>Because Chu Ning had paused to ponder for a bit earlier, he started this final talisman paper slightly later than the other person who had also completed 4.</p><p></p><p>So, when drawing the talisman, he didn't notice that the other person's talisman paper had spontaneously combusted halfway through, signaling failure.</p><p></p><p>All of He Changyu's spiritual awareness was now focused on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning was drawing naturally without any deliberate actions, allowing his state to perform normally.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>When the azure light flashed once more and another successfully drawn Wood Talisman appeared on the table before him, Chu Ning couldn't help but fall silent with a slightly dazed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Truly, man cannot plan as well as heaven!"</p><p></p><p>This final talisman paper had also succeeded.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, He Changyu's gaze towards Chu Ning was exceptionally bright.</p><p></p><p>Because Chu Ning had succeeded in drawing 5 out of the 10 talisman papers, achieving a 50% success rate!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

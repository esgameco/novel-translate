        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the temple, Chu Ning ran along the way and arrived at a mountain cave. </p><p></p><p>This was a cave he had noticed and liked while passing by earlier that day, and it was a perfect place for him to stay for now.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique (0/100)]</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning only needed to activate his mind, and he could still see this display in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"This should be something like a proficiency panel? But I don't know if it has any other functions."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, trying things like allocating points, but he wasn't able to succeed.</p><p></p><p>With no sleepiness, Chu Ning simply gathered some dry branches, took out a fire striker to light them, and by the firelight, he carefully took out the Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique book to read.</p><p></p><p>The book contained nine sets of illustrated movements along with corresponding text explanations, stating that by practicing these nine sets of movements in sequence and persevering for a long time, one could achieve the effect of body tempering.</p><p></p><p>After reading it, Chu Ning began practicing according to the first set of illustrations.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had just gotten into the stance when he sucked in a breath of cold air, feeling like his leg muscles were about to be torn apart.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he continued practicing.</p><p></p><p>After clumsily and unstably completing one round, Chu Ning felt like his body had been beaten up.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique (0/100)]</p><p></p><p>There was no change at all, the proficiency was still at 0.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not lose heart, since this thing had appeared, it must have some use, and more practice would definitely have an effect.</p><p></p><p>It's just that at this moment, he had no intention of doing another round, as his whole body was too sore and aching.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after being exhausted by today's events, Chu Ning might not have been able to sleep, but now he actually felt a bit sleepy, so he went straight to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next morning when Chu Ning woke up, he found that his body's soreness and aches were not as obvious.</p><p></p><p>So, he practiced another round.</p><p></p><p>Hmm, it was a bit better than yesterday, and he felt that several of the movements were more standard.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning found that there was still no change.</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure it out, he simply stopped thinking about it for now, took his belongings out of the mountain cave, and headed towards Qingxi City.</p><p></p><p>This was thanks to that Cai Fu who had brought a map, allowing Chu Ning to find his way.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, whenever he rested in the mornings and evenings, Chu Ning would practice the Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>It's not that Chu Ning wasn't diligent, but he felt that practicing once in the morning and once in the evening had already reached his physical limit.</p><p></p><p>Although the proficiency didn't increase, the fatigue was reduced quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>After walking for four days, plus the first evening, Chu Ning had practiced nine times in total. When Chu Ning practiced again during a rest:</p><p></p><p>[Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique (1/100)]</p><p></p><p>"Oh, the proficiency has become 1! Practicing more is indeed useful, practicing 10 times can increase the proficiency by 1 point."</p><p></p><p>Having figured out the pattern, Chu Ning's spirit was reinvigorated.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, he would be completely exhausted after practicing the full routine each day, but today he felt he still had some energy left.</p><p></p><p>If he continued practicing, he might not only be able to practice twice a day, but perhaps even three or four times...</p><p></p><p>With such expectations, Chu Ning continued practicing while hurrying towards Qingxi City. By the time he arrived ten days later, the proficiency of the Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique had risen to 3.</p><p></p><p>After entering the city and inquiring around, Chu Ning learned that the selection test for Qingxi Sect would be held in half a year.</p><p></p><p>Having gained some money and valuables from the former master and servant, he had more than enough for normal living expenses for half a year. So Chu Ning decided to stay and practice the Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique while waiting for the selection test in half a year.</p><p></p><p>He rented a small house in a remote part of the city. During this period of time, Chu Ning kept a low profile.</p><p></p><p>He practiced the Nine Yin Body Tempering Technique diligently morning, noon, and night. When he had free time, he would wander around the city to learn more information about this world.</p><p></p><p>Qingxi City was an ordinary city, with no cultivators living inside. However, perhaps because it was closer to the cultivation sects, there was clearly more information about cultivation here.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning also gained more understanding about Qingxi Sect. Apparently, this Qingxi Sect was located in the Qingxia Mountain Range nearly a hundred li away from here.</p><p></p><p>Every three years, Qingxi Sect would recruit new disciples from the outside world. Those with outstanding aptitudes would be directly accepted into the inner sect for training, those with excellent aptitudes would cultivate in the outer sect, while those with average cultivation aptitudes would be accepted as servant disciples in the sect.</p><p></p><p>The aptitude...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The assessment mainly tests one's spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't know what kind of spiritual root he had, so he didn't bother thinking about it and just waited patiently for the selection half a year later.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, and half a year passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique (99/100)]</p><p></p><p>Seeing this prompt, a hint of anticipation was revealed in Chu Ning's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"After the proficiency increased to 99, in the past few days, I've practiced it 9 times. One more time and the proficiency will increase by 1 point, reaching 100."</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning really wanted to complete that one practice session immediately, he had already reached his physical limit today after practicing 4 times.</p><p></p><p>Initially, Chu Ning could only practice the body tempering technique 2 times a day before reaching his limit. Later, he could practice 3 times a day, and now he could practice 4 times a day.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow morning is the day to go to Qingxi Sect for the selection. I can practice one more time in the morning."</p><p></p><p>Suppressing that slight excitement, Chu Ning took a shower and went to sleep.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, Chu Ning got up early as usual and began practicing the Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>All the movements were already ingrained in his heart. As Chu Ning easily performed the various high-difficulty body tempering postures that he had previously thought were difficult, the nine sets of movements were quickly completed.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt as if some shackle in his body had been unlocked.</p><p></p><p>Looking at himself again, the clothes he had just changed into yesterday were now completely soaked and covered in layers of grime.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had been reborn, feeling refreshed and energized!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning's consciousness quickly scanned his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique (100/100)]</p><p></p><p>[Talent Refreshed, Rewarded with the "Yin Wood Spirit Body" Talent:</p><p></p><p>1. Greatly enhances the ability to sense wood-attribute spiritual qi and increases the cultivation speed of wood-based techniques and spells.</p><p></p><p>2. The wood-attribute spiritual power cultivated can conceal itself from detection and its strength can be revealed at will.]</p><p></p><p>"Talent refreshed! Yin Wood Spirit Body!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this new prompt, Chu Ning knew that this must be the reward for reaching full proficiency, and he felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>"A spirit body talent, so I must have a spiritual root, right?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought to himself as he quickly walked out of the house and headed towards the outskirts of the city.</p><p></p><p>Today was the selection day for Qingxi Sect, so he would naturally find out if he had a spiritual root by getting tested.</p><p></p><p>As for the latter two talent abilities, he would only know about them after joining a cultivation sect and officially beginning his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I've been staying in this city for so long, and I've only heard them mention spiritual roots, but I've never heard anyone talk about spirit bodies."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, also wondering what he would do if the test didn't detect anything.</p><p></p><p>By the time Chu Ning reached the street, there were already many young people like him heading towards the outskirts of the city.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had seen many people arriving in Qingxi City from other places over the past half month, so he wasn't surprised and just blended into the crowd.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the east gate of the city, there were several young men and women wearing Qingxi Sect's robes handing out test number plates at the exit.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning approached a young woman, who handed him a plate without looking up.</p><p></p><p>"Ding Nineteen"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took the plate and followed the crowd out of the city gate.</p><p></p><p>Outside the east gate, there was a spacious field where many people had already gathered and were lining up according to their number sequences.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning joined the Ding sequence line, and soon more people arrived and lined up behind him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed that the testing had already begun for the A, B, and C sequences on one side.</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, he doesn't have a spiritual root either!"</p><p></p><p>"Four spiritual roots, I heard this is a false spiritual root, but he can still cultivate and join the sect as a menial worker."</p><p></p><p>"Wow, three spiritual roots, he can join the outer sect!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Voices of sighs, exclamations, and gasps could be heard from time to time.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, a voice rang out from the front of the line.</p><p></p><p>"Ding sequence, begin testing!"</p><p></p><p>My friends, please give it a bookmark if you can~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

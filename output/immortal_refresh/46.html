        <h1>Chapter 46</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>He put away the jade slip containing the Refining Spirit Technique and placed it in his storage bag, then Chu Ning looked towards the last bamboo plaque. </p><p></p><p>This bamboo plaque appeared to be made of very ordinary bamboo material, definitely not any kind of spirit bamboo.</p><p></p><p>A crude pattern was carved on it. In Chu Ning's eyes, it was just some random scratched lines without any discernible pattern. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning examined it front and back but didn't find anything special about it.</p><p></p><p>If it wasn't stored in Qi Chongmao's storage bag, Chu Ning wouldn't have paid any attention to such an ordinary bamboo plaque.</p><p></p><p>He tried activating it with spiritual power but there was no effect. </p><p></p><p>After carefully studying it, he couldn't make anything of it, so Chu Ning simply put it back into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning pondered silently. From the look of Qi Chongmao having so many secrets, he was clearly no ordinary cultivator.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown if he had any connections to major figures in the sect.  </p><p></p><p>If that was the case, investigating further could lead to trouble.</p><p></p><p>The two were neighbors after all. No matter how well he concealed it, someone might become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning had no regrets. If he didn't take decisive action today, he would have been the one reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Reviewing today's battle carefully, Chu Ning realized he expended quite a bit but also gained considerably.  </p><p></p><p>He used 6 talisman papers but recovered 2 talisman papers and 2 elixir pills, and most importantly, obtained the secret Refining Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't rush to cultivate it immediately. Instead, he sat cross-legged to recover his spiritual power, as he had expended quite a bit today.</p><p></p><p>Mainly from his Heavenly Pillar Fist, which consumed over 30% of his power.</p><p></p><p>After running the Evergreen Wood Technique for a few cycles, Chu Ning's spiritual power fully recovered. Seeing it was still midnight, he went back to his room to sleep and rest.</p><p></p><p>After all, for the past ten days, Chu Ning had been guarding the Seven Star Spirit Fruit anxiously without truly resting well.</p><p></p><p>This sleep was exceptionally relaxing and sweet for Chu Ning, not waking until late morning the next day.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the courtyard, Chu Ning intentionally lingered outside the gate for a while.</p><p></p><p>He didn't notice any abnormalities or anyone coming to look for Qi Chongmao, which put him slightly more at ease.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, no one seemed to have detected last night's events.</p><p></p><p>It had been over ten days since he last visited his spirit fields, so Chu Ning headed to his two plots.</p><p></p><p>But upon arriving at the intermediate spirit field growing purple orchid grass, Chu Ning's expression soured slightly.</p><p></p><p>In the past ten days, not only had the grass not grown much, but quite a bit had turned yellow and withered, clearly indicating an issue.</p><p></p><p>Entering the spirit field, Chu Ning immediately discovered the cause.</p><p></p><p>The purple orchid grass had been eaten by locust pests.</p><p></p><p>These locusts were a common pest in spirit fields, especially favoring grassy and grain spirit plants, and reproduced rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning felt relieved, as the issue was easily resolved once identified.</p><p></p><p>Although the purple orchid grass was a bit withered, it wasn't dead, so it could be treated.</p><p></p><p>He cast a few Purification Spells to eliminate all locust eggs in this field first.  </p><p></p><p>Then used a Sweet Rain Technique, temporarily resolving the pest crisis for the purple orchid grass.</p><p></p><p>To help it grow well again would require his Evergreen Wood Flourishing Technique, which happened to be Chu Ning's specialty.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Chu Ning had no intention of using the Evergreen Wood Flourishing Technique here.</p><p></p><p>After treating the areas affected by locusts across these few acres, he hurriedly went to his 5-acre high-grade spirit field.</p><p></p><p>The black spirit bamboo there could bring him much greater income.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning breathed a sigh of relief that the black spirit bamboo was completely normal.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning had not come to perform the Qingmu Chunhua technique for a period of time, causing the growth to slow down a bit, there were no abnormal pest problems. </p><p></p><p>Then, for the entire next day, Chu Ning stayed in the two spirit fields almost the whole time.</p><p></p><p>First performing the Qingmu Chunhua technique, then recovering his spiritual power, and then continuing to perform the Qingmu Chunhua technique. </p><p></p><p>It was not until all the spirit plants in the two fields had been treated that he slowly returned to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The neighboring courtyard of Qi Chongmao was still tightly closed, and there were no signs that anyone had been there.</p><p></p><p>However, after thinking about it, Chu Ning felt it was normal. He had not left the courtyard for about ten days, and no one had noticed either.</p><p></p><p>From this point of view, the servant disciples in Qingxi Sect still had quite a lot of freedom.</p><p></p><p>Normally, except for the occasional visit from the duty disciple Zhang Yunde, the sect rarely managed them.</p><p></p><p>As for the steward He Changyou, he would only come before the harvest each season or after sowing.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not linger outside the courtyard for too long. He just glanced over casually, and then walked back to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He cooked spirit rice and two dishes, and had a nice dinner. After resting for a while, Chu Ning came to the front courtyard to begin his cultivation for the day.</p><p></p><p>He had been cultivating in the back courtyard for a period of time, but since someone had just been killed there last night, he felt a bit uncomfortable about it.</p><p></p><p>Since he was not sure how long it would take to cultivate the Lianshen Art, Chu Ning did not rush to practice this secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Instead, as usual, he first began cultivating the Jiuxuan Lianti Technique.</p><p></p><p>The first volume of the Jiuxuan Lianti Technique contains five levels of cultivation. Currently, Chu Ning was cultivating the second level, Buku Gu.</p><p></p><p>As his spiritual power circulated and he went through various body-refining postures, Chu Ning suddenly felt a warm current surging through his limbs and body.</p><p></p><p>Although slightly surprised, Chu Ning did not think too much of it, as this was the first time he had cultivated the Jiuxuan Lianti Technique after breaking through to the Buku Gu level.</p><p></p><p>He thought this was just a normal reaction when cultivating Buku Gu.</p><p></p><p>After consecutively cultivating the Jiuxuan Lianti Technique twice, Chu Ning collected his efforts with a clear mind and refreshed spirit. When he looked at the proficiency levels in his mind, he was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Gong (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), Second Layer (244/900)]  </p><p>[Jiuxuan Lianti Technique, First Volume, Buku Gu 2/600]</p><p></p><p>"This body refining progress..."</p><p></p><p>He had only cultivated the Jiuxuan Lianti Technique twice, but the proficiency of Buku Gu had already reached 2.</p><p></p><p>This speed was even faster than when he had previously cultivated Buxiu Pi.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the proficiency levels with some puzzlement and carefully recalled the feeling when he was cultivating just now.</p><p></p><p>That feeling was vaguely similar to the feeling of body refining after taking the Seven Star Spirit Fruit over the past two days.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought of a possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that after I broke through Buxiu Pi with the help of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit, its lingering effects have not been fully absorbed, so it is still continuously taking effect?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed. After all, the Seven Star Spirit Fruit was meant for body refiners at later stages.</p><p></p><p>He had only taken it when cultivating the first level, so the effects were naturally different.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Chu Ning's face, and he muttered to himself:</p><p></p><p>"It seems I should cultivate more of this Jiuxuan Lianti Technique these days to fully absorb the medicinal effects of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit and not waste them."</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, Chu Ning did not continue cultivating. He was also very interested in the Lianshen Art and wanted to try it out.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out the jade slip of the Lianshen Art again.</p><p></p><p>After going through all the contents once more, he slowly closed his eyes and began cultivating according to the methods described.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

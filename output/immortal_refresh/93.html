        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At dinner, while Chu Ning ate a few bowls of spirit rice himself, he also filled a bowl of spirit rice for Ling Bai. </p><p></p><p>This little fellow didn't have the hesitant look from yesterday. It seemed to know that this would be its food from now on, so it obediently started eating.</p><p></p><p>After finishing dinner and tidying up a bit, Chu Ning returned to his room. </p><p></p><p>Without rushing into cultivation, Chu Ning picked up the jade slip containing the Illusion Shaping technique with great interest.</p><p></p><p>After briefly understanding the contents, he immediately became very interested.</p><p></p><p>This Illusion Shaping technique had no attributes or levels. </p><p></p><p>According to the introduction, the method was to use spiritual power to change the shape of one's entire skeletal muscles.</p><p></p><p>So as long as it was cultivated successfully, one could change their height and appearance at will.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if someone with higher spiritual power or spiritual sense probed it, because this Illusion Shaping technique truly changed the bones and muscles, they might be able to tell that some secret technique was used, but they wouldn't be able to see the original appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Since this is a technique without attributes, it's no different from wood techniques for me. So I should be able to cultivate it quickly."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning re-read the contents of the jade slip a few more times, committing it firmly to memory.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning began changing his bones according to the method recorded in the Illusion Shaping technique.</p><p></p><p>Since it was his first try, Chu Ning didn't dare start with his face.</p><p></p><p>He tried shortening one of his feet a little bit.</p><p></p><p>As spiritual power circulated there, his left foot had a very strange squeezing sensation.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, when Chu Ning put his two feet together, he was surprised to find that his left foot was indeed shorter than his right.</p><p></p><p>With a circulation of spiritual power, that foot returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting."</p><p></p><p>Intrigued, Chu Ning began constantly experimenting with his feet, making them bigger or smaller at times...</p><p></p><p>And when Chu Ning unintentionally glanced over a certain part of his body, a strange idea arose.</p><p></p><p>But then he dismissed that idea, since there were no bones there.</p><p></p><p>He continued experimenting on other parts of his body, and soon his entire figure became taller, shorter, fatter, or thinner.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Chu Ning the most was that after using the Illusion Shaping technique, no spiritual power was needed to maintain it running.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual power was only needed when reverting the changes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once the bones changed, the corresponding muscles would also change accordingly, looking very natural.</p><p></p><p>After practicing on all the bones in his body and becoming proficient, Chu Ning finally turned his attention to his slightly delicate facial features.</p><p></p><p>Holding a mirror, he began adjusting his face with the Illusion Shaping technique.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he almost threw the mirror to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The adjustments to the facial bones were so subtle that he inadvertently made the bones on the two sides of his cheeks uneven heights, causing his entire face to become slightly distorted.</p><p></p><p>That appearance was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>After readjusting and practicing a few more times, Chu Ning finally became more skilled, gradually adjusting the shape of his face.</p><p></p><p>After some adjustments, his originally slightly delicate facial features disappeared.</p><p></p><p>In their place was an extremely ordinary-looking young man's face.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then also used the Illusion Shaping technique on his body, reducing his height slightly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he released the suppressed sixth-layer Qi aura of his Yin Wood Spirit Body.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this face completely different from before, Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He then got up, left the room, and took a walk around the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Feeling no discomfort, and that his spiritual power and techniques were unaffected, Chu Ning couldn't help but laugh lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Even people who see me every day wouldn't be able to recognize me, let alone anyone who doesn't see me daily."</p><p></p><p>Only then did this occur to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Wuu!"</p><p></p><p>A sound rang out as Ling Bai looked over, its two small eyes flashing a hint of alertness, which quickly disappeared completely.</p><p></p><p>Then its two small eyes rolled as it let out another "wuu" towards Chu Ning, as if saying, "I know it's you."</p><p></p><p>This immediately made Chu Ning greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Illusion Shaping technique so ineffective? Ling Bai saw through it with just a glance?"</p><p></p><p>But after a moment's thought, Chu Ning felt that wasn't right.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Ling Bai's peculiarities, he figured it probably had other means of identification.</p><p></p><p>The best way was still to find an acquaintance to verify it the next day.</p><p></p><p>That night, Chu Ning happily practiced the Illusion Shaping technique.</p><p></p><p>He even tried changing into his appearance from his previous life, feeling a tinge of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>The next morning after breakfast, Chu Ning brought Ling Bai out of the town.</p><p></p><p>He then took out the Wind-Chasing Talisman, preparing to head to the Spirit Fields.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, I'll take you out for a spin!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning told Ling Bai with his spiritual sense to hop onto his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Ling Bai nimbly jumped onto Chu Ning's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then stepped onto the Wind-Chasing Talisman.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he infused it with spiritual power from his feet, and the next moment, the Wind-Chasing Talisman took flight.</p><p></p><p>It then soared through the air, heading straight forward.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, Chu Ning almost stumbled but managed to steady himself in time.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Hee!" </p><p></p><p>The little spiritual white creature Ling Xiaobai was also looking curious and delighted at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"You do seem to be enjoying yourself," Chu Ning said with a smile to Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>"You look quite formidable, when will you take flight?"</p><p></p><p>"Hee!"</p><p></p><p>He received a slightly aggrieved sound from Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt the speed for a moment, and his gaze became bright.</p><p></p><p>The speed of this wind-chasing shuttle was enough to match three times his previous wind-riding speed. </p><p></p><p>The spirit field that originally took a quarter of an hour to reach was arrived at in just a short while.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the wind-chasing shuttle, Chu Ning vaguely felt a sense of lingering regret.</p><p></p><p>This distance was still a bit too short, not enough to satisfy the craving.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then smiled and shook his head, this was probably like driving a car in his previous life - always wanting one when you didn't have it.</p><p></p><p>But after really getting a car, you'd get tired of driving it after a while.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai looked at Chu Ning's expression and revealed an adorable look on its face, as if not quite understanding what Chu Ning meant.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't bother with the little creature, looking at the growth of the purple crystal bamboos and golden spirit fruits, and then began to perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique.</p><p></p><p>Both spirit plants were not bad, and as his cultivation improved, the effect of this Green Wood Spring Bloom technique seemed to be getting better and better.</p><p></p><p>After performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique on all the spirit plants, Chu Ning did not linger and left the spirit field to return to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>These purple crystal bamboos had been delayed for a few days, so their effect in supporting his cultivation was still not very good at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The iron-stem orchids in his courtyard were not fully grown yet, but the green spirit fruits were growing quite well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these two spirit plants absorbed spiritual energy faster and were more effective for cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen technique.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning still planned to cultivate those two spirit plants as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not forget that he wanted to try out the Illusion Shaping technique yesterday.</p><p></p><p>So, he directly performed the Illusion Shaping technique in the spirit field and changed into another appearance.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his gaze turned towards Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>With Ling Xiaobai following him like this, it would inevitably be seen by other people in the market town sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, others would recognize him at a glance, which would instead actively expose that he knew the Illusion Shaping technique.</p><p></p><p>"Ling Xiaobai, come into the spirit beast pouch."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out the spirit beast pouch and beckoned to Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai looked at it and shook its little head repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning frowned, "You can stay outside normally, but when I have something to do, you must go into the spirit beast pouch, otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>This little creature was extremely spiritually intelligent and seemed to realize that Chu Ning was serious, then it made an "hee" sound in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chu Ning nod in satisfaction and use the spirit beast pouch to put Ling Xiaobai directly inside.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning began riding the wind towards the market town.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he did not use the wind-chasing shuttle since he was now in a different appearance.</p><p></p><p>After entering the market town, Chu Ning saw that Gu Xiaoqing's shop was open, so he went straight over.</p><p></p><p>Since it wasn't a market day, there were generally few customers, and Gu Xiaoqing was not minding the shop.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning arrived at the shop and called out, Gu Xiaoqing then came out from the inner room.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of spirit pills does this Daoist friend want to buy?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any Essence Gathering Pills?" Chu Ning asked.</p><p></p><p>His voice had also changed, not as youthful as before, and his tone was rougher, not as clear and bright as before.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Gu Xiaoqing took out a jade bottle from her storage pouch, "10 spirit stones per pill, how many do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out 100 spirit stones from his storage pouch, "Give me 10 pills."  </p><p></p><p>"There are exactly 10 pills in this bottle." Gu Xiaoqing said, handing the jade bottle over.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took it but did not leave immediately. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he deliberately opened the bottle cap slowly to look inside, and even took out a pill to smell it.</p><p></p><p>Giving Gu Xiaoqing ample time to observe him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Gu Xiaoqing smiled and said, "These are genuine low-grade Essence Gathering Pills, we are from the Qingxi Sect, Daoist friend can rest assured."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, and even deliberately asked about two kinds of higher-grade spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Then he left the shop under Gu Xiaoqing's puzzled gaze.</p><p></p><p>"That person is clearly only at the sixth level of Qi Condensation, yet he wants to buy higher-grade spirit pills, and it's not even a market day when he came. That's a bit strange."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning released his spiritual sense and perceived Gu Xiaoqing's murmured words behind him, with a faint smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>His series of actions and words had completely drawn Gu Xiaoqing's attention.  </p><p></p><p>Yet she showed no signs of recognizing him, which finally put Chu Ning greatly at ease.</p><p></p><p>This Illusion Shaping technique was indeed effective.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the market town, Chu Ning found a deserted place and reverted to his own appearance.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he return to his own shop and courtyard as normal.</p><p></p><p>The Illusion Shaping technique had no particular use for him at the moment.</p><p></p><p>But for the ever-cautious Chu Ning, he felt this skill would inevitably come in handy sooner or later.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the rear courtyard, Chu Ning prepared to perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique again on the green spirit fruits and iron-stem orchids, while also cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen technique aided by the green spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>But when his gaze swept over the iron-stem orchids, he suddenly froze.</p><p></p><p>The growth of four of the iron-stem orchids was clearly better than the several other ones.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chu Ning's astonished gaze turned towards Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>These were the few iron-stem orchids that it had urinated on yesterday.</p>

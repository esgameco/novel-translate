        <h1>Chapter 15</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Hechang You asked Zhuang Yunde to record the various allocations he had just made on jade slips. </p><p></p><p>He clearly specified the location of the spiritual fields allocated to each person, and then took out seeds from his storage bag and distributed them to everyone.</p><p></p><p>However, when it came to Chu Ning's turn, he did not give him any, but instead said:</p><p></p><p>"I really didn't expect any of you would choose to grow ink bamboo, so I didn't bring the seeds with me. You can come back with me to get them."  </p><p></p><p>Saying that, Hechang You turned and left, and Chu Ning hurriedly followed him.</p><p></p><p>Watching their backs, the others started discussing.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect Chu Ning would actually choose to grow ink bamboo!"</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, ink bamboo is really not easy to grow. Senior Brother Yuan, it's even harder than the purple yam fruit you chose."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>These words fell on Yuan Guang's ears, immediately making the arrogant and unsmilingYuan Guang very displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating at only the second level of Qi Refining and choosing to grow ink bamboo, how presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Yuan Guang's words, the others all asked him what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Yuan Guang was about to explain when he noticed Zhuang Yunde still standing nearby. His arrogant expression immediately subsided as he respectfully said:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang, if I remember correctly, in order for the ink bamboo to grow well enough for making talisman paper, one must constantly use the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique to enhance its quality. Have I remembered incorrectly?"</p><p></p><p>The plump Zhuang Yunde nodded and said with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"This junior brother has not remembered incorrectly. The ink bamboo is quite different from the red spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique is used on the red spirit rice, the quality it can enhance is limited and cannot go too high.</p><p></p><p>But the ink bamboo is different. There is an extreme difference between those whose quality has been enhanced by the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique and those whose quality has not been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>However, it is too absolute to say that one must use the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique to enhance the quality in order to make talismans.</p><p></p><p>As long as the talisman maker is skilled enough, they can still make talisman paper. It's just that the quantity made will be much less.</p><p></p><p>So if the quality of the ink bamboo grown is not good, then more will have to be handed over to the sect, leaving almost none for oneself.</p><p></p><p>This Junior Brother Chu choosing to grow ink bamboo at only the second level of Qi Refining..."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde trailed off without finishing his sentence.</p><p></p><p>But Yuan Guang did not ponder it carefully. Instead, he turned to look at the others, his expression saying "You all heard that, right?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the others also started praising Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Yuan, your choice is indeed more stable."  </p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, this Junior Brother Chu must have forgotten about this, right?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Most of them had expressions of watching something amusing unfold, except for Qiu Shunyi and Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi looked somewhat worried, while Zhuang Yunde had a contemplative look that flashed across his face briefly.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Zhuang Yunde said, "Let me show you your spiritual fields and residences first."</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Ning, of course he would not be unaware of this point.  </p><p></p><p>The reason he chose ink bamboo was naturally related to his newly awakened innate talent for talisman sources.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely have to choose the path of talisman making next, so he had to get a head start in that area.</p><p></p><p>As for the ink bamboo requiring cultivation with the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, Chu Ning had already thought of an explanation.</p><p></p><p>It was the same reason - that he was quite compatible with the Green Wood Evergreen Technique, so he had already learned the basics of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique and could use it.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that Hechang You did not mention this at all, nor ask Chu Ning why he chose to grow ink bamboo.  </p><p></p><p>After getting the ink bamboo seeds for him, Hechang You directly sent Chu Ning away.</p><p></p><p>On the way back, Chu Ning pondered over everything and eventually relaxed, realizing he had been overly worried before.</p><p></p><p>The Green Creek Sect accepted new disciples periodically, so naturally there would be all kinds of people.  </p><p></p><p>As the executor of the Hundred Arts Hall, Hechang You must have seen countless people.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was merely a "second level of Qi Refining" servant disciple. Even if Hechang You guessed that he might know the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, it was not a big deal.</p><p></p><p>After all, among so many disciples, there were bound to be a few who performed better.</p><p></p><p>Although ink bamboo was somewhat more difficult to grow, it was not exactly a rare thing either.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Even though he had gained a little fame today, as long as he kept a low profile going forward and didn't flaunt it everywhere, there shouldn't be any problems. </p><p></p><p>Instead, what he needed to consider next was how to get into talisman making after planting this Ink Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>For now, he would just take it one step at a time and focus on doing a good job with the tasks at hand.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning returned to his original spot, everyone had already dispersed. He didn't know how to find the spiritual field assigned to him. </p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, he headed to Cao Dongxin's residence, planning to pack up his belongings first.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Chu Ning slightly was that Qiu Shunyi was actually waiting for him outside the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>As soon as he saw Chu Ning return, Qiu Shunyi rushed over in two steps and anxiously asked:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, are you really going to plant that Ink Bamboo? I heard it's not easy to grow..."</p><p></p><p>He rambled on about what everyone had discussed earlier. After listening, Chu Ning calmly said:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your concern, Shunyi. I'll give it a try. If it really doesn't work out, I'll just have a smaller harvest this season."</p><p></p><p>"Aiya, you've already gotten the seeds anyway."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi sighed and didn't say much more, then remembered something and said:</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Senior Brother Zhuang asked you to wait here. He'll come get you after taking the others first."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning, who was worried about not knowing who to find, hurried back to his room to pack up his belongings after hearing this.</p><p></p><p>When he came out with his things packed, he found that Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin had also returned from the fields.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning come out, Shang Zhaoxiang smiled and spoke first:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, I heard from Shunyi. Congratulations! The top-grade spiritual fields in Area D that you got total 2 mu more than ours."</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang's words made Cao Dongxin's expression even more complicated.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were also planting 10 mu of spiritual fields in Area D, but only 3 mu were top-grade, 5 mu were mid-grade, and 2 mu were low-grade.</p><p></p><p>Now, Chu Ning's starting point was higher than theirs.</p><p></p><p>This was a long-standing rule of the sect - more resources would be tilted towards disciples with strength or potential.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning cupped his hands towards the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you both senior brothers for your guidance during this time."</p><p></p><p>While Shang Zhaoxiang spoke polite words, Cao Dongxin wanted to say something conciliatory to make up for his previous harshness towards Chu Ning, but ultimately couldn't bring himself to do it.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning couldn't be bothered to care about him either.</p><p></p><p>Although Cao Dongxin had been strict over the past three months, forcing him to work in the fields had allowed him to discover the benefits of the Green Wood Spring Technique for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Zhuang Yunde arrived, and Chu Ning bid farewell to the three of them.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, a slight smile appeared on Zhuang Yunde's round face as he asked lightly:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu chose to plant Ink Bamboo, so you must have gained some understanding of the Green Wood Spring Technique, right?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning didn't try to hide it and admitted directly:</p><p></p><p>"I've just begun, but I still need more practice."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I noticed Junior Brother's proficiency in the Catalyzing Technique and Purification Technique. They seem to be highly compatible with wood-attribute cultivation methods. </p><p></p><p>By the way, does Junior Brother's choice to plant this Ink Bamboo mean you're interested in the art of talisman making?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately became guarded and asked in return:</p><p></p><p>"Why does Senior Brother ask?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled, "This Ink Bamboo is not easy to grow, so very few people choose it.</p><p></p><p>Junior Brother has only just joined the sect recently. If you weren't interested in talisman making, why would you think of this thing?"</p><p></p><p>This time, however, Chu Ning didn't admit it. Instead, he shook his head and said:</p><p></p><p>"I only heard that Ink Bamboo can be used to make talisman paper and has a good yield, so I wanted to try it. But I have no understanding of talisman making at all."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhuang Yunde smiled again, "No need to rush. Let's see first how Junior Brother's Ink Bamboo turns out."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart stirred. Did Zhuang Yunde's words carry some hidden meaning?</p><p></p><p>But after saying that, Zhuang Yunde didn't continue on that topic. Instead, he talked about other things to pay attention to when cultivating a personal spiritual field.</p><p></p><p>Then, after showing Chu Ning his spiritual field and courtyard, he left directly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhuang Yunde off, Chu Ning looked up at his own private courtyard, a slight smile appearing on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I have my own plot of land. Oh no, not a plot - ten mu!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

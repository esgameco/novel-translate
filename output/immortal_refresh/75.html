        <h1>Chapter 75</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and the other person rode on the wind, walking at a good pace. </p><p></p><p>In just half an incense stick's time, they covered over ten li and arrived.</p><p></p><p>The twenty mu spiritual field was located between two small hills, relatively isolated.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, Chu Ning was very satisfied with it. </p><p></p><p>Such a relatively isolated place was perfect for him.</p><p></p><p>After all, in addition to regular farming, he still needed to cultivate using the Green Wood Spring Technique.</p><p></p><p>His only concern was safety.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning turned his head and asked Du Han:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Du, this spiritual field is over ten li away from the town. I don't know if this area is safe."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's cautious look, Du Han slightly frowned.</p><p></p><p>But he still answered Chu Ning's question.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, the hills around this spiritual field are also spiritual fields belonging to a few cultivator families like the Sun family, who are subordinate to our Green Creek Sect."</p><p></p><p>"They have patrol teams patrolling the area every day."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded and confirmed with him again: </p><p></p><p>"So no one will try to steal my spiritual plants at night, right?"</p><p></p><p>Du Han frowned again, "I said there are people patrolling here."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this spiritual field belongs to our Green Creek Sect. Everyone in the Yan Ji Town area knows this. </p><p></p><p>No rogue cultivators would dare target our Green Creek Sect."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Du Han glanced at Chu Ning,</p><p></p><p>"Besides, don't you have formation arrays set up in your Spiritual Plant Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning listened and nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual field did indeed have simple formation arrays set up, just like the ones in the sect.</p><p></p><p>However, these arrays were extremely basic, which could be broken through with just a talisman.</p><p></p><p>They only prevented noble people, not malicious ones.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they only guarded against very low-level cultivators or mortals trespassing.</p><p></p><p>That's why Chu Ning asked so clearly about it.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out the array plate from his body, about to directly enter the spiritual field.</p><p></p><p>Du Han spoke from the side: "Take a look if you want, I'll head back first."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Du isn't going to take a look?" Chu Ning stopped and asked.</p><p></p><p>Du Han waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"How you cultivate this spiritual field is up to your Celestial Arts Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>If you want to look, stay. If not, leave with me now."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought for a moment and said, "Then Senior Brother Du can head back first, I still need to see what to plant in this spiritual field."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Du Han didn't say much more and turned to leave directly.</p><p></p><p>Only after Du Han left did Chu Ning slightly shake his head.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, he did miss interacting with Zhuang Yunde and He Changfeng from the same pavilion back at the sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, they were from the same pavilion and had some friendship.</p><p></p><p>But soon, Chu Ning dismissed this thought.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Plant Pavilion also had people like Cao Dongxin and Qi Chongmao - the world has all kinds of people.</p><p></p><p>Walking into the spiritual field, Chu Ning carefully sensed it again.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen the Grade B spiritual fields in the sect, but the spiritual qi quality here was indeed higher than the Grade C field where he took the advancement test before.</p><p></p><p>With twenty mu of land, what should he plant?</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning began contemplating. First, he definitely had to plant spirit bamboo for making talismans.</p><p></p><p>After all, he himself needed large quantities of talisman paper to make talismans.</p><p></p><p>With the quality of this spiritual field, he didn't need to plant ink spirit bamboo, but could plant purple crystal bamboo instead.</p><p></p><p>Purple crystal bamboo was also a premium material for making talisman paper, with far lower impurities than ink spirit bamboo.</p><p></p><p>The same bamboo stalk could produce up to fifty to seventy percent more pulp.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the difficulty of cultivation was correspondingly higher.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, for Chu Ning at this time, there was not much difficulty in planting.</p><p></p><p>"Ten mu to grow purple crystal bamboo, first to meet my own talisman-making needs." Chu Ning immediately made up his mind. </p><p></p><p>Before coming, he had brought bamboo seeds of ink spirit bamboo and purple crystal bamboo, intending to see the situation of the spiritual field afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Now that he found the spiritual field level was sufficient, naturally there was no hesitation in growing the purple crystal bamboo.</p><p></p><p>"Another 10 mu..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered for a moment, not making a direct decision.</p><p></p><p>Most of the disciples from the Spirit Plant Pavilion previously grew spirit-returning spiritual grass. </p><p></p><p>This spiritual grass is an excellent medicinal material for refining spirit-returning pills, which can be sold to the Pill Refining Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning was not sure if Gu Xiaoqing was also refining those spirit-returning pills for sale.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and discuss with Senior Sister Gu. If she still needs to refine spirit-returning pills, then I'll grow spirit-returning spiritual grass. If not, I'll consider other options."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought to himself, no longer dwelling on the matter of the 10 mu.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he took out the purple crystal bamboo seeds from his storage bag and began the catalytic planting process.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if he used the Green Wood Revitalization Technique, it would take him a few months for the purple crystal bamboo to mature enough for making talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not want to delay any time.</p><p></p><p>The purple crystal bamboo seeds were slightly more difficult to catalyze than the ink spirit bamboo, but still easier than the bloodwood tree.</p><p></p><p>So for Chu Ning, it was not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of the bloodwood tree, Chu Ning also had its seeds, but this spiritual plant was difficult to catalyze, and its absorption of spiritual energy was not fast, requiring a very long growth time.</p><p></p><p>It was not suitable for practicing the Green Wood Revitalization Technique, so it was not within Chu Ning's consideration.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out the purple crystal bamboo seeds, first using the Object Driving Technique to evenly scatter the seeds, then casting several catalytic spells.</p><p></p><p>Soon, small purple bamboo shoots emerged from the ground in this field.</p><p></p><p>In the span of one hour, Chu Ning had completed planting 3 mu of the spiritual field.</p><p></p><p>This speed was much faster than when he previously planted the ink spirit bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the time of day, it was already noon, so Chu Ning left the spiritual field directly.</p><p></p><p>No matter how diligent one is, one still needs to eat.</p><p></p><p>After all, at the Qi Refining stage, he could not yet practice fasting cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He returned by riding the wind along the path he came.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Chu Ning saw that there were indeed some spiritual fields nearby, which must be the lands of the Sun Family and other clans that Du Han mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Chu Ning returned to the market street.</p><p></p><p>He came to his own shop, but before he could open the door, he heard two consecutive "creak" sounds as the doors of the neighboring shops opened.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping and Lu Miaoying from the Spirit Beast Pavilion next door, as well as Gu Xiaoqing across the street, all came out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their gazes were all directed towards Chu Ning, clearly indicating they had something to discuss with him.</p><p></p><p>The few of them exchanged glances, seeming surprised that the others also wanted to find Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the more impatient Luo Yiping spoke first.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, you're back. We've been waiting for you for half a day."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Luo Yiping's address, Chu Ning frowned inwardly but calmly asked, "Senior Brother Luo, you were looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping nodded, then said to Chu Ning, "Let's go inside to talk."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then opened the shop door and went straight in, followed by Luo Yiping, Lu Miaoying, and Gu Xiaoqing.</p><p></p><p>Before they could say anything, hearing the commotion, Shen Zhengquan also came in curiously.</p><p></p><p>For the time being, everyone had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning was puzzled inwardly, but did not take the initiative to speak.</p><p></p><p>Since these people had come to find him, they would naturally state their business.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, Luo Yiping spoke first.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, let me tell you something."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

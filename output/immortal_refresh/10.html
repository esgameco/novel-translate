        <h1>Chapter 10</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>There was no conversation that night.</p><p></p><p>The next morning after getting up, Chu Ning first practiced the Nine Ox Tempering Body technique, then started a fire to make breakfast. </p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning finished making breakfast, Cao Dongxin also came out of his room.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Chu Ning at first glance, Cao Dongxin was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Although his cultivation base was not high, he was still a cultivator who had been at the fifth level of Qi Refining for a long time, so he had a certain sensitivity to fluctuations of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The aura around Chu Ning, completely different from an ordinary mortal before, faintly emanating spiritual energy fluctuations, immediately made Cao Dongxin realize something.</p><p></p><p>"You've condensed your Qi?" Cao Dongxin asked in a rather complicated tone.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning inwardly laughed, but timely revealed a hint of excitement on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Martial Brother. Last night's cultivation was very insightful. I seized the opportunity and somehow managed to condense my Qi."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Cao Dongxin didn't say anything more, but the complicated look in his eyes only deepened.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious emotion was envy.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cao Dongxin kept muttering to himself:</p><p></p><p>"Fifteen days? This kid condensed his Qi in just fifteen days, and that's even with me depriving him of cultivation time. Is the difference between a four-attribute spirit root and a five-attribute one really that big?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin clearly remembered that initially, he had tried countless times and it took him over two months to finally condense his Qi.</p><p></p><p>Comparisons are odious.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could naturally sense the envy in the other party's eyes, but he pretended not to notice and smiled to himself, then sat down to eat.</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself, if this Senior Martial Brother Cao knew that he had actually condensed his Qi on the very first day, and the spiritual energy he was revealing now was just intentionally leaked out, he would probably be so shocked that his eyes would pop out.</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin ate that day's breakfast without any taste.</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning proposed going to the Cultivation Technique Hall today, Cao Dongxin did not try to stop him much.</p><p></p><p>It was a rule of the sect that new disciples could go to the Cultivation Technique Hall for lectures every half month, and no matter how much Cao Dongxin wanted to oppress him, he didn't dare to deprive Chu Ning of this right.</p><p></p><p>When the two arrived outside the courtyard, Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi from the neighboring courtyard also came out.</p><p></p><p>This time, Qiu Shunyi didn't follow behind Shang Zhaoxiang, but walked ahead of him.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing Chu Ning, he greeted him excitedly, "Chu Ning, let's go to the Cultivation Technique Hall."</p><p></p><p>"It seems Qiu Shunyi succeeded in condensing his Qi last night," Chu Ning judged upon seeing his demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to respond, Shang Zhaoxiang suddenly spoke with a smile, "Congratulations, Junior Martial Brother Chu!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning knew that Shang Zhaoxiang had seen through his cultivation level, so he cupped his fist in salute and said, "Thank you, Senior Martial Brother Shang. It was just by chance."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi was a little confused and asked, "Senior Martial Brother Shang, what are you congratulating?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I'm congratulating Junior Martial Brother Chu for condensing his Qi and officially entering the first level of Qi Refining, just like you," Shang Zhaoxiang said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiu Shunyi looked at Chu Ning in surprise and asked, "Chu Ning, you've also condensed your Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly, "Just by chance."</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang smiled and continued, "There's no such thing as chance on the path of cultivation. Junior Martial Brother Chu has given us all a pleasant surprise without saying a word."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Shang Zhaoxiang also inwardly mused.</p><p></p><p>"I had already given Shunyi ample time for cultivation, yet this Junior Martial Brother Chu was also able to condense his Qi within the same period of time.</p><p></p><p>Either his talent is much better, or he persevered diligently in his practice.</p><p></p><p>He was assigned to the Ding District, so his talent is probably average at best. To be able to find so much time to cultivate under Cao Dongxin's oppression, he must be a rather perseverant person."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning was unaware of Shang Zhaoxiang's thoughts. Since the other party's words didn't need a response, he just smiled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the look of delight and pride on Qiu Shunyi's face had clearly faded. He muttered:</p><p></p><p>"I was going to boast to you about condensing my Qi, but I didn't expect you to have done the same."</p><p></p><p>Previously, after hearing Shang Zhaoxiang's praise, he felt quite proud because this Senior Martial Brother Shang had taken a month to condense his Qi, while he was twice as fast.</p><p></p><p>Now...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Knowing that Chu Ning had also completed cultivating qi into his body, the sense of pride instantly vanished. </p><p></p><p>After all, he knew that many times when he started cultivating, Chu Ning was still doing chores.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Qiu Shunyi's words, both Chu Ning and Shang Zhaoxiang smiled, this Qiu Shunyi really had a childish side.  </p><p></p><p>After splitting into pairs, Shang Zhaoxiang and Cao Dongxin went to the fields, while Chu Ning and Qiu Shunyi headed towards the Skill Transmission Room.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi's thoughts were relatively simple. Although his sense of pride diminished a little, he didn't have any other thoughts about Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>On the way, he shared with Chu Ning the things he had heard from Shang Zhaoxiang before.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, Senior Martial Brother Shang specifically instructed that those who haven't cultivated qi into their bodies would definitely focus on asking the skill-transmitting disciples about sensing spiritual qi and cultivating qi into the body this time.</p><p></p><p>As for us who have already entered the first level of qi cultivation, we can ask the skill-transmitting disciples more about techniques.</p><p></p><p>It's best to let them teach us basic techniques first, and then we can practice slowly after returning.</p><p></p><p>These skill-transmitting disciples have a deeper understanding of techniques compared to Senior Martial Brother Shang and the others."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi said this, and then added:</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, Senior Martial Brother Shang said that currently the four techniques we need to learn the most are the ones required for cultivating spiritual plants: the Catalyzing Technique, Purification Technique, Sweet Rain Technique, and Blade Technique. </p><p></p><p>Then, we can focus on learning the first three techniques, because three months later if we are assigned to the spiritual fields for planting, we'll need to use these three first. The Blade Technique is only used during the harvest."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made a note of these, feeling grateful that thanks to the enthusiastic Senior Martial Brother Shang Zhaoxiang and the simple-minded Qiu Shunyi telling him these things, otherwise Cao Dongxin wouldn't tell him anything and he would really have to take many detours.</p><p></p><p>So, he sincerely said to Qiu Shunyi: "Shunyi, thank you for the reminder."</p><p></p><p>"Thank me?" Qiu Shunyi was puzzled at first, then immediately grinned. "Hey, what's there to thank? It's not like I said it myself."</p><p></p><p>The two arrived at the Skill Transmission Room, which was the skill transmission venue within the Baiyi Hall, and the skill-transmitting disciples were sent from the Sect's Skill Transmission Hall.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and the others, as new disciples and menial disciples, naturally did not have enough status to directly go to the Skill Transmission Hall to learn techniques.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, they ran into quite a few fellow disciples who had entered together before. Chu Ning observed that a small portion had entered the qi cultivation stage.</p><p></p><p>Upon arriving at the Skill Transmission Room, there were already several skill-transmitting disciples inside.  </p><p></p><p>The first thing Chu Ning and the others needed to check was whether they had completed cultivating qi into their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Those who had completed it were classified into one group, while those who hadn't cultivated qi into their bodies were classified into another group.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Chu Ning and the small group being taken away separately, the remaining disciples who hadn't completed cultivating qi into their bodies looked envious, accompanied by their low murmurs of discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Just half a month and they've cultivated qi into their bodies, even compared to outer sect disciples they're not much slower!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard the person from the Spirit Beast House took only ten days to cultivate qi into his body, catching the sect's attention. They said if his progress in the middle stages of qi cultivation is decent, he can enter the outer sect and become an outer sect disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"I heard that although he has a four-attribute spiritual root, his earth spiritual root is much better than the other three spiritual roots, so that's why he has such rapid cultivation progress."</p><p></p><p>"That's a genius! It's pitiful for us, we don't know when we'll be able to cultivate qi into our bodies."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Hearing these discussions, Qiu Shunyi and the others beamed with delight, their faces unable to conceal their joy. Among them, a thick-browed and big-eyed youth even had a hint of arrogance on his face.</p><p></p><p>This person was the one they mentioned from the Spirit Beast House, named Lin Yong.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Chu Ning kept a low profile.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning was silently estimating the number of people and found that this group he was in was about one-fifth of the total number, immediately putting his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>His "breakthrough" at this timing was not abrupt. If he chose to breakthrough later, he could only listen to the technique explanations today and not practice any techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now, the timing was just right, not too early or too late.</p><p></p><p>As for displaying one's cultivation talent like Lin Yong and having the opportunity to enter the outer sect, Chu Ning had never thought about it.</p><p></p><p>His four-attribute pseudo-spiritual root had a very ordinary talent assessed, and none of the spiritual roots had any particular advantage. If he suddenly showed too rapid cultivation speed, wouldn't that be blatantly telling others that he had a big secret?</p><p></p><p>Before figuring out the secret of the spiritual body, he still couldn't reveal for now that he possessed the Inmu spiritual body, lest it lead to unnecessary complications.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

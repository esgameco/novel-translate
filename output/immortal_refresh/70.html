        <h1>Chapter 70</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, the one in charge of the Yanjiting area is Lin Changqing, an executive from the Foreign Affairs Hall. This executive has a rather cold personality and is not easy to get along with. However, if it's convenient for you shidi, you might as well take some spirit talisman papers from him."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde stopped there and did not continue further. However, Chu Ning quickly understood. That executive seemed to have a different personality from the executives he knew, He Changyou and Liao Yunming, but rather was somewhat similar to this Shixiong Zhuang.</p><p></p><p>After thanking Zhuang Yunde again, Chu Ning left his courtyard and headed towards Mu Ling's courtyard. </p><p></p><p>Mu Ling happened to be in the courtyard today. As soon as Chu Ning entered, he cupped his fist in salutation, saying, "Thank you Shijie Mu for informing me of the news in advance..."</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so courteous," Mu Ling waved her hand, then tilted her head slightly, staring straight at Chu Ning with her bright eyes. "I heard you have a good talent for talisman-making. Uncle Liao actually accepted you into the Talisman Pavillion and taught you the talisman-making techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Executive Liao was too kind," Chu Ning hurriedly replied with humility, not mentioning that he had also obtained the talisman scriptures.</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Ling shook her head like a pendulum drum. "I don't believe it. Uncle Liao has a discerning eye. Your talent in talisman-making must be exceptional."</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Chu Ning to speak, she immediately continued, "Here's what we'll do. Draw a Gengjin Sword Talisman for me to see, and I'll know for sure."</p><p></p><p>"Gengjin Sword Talisman?" Chu Ning shook his head. "I don't know how to make that."</p><p></p><p>"You don't know the Gengjin Sword Talisman?" Mu Ling frowned slightly. "This is clearly a talisman that all disciples of the Talisman Pavillion must learn. Many of the talisman tasks issued by the Pavillion include this one."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Mu Ling took out a pale golden paper made of an unknown material from her storage bag and handed it to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning examined it carefully. After looking at it, he became even more certain that he had never learned this talisman scripture before.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie Mu, I really haven't learned this talisman," Chu Ning said, but Mu Ling shook her head again.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it. You must be pretending. Unless you draw it for me to see, otherwise I'll tell Aunty that you deliberately sold me talisman papers."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's expression immediately changed. Without further ado, he went to Mu Ling's talisman-making table, picked up a talisman brush, and began drawing.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that the making of this Gengjin Sword Talisman was indeed complex, surpassing any talisman scripture Chu Ning had learned before. On his first attempt, he failed halfway through.</p><p></p><p>"Is this talisman really a mandatory talisman-making technique for the Talisman Pavillion? It seems so difficult," Chu Ning thought to himself at this moment.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not dwell on it too much right now. Having been immersed in talisman-making recently, he immediately became interested when unexpectedly encountering this challenging talisman scripture.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning calmed his mind, infused his spiritual power into the talisman brush once more, and began attempting the talisman-making again.</p><p></p><p>The second and third attempts failed in succession.</p><p></p><p>This made Chu Ning take it seriously.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense carefully sensed the flow of the talisman lines, not allowing his spiritual power to waver in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Although the speed was a bit slow, under the combined effects of his various abilities, he eventually completed the tracing of the final talisman line.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning lifted his brush, a golden light flashed above the talisman paper, taking the shape of the talisman lines he had just drawn.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the golden light sank entirely into the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>"I finally succeeded!" Chu Ning nodded in satisfaction, preparing to start on the next talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently raising his head, he saw Mu Ling staring at him with her little mouth agape, an expression of utter astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"You...you actually completed the making of this Gengjin Sword Talisman on only the fourth attempt?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling's voice carried a tone of disbelief, but even more so, an extremely complex emotion.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning also realized that something was amiss, so he hurriedly stopped and asked, "Senior Sister Mu, is there something improper? What is the origin of this Gengjin Sword Talisman?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning realized that a talisman of this difficulty could not possibly be a basic required learning at their Lingfu Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling was still slightly tilting her head up, but her gaze towards Chu Ning became extremely complicated. </p><p></p><p>"I lied to you earlier. This Gengjin Sword Talisman is not a talisman passed down in our Lingfu Pavilion, but was given to me by Grandaunt."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this Gengjin Sword Talisman is a mid-grade junior talisman with extremely strong destructive power. It is already vaguely comparable to some lower quality senior junior talismans. It is said to have the reputation of being the number one offensive junior mid-grade talisman."</p><p></p><p>"A junior mid-grade talisman?" Chu Ning was somewhat dazed, and from Mu Ling's introduction, it seemed incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"I spent two months but was unable to successfully create it, but you..."</p><p></p><p>As Mu Ling said this, her tone contained both envy and a sense of loss.</p><p></p><p>"You actually succeeded after only four attempts! It turns out your talent in talisman making is truly this strong."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Mu Ling laughed at herself in a self-deprecating manner.</p><p></p><p>"No, it turns out my talent in talisman making is truly this poor. No wonder they didn't want me to waste talisman paper."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mu Ling who seemed utterly dejected, Chu Ning temporarily didn't know what to say to console her.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to try to comfort her, the originally despondent Mu Ling suddenly seemed like she had an adrenaline rush.</p><p></p><p>"No, I still have to practice. I refuse to believe that I cannot learn this damned talisman. If I'm not cut out for cultivation, does that mean I'm not cut out for talisman making either?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Mu Ling had already swiftly come to Chu Ning's side. Then, before Chu Ning could react, she thrust out her chest, tilted her head up and asked, "Do you have anything else to do?"</p><p></p><p>"Oh, oh, nothing important," Chu Ning hurriedly made way.</p><p></p><p>Then he quickly stated his original purpose, taking out 1500 sheets of talisman paper and placing them on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mu, the sect has arranged for me to go to an outer town market, so I may not be able to buy talisman paper for you in the future."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Mu Ling was slightly stunned, but then immediately said, "It's fine, Grandaunt has returned to the sect, so I probably won't be confined anymore. I can go to the town market to buy some myself."</p><p></p><p>"This Gengjin Sword Talisman has immense destructive power and will definitely be very popular for sale in the market. Since you've already learned it, consider it a gift from me."</p><p></p><p>After listening, Chu Ning hesitantly asked, "What about Elder Mu's side..."</p><p></p><p>"It's just a junior mid-grade talisman. How would a Golden Dan cultivator take it to heart?" Mu Ling said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, she began taking up blank talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning thanked her again before taking his leave.</p><p></p><p>As he walked out of the courtyard, Chu Ning vaguely heard a mumbling voice coming from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Is this talisman really that difficult? If others can create it, why can't I..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning couldn't help but inwardly chuckle wryly. "This senior sister is truly crazy."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how he had just feared she would be dejected and tried to console her, he couldn't help but shake his head.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, his gaze fell upon the Gengjin Sword Talisman in his own hand.</p><p></p><p>The number one offensive junior mid-grade talisman, it sounded quite powerful.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling said to sell it in the town market, but Chu Ning felt it was better not to.</p><p></p><p>But creating some for his own use shouldn't be a problem, right?</p><p></p><p>Imagining himself casually waving his hand to release a torrent of Gengjin Sword Qi, the corners of Chu Ning's mouth couldn't help but reveal a hint of a smile.</p>

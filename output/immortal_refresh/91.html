        <h1>Chapter 91</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator, you can see the entire auction hall from this room. If you are interested in any item, you can directly bid on it. Our rooms all have restrictive spells." </p><p></p><p>The attendant led Chu Ning into the room and stood outside, speaking:</p><p></p><p>"If you win an item, it will be transmitted through that circular platform in front. You can place the corresponding spirit stones on it."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded to show he understood, then remembered something else and asked the attendant:</p><p></p><p>"What if there is nothing suitable for me at this auction?"</p><p></p><p>The attendant smiled: "You can find me directly after the auction, or tell me if you want anything specific now. I can check if such items are among the auction goods. If not, I can help you acquire them first."</p><p></p><p>Hearing how convenient this was, Chu Ning immediately said: "In that case, please keep an eye out for any flying artifacts and books with comprehensive introductions to spiritual beasts."</p><p></p><p>Pausing, Chu Ning added: "Also pay attention to any spirit pills or medicines that can strengthen the spiritual sense."</p><p></p><p>The attendant's expression remained normal at the first part, but showed a hint of surprise at the mention of pills to strengthen spiritual sense. Clearly, he was quite curious that a Condensing Qi cultivator like Chu Ning would ask about such things.</p><p></p><p>However, the surprise quickly passed, and his expression returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>The attendant replied and left. Chu Ning then curiously examined the small room.</p><p></p><p>Previously at Qinghe Alley, he had sensed that these small rooms at Cloud Sea Pavilion had a layer of restrictive spells on the first floor, blocking prying eyes and altering sounds.</p><p></p><p>Now, he wanted to take a closer look.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked around and found the small square room was only about 10 feet across. Three walls seemed made of some unknown metal, while the front wall facing out was a transparent material, seemingly made of glazed tiles.</p><p></p><p>A faint glow emanated from the tiles, clearly some kind of restrictive spell responsible for the blocking effects.</p><p></p><p>"Although this spell blocks outside observers, these rooms on the second floor are not far apart. If one pays a little attention when entering or exiting, one can still see the people inside," Chu Ning mused.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, may I come in?" The attendant's voice came from outside.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning responded, the attendant entered and handed him a jade slip.</p><p></p><p>"Our manager says since you came with a Foundation Establishment senior, you are an esteemed guest. This jade slip contains basic information about the auction items, including the beast books you mentioned. Please take a look first, and call me if you need anything."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took the jade slip, and after the attendant left, immediately examined it.</p><p></p><p>Browsing the information, Chu Ning felt a mix of delight and worry.</p><p></p><p>He was delighted to find that this auction did indeed have a flying artifact - the Wind-Chasing Shuttle, a high-grade shuttle-shaped artifact. According to the jade slip, it was made with high-quality materials and inscribed with layered wind talismans, allowing extremely fast flight speed. </p><p></p><p>However, as a rare high-grade flying artifact, the starting bid was 700 spirit stones - not a small sum.</p><p></p><p>"Originally I just wanted to see if there were any mid-grade flying artifacts to buy for use. But now this auction has a high-grade one appearing. The competition will be fierce, and I'll likely have to spend quite a lot of spirit stones," Chu Ning mused, but was still determined to obtain the Wind-Chasing Shuttle, as it was the only flying artifact in this auction.</p><p></p><p>As for books introducing spiritual beasts, the jade slip showed there were none in this auction. However, Cloud Sea Pavilion did offer two reference books - one called Thousand Beast Illustrations, mainly describing the habits and traits of various beasts and demons, priced at 200 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The other, called Hundred Beast Manual, detailed the cultivation methods for 100 spiritual beasts but cost a steep 2,000 low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning decided that if buying, he would only get Thousand Beast Illustrations, as he only wanted to look up information on Spirit Beast White, not cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning saw the information on spirit pills for strengthening spiritual sense, he shook his head. According to the jade slip, even among Foundation Establishment cultivators, such pills were extremely rare and priced at tens of thousands of spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>This caused Chu Ning, who had originally considered buying some pills to accelerate his Spirit Condensing practice, to immediately abandon the idea.</p><p></p><p>However, another item in the jade slip caught Chu Ning's interest. Before he could finish reading about it, a light ringing sounded.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw a middle-aged man in a brocade robe appear on the circular platform between the first and second floors.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivators, I am Bai Shuangquan, the host of this Cloud Sea Pavilion auction."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The auction was about to officially begin. </p><p></p><p>After a simple opening remark, the auction officially started.</p><p></p><p>The first auction item that Bai Shuangquan brought out was a high-level defensive magic treasure. Chu Ning had already seen the relevant information before. </p><p></p><p>He knew that although this was a high-level magic treasure, it was more suitable for use with water-attribute cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning immediately lost interest.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the high-level water-attribute defensive magic treasure was auctioned off to a cultivator for 1,150 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, defensive magic treasures are more valuable than offensive ones. And the starting price for this flight magic treasure is even 100 spirit stones higher than the defensive one..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning inwardly grumbled endlessly. </p><p></p><p>He remembered at the previous Qinghe Alley auction, the final transaction price for the high-level metal-attribute offensive magic treasure he saw was only 700 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>For the next few auction items, Chu Ning had also seen them early on. </p><p></p><p>Since they were not what he needed, Chu Ning did not bid.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh auction item is the Wind-Chasing Shuttle, a flight-type magic treasure for single person use. The starting bid is 700 spirit stones, with a minimum increase of 50 spirit stones each time..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Bai Shuangquan's voice, Chu Ning perked up. Here it comes.</p><p></p><p>"750 spirit stones!" A voice immediately rang out as Bai Shuangquan's words fell.</p><p></p><p>"800 spirit stones!" "850 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Various increasing bids followed one after another.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt an itch hearing them. </p><p></p><p>His original intention was not to bid first, to prevent others from driving up the price.</p><p></p><p>But his not bidding didn't mean others wouldn't.</p><p></p><p>After five or six people bid, the price quickly exceeded 1,000 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning also joined the bidding, otherwise it would be too conspicuous if too few people were left.</p><p></p><p>"1,050 spirit stones!" Chu Ning said, but what came out externally was a somewhat thick voice.</p><p></p><p>"1,100 spirit stones!" Another voice followed.</p><p>"1,150 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning waited a breath or two, then said, "1,200 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>To Chu Ning's surprise, the voice changed again, sounding older this time.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly made Chu Ning feel pensive.</p><p></p><p>"This voice-changing formation is quite interesting. The voice is different each time, and the direction varies too. </p><p></p><p>It seems the little flaw I thought of before was something Cloud Sea Pavilion had already anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Even if the transaction is successful in the end, it's unknown which room the bid came from."</p><p></p><p>There was a brief silence on site at this point. </p><p></p><p>Bai Shuangquan's voice rang out again, "1,200 spirit stones, any other cultivators want to bid higher?"</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, another voice responded:</p><p></p><p>"1,250 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning sighed inwardly and calmly said:</p><p></p><p>"1,300 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The scene fell silent again. Bai Shuangquan continued asking: "1,300 spirit stones, any other cultivators want to bid higher?"</p><p></p><p>He asked twice, but there was no response this time.</p><p></p><p>"1,300 spirit stones, sold."</p><p></p><p>As Bai Shuangquan's words fell, Chu Ning inwardly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose of this trip was finally achieved, even though the Wind-Chasing Shuttle's price was driven up to 1,300 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Although he had some wealth now, he couldn't help but feel a slight pang.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, a circular tray appeared in front of Chu Ning with a black shuttle-shaped magic treasure on it.</p><p></p><p>After examining it, Chu Ning took out 1,300 spirit stones from his storage pouch and placed them on the tray.</p><p></p><p>The tray then transmitted away again.</p><p></p><p>Having acquired the Wind-Chasing Shuttle, Chu Ning naturally no longer paid much attention to the next few items.</p><p></p><p>His focus was now on the fifteenth auction item.</p><p></p><p>The auction proceeded one item after another, quickly finishing the first fourteen items.</p><p></p><p>Bai Shuangquan's voice soon rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"The fifteenth auction item is a volume of the Illusion Transformation Technique. After cultivating this technique, one can freely change one's appearance and voice.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that this technique cannot conceal or change one's aura fluctuations. The starting bid is 300 spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning's eyes lit up slightly.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely one of the items he was very interested in when browsing the jade slip earlier.</p><p></p><p>His Yinmu Spirit Body had the innate ability to conceal his aura. If he wished, he could even completely suppress his aura to become an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>However, he always felt that if he could combine it with something to change his appearance, the effect would naturally be better.</p><p></p><p>And this Illusion Transformation Technique undoubtedly matched Chu Ning's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"300 spirit stones," Chu Ning directly bid the starting price.</p><p></p><p>Someone else then bid, "330 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning waited two breaths, and seeing no other bids, he followed up, "360 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because this Illusion Transformation Manual could not conceal or change one's aura, others were not interested.</p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how ordinary cultivators changed their appearance, once their aura was sensed, they would still be identified.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning's bid this time, there were no more bids.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning successfully acquired this Illusion Transformation Technique volume for 360 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Chu Ning's cultivation became highly targeted. </p><p></p><p>Previously, he had allocated part of his time to cultivating life-saving techniques like the Golden Sword Art, Thorny Art, and Rattan Armor Art, but now he set all of those aside.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the coming period, he did not plan to go out.  </p><p></p><p>He could stay within the sect's protective bounds, farming and cultivating in peace.</p><p></p><p>The only thing he needed to do was to continually cultivate the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art.</p><p></p><p>During the day, Chu Ning stayed almost the entire time in the fields of black spirit bamboo. In the evenings, he would sit in the courtyard full of rattan vines, unceasingly cultivating the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art.</p><p></p><p>When his spiritual power was depleted, he would cultivate the Green Wood Evergreen Skill to recover it, and then continue cultivating the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art.  </p><p></p><p>If he became too fatigued from those two, he would cultivate one or two rounds of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Mantra.</p><p></p><p>His entire body would immediately recover to peak condition, and then he would resume cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he felt his body had reached its limit, Chu Ning would get sufficient rest through sleep.</p><p></p><p>Under Chu Ning's bitter day-and-night cultivation like this,</p><p></p><p>Seven days later,</p><p></p><p>In the upper-grade spirit fields of Area D,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stood before the black spirit bamboo. Without forming any hand seals, he casually raised his hand and a spell struck several stalks of the bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his face showed a few hints of delight.</p><p></p><p>"Green Wood Spring Bloom Art, instant cast!"</p><p></p><p>The exceptionally familiar Green Wood Spring Bloom Art had finally been fully mastered,</p><p></p><p>Reaching the level of instant casting, becoming his innate spiritual power technique!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not hesitate further, digging up quite a bit of spirit soil from the fields.</p><p></p><p>He then immediately returned to a corner of the rear courtyard of his residence.</p><p></p><p>This corner was already surrounded by rattan vines, forming a small shelter.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning prepared all the spirit soil, and carefully took out the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seedling from his jade box to plant in the soil.</p><p></p><p>He then continuously cast spells, instantly releasing the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art onto the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seedling.</p><p></p><p>He cast a full ten spells before stopping.</p><p></p><p>Half a quarter hour later, the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art took effect, rapidly gathering spiritual energy towards the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit seedling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, Chu Ning finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He exited the rattan shelter and carefully looked it over before putting his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>Unless someone deliberately inspected closely, in general no one would discover that such a rare spirit plant was being grown in this rear courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As for why he did not choose to plant it in the spirit fields, first the fields were not strictly within the sect's grand formation protections.</p><p></p><p>But also, Zhuang Yunde mentioned that the Supervisor of the Spirit Plant Chamber, He Changyou, would go inspect the growth of the black spirit bamboo in the fields.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was worried that if planted there, it could be detected.</p><p></p><p>Instead, in this rear courtyard, normally no one would come under regular circumstances.</p><p></p><p>In fact, apart from Qiu Shunyi and Zhuang Yunde, in general few would come looking for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>His neighboring fellow disciple Qi Chongmao would often be seen, but mostly in the fields or outside Chu Ning's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Up until now, the two had never entered each other's residences.</p><p></p><p>It seemed cultivators were innately unwilling to have others access their cultivation grounds.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Chu Ning remained secluded, living an existence that went between his residence's courtyard and the spirit fields, focused solely on</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The fruits were the same as the ones he had seen at Old Man Sun's place, totaling seven. </p><p></p><p>Each Seven Star Spirit Fruit tree only bore seven fruits, no more no less, which was quite miraculous.</p><p></p><p>Different from what he saw in Old Man Sun's courtyard back then, these Seven Star Spirit Fruits were much smaller in size, but their color was much deeper.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could clearly sense that their quality was higher than the one Old Man Sun had cultivated.  </p><p></p><p>As for the reason, Chu Ning guessed it was because he had used the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique to help them absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth from the very beginning of planting.</p><p></p><p>During these one hundred days, Chu Ning had performed the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique ten times consecutively every day.</p><p></p><p>In order to avoid affecting the growth and quality of the Seven Star Spirit Fruits, he had never used the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique to cultivate by borrowing from the Seven Star Spirit Fruits.</p><p></p><p>Although the Seven Star Spirit Fruits had better absorption of spiritual energy, even better than the Ink Spiritual Bamboo by a lot.</p><p></p><p>But every day when Chu Ning cultivated in the courtyard, he would go to another corner and cultivate by borrowing from the Iron Vine.</p><p></p><p>"In about three more months, these Seven Star Spirit Fruits should be ripe," Chu Ning roughly calculated the time.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning started walking out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Spirit Fruits were not ripe yet, but the Spirit Rice and Ink Spiritual Bamboo were almost ripe, and it was the harvest season.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Spirit Rice, it had ripened to the point where it had to be harvested immediately.</p><p></p><p>As he walked out, Chu Ning sank his mind into his consciousness to observe his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Everspring Technique (Yellow Realm Lower Grade), Second Layer (167/900)]  </p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Volume, Immortal Skin 97/300]</p><p></p><p>After about three months of cultivation, there had been obvious progress in both his technique and body refining.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the Green Wood Everspring Technique was still stable. Every day, Chu Ning could feel the improvement. At this moment, his realm had reached the late stage of the fourth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could feel that when the second layer reached around 200, he would be able to reach the peak of the fourth level and prepare to break through to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>"This second layer of the Green Wood Everspring Technique, it seems the proficiency is not as evenly distributed as in the early stages of Qi Refining. Could it be that the fourth level is 200, the fifth level 300, and the sixth level 400?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning vaguely felt this might be possible, because if added up, the proficiency would be exactly 900.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it was true or not, he could only verify it when he reached those later stages of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Chu Ning a little was that the cultivation of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual was not as difficult as he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>He persisted in cultivating it every day, perhaps even less time than the Green Wood Everspring Technique.</p><p></p><p>And it was also without the assistance of the Yin Wood Spirit Body and the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, but in terms of proficiency increase, it was very close to gaining 1 point of proficiency per day.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I am naturally suited to walk the path of body refining?" Chu Ning couldn't help but silently mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, Chu Ning dismissed this thought.</p><p></p><p>After all, apart from possessing the Yin Wood Spirit Body which made him suitable for cultivating wood-type spells, he did not see any talent in other aspects of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>During this period, his Thorn Technique and Vine Armor Technique had been cultivated to the point where he could cast them instantly.</p><p></p><p>But for spells of other attributes, the progress was really not good.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Golden Sword Technique could only be described as turtle-speed, and Chu Ning was considering giving it up because the cost-effectiveness was too low.</p><p></p><p>He had spent a lot of time on it but made almost no progress.</p><p></p><p>As for the Rain of Nectar Technique, Blade Edge Technique, Fireball Technique, and the newly learned Drying Technique for making talisman papers, the progress was also very average.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chu Ning's energy was limited, so he did not spend too much time cultivating these spells.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Rain of Nectar Technique, Blade Edge Technique, and Fireball Technique were only cultivated to a barely usable level.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did refine the Drying Technique quite a bit, which was naturally in preparation for making talisman papers later.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning first went to the high-grade spirit fields in Area D.</p><p></p><p>The Ink Spiritual Bamboo was planted a few days later, and it did need a little more time to grow.</p><p></p><p>After taking a look, Chu Ning left for the mid-grade spirit fields where the Crimson Spirit Rice was planted.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had just walked out of the high-grade spirit fields for a while when he encountered a group of people coming towards him, which made him slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

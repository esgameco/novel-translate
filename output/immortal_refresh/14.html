        <h1>Chapter 14</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This guy is really too reckless!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed, but did not dodge. He swiftly formed hand seals and also released a Blade Technique!</p><p></p><p>"Clang!"</p><p></p><p>The two blade forces formed from their techniques collided like metal striking metal, making a loud sound. In the next moment, the blade force released by Qiu Shunyi disappeared directly. </p><p></p><p>However, the blade force released by Chu Ning flew straight forward, slicing through a few stalks of crimson spirit rice before finally dissipating.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Qiu Shunyi finally let out a sigh of relief and hurriedly said with an apologetic look:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, I'm sorry, I...I don't know what came over me just now."</p><p></p><p>However, after witnessing Chu Ning's technique, Qiu Shunyi realized that what Shang Zhaoxiang had said was true. He looked at Chu Ning with envy and said:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, you really did reach the second level of Qi Refining? We completed Body Refining together, but I haven't even reached the threshold of the second level yet."</p><p></p><p>"It was by chance, maybe the Evergreen Wood Cultivation Technique suits me better," Chu Ning casually made up an excuse. </p><p></p><p>Of course, he could not tell the other party that he had already reached the threshold of the fourth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what he said was not entirely false. His Innate Spiritual Body was more suited to cultivating wood-type techniques and spells, so he was indeed more compatible with the Evergreen Wood Cultivation Technique.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's explanation made the other three present believe him to some extent. It was true that technique compatibility existed.</p><p></p><p>It was just that one generally did not know until after actually cultivating the technique.</p><p></p><p>They could only lament that Chu Ning's luck was good.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning and Cao Dongxin left, Shang Zhaoxiang also sighed again:</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the second level of Qi Refining in three months. Although it can't be compared to those disciples with outstanding talents, it's still very good among the servant disciples.</p><p></p><p>After the assessment in a few days, Chu Ning should be able to get a decent spirit field, so he may not have to grow our crimson spirit rice anymore."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Qiu Shunyi's gaze also held a hint of envy once more.</p><p></p><p>They now all knew that the better the spirit field and spirit plants, the higher the income they could bring.</p><p></p><p>But for him now, no matter what, he could not catch up, because there were only four days left until the assessment.</p><p></p><p>While the two were sighing, Chu Ning was also feeling that he seemed to need to practice more spells.</p><p></p><p>Especially offensive and defensive spells.</p><p></p><p>Just now, Qiu Shunyi's reckless Blade Technique was barely blocked by his own Blade Technique thanks to his quick reaction.</p><p></p><p>But after all, the Blade Technique was not his forte.</p><p></p><p>He should find wood-type spells to cultivate, as he would grasp those faster.</p><p></p><p>The four days passed in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Everyone gathered together again, and He Changyou, who had sent Chu Ning and the others here three months ago, appeared with Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>"Executive He!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the greetings, He Changyou nodded, then surveyed the nearly thirty people.</p><p></p><p>His gaze then fell directly on Chu Ning and another person named Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>"You two have reached the second level of Qi Refining? Not bad!" A hint of a smile appeared on He Changyou's face.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing He Changyou's words, the remaining twenty-eight people, including Qiu Shunyi, all cast envious looks towards Chu Ning and the other person.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had noticed earlier that there was another new disciple who had also reached the second level of Qi Refining from the same Body Refining batch, and he secretly breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>This way, he would not appear too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>He had to reveal the second level of Qi Refining, because only then could he obtain the complete Evergreen Wood Cultivation Technique.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning had always been a bit worried that revealing his cultivation level might be too fast, making him stand out too much.</p><p></p><p>Now it seemed alright.</p><p></p><p>Being one of two was different from being the only one.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou's voice came again:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's start the test and see how well you've grasped the spells. First, the Catalyzing Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, He...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Changyou distributed a seed to everyone in the morning. </p><p></p><p>"This is the most basic red spirit rice grain. You've all grown it before. You just finished harvesting the early rice, and the late rice planting season is coming up. Try catalyzing it."</p><p></p><p>After Changyou said this, everyone took the red spirit rice seed in their hands and began using the catalyzing technique. </p><p></p><p>The red spirit rice seed is a relatively easy spirit plant to catalyze. Chu Ning was already proficient in the catalyzing technique. This time, he had reserved some spiritual power, but appropriately revealed his spellcasting abilities.</p><p></p><p>He had made up his mind before coming that he would demonstrate his abilities in catalyzing, purification, and the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique.</p><p></p><p>However, his skills with the Sweet Dew Technique and the Blade Edge Technique were weaker.</p><p></p><p>He aimed to create an image that was well-suited to the Green Wood Longevity Technique and wood-type spells. As long as it wasn't too abnormal, the sect wouldn't be too suspicious. In fact, it would help with what he wanted to do next.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Chu Ning's red spirit rice seed was the first among everyone to sprout and break through the shell, and then it continued growing.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>At He Changyou's voice, the expressions on everyone's faces varied.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few people, most had completed the catalyzation, but most had only catalyzed the seedling sprouts.</p><p></p><p>The best at catalyzing were still Chu Ning and Yuan Guang. Chu Ning's seedling was almost an inch long, while Yuan Guang's was close to half an inch.</p><p></p><p>After He Changyou recorded the results, he began testing the other spells.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning still performed best in the purification technique, but for the Sweet Dew and Blade Edge Techniques, he was a bit worse than Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>The two were about evenly matched in their spell performance.</p><p></p><p>At this point, He Changyou began announcing the final results.</p><p></p><p>"Of the thirty people tested, twenty-two passed. Chu Ning, Yuan Guang, Chen Youdao, Zhang Hui, Qiu Shunyi..."</p><p></p><p>After listing the 22 names, the remaining 8 people's faces immediately fell. He Changyou didn't pay them any mind and waved his hand, saying:</p><p></p><p>"You all go back first and continue cultivating under your senior martial brothers. You'll be tested again in a year."</p><p></p><p>"Apart from Chu Ning and Yuan Guang, the remaining 20 people will be allocated 5 mu of spirit fields by the sect - 3 mu of lower-grade fields in Area D and 2 mu of mid-grade fields for growing red spirit rice."</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning and Yuan Guang will each be allocated 10 mu of spirit fields - 5 mu of upper-grade and 5 mu of mid-grade fields in Area D."</p><p></p><p>He Changyou's words naturally made the other 20 people extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>Not only did Chu Ning and Yuan Guang receive double the spirit field allocation of the others, but they also started with mid-grade fields in Area D. Their treatment was completely different.</p><p></p><p>After saying this, He Changyou looked at Chu Ning and Yuan Guang again.</p><p></p><p>"You should both have some understanding of spirit plants by now. What spirit plants are you planning to grow?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Guang was clearly prepared for this and immediately said with a delighted expression: "Executive He, I plan to grow purple yam fruit and spirit rice."</p><p></p><p>He Changyou nodded. These were two relatively common spirit plant varieties in the upper and mid-grade fields of Area D.</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Chu Ning and asked, "What about you, Chu Ning?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered for a moment before replying: "Executive He, I'll grow spirit rice in the mid-grade fields, but in the upper-grade fields, I want to grow ink bamboo."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, He Changyou was slightly surprised. Ink bamboo was the raw material for making ordinary talisman paper. Its cultivation difficulty was much greater than purple yam fruit. Usually, only those with many years of cultivation experience in Area D would choose it.</p><p></p><p>He frowned slightly. "Are you sure you want to choose ink bamboo?"</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning nodded, He Changyou didn't say anything more. Regardless of which spirit plant was chosen, there were still contribution quotas to the sect.</p><p></p><p>He then took out two booklets from his storage bag and handed them to Chu Ning and Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>"According to the rules, after reaching the second level of Qi Refining, you can obtain the complete version of the Green Wood Longevity Technique..."</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning heard this, he quickly reached out and took it.</p><p></p><p>The small booklet was the same as the one Chu Ning received when he first joined the sect, titled 'Green Wood Longevity Technique', but it was clearly much thicker.</p><p></p><p>"This is the complete Green Wood Longevity Technique, including the fourth level techniques!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

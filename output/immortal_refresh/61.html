        <h1>Chapter 61</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Hechang You looked at Chu Ning with an astonished gaze. If there weren't still a few people making talismans at this moment, he would have gone over to Chu Ning immediately to take a look. </p><p></p><p>However, soon the remaining few people also finished their last talisman paper. Hechang You didn't even wait, flashing to appear by Chu Ning's side.</p><p></p><p>"You successfully made 5 talismans?"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying Hechang You's action and his voice, all eyes in the practice ground instantly turned towards Chu Ning with a "shua" sound. Those gazes were full of shock.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in this practice ground had been exposed to the wood talisman technique for the past five days, deeply aware of how difficult it was to learn from scratch and improve the success rate.</p><p></p><p>Even a 40% or 30% success rate would have been enough to surprise them. But now, Hechang You said that Chu Ning's talisman success rate had reached 50%. How could they not be shocked!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed inwardly. After the last talisman succeeded, he realized that he would probably stand out again this time. But he didn't expect even Hechang You to react so strongly.</p><p></p><p>His thoughts flashed quickly in his mind, and in the next moment, the look of bewilderment on Chu Ning's face quickly turned into one of delight.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning now appeared extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"The second and third ones succeeded, and I felt like I was in a really good state. I didn't expect to succeed on another 3 after that."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's words, the practice ground immediately erupted in a hubbub of voices.</p><p></p><p>"This kid's luck is too good!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, after succeeding consecutively twice, one's whole mentality changes."</p><p></p><p>"I can usually succeed on 3, but it's because I failed the first 3 consecutively that I only succeeded on 2 in the end."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Amidst this discussion, Hechang You nodded slightly, and then his voice rang out in the entire practice ground.</p><p></p><p>"Luck and mentality are both important factors for a cultivator's success. The rules are the same for everyone. First place is first place, there's no such thing as luck."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Hechang You handed the 5 talismans back to Chu Ning, flashed, and returned to the front.</p><p></p><p>"Now I'll announce the results of this talisman competition. First place is Chu Ning with a 50% success rate. Second place is Xie Cai Tian with a 40% success rate..."</p><p></p><p>Hechang You recited ten names in total. The last three had a 20% success rate.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining 17 people, 10 succeeded on only one talisman, and 7 didn't succeed on even a single one.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, for those not yet very proficient at talisman-making, the environment and pressure of this competition caused most people to underperform.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that the gazes people cast towards Chu Ning contained some envy, despite Hechang You having just said that luck was also part of one's ability.</p><p></p><p>But most people still felt that Chu Ning had just gotten lucky.</p><p></p><p>The five who had been promoted from Area D looked at each other, their eyes filled with complex emotions.</p><p></p><p>They had all been promoted from Area D together, and Chu Ning was the one with the lowest cultivation among the six of them.</p><p></p><p>But if Chu Ning learned this talisman technique, the cultivation resources allocated to him in the future might far surpass theirs.</p><p></p><p>Not giving the people in the practice ground too much opportunity to reveal their complex emotions, Hechang You waved his hand after announcing the top ten.</p><p></p><p>"You ten, come with me to the Talisman Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Thus, under the envious gazes of the crowd, Chu Ning and the others followed Hechang You out of the practice ground, heading towards the outer gate.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning's group entered the outer gate, they saw Zhuang Yun De coming out from inside.</p><p></p><p>"Executor He!"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yun De first respectfully saluted Hechang You, then his gaze swept over the people behind him.</p><p></p><p>When his eyes landed on Chu Ning, he paused slightly.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Immediately, it seemed like he understood something, and he nodded at Chu Ning with a smile on his face. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled back in response.</p><p></p><p>With so many people around, it was not appropriate for Chu Ning to have a private conversation with him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Changfeng also nodded in response to Zhuang Yunde, and then led Chu Ning and the others to continue walking forward.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the group arrived in front of a grand hall. </p><p></p><p>This was not Chu Ning's first time coming to the outer door, but previously he had only come to see Zhuang Yunde and Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>He had never even been to the Baiyi Hall, let alone the Lingfu Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It was only after he had entered the sect for some time that he learned about them.</p><p></p><p>Although the Baiyi Hall was called the Hall of Hundred Arts, specialized halls were separately established for disciplines like talisman-making, artifact forging and array formations.</p><p></p><p>There was a Pill Refinement Hall for pill refinement, an Artifact Forging Hall for artifact forging, and the Lingfu Pavilion for talisman-making.</p><p></p><p>The group arrived at the five-story Lingfu Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning and the others could stand outside and take a good look, He Changfeng led everyone directly into the pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Liao!"</p><p></p><p>He Changfeng cupped his fist in greeting towards a middle-aged scholar who was engrossed in reading a book in the main hall.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged scholar did not seem too particular about his appearance, with his scholar's robe casually fastened, not looking very scholarly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing He Changfeng, he shifted his gaze from the book to Chu Ning and the others behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Are these the students selected by the Baiyi Hall for talisman studies?"</p><p></p><p>"These are disciples from the Spirit Plant House who have shown some talent in talisman-making," He Changfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then he turned to Chu Ning and the others and said, "This is Liao Yunming, the Executor of the Lingfu Pavilion. Come and pay your respects."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing He Changfeng's words, Chu Ning and the others stepped forward and cupped their fists in greeting.</p><p></p><p>After receiving their greeting, the middle-aged scholar did not speak to Chu Ning and the others. Instead, he asked He Changfeng, "What talismans did these people test, and how talented are they?"</p><p></p><p>"They tested the Wood Talisman. Their talents are not bad," He Changfeng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"In five days, the success rate of these three in making the talisman reached twenty percent. The success rate of these five reached thirty percent. This one, named Xie Caitain, had a success rate of forty percent."</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming's gaze swept over everyone impassively. However, when he heard that Xie Caitain's success rate reached forty percent, his gaze lingered on him for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked at Chu Ning with a hint of doubt, seemingly puzzled as to why He Changfeng did not introduce him.</p><p></p><p>"I have also brought an exceptional talisman talent," He Changfeng said with a hint of pride, pointing at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, in five days, his success rate in making the Wood Talisman reached fifty percent."</p><p></p><p>"Fifty percent?" Liao Yunming's gaze showed some surprise, and he even put down the book in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Are you kidding me? Or has he had any prior exposure to talisman-making?"</p><p></p><p>He Changfeng shook his head and laughed, "Do you think I would joke about something like this? This junior brother of ours joined the sect a little over a year ago. He was cultivating in Area D until recently when he was promoted to Area C.</p><p></p><p>I have already looked into it. He did learn the art of making talisman paper, but he has never been exposed to the art of talisman-making itself."</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming stood up directly, his gaze sweeping over Chu Ning as he muttered, "Fifty percent, to achieve such a success rate in talisman-making in such a short time... Even in the Lingfu Pavilion, very few have such talent."</p><p></p><p>After muttering, Liao Yunming suddenly turned his head and spoke to a young man in the corner of the main hall, "Tan Zhang, take these nine junior brothers from the Spirit Plant House to select some basic talisman manuals.</p><p></p><p>I want to see this junior brother's talisman-making skills for myself. If he truly has such talent..."</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming did not finish his sentence, but his words clearly implied that he intended to treat Chu Ning differently.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

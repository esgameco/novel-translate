        <h1>Chapter 35</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning walked for a little while and quickly arrived at Zhuang Yunde's residence. </p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu has come? Have you come to hand in talisman papers?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde warmly welcomed Chu Ning into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not immediately ask him about Mu Ling, but first took out the talisman papers he had brought to hand over to the sect.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde took the bundle of talisman papers handed over by Chu Ning, carefully looked them over, counted them, and then nodded with a smile:</p><p></p><p>"The quality of the talisman papers is superb, and the quantity is exactly 3,500 sheets, not bad. Junior Martial Brother Chu has completed his yield for this season."</p><p></p><p>However, Zhuang Yunde's next sentence left Chu Ning somewhat taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Did Junior Martial Brother Chu encounter Junior Martial Sister Mu Ling on the way?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, you knew about it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Let me first tell you about this Junior Martial Sister Mu Ling's situation.</p><p>This Junior Martial Sister Mu Ling is a junior from Elder Mu's lineage, and this Elder Mu is one of the few Golden Dan elders in our sect."</p><p></p><p>"A Golden Dan elder?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning gasped, with just those words from Zhuang Yunde, he understood Elder Mu's status.</p><p></p><p>A Golden Dan elder was not the same as the Elder Chen who had brought them into the sect before, that Elder Chen was at the Foundation Establishment realm, only an elder of the Dharma Transmission Hall.</p><p></p><p>But a Golden Dan elder, that was an elder of the entire sect, the strongest force of the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had also heard Zhuang Yunde casually mention that he only knew of 4 Golden Dan elders in the sect currently.</p><p></p><p>"Then why is she in the Hundred Arts Hall?" Chu Ning was slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>As a Golden Dan elder, her status in the sect naturally could not be compared to ordinary people, it would be easy for a junior to enter the inner sect.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, she was initially in the inner sect," Zhuang Yunde answered.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that Mu Ling's aptitude was really not that great. After cultivating for a few years with slow progress in her realm, she lost interest in cultivation.</p><p>Instead, she started studying other skills, and then became obsessed with talisman making."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde said this and shook his head:</p><p></p><p>"But her aptitude for talisman making was also average, with a low success rate.</p><p>Yet she insisted on constantly making talismans, wasting a lot of talisman paper, not to mention the poor effects.</p><p>After Elder Mu found out, he demanded that the Hall limit the talisman paper provided to Mu Ling, to let her focus on her cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning's expression became somewhat strange.</p><p>He could hardly imagine how low Mu Ling's success rate was, and how much she had practiced, that even the Hundred Arts Hall had to limit her talisman paper supply.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde then continued: "Later, she started buying talisman paper from the market instead.</p><p>But recently, with Elder Mu away and Mu Ling previously getting into trouble outside and being confined by Elder Mu, she couldn't go out to buy talisman paper."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning finally had a rough guess about his encounter today, so he said to Zhuang Yunde:</p><p></p><p>"So Senior Martial Brother Zhuang leaked the information about me making talisman paper to her?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde's small eyes smiled at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"I think it's a win-win situation. You should know that when handing in talisman paper to the sect for recycling, you only get 1 spirit stone for every 55 sheets, and the price is even lower in the market.</p><p>If Junior Martial Brother Chu sells the talisman paper to Mu Ling, I'm sure it's not at that price, right?"</p><p></p><p>"She gave 50 sheets of talisman paper for 1 low-grade spirit stone," said Chu Ning, taking out 11 spirit stones from his pocket and handing them over to Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde took them, his eyes squinting even more from his smile.</p><p></p><p>"You see, it was just a matter of a few words, I earned an extra spirit stone, and Junior Martial Brother Chu also earned several more spirit stones. Why not do it?</p><p>If Junior Martial Brother has more talisman paper, you can sell it to her again."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning sighed and shook his head, "Today I brought all the talisman papers I made, the over 1,000 sheets that were my share..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"The talisman papers were also bought by the other party."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, there's still next season, right?" Zhuang Yunde revealed a harmless expression on his face. </p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu had a lot of practice this time. If he makes talisman papers again next season, he will naturally be more skilled and able to earn more spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately cupped his hands respectfully towards Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Senior Brother's kindness. If I truly make progress, I will certainly not forget Senior Brother's guidance."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhuang Yunde smiled even more happily.</p><p></p><p>After chatting idly for a while, Chu Ning finally left Zhuang Yunde's residence and walked back.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu!"</p><p></p><p>After taking just a few steps, Chu Ning ran into Mu Ling again.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Mu!" Chu Ning became even more polite.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling jogged over in front of Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu should also know my identity. I want to ask Junior Brother for a favor."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt increasingly troubled. To be honest, after learning of Mu Ling's formidable background, he instinctively wanted to keep his distance respectfully.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Senior Sister Mu looked like she would bring trouble no matter how you viewed her. With such a powerful backer, he could not afford to offend her.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he said in a very modest way:</p><p></p><p>"I'm just an ordinary disciple. I'm afraid I can't be of much help to Senior Sister."</p><p></p><p>"You can help with this." Mu Ling didn't seem to notice the polite refusal in Chu Ning's words and quickly continued.</p><p></p><p>"Just buy me a thousand talisman papers every month. I'll provide the spirit stones and pay you for your trouble. I'll also give you this storage bag."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning looked at her suspiciously.</p><p></p><p>"Just this?"</p><p></p><p>"Just this!" Mu Ling nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Although it would be quite troublesome to buy a thousand at the market every month. You may need to go to several shops, and sometimes you may not be able to buy enough in one go and need to make multiple trips."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Mu Ling seemed afraid that Chu Ning would refuse, so she immediately waved the storage bag in her hand.</p><p></p><p>"But it's okay, I'll give you one-tenth of the spirit stones as a reward each time."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning was immediately tempted. For him, this was like a pie falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>What's so difficult about buying a thousand talisman papers a month? He himself still had several thousand left.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning still didn't quite believe that such a good opportunity would fall into his lap.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning raised his own doubts.</p><p></p><p>Why him?</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling immediately explained: "Junior Brother Chu, you can make talisman papers, so you naturally won't make mistakes in judging their quality.</p><p></p><p>The other senior brothers and sisters at the Baiyi Hall can also judge, but they're all very busy and may not be able to go to the market every month.</p><p></p><p>As for other outside disciples, they can't just enter freely. Junior Brother Chu, you're really the most suitable candidate."</p><p></p><p>After this explanation and recalling what Zhuang Yunde said about Mu Ling's personality, Chu Ning basically believed her.</p><p></p><p>So he revealed a slightly hesitant look and said:</p><p></p><p>"Since Senior Sister thinks so highly of me, then I'll help run these errands."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Ling happily handed the storage bag to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Then take this storage bag. There are 22 spirit stones inside, 20 for buying talisman papers, and 2 as compensation for your trouble.</p><p></p><p>Bring the talisman papers to me on this day next month."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, without waiting for Chu Ning to say anything more, she quickly turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I need to go practice talisman making!"</p><p></p><p>Leaving Chu Ning alone, slightly disheveled in the wind.</p><p></p><p>It seemed...he had been hired on a monthly basis?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

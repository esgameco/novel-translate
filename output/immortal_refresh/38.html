        <h1>Chapter 38</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sat down in an empty seat along with Qiu Shunyi and others. At this time, more cultivators were still arriving in the main hall one after another. </p><p></p><p>Later on, Chu Ning also saw that higher-level cultivators kept coming, and they were all respectfully invited upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked up and saw that there was a ring of small rooms all around the second floor. </p><p></p><p>Those small rooms faced the front of the main hall and had only a layer of thin, transparent gauze, but Chu Ning couldn't see anything inside them.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, these small rooms all had certain restrictive spells cast on them.</p><p></p><p>And those sitting up there were the true participants of this auction.</p><p></p><p>After sitting for a while, a slender and beautiful young lady in a purple Daoist robe slowly walked out onto the round platform at the front of the main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Daoists, welcome everyone to the auction held at the Yunhai Pavilion. I am Si Konglan, the host of this auction. </p><p></p><p>Our auction is about to begin, please give your generous support."</p><p></p><p>The lady's voice was not loud, yet Chu Ning felt like she was speaking right next to his ear, hearing it extremely clearly. Her cultivation was evidently profound.</p><p></p><p>The others seemed to realize this too. The previously noisy main hall instantly became quiet.</p><p></p><p>Si Konglan smiled charmingly towards the crowd below, then waved her hand, causing a long brocade box to appear on the table on the platform.</p><p></p><p>"The first item up for auction is a set of Golden Feather Swords, a high-grade metallic spiritual tool.</p><p></p><p>Apart from being a high-grade spiritual tool itself, its true value lies in being a nested set of swords, which can greatly increase its might when used properly.</p><p></p><p>The starting bid is 400 low-grade spirit stones, with each raise no less than 30 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>When Si Konglan said this, it immediately made cultivators like Chu Ning who were attending for the first time inwardly gasp.</p><p></p><p>The starting price for the first spiritual tool was already 400 spirit stones, which was truly unaffordable for low-rank disciples like them.</p><p></p><p>"450 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Si Konglan's voice fell, a voice immediately came from one of the small rooms upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Although the voice was clear, the person speaking gave Chu Ning an ethereal feeling, making him quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"480 spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, another voice responded, giving Chu Ning the same ethereal sensation as before.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning naturally realized that the restrictive spells in these small rooms even processed the voices.</p><p></p><p>"The Yunhai Pavilion really does a good job protecting the privacy of cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought to himself. If he had enough spirit stones in the future, he could consider coming to the Yunhai Pavilion's auctions to buy some treasures.</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning was thinking this, after several raises, this set of metallic spiritual tools was sold to a cultivator for 700 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"700 spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this price, Chu Ning calculated inwardly, then sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Among the new disciples, and even all the disciples in the Ding District, he was one of the highest earners due to his Yin Body's wood element bonus for spells, plus his Talisman Source Body's talent for talismans.</p><p></p><p>Currently, he only had 52 spirit stones and 5,250 talismans in his possession. </p><p></p><p>Of those, 1,000 talismans were supposed to go to Mu Ling, leaving only 4,250 for him to sell later.</p><p></p><p>Even if he sold all of them to Mu Ling at 5 spirit stones per 250 talismans, that would only give him 85 spirit stones, totaling 135 spirit stones with what he had - his entire income for a season.</p><p></p><p>His average spiritual field could only grow spirit rice for two seasons plus one season of purple spirit grass, giving him limited income.</p><p></p><p>The spirit ink bamboo could only be harvested twice a year, so in his current state, the most he could earn from farming in a year was around 300 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Now, a single set of spiritual tools was worth more than his entire yearly income from farming.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>More than two years' worth of income. </p><p></p><p>This was because he was a special existence among the new disciples. If it were people like Qiu Shunyi, it's unknown how many years it would take to obtain so many spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"It's really difficult for a low-level disciple to become outstanding," Chu Ning inwardly sighed.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking that it was a high-grade magic treasure, he felt relieved. </p><p></p><p>Most of these were for cultivators at the Foundation Establishment stage.</p><p></p><p>The auction in the venue continued. </p><p></p><p>The second auction item Sikong Lan took out was a rare spirit herb, with a starting price of 300 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Although this spirit herb was good, it was not as rare compared to magic treasures. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, such rare spirit herbs often need to be refined into pills to fully unleash their effects. A single spirit herb has limited uses.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the competition was not that fierce. </p><p></p><p>Eventually, a cultivator won it with 500 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Sikong Lan successively took out a few more items - pills, magic treasures, spirit herbs, spell manuals - it was all-encompassing.</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of value, they were mostly under 1,000 spirit stones, allowing Chu Ning to roughly gauge the scale of this auction.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, for more precious items worth over 1,000 spirit stones, even if Cloud Sea Pavilion auctioned them externally, they might not choose such a large-scale auction venue.</p><p></p><p>"The next auction item is slightly more precious - a Talisman Crafting Manual.</p><p></p><p>This Talisman Crafting Manual mainly covers low-grade talismans, including the crafting methods for 3 types of low-grade talismans, but it also includes two mid-grade offensive and defensive talismans.  </p><p></p><p>The starting price is 600 spirit stones! Each bid must increase by at least 50 spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Sikong Lan's words on stage, Chu Ning's heart couldn't help but race.</p><p></p><p>Talisman crafting manual!</p><p></p><p>After learning how to make talisman papers, the next thing he wanted most was to learn talisman crafting.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not easy to obtain from the sect, at least he had not heard of any servant disciples who had it.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, one appeared in this market town.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning's racing heart instantly cooled when he heard the price.</p><p></p><p>600 spirit stones, even if he sold himself, he couldn't raise that many spirit stones now, and this was just the starting price, the final deal would definitely be higher.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning expected, as soon as Sikong Lan finished speaking, the cultivators on the second floor immediately started bidding.</p><p></p><p>This Talisman Crafting Manual kept rising in price, eventually being sold for 1,000 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>It became the first item in the venue to reach 1,000 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>However, it was understandable when one thought about it - as one of the four arts of pills, talismans, magic treasures and formations, talisman crafting was relatively more accessible.</p><p></p><p>If one could really learn it, earning spirit stones would not be slow.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it even included two methods for mid-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>And the bidders were still only those few people.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that these higher-level cultivators upstairs had all come into contact with the talisman art before and knew whether they were suited to learn it or not.</p><p></p><p>If everyone could use it, the price would obviously be higher.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Chu Ning sighed at his lack of connection to this item and turned his gaze back to the stage.</p><p></p><p>He saw that Sikong Lan was now holding up a small transparent cover, with a small jade box inside.</p><p></p><p>As Sikong Lan used her magic to open the jade box, the item inside revealed its true appearance.</p><p></p><p>Upon seeing this item, Chu Ning's expression suddenly became somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Sikong Lan's voice rang out in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"The next auction item is the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

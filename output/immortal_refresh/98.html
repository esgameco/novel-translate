        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>What caused Chu Ning's brows to furrow slightly was whether it was due to the consecutive two battles that had drained him too much, or if these few people were really that poor. </p><p></p><p>On Liu Laodan and the effeminate youth, Chu Ning could hardly find many things on them.</p><p></p><p>The few low-grade talisman papers were not worth Chu Ning's attention, as they were not as well-drawn as the ones he could casually sketch.</p><p></p><p>The only things of some use were more than twenty low-grade spirit stones, as well as Liu Laodan's iron hammer. </p><p></p><p>It looked like a mid-grade magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>The effeminate youth's spiked baton was only an initial-grade magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>With this, Chu Ning's interest in searching the yellow-faced man also greatly diminished. </p><p></p><p>He began to approach Sun Laodan's corpse.</p><p></p><p>At the start, when Sun Laodan alone blocked the attacks of the three people, he had indeed used some decent things.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention some talisman papers, there was currently a black shield and a golden dagger beside Sun Laodan's body.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had seen Sun Laodan use these two magic weapons earlier, so they should be quite good, but unfortunately, under the siege of the three people, these two magic weapons had been damaged.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head, then began to take out Sun Laodan's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention other things, if he wasn't mistaken, the blood mist grass should be in Sun Laodan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out Sun Laodan's storage bag, erased the markings on it, opened it, and took out everything inside.</p><p></p><p>What first caught Chu Ning's eyes were a few jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>Almost without a second thought, he opened the jade boxes, and his eyes immediately lit up with delight.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the jade boxes contained blood mist grass.  </p><p></p><p>After a quick count by Chu Ning, there were as many as eighteen stalks.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these eighteen stalks of blood mist grass were over a foot long, with broad leaves, and their color was as red as blood.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, they were already very mature.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the blood mist grass, Chu Ning began to look at the other things.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, there weren't many things in Sun Laodan's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Originally, after seeing Sun Laodan's battle with the few people, Chu Ning thought that despite his lower cultivation level, he should have some good things in his storage bag to be able to last that long.</p><p></p><p>But what surprised him was that inside, there were only two initial mid-grade talisman papers for the Escape Technique, without a single attack or defense talisman paper left.</p><p></p><p>There were no other magic weapons or items either, and there were only a dozen or so spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning blinked his eyes, slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, since Sun Laodan had a shop in Qing He Fang, he shouldn't have such a meager net worth.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning thought of another possibility.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this Sun Laodan was just the person in charge of a cultivating family there, and the things in the shop didn't entirely belong to him.</p><p></p><p>"According to what Du Han had told him before, there was a Sun Family affiliated with the Qing Xi Sect nearby, and they owned quite a few spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Sun Laodan was the shopkeeper of the Sun Family in Qing He Fang?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, it made sense.</p><p></p><p>"But that's not right either. Even if he had sold those seven-star spirit fruits initially, he should have earned more than just this.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that in this past year or so, he had spent all those spirit stones?"</p><p></p><p>No one answered Chu Ning's guesses, so he simply stopped thinking about it further.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the spirit stones, Chu Ning's gaze fell on the last item.</p><p></p><p>A jade plaque that seemed to be of decent quality.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning picked it up and saw that this jade plaque seemed to have some kind of restrictive spell on it.</p><p></p><p>And on it were engraved two large characters: Cloud Sea.</p><p></p><p>Sensing this somewhat familiar restrictive spell and seeing these two words, Chu Ning almost immediately associated it with the Cloud Sea Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"A jade plaque from the Cloud Sea Pavilion, what is this used for?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stroked the jade plaque, his expression somewhat uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that this Sun Laodan had actually joined the Cloud Sea Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>If so, there might be some trouble.</p><p></p><p>But immediately after, Chu Ning shook his head again, it couldn't be that serious.</p><p></p><p>Even if Sun Laodan had sold a few seven-star spirit fruits to the Cloud Sea Pavilion, it still wouldn't be enough for him to join the Cloud Sea Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>This plaque might have another use.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning directly threw the jade plaque into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Standing up, Chu Ning then walked towards the yellow-faced man.</p><p></p><p>Looking at him, there was indeed a storage bag, but as Chu Ning expected, there was nothing particularly good inside either.</p><p></p><p>However, the short halberd he had thrown out earlier was still intact.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning picked it up and saw that it was also a mid-grade magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>After searching everyone's bodies, Chu Ning fired a few fireballs to completely cremate their corpses.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was about to head towards the spirit spring water, his gaze shifted.</p><p></p><p>Looking behind where the yellow-faced man was, there was a jet-black dagger stuck in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning clearly remembered that before Sun Laodan died, he had released a black light that pierced through the yellow-faced man's body.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for that, it would have been quite difficult for him to kill the three of them afterwards.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning walked up to the jet-black dagger, lightly picked it up, and sensed it briefly.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from the power this magic weapon displayed earlier, its grade is clearly very high.</p><p></p><p>It even seems higher than my own Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield, could this be a high-grade magic weapon? Or even a top-grade magic weapon?"</p><p></p><p>Holding this jet-black dagger, Chu Ning's expression was filled with shock and puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning tried infusing it with spiritual power, he found that there was no reaction at all.</p><p></p><p>Although this jet-black dagger had appeared to be of a very high grade earlier, now it...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense was completely gone, and now it seemed to be unusable. </p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this is a one-time use? So that's why the old man Sun didn't take it out?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered silently in his heart. </p><p></p><p>He tried sending spiritual power into it repeatedly, but the spiritual power simply could not enter the small knife.</p><p></p><p>After several attempts, he had to give up.</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure out the situation, he simply put the jet-black small knife into his storage bag as well.</p><p></p><p>He could only see if there would be an opportunity to figure out what was going on in the future.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Chu Ning finally came to the Spirit Spring water.</p><p></p><p>"The jade slip's description about this Spirit Spring water said that when combined with the Blood Mist Grass, it is one of the best treasures for body tempering. </p><p></p><p>Its effect lies in its all-around improvement of the physical constitution. Although the effect is not extremely good each time, the tempering process is relatively mild.</p><p></p><p>It's best if it can be soaked in for a long time."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning began recalling the introduction about the Spirit Spring water that he had read before.</p><p></p><p>If according to what was mentioned in the jade slip, it's best to use one stalk of Blood Mist Grass per day for continuous body tempering.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, I need to come here for over ten days in a row?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered softly.</p><p></p><p>After all, this Spirit Spring water could not be moved, and it would immediately lose its spiritual efficacy once taken out.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt that it was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Based on the conversation between those few people earlier, this place was extremely secluded, and only two people knew about it.</p><p></p><p>One was Old Man Sun, and the other was Old Liu Three who had died by his hand before.</p><p></p><p>Now, Old Man Sun was dead, and the three including Old Liu One who were with Old Liu Three's group had also died.</p><p></p><p>Those few seemed to be wandering cultivators. From what they said, they had been watching Old Man Sun for nearly a year, so they should have been acting together.</p><p></p><p>Judging from this, they probably didn't have any other accomplices.</p><p></p><p>After going over the matter in his heart, Chu Ning basically determined that staying in this mountain cave should not pose a big risk.</p><p></p><p>He immediately took out a stalk of Blood Mist Grass from the jade box.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Chu Ning also said to Spirit White, "Little White, go stand guard outside the cave. If anyone comes, quickly let me know."</p><p></p><p>Spirit White, who had been curiously watching Chu Ning destroy the corpses earlier, did not immediately act upon hearing these words.</p><p></p><p>"Wuu!"</p><p></p><p>Instead, it called out to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Want to eat!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Spirit White's words, Chu Ning laughed and scolded, "You little thing, you don't move unless there's something in it for you."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, Chu Ning did not hesitate and directly threw the stalk of Blood Mist Grass in his hand to Spirit White.</p><p></p><p>"Wuu!"</p><p></p><p>After letting out a happy cry, Spirit White quickly ate the Blood Mist Grass.</p><p></p><p>Then it waddled out of the cave.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning took out another stalk of Blood Mist Grass from the jade box and threw it into the Spirit Spring water.</p><p></p><p>Amazingly, after the Blood Mist Grass was thrown in, the previously calm water surface began to ripple slightly, while emitting wisps of hot air.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the Blood Mist Grass had completely dissolved and melted into the Spirit Spring water.</p><p></p><p>And the originally clear water that could see the bottom had now turned into a fresh blood-red color.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning reached his hand into the Spirit Spring water and felt that it was a bit hot, but not scalding.</p><p></p><p>He did not hesitate further, stripped off his clothes, and directly jumped into the crimson Spirit Spring water.</p><p></p><p>As his body soaked in the blood-colored Spirit Spring water, Chu Ning immediately felt an extremely comfortable warmth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the warm Spirit Spring water wanted to directly penetrate into his body.</p><p></p><p>"Comfortable!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could not help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention whether it could temper his body, just this unique experience of soaking in a hot spring was enjoyable enough.</p><p></p><p>After briefly marveling for a while, Chu Ning began to seriously sense and observe.</p><p></p><p>With his keen perception, he could detect thin threads of spiritual energy seeping through his skin and into his body.</p><p></p><p>The speed was not fast, but it was indeed happening.</p><p></p><p>And the blood-red Spirit Spring water was gradually becoming lighter in color during this process.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the temperature of the Spirit Spring water was slowly decreasing, while Chu Ning's body temperature was slowly rising.</p><p></p><p>After about an hour of this, the color of the Spirit Spring water had completely returned to normal, without a trace of red.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt a scorching sensation in his body.</p><p></p><p>He immediately leapt out of the Spirit Spring water and began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating like this for a while, when the scorching sensation in his body had completely disappeared, Chu Ning stopped.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning immediately checked the cultivation proficiency in his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Third Layer (2/2100)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Technique, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 254/600]  </p><p>[Refining the Divine Technique, First Layer 331/1000]</p><p></p><p>There was no change to the Green Wood Evergreen Skill and Refining the Divine Technique, but the proficiency in Imperishable Bones had increased by a full 3 points.</p><p></p><p>Wishing all reader daoists a happy New Year in advance, remember to support with monthly tickets tomorrow~</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 78</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Under normal circumstances, there would still be people coming to buy things at the Yan Ji Market even on closed market days, but not many. </p><p></p><p>The real crowds came on open market days.</p><p></p><p>Although it was still early, people had already gradually started coming to the market, creating a bit of liveliness.</p><p></p><p>As some cultivators and ordinary people walked along the market streets, they would occasionally point at a few shops and discuss.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingxi Sect's shop has opened."  </p><p></p><p>"Yeah, I heard they're going to switch out a batch of new disciples, so they were closed for two market days. Today they've finally reopened."</p><p></p><p>"Those must be the Qingxi Sect's disciples. That's one of the seven great sects of the Qingxia Mountain Range. If only we could become disciples there."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After hearing such discussions, Gu Xiaoqing, Luo Yiping, Shen Zhengquan, and Lu Miaoying couldn't help but show a hint of pride on their faces.</p><p></p><p>As one of the seven great sects of the Qingxia Mountain Range, the Qingxi Sect's reputation was indeed resounding.  </p><p></p><p>Although the few of them were only outer sect disciples, it was undoubtedly far better than being from an ordinary cultivating clan or just a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even for the cultivating clans affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, if someone could enter the sect as an outer disciple, it would be considered a matter of pride.</p><p></p><p>If it was an inner sect disciple, that would be an even greater achievement.</p><p></p><p>So at this moment, as people passed by on the street and looked at them, most had envious expressions.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the discussions, people also noticed the closed spirit emblem and spirit plant shops nearby.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, why are those two shops still not open?"</p><p></p><p>"Those are the Spirit Emblem Pavilion and Spirit Plant House. Maybe they haven't arranged for staff yet."</p><p></p><p>Initially discussing were two middle-aged men. After their conversation was overheard, a curious teenager around 17 or 18 years old asked:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Qingxi Sect is no longer doing business in those two areas?"</p><p></p><p>One of the taller middle-aged men shook his head and said:</p><p></p><p>"Probably not. The Qingxi Sect's spirit plant techniques are still quite decent. It's just that their spirit emblem business can't really compare to Feng Valley."</p><p></p><p>The shorter, sturdier middle-aged man immediately chimed in:</p><p></p><p>"That's unavoidable. After all, Feng Valley has more disciples who can make emblems, and their levels are higher too. Even a small market like our Yan Ji Market can send out second-rank emblem masters."</p><p></p><p>"Emblem masters?" The 17 or 18-year-old teenager asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the teenager's lack of understanding, the middle-aged man immediately explained:</p><p></p><p>"In the cultivation world, those who can make low-grade basic emblems are generally called first-rank emblem masters, while those who can make mid-grade basic emblems are called second-rank emblem masters."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the teenager quickly asked again: </p><p></p><p>"So the Qingxi Sect can't even send out second-rank emblem masters?"</p><p></p><p>The sturdier middle-aged man was about to say something, but the taller one quickly pulled on him.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's go. Don't discuss it anymore."</p><p></p><p>As the sturdier man wondered what was going on, following the taller man's gaze, he noticed a young man from a nearby shop staring straight at them, so he immediately closed his mouth and stopped talking.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Luo Yiping, who had originally been enjoying people's envious looks, had a slightly gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>After that group of people walked away, Luo Yiping couldn't help but curse:</p><p></p><p>"What is Chu Ning up to? Is this what he calls being diligent? The market has already opened, and the peak crowd is about to arrive, yet he hasn't even shown up."</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan frowned without saying a word, while Lu Miaoying habitually didn't refute Luo Yiping.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing opened her mouth as if wanting to say something but didn't after seeing the closed doors of the two shops Chu Ning was in charge of.</p><p></p><p>"Being grouped with this kind of person, I must have been cursed in my past eight lifetimes. It's bad enough that he doesn't work himself, but he's also affecting the Qingxi Sect's reputation, which will eventually implicate us too."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping continued ranting until another group of people came, and he finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, more and more people started filling the market.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect's shop changing management was quite a big deal in Yan Ji Market, especially for those affiliated with the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>For cultivating families affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, this was quite important. </p><p></p><p>Since they were located far from the sect, many families had weak connections with the sect, so they would rely on the disciples dispatched to these market towns to strengthen their relationships.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after learning that new people had arrived from the Qingxi Sect, a small crowd had already gathered on the nearby streets. </p><p></p><p>Some went to look after other people's shops, so naturally there were also people discussing the two closed shops belonging to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there were quite a few people pointing and gesturing around the two shops.</p><p></p><p>"I should go inquire, they can't really not have arranged for someone yet, right? I still have some spirit seeds I want the sect's people to buy back."</p><p></p><p>"If the Qingxi Sect doesn't send a talisman master, then in the future we can only go to the talisman shops in Wind Gorge Valley to buy talismans."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Among the cultivating families affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, the most common occupation was growing spirit plants.</p><p></p><p>After all, cultivating spirit plants was relatively basic and didn't require very profound cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And talismans were the most commonly used items for low-level cultivators, so everyone paid close attention to this.</p><p></p><p>For these people who had previously always dealt with the Qingxi Sect, if the sect didn't arrange for people to handle these two areas, they would undoubtedly be greatly affected.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning finally appeared on the street.</p><p></p><p>Standing behind the crowd, he heard these conversations but didn't join in.</p><p></p><p>"Please make way for me, fellow daoists."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning called out softly, but those observing in the front didn't react much.</p><p></p><p>With no choice, Chu Ning could only gently tap a young man's shoulder with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Please make way for me to pass through, fellow daoist."</p><p></p><p>The young man turned his head, looked at Chu Ning's somewhat delicate face in his ordinary cloth robe, and glared.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you going over there? The doors aren't even open."  </p><p></p><p>"I'm going over to open the doors," Chu Ning smiled.</p><p></p><p>That morning, in order to take a stroll through the market town and understand the situation with Wind Gorge Valley's talisman sales in this area, he hadn't worn his sect robe.</p><p></p><p>The young man sneered upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"You? Going to open the doors? Are you a four qi-layer outer sect disciple of the Qingxi Sect? Then I'll say I'm an inner sect disciple too."</p><p></p><p>The young man's words drew the attention of the crowd, who turned their heads.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning was taken aback, then took out his prohibition token from his storage pouch and shook it.</p><p></p><p>An elder around sixty years old had keen eyes and let out an exclamation.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingxi Sect's prohibition token!"</p><p></p><p>After hearing the elder's words, the people who had been prepared to laugh and jeer along with the young man immediately closed their mouths.</p><p></p><p>"Can I pass through now?" Chu Ning asked again, and the crowd immediately made a path for him.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Chu Ning truly use the prohibition token to open both shops, the crowd's gazes toward him held an additional hint of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>As for the young man, his face flushed red, his expression full of panic.</p><p></p><p>As a member of a small cultivating family, reaching the fourth qi layer was already an extremely impressive achievement in his family.</p><p></p><p>But he was also well aware of what an outer sect disciple of the Qingxi Sect meant for their family.</p><p></p><p>No one paid any more attention to the young man, as everyone was drawn to Chu Ning's actions.</p><p></p><p>They saw Chu Ning first hang up a sign at the Qingxi Spirit Plant Shop:</p><p></p><p>"Purchasing spirit rice and all varieties of high-quality spirit plants. </p><p>Prices negotiable.</p><p>Please visit the Qingxi Spirit Talisman Shop."</p><p></p><p>Next, Chu Ning went to the front of the Spirit Talisman Shop and hung up another sign:</p><p></p><p>"High-quality Fire Talisman, Glacial Talisman, Evergreen Talisman, Rejuvenation Talisman: two low-grade spirit stones each</p><p>High-quality Earth Armor Talisman, Wood Talisman: three low-grade spirit stones each."</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Chu Ning took out some talismans from his storage pouch and placed them on the shelves.</p><p></p><p>Then he sat down at the shopkeeper's position in the talisman shop.</p><p></p><p>This immediately caused the observing crowd to be dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"How does this person look like he's in charge of both shops?"</p><p></p><p>"It can't be, right? Maybe he's just hanging up signs to help someone else. How can someone so young manage two shops?"</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

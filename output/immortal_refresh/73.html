        <h1>Chapter 73</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the spiritual energy on the spirit stones rapidly rushed into Chu Ning's body. </p><p></p><p>After a short while, one of the spirit stones shattered, and Chu Ning began absorbing another spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>This cycle repeated itself.</p><p></p><p>If he felt he had reached his limit in cultivation, Chu Ning would eat some spirit rice, briefly clear his mind, or practice the Refining Spirit Art and the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>For 5 days, Chu Ning devoted himself wholeheartedly to cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>Consuming over 30 spirit stones per day, he frantically improved his proficiency in the Evergreen Wood Technique.</p><p></p><p>This continued until the night of the fifth day.</p><p></p><p>[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (499/900)]</p><p></p><p>"Only a step away from the sixth layer, keep going!"</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the bed, Chu Ning opened his eyes, a glimmer of excitement flashing in their depths. </p><p></p><p>He then casually grabbed six spirit stones from in front of him and closed his eyes again.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the spirit stones turned to powder in Chu Ning's hands until all six had disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the bed, Chu Ning suddenly opened his eyes, a ray of light flashing through them.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Refining sixth layer!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a sixth ring of power had appeared in Chu Ning's dantian.</p><p></p><p>[Evergreen Wood Technique (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (501/900)]</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to 500 and reaching the peak of the fifth layer of Qi Refining, Chu Ning continued cultivating and absorbing the remaining four spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He finally mustered all his strength and directly charged into the sixth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he stabilized his new realm!</p><p></p><p>"With the sixth layer of Qi Refining, at the very least, I have gained more ability to protect myself."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning let out a light breath.</p><p></p><p>"If I can break through one more time, I'll enter the late stage of Qi Refining."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning suddenly thought of a problem.</p><p></p><p>The next step, when breaking through to the seventh layer of Qi Refining, his Evergreen Wood Technique would also break through the second layer and enter the third layer.</p><p></p><p>Would completing the second layer's proficiency refresh his talent reward?</p><p></p><p>If that was possible, wouldn't there be a loophole for him to exploit?</p><p></p><p>For example, if he chose a technique with six or seven layers next time, wouldn't he be able to refresh the reward six or seven times?</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Chu Ning vaguely felt that the heavenly privilege probably wouldn't let him exploit such a loophole.</p><p></p><p>As for exactly how it would work, he could only wait and see after completing the second layer's proficiency.</p><p></p><p>Getting up, Chu Ning used a Purification Technique to completely clear away the spirit stone powder in the room.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a simple Rain of Sweetness Technique, he rinsed himself clean and followed with a Drying Technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Chu Ning, who had cultivated bitterly for five days, felt refreshed.</p><p></p><p>After a good night's sleep, Chu Ning got up early the next morning and began packing his belongings.</p><p></p><p>According to the sect's arrangements, all the disciples heading to Yan Ji Fang would depart together today.</p><p></p><p>By packing belongings, there actually wasn't much to pack.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Spirit Fruits, talisman papers, and items for cultivation and talisman making had already been stored in his storage bag long ago.</p><p></p><p>Now, all he had to pack were a few changes of clothes and the spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>After going through half a year, Chu Ning had already eaten quite a bit of the spirit rice, so there wasn't much left to bring.</p><p></p><p>After packing everything, Chu Ning took a stroll around the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the densely grown iron vine covering the yard, he felt a tinge of reluctance in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A little over a year ago, he had just completed the test to become an outer sect disciple in the lowest Dingqu.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, he had leapt two levels to become an inner sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>His former neighbor Qi Chongmao, whom he had killed in retaliation, had moved out, while Lu Yunfang and Luo Hongping, who had moved in later, had also relocated to Bingqu.</p><p></p><p>It gave him a sense of how things and people change.</p><p></p><p>After these thoughts circled in Chu Ning's mind, he smiled nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand technique, he directly dug up a few iron vines by the roots and casually put them into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Then, he strode out of the courtyard, heading straight towards the outer sect area.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At the outer gate entrance, Chu Ning was the first to arrive. After a while, several others arrived successively. </p><p></p><p>Everyone introduced themselves briefly, getting preliminarily acquainted.</p><p></p><p>The Pill Refinement Hall arranged for a female disciple named Gu Xiaoqing, who had already reached the 8th level of Qi refinement for some time, making her the most senior among them.</p><p></p><p>The Artifact Refinement Room arranged for a male disciple named Shen Zhengquan at the 7th level of Qi refinement. </p><p></p><p>This path of artifact refinement is very difficult to master.</p><p></p><p>From Shen Zhengquan, Chu Ning and the others learned that this time he was not going to refine artifacts at the Yan Gathering Market.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he was only responsible for selling ritual implements there, while also looking to purchase suitable materials for Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>As for artifact refinement, that would still be handled by the senior refiners within the Hall.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, two disciples were assigned from the Spirit Beast Chamber.</p><p></p><p>One was a 7th level male disciple named Luo Yiping, and the other a 5th level female disciple named Lu Miaoying.</p><p></p><p>According to their introduction, besides some low-rank demonic beasts, the area around the Yan Gathering Market also produced some low-rank spirit beasts suitable for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For example, there was a spirit beast called the Ash Spirit Rabbit. After being raised, its rabbit meat had a certain effect in advancing one's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>This effect was especially pronounced for disciples at the Qi Refinement stage.</p><p></p><p>So their task was to purchase such spirit beasts from wandering cultivators or cultivator clans, raise them, and then sell them.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, Chu Ning, representing the Spirit Plant Chamber and Talisman Pavilion, seemed the most lacking in strength.</p><p></p><p>After all, on the surface Chu Ning only had the 4th level of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>However, the others were still somewhat puzzled that Chu Ning was representing both the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant Chamber at the Yan Gathering Market.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not hide much, explaining that he was originally a menial disciple.</p><p></p><p>He happened to have some talent in talisman crafting, so the Talisman Pavilion accepted him.</p><p></p><p>Then, since both sides were short-handed, he was assigned this task.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Chu Ning was originally a menial disciple, the others were mildly surprised.</p><p></p><p>But everyone knew that the Green Creek Sect did not directly manage many spirit fields near the Yan Gathering Market, and talisman crafting was relatively simpler compared to artifact and pill refinement.</p><p></p><p>So they only asked a little, and soon paid it no further mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chu Ning had only recently joined the Talisman Pavilion, with few in the Pavilion aware of his talent. Moreover, he had only crafted low-grade basic talismans before. Naturally, the Pavilion members did not pay much attention to him.</p><p></p><p>And he had even less reputation outside.</p><p></p><p>As the one with the lowest cultivation among the group, who had risen from being a menial disciple, Chu Ning had already become the most overlooked person.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the graceful and elegant Gu Xiaoqing, with the highest cultivation among them, who naturally drew the most attention.</p><p></p><p>Both Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan tried to converse with her, clearly intending to get closer.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning originally wanted to keep a low profile, so he was happy to oblige.</p><p></p><p>Without joining the conversation, he quietly observed the others while waiting for the Outer Affairs Hall's executor to arrive, roughly gauging their personalities through their words and actions.</p><p></p><p>After about half an incense stick's time, an elderly man in grey robes appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Executor Lin!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the others' address, Chu Ning guessed the man's identity and also paid respects with the rest.</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing, the executor from the Outer Affairs Hall in charge of the Yan Gathering Market and a few surrounding markets.</p><p></p><p>This Lin Changqing was around fifty years old, with a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>After the disciples paid respects, he only gave a light "hmm" through his nose.</p><p></p><p>"The disciples for the other markets have already departed. You are the last batch. Since everyone is here, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing's voice carried a sense of aloofness.</p><p></p><p>His demeanor made the outer disciples not dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing had no intention of letting them speak either. After speaking, he waved his hand, releasing a flying boat from his storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>The five disciples boarded, and Lin Changqing took off into the sky with them, disappearing from the sect's domain in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 52</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After entering the outer gate, Chu Ning went familiarly towards the residence of Zhuang Yunde. </p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, halfway there, he saw Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu, I heard that you've recently come to hand in your contributions."</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling slightly tilted her head, smiling at Chu Ning with a knowing look.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was naturally no longer bewildered and wary like before, and now directly took out talisman papers from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"I was just about to go to Senior Martial Brother Zhuang's place and then find you, Senior Martial Sister. These are the talisman papers I've contributed to the sect this season. I don't know if you need this many, Senior Martial Sister."</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling's eyes immediately lit up, "How many are there?"</p><p></p><p>"3,000 sheets," Chu Ning answered.</p><p></p><p>"So many, then I don't have to worry about wasting them..." Mu Ling said with a slight excitement, but immediately restrained herself.</p><p></p><p>Her expression became a bit more restrained, and then she reached out to brush her hair back.</p><p></p><p>"With this, I can cultivate talisman-making properly."</p><p></p><p>The two quickly made the transaction. Chu Ning gave her 3,000 talisman papers, and in exchange received 60 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for things like giving a discount for buying in bulk, Chu Ning hadn't even considered it.</p><p></p><p>Who else would he earn this money for?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Mu Ling about to leave with the talisman papers, Chu Ning hurriedly spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Sister Mu, I've become quite familiar with buying talisman papers and dealing with various merchants in the market recently.</p><p></p><p>I should be able to get more goods. Would you like to buy some more, Senior Martial Sister?"</p><p></p><p>"Buy! Buy!" Mu Ling immediately exclaimed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"Buy as many as you can get."</p><p></p><p>After exclaiming, Mu Ling thought for a moment and said, "I have 3,000 sheets here, which should last me a month. Next month, you can buy some more then."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded and said to her, "Then I'll help you buy 1,500 sheets each month, Senior Martial Sister."</p><p></p><p>He currently had 7,900 talisman papers left in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Selling 1,500 sheets to her each month, for 4 months, would be 6,000 sheets.</p><p></p><p>He would still have 1,900 sheets left for himself.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning planned to keep these talisman papers for his own use.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was preparing to participate in the advancement assessment. </p><p></p><p>If the information Mu Ling had revealed before was true, and he had a chance to obtain the talisman-making method after advancing, then these talisman papers could be used for him to practice talisman-making himself. According to Chu Ning's thoughts, it should be enough.</p><p></p><p>After all, he couldn't be as wasteful as Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling nodded at this time, and took out 10 spirit stones from her storage bag to hand to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Adding this to the amount she had planned to give Chu Ning each month, it came to 32 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll buy an extra 500 sheets each month."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, she took out another 3 spirit stones and handed them to Chu Ning together with the others.</p><p></p><p>"You've worked hard this period of time."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning accepted these spirit stones, and couldn't help but inwardly click his tongue as he watched Mu Ling's light-footed departure.</p><p></p><p>What a wasteful woman.</p><p></p><p>However, the feeling of earning spirit stones was truly great.</p><p></p><p>These 3 spirit stones, plus the errand fee for this month, amounted to a full 5 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>To put it into perspective, this was already more than what Qiu Shunyi and the others could earn from an entire season's harvest after contributing to the sect.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought, with her having a Golden Dan stage great-aunt, this amount of spirit stones really wasn't much.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt justified in accepting it.</p><p></p><p>He put all the spirit stones into his storage bag, and arrived at Zhuang Yunde's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning, Zhuang Yunde had his usual smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Chu Ning is here. I was just about to go over to your place this afternoon."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, I've come to hand in my contributions."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning said, taking out 3,500 talisman papers from his storage bag, as well as an additional 11...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"A chunk of spirit stone."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde immediately asked with a smile, "You met Mu Ling again?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "Yeah, I sold some extra talisman papers to Senior Sister Mu."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde didn't say much more, skillfully putting the items into two separate storage bags. </p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning straightforwardly stated his purpose for coming.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang, I don't know if I need to register with you to participate in the assessment for promotion to the C-district?"</p><p></p><p>"You want to take the promotion assessment?" Zhuang Yunde was slightly surprised at first.</p><p></p><p>But after glancing at Chu Ning, there was an added look of surprise on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you've already reached the fourth level of Qi refining, so you do indeed meet the conditions for promotion."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled and looked at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother entered the sect one and a half years ago and has already reached the fourth level of Qi refining. This cultivation speed is not slow at all."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cupped his hands towards the other party.</p><p></p><p>"It's thanks to Senior Brother's guidance that I earned some spirit stones, which were basically all spent on improving my cultivation. I officially entered the middle stage of Qi refining last month."</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Zhuang Yunde slightly nodded and said:</p><p></p><p>"You are inherently very compatible with the Qingmu Changchun Skill. Plus, with the assistance of spirit stones for cultivation, it's natural that you progressed faster."</p><p></p><p>Then, he changed the subject:</p><p></p><p>"However, I cannot make the decision regarding this promotion assessment. You need to go register with Executive Officer He. Only with his approval can you participate."</p><p></p><p>"Executive Officer He Changyu?" Chu Ning asked to confirm.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde nodded again, "I didn't expect that you would be able to reach the fourth level of Qi refining in just one and a half years after joining the sect.</p><p></p><p>Plus, your grasp of spells is not bad either. Executive Officer He should agree.</p><p></p><p>However, the competition is also very fierce, so you need to be mentally prepared."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's expression turned serious as he said, "So in the next half month or so, I plan to use spirit stones to further improve my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Whether I can be promoted or not, I hope Senior Brother Zhuang can continue to provide guidance in the future." Chu Ning said this very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, although he had a golden finger, his current cultivation speed and income were indeed closely related to Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>Although the two of them were essentially in a transactional, mutually beneficial relationship, he still needed to acknowledge this.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Zhuang Yunde's round face showed a few more smiles. However, his expression soon turned somewhat sentimental as he said:</p><p></p><p>"I really wish I could provide more guidance to you newer junior brothers, but I'm afraid I won't have the opportunity. I'll be leaving soon too."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhuang Yunde's words, Chu Ning was slightly stunned and asked in surprise:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is leaving?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde nodded, hesitated for a moment, but ultimately spoke:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, you've been in the sect for about one and a half years.</p><p></p><p>You should have heard that every one or two years, the sect organizes a group of Qi refining disciples to go out and carry out missions."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning suddenly remembered what Shang Zhaoqiang had said before and blurted out:</p><p></p><p>"Is Senior Brother referring to the rumor that the sect discovered a treasure land elsewhere and needs to open it up, so many servant disciples were arranged to go there?</p><p></p><p>But I heard that it's not the servant disciples being sent. Could it be that Senior Brother is going there to oversee things?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde nodded and then shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I am indeed participating in this matter, but I'm not going there to oversee things.</p><p></p><p>And what you heard outside is not entirely accurate. From the very beginning, it was the inner sect disciples and outer sect disciples who were arranged to go.</p><p></p><p>It was only later, when there was a shortage of manpower, that the servant disciples were allowed to participate."</p><p></p><p>"Shortage of manpower?" Chu Ning murmured these words, then raised the doubt that had always lingered in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang, the sect is arranging so many Qi refining disciples to go. Is it really for opening up a new territory?</p><p></p><p>I've never heard of any senior brothers returning."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Chu Ning's question, Zhuang Yunde's expression became slightly more complicated.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his expression, Chu Ning vaguely felt that he seemed to have asked about something secret.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning came out of the room and saw a plump middle-aged man standing outside the courtyard. He quickened his pace, walked up to him, and cupped his fists in a salute.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Martial Brother."</p><p></p><p>The man smiled and said, "My surname is Zhuang, Zhuang Yunde. I'm the disciple in charge of this Ding district."</p><p></p><p>A disciple in charge? Chu Ning had never heard of this title before, but he could roughly guess that this was probably the disciple assigned by the Baiyi Hall to manage affairs in this area.</p><p></p><p>So he cupped his fists again and said, "Chu Ning greets Senior Martial Brother Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, one cannot be too courteous. Seeing Chu Ning's politeness, Zhuang Yunde's smile widened.</p><p></p><p>He took out a package from his storage bag and handed it to Chu Ning, then took out another booklet and handed it over solemnly, saying:</p><p></p><p>"This is the basic cultivation method of our Qingxi Sect's Wood Path. Although it's only a lower-grade Yellow Realm technique, it has been continuously refined by our predecessors over generations. Martial Nephew must keep it safe."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning listened and quickly took it. He saw five words written on the booklet: 'Evergreen Wood Cultivation Method'.</p><p></p><p>This was a cultivation technique!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt some anticipation and excitement, which he did not suppress but showed on his face.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde did not find it strange. Instead, he felt Chu Ning's reaction was normal. After all, every person who had just joined the cultivation world and received a cultivation technique would react this way.</p><p></p><p>If someone remained completely calm and indifferent, he would find it strange.</p><p></p><p>After showing a proper amount of small excitement, Chu Ning immediately asked:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, you just said this is a lower-grade Yellow Realm technique. What are the different levels of cultivation techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because Chu Ning had shown courtesy and respect, earning Zhuang Yunde's good impression, he patiently explained:</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation techniques are divided into four realms based on the Profound and Primordial: Yellow, Black, Violet, and Red. Each realm is further divided into upper, middle, and lower grades."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly in understanding. Lower-grade Yellow Realm, so it was the most basic of the basics.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not mind. He was currently just a peasant servant disciple, so having a cultivation technique to practice was already good.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this technique happened to be of the Wood Path, which was exactly what he needed.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I still need to deliver things to others." Zhuang Yunde turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>But halfway through turning, he paused and glanced at the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"If I remember correctly, this courtyard belongs to Cao Dongxin, right? Are you with him?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, and Zhuang Yunde shook his head, saying, "That guy has a rather eccentric personality and is not easy to get along with. Your luck is really not that good."</p><p></p><p>With that, Zhuang Yunde turned and left directly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning watched him leave and sighed inwardly. It seemed his previous feeling was correct - this Cao Dongxin's unsociable personality was quite well-known.</p><p></p><p>Temporarily putting this aside, Chu Ning looked at the small booklet in his hand, turned around, entered the courtyard, and headed towards his room, intending to take a look at the Evergreen Wood Cultivation Method first.</p><p></p><p>"Creak!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the sound of a door opening came from Cao Dongxin's room as he walked out and said to Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"Go to the kitchen and make something to eat."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. It was still early, and even if they ate dinner a bit earlier, there was still half a shi left.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Cao Dongxin did not come out early or late, but appeared right when Chu Ning was about to enter his room to read the Evergreen Wood Cultivation Method. For him to say it was not intentional, Chu Ning did not quite believe it.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, Chu Ning's mouth quickly agreed, "Yes, Senior Martial Brother. I'll go after putting my things down."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning quickly entered his room, placed the package inside, and put the Evergreen Wood Cultivation Method booklet in his bosom.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the kitchen, Chu Ning saw a rice bin and curiously opened it to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"I heard cultivators eat spirit rice, but this is just ordinary rice."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself and then laughed wryly. Spirit rice was probably not something servant disciples could easily obtain.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, given Cao Dongxin's attitude, even if he had spirit rice, he would probably not...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He was afraid he wouldn't even dare to take any for himself to eat.</p><p></p><p>Slightly disappointed, Chu Ning started to make a fire to cook rice. </p><p></p><p>Fortunately, after the reincarnation, his body still retained the memories of this body, so these tasks were not too difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>After putting the rice and water into the pot, and randomly cutting up a couple of vegetable dishes in the kitchen, seeing that it would still take some time, Chu Ning took out the book on the Qingmu Changchun Skill to read.</p><p></p><p>Since it was for beginning disciples, this martial skill was written in a very basic and detailed manner. Not only did it introduce the entire skill, but it also included some basic knowledge about meridians and spell foundations.</p><p></p><p>It allowed Chu Ning to read it with great interest and gain a better understanding of this skill.</p><p></p><p>The Qingmu Changchun Skill, a lower-grade wood-type skill of the yellow rank, is divided into three levels in total.</p><p></p><p>Corresponding to the initial qi refining stage of the 1st to 3rd level, the middle qi refining stage of the 4th to 6th level, and the late qi refining stage of the 7th to 9th level.</p><p></p><p>As for the great circle qi refining stage of the 10th level, and the foundation building stage after that, there were no corresponding skills.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what was given to Chu Ning now was only the first level of the skill.</p><p></p><p>This martial skill also came with a spell called the Qingmu Chunhua Art. This spell was very beneficial for the growth of spiritual plants and vegetation. Not only could it promote growth, but it could also refine their essence and improve their quality.</p><p></p><p>It can be said that this Qingmu Chunhua Art was an essential spell for the disciples of the Qingxi Sect who cultivated spiritual plants. The mastery of this spell also represented one's strength to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>"There's a spell included here? What kind of spell do these senior disciples need to teach, then?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly puzzled in his heart, but he didn't dwell on it too much.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he suddenly remembered something and quickly focused his mind inward. Sure enough, he saw that the prompts had changed.</p><p></p><p>[Jiu Yin Tempering Body Art (100/100)]</p><p>[Innate Talent: Yin Wood Spirit Body]</p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Skill (Lower Yellow Rank), First Level (0/300)]</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation progress of the Qingmu Changchun Skill has indeed appeared. Eh, why isn't that spell there?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt a bit puzzled in his heart, but he didn't think too much about it. Anyway, he would start cultivating first. Even with the Jiu Yin Tempering Body Art before, he couldn't make heads or tails of it at first. After cultivating for a while, he would naturally be able to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>However, it was obviously not an appropriate time to cultivate now. As the rice was almost done, Chu Ning put away the small book, started to scoop out the rice to steam, and then stir-fried the two vegetable dishes.</p><p></p><p>After everything was ready, Chu Ning went to call Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning ate his meal quickly, but he waited for Cao Dongxin to finish eating slowly before collecting and washing the bowls and chopsticks.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to return to his room, Cao Dongxin called him back again.</p><p></p><p>"Clean up and tidy the courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning was already cursing inwardly, he didn't show any dissatisfaction and followed Cao Dongxin's instructions to clean up and tidy the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Then, following Cao Dongxin's orders, he did some chores.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until Cao Dongxin seemed to have had enough and returned to his room that Chu Ning took a bath and went back to his own room.</p><p></p><p>As he went over the events that had just happened in his mind, Chu Ning could vaguely discern some of Cao Dongxin's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, this person had probably been in the lower ranks for too long, so he had become psychologically reclusive and even a bit twisted. Even though he had no grudge against Chu Ning, he enjoyed bullying others to satisfy his own sense of superiority.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps he couldn't stand seeing others doing well?</p><p></p><p>It seemed that what Zhuang Yunde said was true – his luck didn't seem to be very good.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the people in the neighboring courtyards, each of them had already returned to their rooms to cultivate early on.</p><p></p><p>He would endure it for the next three months. For now, he would pretend to be a fool who knew nothing, so as not to provoke the other party to become even more excessive.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made up his mind and quickly put the matter aside. He sat cross-legged on the bed, preparing to officially begin cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Skill. According to the prompt of the innate talent "Yin Wood Spirit Body," he could greatly enhance his aptitude for cultivating wood-type skills and spells.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating this Qingmu Changchun Skill, he should have an advantage, right?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 77</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I have the seeds!" </p><p></p><p>As Gu Xiaoqing spoke, she immediately took out a small cloth bag from her storage bag. </p><p></p><p>She poured out a few yellow seeds the size of rice grains.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning picked one up and glanced at it, confirming that these were indeed high-quality Jinyuanguo (a type of spiritual fruit) seeds.  </p><p></p><p>"Good, then I'll use ten mu (about 1.6 acres) to grow these Jinyuanguo."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately decided.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Gu, lend me the seeds first, and I'll return them to you later."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hint of a smile flashed across Gu Xiaoqing's eyes as she handed a small bag of seeds to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Consider these seeds a gift to Junior Brother Chu. I just hope you can sell me the Jinyuanguo at a discounted price later."</p><p></p><p>Listening to Gu Xiaoqing's gentle voice, Chu Ning did not get carried away. </p><p></p><p>Taking the seeds from her slender hands, he laughed and said vaguely:</p><p></p><p>"Let me grow the Jinyuanguo first before we discuss that. I've never grown this spiritual fruit before, so I don't know if I'll waste Senior Sister's seeds."</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning could not immediately agree to give a big discount just because she gave him the seeds.</p><p></p><p>After all, if Chu Ning applied to the sect, he could get Jinyuanguo seeds for free.  </p><p></p><p>If nothing went wrong, Gu Xiaoqing probably obtained them through this method as well.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, right, Senior Sister Gu, even if I use spells to force the Jinyuanguo to mature quickly, it will still take a few months before they can be used as medicine. During that time, I won't be able to provide any to you."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly changed the subject.  </p><p></p><p>Hearing that Chu Ning didn't respond, Gu Xiaoqing couldn't help but look at him again before replying:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Junior Brother Chu. I've already brought some Jinyuanguo with me, and I'll have the housekeeper Lin bring more regularly during this period."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "That's good then."  </p><p></p><p>The two were not very familiar with each other, so after discussing the main topic, they didn't have much more to say for a while.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing bid farewell and left directly.</p><p></p><p>As she was about to go out the door, she paused slightly, turned her head, and said:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, since Junior Brother Luo didn't achieve his goal, he may look unfavorably upon you in the future. </p><p></p><p>The talisman-making techniques of Wind Gorge are unique, so the pressure on you going forward won't be small.</p><p></p><p>If you need any help from me, just say the word."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cupped his hands slightly, "Thank you, Senior Sister."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing smiled but didn't say anything more before leaving gracefully.</p><p></p><p>Only after Gu Xiaoqing's figure disappeared did Chu Ning calmly walk towards the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the sect and coming to the market town, his circumstances didn't seem to have improved much.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning didn't take it too seriously. It was just growing spiritual plants and making talismans - nothing too difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>As for having malicious people around him, Chu Ning had long since gotten used to it.  </p><p></p><p>Previously there were Cao Dongxin and Qi Chongmao - were any of them easy to get along with?</p><p></p><p>Since he had arranged to come here and had the support of two halls behind him, he didn't believe Luo Yiping would openly target him.</p><p></p><p>As for some sneers and taunts, Chu Ning wouldn't take them to heart.</p><p></p><p>First, he took out some spiritual rice from his storage bag, cooked a pot of spiritual rice, and casually made a couple of dishes for lunch.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Chu Ning continued to the spiritual fields to plant purple crystal bamboo.  </p><p></p><p>Tomorrow was the market day, so if he didn't finish planting today, he'd have to wait another day.</p><p></p><p>After over two hours, Chu Ning finished planting the remaining seven mu of purple crystal bamboo before leaving the spiritual fields.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have time to plant the Jinyuanguo seeds, so he'd have to do that later.  </p><p></p><p>When he returned to the market town, Chu Ning saw that the door to the neighboring spirit beast shop was open.</p><p></p><p>The voices of Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan could faintly be heard discussing preparations for the market opening the next day.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had no interest in getting involved, so he went straight back to his own courtyard and closed the door.  </p><p></p><p>After eating dinner, Chu Ning walked around the two courtyards.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His mind began to ponder how this courtyard should be utilized. </p><p></p><p>Before coming, he had brought some jasmine vines from his own courtyard, but Chu Ning felt that planting more jasmine vines in this courtyard seemed a bit too low-class.</p><p></p><p>After all, he still needed to cultivate through the Green Wood Spring Technique, and the higher the quality of the spirit plants, the better they would assist in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For the time being, he had no good ideas, so Chu Ning set it aside and began to think about the matter of this market street.</p><p></p><p>For now, there were no spirit plants that could be sold.  </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning casually took a plank and wrote on it that he was purchasing spirit rice and spirit plants, preparing to hang it outside the shop.</p><p></p><p>As for talismans, he had plenty.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Chu Ning had been madly making talismans, so he currently had various talismans in good supply.</p><p></p><p>Except for the low-grade superior talisman that Liao Yunming had given him to save his life, and the Geng Metal Sword Talisman he learned from Mu Ling, he would not sell those.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the talismans could be sold.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning began to inventory the talismans he had.</p><p></p><p>Although he had given some to Zhuang Yunde and Qiu Shunyi before, it was only a very small portion.</p><p></p><p>The Wood Escape Talisman was the most numerous. Previously, Chu Ning had drawn nearly 40 Wood Escape Talismans in a day, and now he had as many as 260 Wood Escape Talismans.</p><p></p><p>Then there were the low-grade inferior talismans from the Talisman Making Basics manual.</p><p></p><p>For the Fire Talisman, Glacial Talisman, and Earth Armor Talisman, Chu Ning had 220 of each.</p><p></p><p>For the Rejuvenation Talisman used for healing and recovery, Chu Ning had 200.</p><p></p><p>He had fewer Evergreen Talismans, only 150.</p><p></p><p>After inventorying these talismans, Chu Ning folded up the plank and began writing the sale information for the talismans.</p><p></p><p>After all, with so many talismans, it would be too troublesome to explain each one to every customer who came to buy.</p><p></p><p>Having been to Qinghe Market a few times before, Chu Ning had a rough idea of the prices for talismans.</p><p></p><p>The sale prices for the Fire Talisman, Glacial Talisman, Evergreen Talisman, and Rejuvenation Talisman should be two low-grade spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Armor Talisman and Wood Escape Talisman should be three low-grade spirit stones each.</p><p></p><p>With this preliminary calculation, Chu Ning was suddenly startled by his own wealth.</p><p></p><p>If all these talismans were sold...</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>Although this Yan Ji Market was frequented by many rogue cultivators and the sales of talismans, pills, and the like were decent, it was not like all these talismans could be sold quickly.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the contents of the Spirit Talisman Formulas flashed through Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the previous basic low-grade talisman jade slip, the Spirit Talisman Formulas did not cover as much basic knowledge.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip only contained the production methods for eight types of talismans.</p><p></p><p>Five of them were mid-grade low-level talismans, while the other three were shockingly high-grade low-level talismans!</p><p></p><p>However, according to the introduction to talisman knowledge in the previous basic low-grade talisman jade slip, these high-grade low-level talismans could only be produced after reaching the late Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>So although Chu Ning was tempted, he had to set them aside for now.</p><p></p><p>During this period, although he had not had time to practice, he had roughly understood the five types of mid-grade low-level talismans in the Spirit Talisman Formulas.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Lightning Talisman, an offensive talisman.  </p><p></p><p>The Vajra Talisman, a defensive talisman.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Condensing Talisman, used to conceal one's aura.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Escape Talisman, a movement technique talisman.</p><p></p><p>The last one was the Purifying Wind Talisman, used to ward off and dispel various toxic gases.</p><p></p><p>These types of talismans were among the most commonly used mid-grade low-level talismans.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was not in a hurry to draw these talismans, as he would naturally have time and energy to practice them in this Yan Ji Market.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Wind Gorge Valley is also renowned for talismans. I wonder what kind of talismans they sell in their market."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered for a moment and decided to go take a look at the situation there tomorrow first.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

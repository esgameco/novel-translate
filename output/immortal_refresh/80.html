        <h1>Chapter 80</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Those who noticed Chu Ning's business were naturally not just the people from the Qingxi Sect. </p><p></p><p>At the same time when the flow of people on Chu Ning's side was gradually increasing, in a shop with a sign hanging that said "Fengguxia Valley Talisman Shop" on the neighboring street, a young servant-looking person rushed into the shop and said to a yellow-robed cultivator in his thirties:</p><p></p><p>"Master, the rumors outside are actually true. That Qingxi Talisman Shop has indeed changed to a new person. He looks quite young, probably around sixteen or seventeen years old. I heard someone say that he seems to have the cultivation base of the fourth level of Qi Refining. Moreover, he really hung up a sign offering a buy-five-get-one-free deal on the opening day."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-robed cultivator glanced at the young servant and then slowly said, "I'm not concerned about that. What I'm concerned about is whether the rumors that the talismans he makes are better than ours are true."</p><p></p><p>The young servant did not answer directly but took out a talisman from his pocket. "I don't really understand this, but I bought one and brought it back for you, Master."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-robed cultivator took the talisman and, after briefly sensing it, his expression changed slightly. "How is this possible? The quality of this talisman is so high that even I, a second-grade Talisman Master, cannot make one like this."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the yellow-robed cultivator looked at the young servant. "That person is really only sixteen or seventeen years old and has only the fourth level of Qi Refining cultivation base?"</p><p></p><p>The young servant nodded hesitantly, "Indeed, there is only one person. I heard that he is also a disciple of the Qingxi Sect's Talisman Pavilion and Spiritual Herbs Chamber, managing these two shops. As for whether he is at the fourth level of Qi Refining, I can't tell."</p><p></p><p>"You stay here. I'll go take a look." The yellow-robed cultivator left after saying this.</p><p></p><p>After about half an incense stick's time, the yellow-robed cultivator returned with a puzzled look on his face. "It's impossible. How could a disciple at the fourth level of Qi Refining make talismans of such high quality? He must have brought them from the sect. Even if he did, there shouldn't be many."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-robed cultivator said to himself and then continued, "Originally, I was thinking of taking out some low-grade talismans from time to time to sell at a higher price. Now it seems I have to take out more."</p><p></p><p>He then said to the young servant, "You go hang a sign at the entrance too. On the next opening day, our talisman shop will sell a large number of low-grade attack talismans and a small number of low-grade defensive talismans. I don't believe the other party can bring out so many low-grade talismans."</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Ning being able to make low-grade talismans, this yellow-robed cultivator had never even considered it.</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not notice that a cultivator from the Fengguxia Valley had come to observe him from afar earlier.</p><p></p><p>After the talisman shop's business picked up, he became a bit busier.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was responsible for two shops. In addition to selling talismans, Chu Ning also had to handle the purchase and sale of spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Initially, everyone only came to buy talismans, but gradually, as more people from cultivating families arrived, some began to inquire with Chu Ning about purchasing and selling spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>For a while, Chu Ning became one of the busiest among them.</p><p></p><p>It was not until the peak hours of the market passed and it was nearing closing time that the number of people gradually decreased.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked around and saw that Luo Yiping from the Spiritual Beasts Chamber, Gu Xiaoqing from the Pill Refining Hall, and Shen Zheng from the Artifact Refining Hall were also preparing to close up.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing's pill business was the easiest to wrap up, and she was already done at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning looking over, she immediately smiled and called out from a distance, "Junior Brother Chu, your talisman shop had quite good business today."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Gu Xiaoqing said this, Luo Yiping and Shen Zheng's movements slightly paused.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was on the same street, so how could they not notice?</p><p></p><p>Although all of them had decent business on the opening day, in terms of popularity, no one could match Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Doubts still lingered whether Chu Ning was the best.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was normal for there to be more people using spirit plants and talisman papers, as they were the most commonly used items among low-level cultivators. </p><p></p><p>However, it was unexpected by everyone that Chu Ning's talisman papers would surpass the reputation of the talisman shops in Wind Gorge Valley.</p><p></p><p>Combined with Chu Ning's promotion of buying five and getting one free, it was only natural that his business was booming.</p><p></p><p>Previously, the two had said that Chu Ning would hold the sect back, but from the first day, it seemed that Chu Ning was the one giving Qingxi Sect the most face.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning habitually remained low-key and humbly said, "I'm just taking advantage of having two businesses at the same time. If we're talking about a single business, I'm not doing any better than Senior Martial Sister Gu."</p><p></p><p>"Humph, don't get too full of yourself," Luo Yiping coldly spoke from the side.</p><p></p><p>"You think the people from Wind Gorge Valley are just eating for free? They have a second-level talisman master there.</p><p></p><p>Just now, many people said that Wind Gorge Valley is preparing to sell a large number of low-grade mid-product talisman papers."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping's voice was full of ridicule.</p><p></p><p>This caused Gu Xiaoqing beside him to show a hint of displeasure, her beautiful brows slightly furrowing.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Chu Ning was still from the same sect.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Luo Yiping had been targeting Chu Ning under the banner of upholding the sect's reputation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had given the sect face on the first day, but Luo Yiping's words were quite derisive.</p><p></p><p>Even Shen Zhengquan found it hard to listen and let out a light cough.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping seemed to sense their displeasure and did not say anything more, but his gaze towards Chu Ning still held a hint of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning felt a little irritated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not his style to directly refute Luo Yiping.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another cultivator came to the shop, so Chu Ning did not say anything.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator looked like a spirit farmer from a cultivating family, over forty years old, wearing coarse cloth robes with a square face.</p><p></p><p>He carried two bags of spirit rice and came forward to ask Chu Ning if he would buy them back.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning opened the bags and looked, then said to the square-faced middle-aged cultivator, "This spirit rice is of average quality, 65 pounds for one spirit stone."</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, can you raise the price a little? How about 60 pounds for one spirit stone?" The square-faced man looked at Chu Ning with a hint of expectation in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"This spirit rice is only of average quality. I can't sell it for a high price, so I can't waste effort for nothing."</p><p></p><p>In business, Chu Ning could see that this spirit farmer seemed to be living in hardship.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning did not let his sympathy get the better of him.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation world was cruel, and he had a clear understanding of this himself.</p><p></p><p>The spirit farmer let out a light sigh and finally placed the two bags of spirit rice in front of Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Here are 100 pounds of spirit rice. The price is one spirit stone plus three taels of spirit shards..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning weighed them and said with some difficulty, "Friend, I just opened today, so I don't have any spirit shards prepared here."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning indeed did not have any spirit shards. Since he had learned to make talisman papers, he had only traded in whole spirit stones and did not carry spirit shards.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the spirit farmer hesitated and asked Chu Ning, "Then, shopkeeper, can I ask you to use those three taels of spirit shards to catalyze some seeds for me?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning heard this and said it was possible, so he said to the other party, "Take them out and let me see what seeds they are."</p><p></p><p>The spirit farmer took out a cloth bag from his bosom, opened it, and revealed a handful of purplish-black seeds inside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, you want to grow these spirit-qing fruits? This thing is not very easy to grow, you know."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 68</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liao Yunming spoke up from the side:</p><p></p><p>"Chun Ning, this time the other senior disciples need to participate in a unified task assigned by the sect, resulting in a shortage of manpower in our Spirit Plant House and Spirit Talisman Pavilion. </p><p></p><p>The sect requires us to arrange for some disciples to go to various towns to take over duties.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how we arrange it, we cannot find anyone to assign to Yan Ji Town.</p><p></p><p>The Executor He and I discussed it, and you are skilled in both spirit plant cultivation and talisman making. </p><p></p><p>You are indeed a very suitable candidate, as one person can do the work of two."</p><p></p><p>"Hm?" Originally anxious and uneasy, Chun Ning was slightly taken aback upon hearing this. </p><p></p><p>It seemed the task was different from what he had imagined?</p><p></p><p>Chun Ning asked tentatively, "Two Executors, are you saying the task is for me to go to an external town?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what else did you think the task was?" He Changfou said with a smile. </p><p></p><p>"With your low cultivation level, you wouldn't be able to handle a more complex task."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chun Ning finally heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had misunderstood! It was just a false alarm.</p><p></p><p>He had thought he would have to go on some life-threatening, mysterious task.</p><p></p><p>After Chun Ning relaxed, he immediately became curious about what the two were saying about going to the town.</p><p></p><p>He eagerly inquired in detail and quickly understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>According to the two, it seemed that the number of Qi Refining disciples the sect needed to recruit this time was more than expected.</p><p></p><p>As a result, some senior disciples at the sixth layer of Qi Refining or above, who were originally assigned to external towns and cultivating clans, were also summoned back.</p><p></p><p>Some were needed to participate in the sect's unified task, while others were used to fill vacancies among the outer sect and menial disciples.</p><p></p><p>This, in turn, led to a shortage of manpower in various places outside the sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, besides the matters at the Mountain Gate here, the Qingxi Sect also had towns and spirit fields in other locations.</p><p></p><p>The Yan Ji Town that the two mentioned to Chun Ning was one of those places.</p><p></p><p>According to their introduction, Yan Ji Town was located at the end of a branch of the Qingxi Mountain Range, far away from the sect.</p><p></p><p>Its location was between the Qingxi Sect and the Wind Gorge Sect.</p><p></p><p>However, the spiritual energy in that branch was quite good, and part of the area could even reach the standard of the Qingxi Sect's Grade C spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect and the Wind Gorge Sect had both established some spirit fields in the surrounding areas.</p><p></p><p>Most of these spirit fields were managed by cultivating clans affiliated with the sects.</p><p></p><p>However, there were about twenty acres of spirit fields with spiritual soil and energy quality higher than the Grade C spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>It even barely reached the standard of the Qingxi Sect's Grade B spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>This part of the spirit fields had always been under the direct control of the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, due to the presence of some lower-level demonic beasts in the area, it also attracted some wandering cultivators or junior disciples from nearby small sects.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a small town formed here.</p><p></p><p>Although it could not compare to the Qinghe Town near the Qingxi Sect, it had a complete range of businesses.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect had previously set up some shops in the town, but on a small scale.</p><p></p><p>They mainly sold low-grade spirit pills, talismans, and magic tools, and since there was no unified large store, each pavilion was responsible for its own operations.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Gorge Sect did the same.</p><p></p><p>This time, since the disciples from the Spirit Talisman Pavilion and the Spirit Plant House in Yan Ji Town had been reassigned, the two thought of Chun Ning.</p><p></p><p>After listening to all this, Chun Ning finally felt relieved, but at the same time, he couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Although the two seemed to not give him much choice, Chun Ning still couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Two Executors, will there be any danger in going to Yan Ji Town?</p><p></p><p>I mean, like any attacks from demonic cultivators or beasts?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chun Ning's cautious demeanor, the two did not mock him but found it normal instead.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chun Ning had only recently joined the sect, and his cultivation level was...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"It's not too high, so it's normal to have concerns in this regard." </p><p></p><p>Hechang You immediately said, "Yan Jifang is under the joint jurisdiction of our Qingxi Sect and Feng Gorge. Some surrounding families are subordinate to us. The law enforcement hall of our sect has a small squad stationed there. Moreover, the foreign affairs hall has also arranged corresponding overseers who come to the market town every few days. So you can rest assured that no reckless rogue cultivators would dare cause trouble for you there."</p><p></p><p>"As for demonic beasts, apart from beast calamities, there are no high-level demonic beasts nearby. Even in the case of a beast calamity, they would just be some initial and mid-level first-grade demonic beasts, posing no danger to you at the mid-stage of Qi refinement."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning finally relaxed a bit. Then, he couldn't help but ask, "When do we leave, and how long will I have to stay there?"</p><p></p><p>"Five days later, you'll go with some other disciples from the sect's other halls. As for how long..." Hechang You pondered for a moment but still replied uncertainly, "It depends on the overall personnel arrangements of the sect."</p><p></p><p>I understand, it depends on how many people from this secret mission of the sect return alive, Chu Ning muttered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>As for coming to see him today, it was naturally not to seek his opinion but to directly inform him of the arrangement. As an outer sect disciple, he obviously had no say.</p><p></p><p>However, he still had to try his best to seek advantages.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a slightly difficult expression appeared on his face. "Executors, my cultivation is low. For this trip, will there be corresponding self-defense items provided?"</p><p></p><p>When Hechang You and Liao Yunming heard Chu Ning's words of climbing up the bamboo pole step-by-step, they both fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two not responding, Chu Ning sighed inwardly, two old foxes.</p><p></p><p>Then, he looked towards Liao Yunming. "Executor Liao, I remember you told me before that as long as my success rate in creating the five basic talisman formations reached sixty percent, I could learn the spiritual talisman formations."</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming was stunned for a moment, then nodded, "I did say that."</p><p></p><p>Then, as if suddenly realizing something, he looked at Chu Ning and said uncertainly, "Don't tell me you've already achieved it?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "The disciple wants to try it in front of you two seniors."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's confident words, Liao Yunming couldn't help but look at him deeply.</p><p></p><p>Feeling Liao Yunming's gaze, Chu Ning calmly took out talisman pens, talisman ink, and talisman paper from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Chu Ning had planned to wait a while before finding Liao Yunming to learn those spiritual talisman formations.</p><p></p><p>But now that plans had changed unexpectedly, who knew how long this trip would take.</p><p></p><p>Taking this opportunity, he naturally wanted to gain as many benefits as possible.</p><p></p><p>Quickly reviewing the basic talisman formations in his mind, Chu Ning began creating talismans.</p><p></p><p>Starting with the Fire Talisman and Ice Talisman, then the remaining talismans.</p><p></p><p>Over the next half-hour or so, Liao Yunming and Hechang You's gazes towards Chu Ning kept changing.</p><p></p><p>They watched as Chu Ning consecutively created 50 talismans.</p><p></p><p>Every 10 talismans were of a different formation, and the success rate for each formation reached 60%.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning placed the complete 30 talismans in front of Liao Yunming, Liao Yunming's eyes shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

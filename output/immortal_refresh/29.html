        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Actually, after entering the sect, Chu Ning discovered that everyone was busy cultivating and farming. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, junior disciples had limited information and resources, so there wasn't much they could discuss with each other.</p><p></p><p>Although you couldn't say they were all completely solitary, it was indeed rare for people to group up together.</p><p></p><p>Situations like now, where a group suddenly appeared within the spiritual fields, Chu Ning really didn't see often.</p><p></p><p>And Chu Ning realized that he recognized all these people. </p><p></p><p>They were the spirit plant disciples who had passed the assessment with him a few months ago.</p><p></p><p>Walking at the very front was Yuan Guang, who was assigned to the top-tier spiritual fields just like him.</p><p></p><p>Behind were Chen Youdao, Zhang Hui and others, even Qiu Shunyi and Lu Xingyu who had gone to the market town with him before were there.</p><p></p><p>At the same time Chu Ning saw them, this group also noticed Chu Ning coming from the opposite direction, and the expressions on many people's faces became more animated.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's Senior Martial Brother Chu?"</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke first was the person called Chen Youdao, who was walking closest to Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>"We were just about to go take a look at Senior Martial Brother Yuan's purple yam fruits. Don't know if your black spirit bamboos have matured yet? Could you let us go take a look too?"</p><p></p><p>Once Chen Youdao opened his mouth, the others immediately chimed in one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, Senior Martial Brother Chu, we haven't seen mature black spirit bamboos before."</p><p></p><p>"I heard these black spirit bamboos can be used to make talisman papers, really curious what they look like."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The crowd had a look of not minding making a scene out of it.</p><p></p><p>Among the group, when Yuan Guang heard everyone's words, a hint of pride appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi's expression changed slightly, he was about to open his mouth to say something to everyone, but saw Chu Ning wave his hand and say:</p><p></p><p>"My black spirit bamboos, let's forget about them. Their growth is average, can't be harvested yet."</p><p></p><p>When the crowd heard Chu Ning's words, their expressions became even more lively. That Chen Youdao continued:</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, Senior Martial Brother Chu. Senior Martial Brother Yuan's purple yam fruits really grew quite well.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, Senior Martial Brother Zhang Yunde from the sect said they even exceeded the sect's standards.</p><p></p><p>You and Senior Martial Brother Yuan have the same cultivation, if you also planted these purple yam fruits, you might be able to grow them quite well too."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning saw that sycophantic look on the other party and inwardly shook his head, but didn't respond.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's reaction, Yuan Guang immediately felt great in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Previously during the assessment, Chu Ning chose to plant the higher-grade black spirit bamboos compared to his purple yam fruits, now he could let out that breath.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Yuan Guang also opened his mouth: "Junior Martial Brother Chu, why don't you come take a look too? Give some pointers?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Guang had this appearance of kindly inviting, but addressed him as junior martial brother, the boastful element which Chu Ning could clearly hear.</p><p></p><p>However, at this point Chu Ning really didn't take this kind of person seriously. The other party was simply not on the same level as himself, the pursuits were already at completely different grades.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning lightly laughed and shook his head, "No need, I still have other things to do, I won't go."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning stepped forward to continue on his way.</p><p></p><p>These people never had sincere intentions to invite him in the first place.</p><p></p><p>And they also thought Chu Ning definitely didn't have the face to stay with everyone, since he had initially overreached by choosing to plant black spirit bamboos.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning about to leave, naturally no one tried to stop him, as they headed together towards the top-tier spiritual field area.</p><p></p><p>It was Qiu Shunyi who, after seeing this scene, caught up to Chu Ning's side in the last two steps, with an embarrassed look saying:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, Xingyu invited me to go take a look. I guessed you might not want to go, so I didn't call you."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning slightly smiled and patted Qiu Shunyi's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, you go ahead. It's good to gain some experience. You've also reached the second level of Qi Condensation, maybe you'll soon have a chance to plant those purple yam fruits too."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Chu Ning left in a free and unbothered manner.</p><p></p><p>Watching Chu Ning's demeanor, a flicker of doubt flashed across Qiu Shunyi's mind.</p><p></p><p>How come it didn't seem like Chu Ning was embarrassed that his black spirit bamboos didn't grow well, but rather like he looked down on these purple yam fruits?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning wasn't thinking that much. He was in a hurry to head to the mid-tier spiritual fields where he planted spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>This spirit rice had completely matured, this was his first harvest since coming to this cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning entered the mid-tier spiritual field area, and from afar could already see a figure standing at the edge of his field, immediately quickening his pace.</p><p></p><p>Walking closer, he realized it was his neighboring Senior Martial Brother Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Qi." Chu Ning greeted the pants-rolled-up, farmer-looking Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao turned his head and smiled at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu, your spirit rice grew quite well. Looks like your spell cultivation is also decent."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning modestly said: "Senior Martial Brother is too kind. I've just been diligent in tending to it."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"That's true, Junior Brother Chu is indeed very diligent." Qi Chongmao nodded and smiled, pausing for a moment before continuing. </p><p></p><p>"However, it seems you haven't come here as often recently. A few times I saw some insects and birds, so I helped drive them away for you."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was momentarily stunned, then thanked him profusely. He had indeed come to this mid-grade spiritual field less frequently lately, spending more time in the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>As for the reason, well, it was naturally because of those Seven-Star Spirit Fruits.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted in the field for a while. Qi Chongmao turned and went back to his own field, rolling up his pant legs and going straight into the field to harvest the rice.</p><p></p><p>This Blade Technique could clearly harvest from a distance, yet he seemed to enjoy standing in the mud.</p><p></p><p>"This Senior Brother Qi is really quite like those farmer uncles from the previous Earth, an honest and warmhearted person."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, then also came to the edge of his own spiritual field.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the red spiritual rice he had planted and harvested at Cao Dongxin's place, the spiritual rice Chu Ning grew not only produced more grains, but the rice was also plumper and of better quality.</p><p></p><p>This was naturally partly because the mid-grade spiritual field here had a much higher concentration of spiritual qi than Cao Dongxin's place, and the spiritual rice seeds themselves were also superior to the red spiritual rice.</p><p></p><p>Additionally, it was because the effect of Chu Ning's Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique was better.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the thriving spiritual rice, a faint smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual rice was different from the red spiritual rice. Because the red spiritual rice tasted average and contained little spiritual qi, it was rarely eaten directly.</p><p></p><p>However, this spiritual rice could be directly consumed by cultivators. Come to think of it, he really hadn't eaten much of this good stuff before.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the quantity of spiritual rice, after contributing the required portion to the sect, he should still have plenty left over, enough for himself to eat for at least half a year without issue.</p><p></p><p>Standing at the edge of the field, Chu Ning unleashed the Blade Technique, instantly felling a swath of spiritual rice stalks.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning followed up with a Driving Object Technique, gathering the fallen stalks into a pile, then began the next round of harvesting.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blade Technique could not reach the level of a Wood-type spell, Chu Ning did not need to conceal his abilities in his own spiritual field. After all, with the cultivation of the fourth level of Qi Refining, this harvesting speed would not be too slow.</p><p></p><p>First cut down the rice stalks, then use a Cleansing Technique to get the grains into the basket. As a cultivator, he could harvest rice without even getting his hands dirty.</p><p></p><p>In less than two days, Chu Ning had harvested all five mu of spiritual rice grains, partly because he had to balance it with his daily cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He directly burned the remaining straw in the field with a few Fireballs, allowing it to fertilize the spiritual field. As for the grains, Chu Ning brought them all back to the courtyard to sun-dry.</p><p></p><p>Not that it took much time to sun-dry them. After a few Drying Techniques, the moisture in the grains had mostly evaporated.</p><p></p><p>He then used the Cleansing Technique to remove all the rice husks. A few days later, Chu Ning's room was piled with spiritual rice.</p><p></p><p>At noon, Chu Ning took a handful of spiritual rice and cooked it into a meal.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the pristine white rice, steaming hot and faintly emanating spiritual qi, Chu Ning couldn't help his mouth watering.</p><p></p><p>He didn't bother cooking any dishes, simply filling a bowl with the plain white rice and starting to eat.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this spiritual rice entered his mouth, Chu Ning felt a fragrance lingering between his teeth and lips.</p><p></p><p>"So fragrant! This is the food cultivators should eat!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning almost wanted to devour it ravenously.</p><p></p><p>And after the two bowls of spiritual rice entered his stomach, a faint spiritual qi seemed to surge from his stomach towards his limbs and whole body.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the gathering of spiritual qi within, Chu Ning immediately began meditating.</p><p></p><p>After a full Celestial Circulation, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (179/900)]  </p><p></p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Scroll, Undying Skin 103/300]</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation after eating spiritual rice is indeed more effective than direct cultivation. However, it still can't match the enhancement effect of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning roughly estimated that it would take two days and six meals of spiritual rice to barely match the cultivation effect of one session aided by the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Chu Ning decided that from now on, his main food would be completely replaced by spiritual rice.</p><p></p><p>Being able to slightly increase his cultivation speed was one thing, but the other reason was, of course, because it was so fragrant!</p><p></p><p>After contributing the required harvest to the sect, he should still have plenty left over, enough for his own provisions.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was thinking this, a call came from outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the voice, Chu Ning knew it was Zhuang Yunde, and quickly went out.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

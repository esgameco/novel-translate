        <h1>Chapter 44</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's first thought was to quickly activate the defensive talisman in his hand. </p><p></p><p>However, the stabbing pain in his head made it impossible for him to muster even a shred of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even activate the simplest talisman.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch helplessly as these ice blades struck directly at his body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao's voice came again, accompanying these ice blades.</p><p></p><p>"For me to expend such a great cost to unleash this secret technique, it means I think highly of you. If I wasn't afraid the sounds of our battle would be discovered, with my cultivation at the sixth level of Qi Refining..."</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao's words suddenly trailed off, his gaze filled with astonishment. </p><p></p><p>Because he saw that after those few ice blades struck Chu Ning's body, the fluctuations of the latter's spiritual power remained completely unharmed!</p><p></p><p>"You...body cultivation method?" </p><p></p><p>Immortal Skin!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although Chu Ning was not circulating his spiritual power, the Immortal Skin from the Nine Revolutions Body Refinement Art had automatically activated.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning rejoiced inwardly. Because he discovered that at this moment, the stabbing pain in his head, whether due to the time limit of the opponent's secret technique or the effect of the Immortal Skin, had greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>More crucially, he could now circulate his spiritual power!</p><p></p><p>"Earth Armor Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, Chu Ning activated the talisman he had been holding, and a faint yellow spiritual light shield immediately appeared around his body.</p><p></p><p>This was the low-grade defensive talisman he had specially asked Qiu Shunyi to purchase for him!</p><p></p><p>Almost as soon as he completed this, several more ice blades flew towards him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed Qi Chongmao, seeing his first strike fail, had launched another spell.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning, having activated the Earth Armor Talisman, paid it no heed.</p><p></p><p>At the same moment the opponent cast his spell, Chu Ning instantly released the Thorny Vine Technique.</p><p></p><p>The ice blades struck the yellow light shield and were directly blocked.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the eight iron vines Chu Ning controlled wildly lashed out towards Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth level of Qi Refining? Instant spell casting?"</p><p></p><p>This scene left Qi Chongmao, whose complexion had paled slightly after using his secret technique, looking rather astonished.</p><p></p><p>He had intended to use this basic spell to control the iron vines.</p><p></p><p>But in terms of mastery of this wood-type spell, he was no match for Chu Ning, who had only been practicing for a year.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao managed to control 6 of the iron vines.</p><p></p><p>5 of them became entangled with the ones Chu Ning controlled, while 1 flew towards Chu Ning himself.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, realizing he could not block all of Chu Ning's iron vines, he tried to bind Chu Ning as well.</p><p></p><p>But to Qi Chongmao's surprise, the remaining 3 iron vines Chu Ning controlled did indeed tightly bind him.</p><p></p><p>As for the one vine flying towards Chu Ning, it was blocked by a large black wooden sword Chu Ning wielded.</p><p></p><p>The iron vine coiled tightly around the wooden sword, which then fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing himself bound by the Thorny Vine Technique while Chu Ning remained free, Qi Chongmao's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He reacted quickly, activating a talisman similar to a body protection talisman.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a white protective light shield appeared around his body.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao also cast another spell, generating a rattan armor-like light ring around himself.</p><p></p><p>This was the Rattan Armor Technique commonly used by cultivators of wood-type spells in his sect.</p><p></p><p>With two layers of protection around him, Qi Chongmao felt slightly more at ease, giving Chu Ning an amused look.</p><p></p><p>His expression seemed to say to Chu Ning: So what if you have a defensive talisman? I have them too.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning paid no heed to his gaze.</p><p></p><p>He swiftly activated all the remaining talismans in his hand!</p><p></p><p>A total of 6 talismans released, transforming into 6 rays of golden light that shot one after another towards Qi Chongmao!</p><p></p><p>"Golden Sword Talismans?"</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao saw that Chu Ning was using so many talisman papers, and was slightly surprised. </p><p></p><p>However, he did not panic too much, just frantically channeling his magic power to maintain his magic shield.</p><p></p><p>Even when using the same Rattan Armor technique, different cultivation levels would result in different effects. </p><p></p><p>At the sixth level of Qi refining, his Rattan Armor magic shield was naturally formidable, moreover he had an additional layer of talisman protection on the outer perimeter.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao had enough confidence that even with 6 Sword Talisman spells, at most they could break through his body shield, but it would not be easy to harm him.</p><p></p><p>And after that, it would be his turn to deal with Chu Ning!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Qi Chongmao's gaze unconsciously fell on Chu Ning again.</p><p></p><p>Yet he saw that at this moment, Chu Ning had activated another talisman paper, incredibly it was a Mystic Stride Talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Trying to run away!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao's expression changed slightly, but he did not dare to drop his defenses immediately. In his heart, he had already made up his mind that he must not let Chu Ning escape.</p><p></p><p>What astonished him was that after activating the Mystic Stride Talisman, Chu Ning did not choose to flee far away.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, and he actually followed closely behind the 6 talisman spells, howling towards Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>"Bang! Bang! Bang!"</p><p></p><p>The talisman spells kept slamming into Qi Chongmao's body shield.</p><p></p><p>After three spells, the outermost pale yellow light shield instantly shattered and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's not all Sword Talismans, one of them is a Radiance Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao finally realized.</p><p></p><p>Although the two only differed by one word, the Radiance Talisman was a genuine low-grade offensive talisman!</p><p></p><p>However, by the time he realized it, the remaining talisman spells had already struck the Rattan Armor light shield without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>This layer of light shield also could not withstand it, completely shattering.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chu Ning appeared within Qi Chongmao's line of sight.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning swinging his fist to attack, Qi Chongmao was slightly bewildered at first.</p><p></p><p>Then, his previously pale face from casting secret techniques instantly turned deathly pale!</p><p></p><p>Because at this time, he felt an immense oppressive force!</p><p></p><p>Such an oppressive force made him vaguely sense the threat of death.</p><p></p><p>He could no longer dodge, moreover he was still bound by the Thorny Entanglement technique. Qi Chongmao wanted to gather his magic power for defense again, but it was simply too late.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's fist heavily struck Qi Chongmao's body, and a surging magic power carrying the spiritual energy of heaven and earth instantly gushed forth.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely the celestial ability Chu Ning had just obtained - the Heavenly Canopy Fist!</p><p></p><p>The immense destructive force did not even allow Qi Chongmao any extra thoughts to flash through his mind, as the life instantly drained from his eyes!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible......"</p><p></p><p>Before collapsing, this was Qi Chongmao's only thought.</p><p></p><p>He felt he had hidden deeply enough, even using secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>But he never imagined that Chu Ning, a new disciple, would have so many tricks up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"Crack!"</p><p></p><p>This was the sound of Qi Chongmao's bones breaking.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that Qi Chongmao had lost all life force,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning standing beside him let out a light breath.</p><p></p><p>Without much hesitation, he quickly began feeling around Qi Chongmao's body.</p><p></p><p>He believed that based on the cultivation level and skills Qi Chongmao displayed, the other party should have a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's guess was correct, and soon he took out a storage bag from Qi Chongmao's bosom.</p><p></p><p>Swiftly forming hand seals, he released the Thorny Entanglement technique.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chu Ning almost without a second thought cast a few Fireballs.</p><p></p><p>Burning Qi Chongmao's corpse to ashes.</p>

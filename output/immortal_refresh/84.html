        <h1>Chapter 84</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You all should know the situation. This beast disaster came more suddenly than usual, and the levels of the demonic beasts are higher. </p><p></p><p>Based on yesterday's situation, although most were primary-level demonic beasts below the first rank, there were also some mid-rank first-level demonic beasts, and there may even be high-rank first-level demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Du Han called everyone to Gu Xiaoqin's shop, then went straight to the main topic.</p><p></p><p>"I went to Yangling last night when the beast disaster struck, but I was still a little late. The scale of the demonic beasts this time was large. The Li family in Yangling, closest to the mountain range, resisted for a while but still suffered many casualties. Fortunately, the demonic beasts retreated at dawn this morning."</p><p></p><p>When Du Han said this, Chu Ning and the others only then realized that Du Han had gone to the scene of the beast disaster in Yangling last night to investigate the situation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Du Han continued:</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Lin Changqing arrived early this morning and is now leading two junior disciples into the mountains to investigate the specific cause in preparation for when the demonic beasts become rampant tonight. </p><p></p><p>To be on the safe side, he instructed me to take you all to the Li family this afternoon to help the surrounding families fend off the demonic beast attacks and minimize their losses as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning was stunned. When the sect arranged for him to come out, they only said to cultivate spirit plants and sell talisman papers. They didn't say he would be involved in such a dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>A high-rank first-level demonic beast was at the late Qi Refining stage - not something he could easily deal with now.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning turned his head and saw the others were full of eager expressions, clearly excited at the rare opportunity to fight since they were in the middle and late Qi Refining stages with few chances at the sect.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, even a high-rank first-level demonic beast would be easy to deal with together.</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning was thinking this over, Du Han spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"It's the market closing time now anyway. Go close your shops and come with me."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed inwardly, hesitated, but finally couldn't help asking: "Senior Brother Du, this market town should be safe, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it's safe here," Du Han nodded. "This market town is still some distance from the mountains, and it's surrounded by cultivator families. Even if there are demonic beasts, the major families will block them. You don't need to worry about your shops."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this reassured Chu Ning, and he quickly followed up: "Senior Brother Du, that's not what I meant. What I mean is, I've only reached the fourth level of Qi Refining. With such a low cultivation, I can't really help. Can I not go?"</p><p></p><p>Du Han was slightly taken aback, but his cold expression didn't change much as he pondered briefly before saying: "Fine, you don't have to go since you're only at the fourth Qi Refining level. You spirit plant cultivators only know some farming techniques anyway, you can't help much. You might even need others to look after you instead."</p><p></p><p>When Du Han said this, the other Qingxi Sect disciples looked at Chu Ning with strange gazes, clearly seeing his low cultivation and cowardice as unbecoming of an outer sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning ignored their looks. With his Yin Wood and Talisman Source spirit bodies, he just needed to develop steadily. Why take such risks? If it was just mid-rank first-level demonic beasts, he could go gain some experience. But since high-ranks were appearing too, he would have to use more of his hidden abilities and reveal his true strength, which carried some danger.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, he would leave the heavy lifting to the senior cultivators while contributing by selling some talismans.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning was thinking this, Du Han spoke again: "Bring out some of your talismans for everyone as a precaution. These low-level demonic beasts aren't much threat, but I'm worried it may get out of hand if there are too many. How much spirit stones are they worth? I'll report it to Sect Leader Lin when I return and deduct it from your monthly allowance."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning's face showed difficulty. "Senior Brother Du, it's not that I'm unwilling to give them. Everyone rushed to buy talismans at the market today, so I've sold out completely. Let me quickly draw some new ones."</p><p></p><p>But Du Han waved his hand dismissively. "Never mind if you don't have any. The low-grade beginner talismans you can make now won't help much anyway. Let's depart, don't waste any more time."</p><p></p><p>Without giving Chu Ning a chance to speak, he turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Although Du Han said that, the looks Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan gave Chu Ning were filled with doubt, thinking he was unwilling to provide talismans.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could only shake his head - his talismans really were all sold out, not even a low-grade beginner talisman left.</p><p></p><p>To be honest, this was also an important reason he was unwilling to get involved in this mess. If he had many talismans on hand, he could always use them as a solution when in trouble. But now that he had none, he felt quite unsafe.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Watching everyone leave, Chu Ning directly closed the shop door. </p><p></p><p>He decided to hide in this talisman shop and make talismans for the next few days. He didn't really want to go to the spirit field either.</p><p></p><p>After all, the purple crystal bamboo and golden yuan fruit had already been planted. If he didn't go, they would just grow a bit slower.  </p><p></p><p>During these chaotic days, who knows what dangers there might be if he went out alone.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had clearly felt that after noon today, there were many more wandering cultivators in the market streets.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the news of the beast calamity had spread, so many wandering cultivators rushed here.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the nearby cultivating families who were wary of the beast calamity, worried that the demonic beasts would bring great losses to their families.</p><p></p><p>Most of the wandering cultivators were happy to see it, because whenever this happened, the wandering cultivators could often obtain good income by hunting and killing some demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>So when a beast calamity arrived, it was often a rather chaotic time in this area.</p><p></p><p>The various cultivating families not only had to worry about the demonic beasts, but also had to worry about some wandering cultivators taking advantage of the chaos to loot and plunder.</p><p></p><p>After closing the shop door, Chu Ning first cultivated the Refining Mind Technique to recover his spiritual sense. </p><p></p><p>He didn't even have time to take stock of his gains today, and directly started making talismans.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of a beast calamity would often last for a few days.</p><p></p><p>During this period, the major cultivating families nearby and the wandering cultivators who came would all need talismans.</p><p></p><p>As long as he made more talismans, earning a little money was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Binding Beast Talisman was what Chu Ning needed to draw, and it had the highest demand today.</p><p></p><p>Then there were the Yin Thunder Talisman, Diamond Talisman, and Clear Wind Talisman, which he also needed to prepare some of.</p><p></p><p>These three talismans were quite useful when facing demonic beasts - one for attack, one for defense.</p><p></p><p>And the attacks of some demonic beasts would often carry poisonous gas, so the Clear Wind Talisman could also come in handy.</p><p></p><p>Drawing these few types of talismans continuously for the next few days, his proficiency and success rate would both increase. Now he already had over a 50% success rate in making talismans.</p><p></p><p>In the morning, he could only successfully make 50 talismans at a time before having to stop.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could reach 55 talismans.</p><p></p><p>After recovering his spiritual sense and continuing to make talismans, drawing another 60 Yin Thunder Talismans, Chu Ning stopped again.</p><p></p><p>After repeating this three times, just as Chu Ning was about to end his cultivation to continue making talismans again in the morning...</p><p></p><p>"Bang bang bang!"</p><p></p><p>There was a sudden knocking sound coming from outside the shop door.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, a low voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Is the shopkeeper there? Buying talismans."</p><p></p><p>"Someone is still buying talismans this late?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was a bit stunned, his brows furrowing slightly.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that it was already quite late after the market had closed, and the sky had completely darkened.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning hesitated for a moment, not getting up immediately or responding.</p><p></p><p>He used the Qi Condensing ability of his Tiger Body to completely conceal his aura. At the same time, he carefully extended his spiritual sense outwards to probe.</p><p></p><p>He saw that there was currently a cultivator in coarse black cloth robes standing outside his shop door.</p><p></p><p>Sensing that this person's cultivation was in the late Qi Condensation realm, and his whole aura gave Chu Ning a very cold and ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart immediately thumped.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he became even more cautious, carefully observing this person's actions.</p><p></p><p>When the black-robed cultivator heard no response, he took something out, as if about to knock on the door again.</p><p></p><p>"No need to call out, he's probably not here like the other shops."</p><p></p><p>At this time, three more people appeared and one of them said to the black-robed man:</p><p></p><p>"Those from the Green Creek Sect have probably all gone to the cultivating families where the beast calamity occurred."</p><p></p><p>The few of them were dressed differently, looking like wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But they gave Chu Ning a strange feeling, as if they were from some sect.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning couldn't quite make out their depths of cultivation, so he didn't dare probe further with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he just kept it close to his body, making all his senses more acute.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he listened carefully to the movements outside.</p><p></p><p>However, the few of them didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning only heard this one sentence, then the four of them quickly left.</p><p></p><p>Even after they had all left, Chu Ning remained vigilant.</p><p></p><p>He carefully listened for a long while, then sent out his spiritual sense to probe the area again.</p><p></p><p>Only after confirming there was no one near his shop did he finally breathe a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Who were those people? Were they really just here to buy things, or were they targeting the Green Creek Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Various thoughts flashed through Chu Ning's mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to send a warning to everyone in the sect, but then gave up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know where the Yang Ridge Li Family was located, let alone where to send a message.</p><p></p><p>As for going out to report it, Chu Ning didn't even consider that.</p><p></p><p>Especially after those people appeared just now, Chu Ning would never put himself in such a dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>Even if he rested tonight, it might not be peaceful. Thinking it over, Chu Ning cultivated the Refining Mind Technique again.</p><p></p><p>In the current situation, cultivating techniques like the Green Wood Evergreen Skill or the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique wouldn't allow him to improve much in the short term, so there was no real point.</p><p></p><p>It was better to get his spiritual sense in the best state possible and make more talismans, which would be useful for both self-defense and selling.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

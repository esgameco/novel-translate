        <h1>Chapter 19</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a familiar voice, a figure pushed open the door and walked in. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart stirred slightly, and in the next moment, he clenched his palm mantra - Thorn Technique!</p><p></p><p>The two iron vines near the courtyard gate immediately flew out, entangling the person who came, rendering them immobile.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not continue to stimulate the mantra, so the iron vines did not continue to constrict or grow thorns.</p><p></p><p>Even so, it still startled the visitor greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, hey, it's me Qiu Shunyi!"</p><p></p><p>The visitor was indeed Qiu Shunyi, and at this moment, his slightly dark face was full of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, it's Shunyi."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning laughed heartily, stimulating the mantra to retract all the iron vines back.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Qiu Shunyi pat his chest in lingering fear, then turned to look at Chu Ning, glaring his eyes and asking:</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you recognize my voice just now?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning laughed again, "I really didn't pay attention."</p><p></p><p>In his heart, however, he was thinking that this Thorn Technique for binding people was indeed not bad.</p><p></p><p>If he had continued stimulating the mantra earlier, Qiu Shunyi would have been in trouble.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Qiu Shunyi said with some envy:</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Thorn Technique, I didn't expect you to cultivate it so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning lightly acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>"This is the innate technique of the Qingmu Changchun Skill. Once you reach the second level of Qi refining and obtain the complete technique, you can cultivate it. How about you, have you reached the second level?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I broke through to the second level yesterday."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi smiled with some pride. Although it took nearly five months, he had still broken through from the first to the second level, so he was quite happy.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning congratulated him, Qiu Shunyi finally stated his purpose for coming.</p><p></p><p>"I came this time to invite you to the market town. Are you going or not?"</p><p></p><p>"Go to the market town?" Chu Ning was slightly surprised upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>To explain this market town, one must mention the terrain of the Qingxia Mountain Range where the Qingxi Sect was located.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxia Mountain Range stretched for thousands of miles from east to west, and over a thousand miles from north to south. Seven sects were built relying on this mountain range.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect was one of the easternmost sects, while about a thousand miles west of the Qingxi Sect was another sect called Fengxia Valley.</p><p></p><p>Within this thousand-mile mountain range, there were many large and small cultivator clans scattered about, some affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, and some with Fengxia Valley.</p><p></p><p>Because these cultivator clans needed to trade with each other, market towns gradually formed.</p><p></p><p>Initially, it was only on a small scale, with some cultivator clans occasionally trading.</p><p></p><p>Then, as it became inconvenient for menial disciples to enter the sects, some of them also joined the trade.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, as more people participated in the trade, the scale of the market towns grew larger.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, even major sects like the Qingxi Sect and Fengxia Valley opened shops in the market towns.</p><p></p><p>Along the thousand-mile journey from the Qingxi Sect to Fengxia Valley, there were three relatively larger market towns, with Qinghe Town being the closest to the Qingxi Sect, about a hundred miles away.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had learned this information before, but had never been there, so he was a little surprised when Qiu Shunyi mentioned going.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi quickly followed up: "Yes, to Qinghe Town, it's really lively and fun.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother Shang took me there once before, and I went again by myself last month. I was actually going to invite you then, but you happened to be away, so I came early today."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning was a little surprised. He didn't expect that Qiu Shunyi had already been to the market town twice, so he asked curiously:</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"We don't have any spirit stones, what are we going to the market town for?"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Chu Ning let out a slight sigh in his heart. Actually, the main reason he hadn't gone to the market town before was because of this.</p><p></p><p>Spirit stones are the currency in the cultivation world. </p><p></p><p>Within the Qingxi Sect, servant disciples like himself, unlike the inner and outer door disciples, did not receive a monthly distribution of spirit stones. The only way for them to obtain spirit stones was through labor.</p><p></p><p>For example, if Chu Ning wanted to get spirit stones, he could only wait a few months until the spirit rice and spirit bamboo were harvested, submit a portion to the sect, and then exchange the surplus for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"We may not have spirit stones now, but we can take a look. When we do have spirit stones later, we can buy whatever we want," Qiu Shunyi said with a laugh at this time.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it's quite boring staying here farming all day. It would be nice to go to the market town and see the lively atmosphere."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning was also a bit tempted. Come to think of it, he hadn't been out since joining the sect a few months ago.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to agree, Chu Ning hesitated and asked, "Is it not dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>"Not at all!" Qiu Shunyi immediately laughed. </p><p></p><p>"Qinghe Market Town is only a hundred li away from us. Who would dare cause trouble for people from the Qingxi Sect in such a place?</p><p></p><p>Oh, if we're lucky enough, there may be some senior martial brothers and uncles going out, so we won't have to rush and can take the flying boat instead.</p><p></p><p>You may not know, but to accommodate us new disciples, the sect doesn't charge spirit stones for the first six rides on the flying boats.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we'll probably not be so lucky to catch a flying boat on the way back, so we'll have to make our own way back."</p><p></p><p>Only after hearing this did Chu Ning feel reassured, and he went out with Qiu Shunyi.</p><p></p><p>The two came to a large square inside the mountain gate.</p><p></p><p>This was the main mountain gate of the vast Qingxi Sect, located near the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Deeper into the Qingxia mountain range, there was another gate leading into the inner sect of Qingxi.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had not been there yet.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the square inside the mountain gate, there were already a few people standing there.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi introduced another companion going to the market town to Chu Ning, named Lu Xingyuan, who was currently Qiu's neighbor.</p><p></p><p>He was also among the newly admitted disciples in this batch.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Chu Ning would often run into his current neighbors Qi Chongmao and another person.</p><p></p><p>However, as Chu Ning preferred solitude and was wholeheartedly focused on cultivation, he would just greet them without getting too close.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Qiu Shunyi was outgoing as always and quickly became good friends with his neighbors.</p><p></p><p>The reason everyone was waiting here instead of rushing out was, as Qiu Shunyi told Chu Ning, if they waited a little longer when going out, they would often be able to catch a higher-grade flying boat.</p><p></p><p>However, the return trip depended on luck. If they couldn't catch one, they would have to travel back by riding the winds, returning earlier.</p><p></p><p>After the three chatted idly for a while, sure enough, an elder came driving a flying boat from inside the sect to the square.</p><p></p><p>The few of them paid respects to the elder and said they wanted to go to the market town.</p><p></p><p>The elder didn't say much, just telling them to board the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>This flying boat was smaller than the one Chu Ning and the others had taken from Qingxi City, but it could fit the seven or eight people present.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat flew all the way, taking less than half an hour before descending outside a memorial archway.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning stepped off the flying boat, he looked up and saw three large characters written on the archway:</p><p></p><p>Qinghe Market Town.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Going through body tempering in the Spiritual Spring once can actually increase proficiency by 3 points!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the increase in the proficiency of the Inexhaustible Bone Technique with pleasant surprise, silently calculating in his mind.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of 18 Blood Mist Grass plants. He had just given one to Ling Xiaobai and used one himself, leaving 16 plants remaining. </p><p></p><p>If the effects could be maintained going forward, then by continuously doing this for half a month, he could increase the proficiency of the Inexhaustible Bone Technique by 48 points.</p><p></p><p>This would bring it over 300 points!</p><p></p><p>According to his understanding, the Inexhaustible Bone Technique would face a bottleneck after reaching 300 proficiency points.</p><p></p><p>So in a little over ten days, he could consume the Seven Star Spirit Fruit to break through and fully master the Inexhaustible Bone Technique.</p><p></p><p>A faint smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cold wind blew, causing a chill below his waist. </p><p></p><p>Ah, he had forgotten to put his clothes back on.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning put his clothes on, then circled the cave to confirm there was nothing left behind before leaving.</p><p></p><p>Calling over Ling Xiaobai, Chu Ning released the Wind-Tracing Talisman and flew up, departing by air.</p><p></p><p>It had taken around half an hour of wind-riding to get here earlier.</p><p></p><p>But the Wind-Tracing Talisman was much faster, so it only took Chu Ning a quarter-hour to return to the Spirit Field.</p><p></p><p>After changing back to his original appearance, Chu Ning headed into the market street.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Chu Ning did upon arriving at the market street was to go to Gu Xiaoqing's shop.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Gu, please give me a bottle of Fasting Pills."</p><p></p><p>Arriving at Gu Xiaoqing's shop, Chu Ning got straight to the point.</p><p></p><p>Next, he planned to speed up the cultivation of the Purple Crystal Bamboo in the Spirit Field, while also going to the Spiritual Spring for body tempering every day.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't want to make the troublesome trip back and forth every day, so he prepared to get some Fasting Pills for convenience when not returning to the market street.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing glanced at Chu Ning. Just as she was about to reach for the spirit pill directly, her clear eyes looked straight at Chu Ning instead.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu has reached the fifth level of Qi Refinement?"</p><p></p><p>"Fifth level of Qi Refinement" was the cultivation level Chu Ning was intentionally revealing at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In just a few months, he had shown his progress from the fourth to the fifth level of Qi Refinement, which was calculated on Chu Ning's part.</p><p></p><p>During that beast calamity, while Chu Ning had sold a large number of talismans to earn quite a few spirit stones, he had also built up the reputation of his talisman shop.</p><p></p><p>So in these past two months, business at Chu Ning's talisman shop had been good.</p><p></p><p>Previously in Falcon Gathering Market, only the talisman shop of Wind Gorge Valley had a junior high-grade talisman master named Lai Weiquan, whose attitude was not very good.</p><p></p><p>Now, not only were the talismans Chu Ning sold of higher quality, but his service was better too.</p><p></p><p>So those coming to buy talismans naturally preferred to purchase from Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Aside from a few cultivators from families affiliated with Wind Gorge Valley who bought more from Lai Weiquan, most other cultivating clans and solitary cultivators came to Chu Ning to buy talismans.</p><p></p><p>Some families affiliated with Wind Gorge Valley even snuck over to buy talismans from Chu Ning sometimes.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the few from Green Creek Sect all knew that Chu Ning had earned quite a few spirit stones in these past few months.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, it was reasonable for Chu Ning to use the spirit stones he earned to rapidly improve his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning knew that if he appeared to be hoarding spirit stones without using them, it would only make others envious instead.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention others, he wasn't even sure if Lin Changqing or Du Han might covet his spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Chu Ning not only bought spirit pills from Gu Xiaoqing, but also proactively purchased spirit creatures like Ash Spirit Rabbits and Spirit Fowl for consumption from various cultivating clans.</p><p></p><p>He even bought a magic treasure from the sect through Lin Changqing.</p><p></p><p>He presented the image of going all out to improve his strength.</p><p></p><p>This way, although everyone knew Chu Ning's talisman shop had earned some spirit stones previously, they could also guess that Chu Ning had not accumulated too many spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Ning's high talisman creation success rate, he naturally wouldn't tell them about that.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, hearing Gu Xiaoqing's question, he showed some delight on his face as he replied:</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to Senior Sister Gu's Qi Gathering Pills, coupled with consuming spirit beasts to supplement my cultivation recently, my progress has indeed sped up considerably."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing nodded slightly, then frowned lightly and followed up: </p><p></p><p>"If I recall correctly, Junior Brother Chu bought three bottles of Qi Gathering Pills two months ago. Have you finished taking all of them?"</p><p></p><p>Of course Chu Ning wouldn't tell the full truth, immediately waving his hand as he answered:</p><p></p><p>"No, I still have quite a few left."</p><p></p><p>"But don't take them too frequently," Gu Xiaoqing advised.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you follow my recommendation of taking one pill every three days, you still need to pause after taking them for a period of time. After all, a large accumulation of spirit pill toxins may not be fully purged.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, relying solely on spirit pills to improve will easily lead to an unstable foundation."</p><p></p><p>Although none of this was actually an issue for Chu Ning, he still felt grateful that this gentle Senior Sister Gu kept reminding him repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he sincerely showed an appreciative expression.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Sister, for the reminder. After finishing the ones I have on hand, I won't plan to take any more."</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to spend more time at the Spirit Field recently, cultivating the Golden Spirit Fruit, so I'm buying some Fasting Pills for convenience."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this from Chu Ning, Gu Xiaoqing finally nodded and handed him a bottle of Fasting Pills.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had originally considered showing Gu Xiaoqing the Spirit Nourishing Pills, but after some thought he decided against it.</p><p></p><p>The process of obtaining those pills was not something to be shared with outsiders.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt Gu Xiaoqing could generally be trusted after interacting with her recently, Chu Ning still didn't want to let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days...</p><p></p><p>Farming, talisman making, cultivation...Chu Ning's routine was no different than before.</p><p></p><p>The only change was that every day he would spend one hour in that cave, using the Spiritual Spring water along with Blood Mist Grass for body tempering.</p><p></p><p>And the proficiency of Chu Ning's Nine Cycles Body Refining Technique was visibly increasing at a rapid pace through this cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, ten days passed.</p><p></p><p>One morning when Chu Ning arrived at the Spirit Field and saw the completely purplish hue of the Purple Crystal Bamboo, a smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>With his and Ling Xiaobai's unceasing efforts to hasten its growth, this Purple Crystal Bamboo had reached the standard for making talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>And the total time taken was likely only half of the originally expected growth period for Purple Crystal Bamboo.  </p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, Chu Ning saw no need to wait any longer.</p><p></p><p>With a casual Blade Aura Technique, he directly cut down several stalks of Purple Crystal Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>"Woo!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a cry came from beside him.</p><p></p><p>It was Ling Xiaobai, staring at him with unblinking eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Want to eat!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ling Xiaobai's telepathic message, Chu Ning nodded slightly and used a Controlling Technique to toss one of the freshly cut Purple Crystal Bamboo stalks in front of it.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai immediately began happily munching on it.</p><p></p><p>"Seems Little White is a herbivore."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning couldn't help remarking, though Ling Xiaobai didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>During this period, he had discovered that Ling Xiaobai only ate spirit plants and never touched meat.</p><p></p><p>For example, it didn't eat the Spirit Fowl or Ash Spirit Rabbits Chu Ning regularly bought, only having some spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Putting his musings aside, Chu Ning's hands kept moving as he continuously cut down more Purple Crystal Bamboo stalks.</p><p></p><p>As someone at the seventh level of Qi Refinement, harvesting these spirit plants was naturally much easier compared to when he was at the third or fourth level.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, Chu Ning had harvested all the Purple Crystal Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>During this time, Ling Xiaobai had somehow managed to munch down three whole stalks despite its small stomach size.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning still hadn't figured out how the little guy could eat that much bamboo.</p><p></p><p>After flying back to the market street, Chu Ning immediately began making talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>The process of making paper from Purple Crystal Bamboo was largely similar to Ink Bamboo, but the Purple Crystal Bamboo pulp had less impurities.</p><p></p><p>So with the same amount of bamboo, the quantity of paper produced at equivalent quality would be higher.</p><p></p><p>Having gone through two seasons of papermaking, Chu Ning was very familiar with the entire process. Coupled with his improved spiritual power and spiritual sense, the papermaking naturally became much faster too.</p><p></p><p>In just five days, Chu Ning had turned all the Purple Crystal Bamboo into talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>With nearly 50,000 sheets of paper stored in his qiankun bag, Chu Ning had no intention of selling any.</p><p></p><p>A year ago, he would have tried every way to exchange the talisman paper for spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But now, even if these papers could fetch close to 1,000 spirit stones when sold, Chu Ning still chose to keep them.</p><p></p><p>After all, he would need to use quite a lot himself for talisman making, and didn't want a repeat of before when low paper quality caused failed talisman creation.</p><p></p><p>With all the papermaking done, Chu Ning returned to his desk once more.  </p><p></p><p>He did want to try his hand at creating high-grade talismans with this premium paper.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning still chose to start with the Blazing Fire Talisman.  </p><p></p><p>He had already practiced the talisman pattern using those lower quality papers before, so he was very familiar with this talisman.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the brush, infusing it with spiritual power and dipping it in ink, while controlling it with his spiritual sense...</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning began drawing the pattern on the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>After he completed the entire talisman pattern in one go, a flash of red light appeared in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>But all the light was quickly reabsorbed back into the pattern.</p><p></p><p>This time, there were no mishaps.</p><p></p><p>A complete Blazing Fire Talisman imbued with spiritual power now lay calmly on the desk.</p><p></p><p>"It really was an issue with the paper quality, not me."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning lightly held this talisman paper, the corners of his mouth curling up slightly. With his Spirit Source Body, creating high-grade talismans was just this easy.</p><p></p><p>So what was he waiting for? Time to make talismans.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Blazing Fire Talisman for a while, Chu Ning moved on to the Cloud Stepping Talisman and Flowing Light Shield Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Holding five talismans of each type, Chu Ning paused.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the talisman ring appeared in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He had witnessed the might of high-grade talismans before - the Flowing Light Shield could directly block a full-force strike from a seventh level Qi Refinement cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He could make low-grade superior talisman papers, so naturally he had to replace all the talisman papers within this talisman ring. </p><p></p><p>Coming to the backyard, he activated and used up all the Vajra Talisman, Yin Thunder Talisman, and Earth Escape Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning glanced at the two Geng Metal Sword Talismans and chose to keep one of them. </p><p></p><p>The destructive power of this Geng Metal Sword Talisman was still decent, so he could keep one.</p><p></p><p>After all, talisman papers of different attributes had different destructive powers.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Chu Ning inside the room took out a Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman.</p><p></p><p>He brought the talisman paper close to the talisman ring on his palm, and in the next moment, the talisman pattern turned into a flash of light and entered.</p><p></p><p>It merged into the talisman ring on his palm.</p><p></p><p>"My own low-grade superior talisman papers will do!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered softly in his heart, and then casually took out two Crimson Flame Fire Talismans and one Soaring Cloud Talisman.</p><p></p><p>The three talisman papers merged into the talisman ring according to the method.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's palm flickered with various colors of light different from before.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a slight movement of Chu Ning's mind, they disappeared again.</p><p></p><p>"This is equivalent to having a few low-grade superior spells by my side." Chu Ning's face showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then, he picked up the talisman pen in his hand again.</p><p></p><p>Having tasted the fun of making low-grade superior talisman papers, Chu Ning began to practice repeatedly with the three kinds of talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>It was both to improve the success rate of making talismans and to practice spirit cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, two days later would be the market day, and his newly released low-grade superior talisman papers should sell well.</p><p></p><p>If they sold well and caught the attention of others in the sect, Chu Ning planned to say that the talisman papers came from the sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Spirit Talisman Pavilion would also send some talisman ink, talisman paper, and the like from time to time.</p><p></p><p>No one would investigate deeply with that explanation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's worries disappeared completely the next afternoon.</p><p></p><p>What disappeared along with it was the joy he had gained.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with the people in this Yan Ji Market? Low-grade superior talisman papers are so rare to buy here, yet they don't buy them?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the pile of low-grade superior talisman papers in his hand and couldn't help but complain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Because today was the market day, Chu Ning had specially promoted the low-grade superior talisman papers to people who came to buy talismans.</p><p></p><p>But to his disappointment, Chu Ning only sold one low-grade superior talisman paper throughout the day.</p><p></p><p>"The price was a bit high, but they can't afford twenty spirit stones for a low-grade superior talisman paper. It seems that the income level around Yan Ji Market is indeed a bit low."</p><p></p><p>After sighing helplessly, Chu Ning could only put these talisman papers into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that selling the low-grade superior talisman papers he had enthusiastically made was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that he could accumulate a pile of spirit stones with the low-grade superior talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>But now it didn't seem to be the case.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the low-grade talismans in his hand, Chu Ning frowned slightly. These talisman papers could either be handed over to the sect for recovery, or...</p><p></p><p>"Feng Xia Market."</p><p></p><p>At this time, a thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>Feng Xia Market was a large market. If he took these talisman papers to the Cloud Sea Pavilion, that large store should be able to recover them.</p><p></p><p>The price might not be as high as selling them individually, but if he sold a large quantity, the amount of spirit stones earned would definitely be faster than selling them one by one.</p><p></p><p>If he accumulated more talisman papers, he could make a fortune at once.</p><p></p><p>The only trouble was that Feng Xia Market was not very close.</p><p></p><p>But he had the Wind-Chasing Dart, so it should be fast to go there.</p><p></p><p>"I'll consider going to Feng Xia Market after accumulating more low-grade superior talisman papers," Chu Ning made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this matter was not urgent for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>He didn't have many places to spend spirit stones urgently, and he had also accumulated quite a lot from selling talismans in the past few months.</p><p></p><p>What he needed to do first was to complete the last session of body tempering in the Spirit Spring!</p><p></p><p>The next day, Chu Ning came to that cave again.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at his cultivation progress, his gaze flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Grade, Lower Rank), Third Layer (32/2100)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 299/600]</p><p>[Spirit Cultivation Art, First Layer 376/1000]</p><p></p><p>In the previous 15 days, Chu Ning had tempered his body every day with the help of the Spirit Spring water and Blood Mist Grass, increasing the proficiency of Imperishable Bones by a full 45 points.</p><p></p><p>Now, it had reached 299.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see if this 300 is the bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning took out the last stalk of Blood Mist Grass from his storage bag and threw it into the Spirit Spring water.</p><p></p><p>A moment later, the spring water turned blood red again.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stepped directly into it and soaked for an hour.</p><p></p><p>When the spring water returned from blood red, the scorching heat in Chu Ning's body reached its peak, and he immediately began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art.</p><p></p><p>Until the scorching sensation in his body completely dissipated, the first thing he did was check his proficiency.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 300/600]</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning had expected, the proficiency of Imperishable Bones could only increase to 300. If it were under normal circumstances, this number should have been 302.</p><p></p><p>Just like when he cultivated Imperishable Skin before, once the proficiency reached half, Imperishable Bones could no longer be improved through normal cultivation, even with the Spirit Spring water tempering.</p><p></p><p>Imperishable Bones was facing a breakthrough point and needed something that could directly break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning took out a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit that had been in his storage bag for a long time without hesitation and put it directly into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>A rich spiritual aura immediately spread from his mouth and drilled directly into his body.</p><p></p><p>A familiar scorching sensation appeared in his dantian.</p><p></p><p>With the previous experience, Chu Ning didn't wait and almost immediately began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art as soon as this scorching sensation appeared.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten that the last time, that scorching sensation had almost burned his consciousness into a daze.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, this scorching sensation in his body began to spread outward continuously.</p><p></p><p>It made Chu Ning's entire body feel as if it was about to be melted by the heat wave.</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat the size of beans dripped down one by one from Chu Ning's body, while Chu Ning cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art over and over again without the slightest pause.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was because of the previous experience of breaking through Imperishable Skin to perfection.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning felt that the degree of torment seemed a little better than last time.</p><p></p><p>Then, this scorching sensation, just like the previous time, gradually weakened as he cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art.</p><p></p><p>His body also became more and more transparent.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating like this for a while, Chu Ning gradually found that the scorching sensation on his body had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>This made him stop in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The feeling his body gave him was that the medicinal effect of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had been completely absorbed and transformed.</p><p></p><p>However, he didn't have the slightest feeling of breaking through Imperishable Bones like when Imperishable Skin reached a great achievement last time.</p><p></p><p>With doubts, Chu Ning's divine sense sank into his sea of consciousness and observed his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 420/600]</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit didn't completely break through the bottleneck and only increased my body tempering proficiency by 120?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>According to the previous introduction in the jade slip, this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit should have an effect even on breaking through the bottlenecks of Imperishable Tendons and Imperishable Soul.</p><p></p><p>How come it didn't allow him to break through Imperishable Bones?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because I used the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit during the Imperishable Skin stage, so the medicinal effect was weakened later?</p><p></p><p>Or is it because under the effects of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and Spirit Spring water, my body tempering effect exceeds ordinary people, so the bottleneck is harder?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't know which reason it was, and he didn't bother thinking about it at this time.</p><p></p><p>Since one Seven-Star Spirit Fruit wasn't enough, then he would take another one!</p><p></p><p>It was just a Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, and he had plenty.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately took out another Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and swallowed it without a second thought.</p><p></p><p>Then, he endured the scorching sensation that felt like it would burn even his consciousness and began cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art again.</p><p></p><p>One after another, until the medicinal power of this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was completely refined.</p><p></p><p>Still no breakthrough, so Chu Ning checked the proficiency again.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 530/600]</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Star Spirit Fruit just now had only increased the proficiency by 100 points.</p><p></p><p>"Although I don't know the reason, it seems that the medicinal effect of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit is indeed weakening for me."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's brows raised slightly, and he muttered.</p><p></p><p>"However, one more Seven-Star Spirit Fruit should help me break through Imperishable Bones."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he took out the third Seven-Star Spirit Fruit from his storage bag and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>The feeling was almost a replica of the previous two Seven-Star Spirit Fruits. The only difference Chu Ning felt was that the scorching sensation dissipated faster, meaning he absorbed the medicinal power faster.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art over and over again, until a certain moment...</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>That familiar feeling of the shackles on his body being broken open appeared once again.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by it was an incomparably transparent and comfortable feeling in his body, making Chu Ning almost unable to resist the urge to let out a long roar!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately checked his proficiency.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Tempering Art, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 600/600]</p><p></p><p>Imperishable Bones had reached the perfect realm!</p><p></p><p>This meant that theoretically, Chu Ning could withstand ordinary spell attacks from a ninth-layer Qi Refining cultivator with his physical body!</p><p></p><p>And when Chu Ning's gaze swept down, his eyes became even brighter...</p><p></p><p>[Innate Divine Ability Refreshed, Rewarded with the Secret Art "Thunderous Steps"]</p><p></p><p>Happy New Year!

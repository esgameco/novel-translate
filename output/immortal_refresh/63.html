        <h1>Chapter 63</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I'm willing!" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning answered almost without thinking.</p><p></p><p>He had been worrying about not having a place to learn the art of talisman-making before. </p><p></p><p>Now that he could join the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, it was naturally something he had been longing for.</p><p></p><p>From Liao Yunming's words just now, he also heard some inside information. </p><p></p><p>Those from the Spirit Plant Hall who came to learn the art of talisman-making could not be treated the same as disciples of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He estimated that people like Xie Cai Tian could at most only learn some basic talismans.</p><p></p><p>But from Liao Yunming's words, as long as he joined the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, he could learn more advanced talisman-making methods.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he didn't have to leave the Spirit Plant Hall, and he would still have a place to cultivate his Green Wood Spring Technique. Why not do it?</p><p></p><p>When He Changyu heard Chu Ning agree, he also said:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's send a voice transmission together to request approval."</p><p></p><p>Thereupon, He Changyu took out a voice transmission talisman, and together with Liao Yunming, they opened their mouths.</p><p></p><p>After briefly explaining the matter, they sent out the voice transmission talisman.</p><p></p><p>About the time it took to drink a cup of tea, a voice transmission talisman flew back.</p><p></p><p>He Changyu received it and listened, then said: "The sect has agreed."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was delighted to hear this, and at this moment, a faint smile also appeared on Liao Yunming's face.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good! Our Spiritual Talisman Pavilion has gained another promising seedling."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Liao Yunming reacted.</p><p></p><p>"I should say that our Spiritual Talisman Pavilion and the Hundred Arts Hall have gained another promising seedling."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, He Changyu said to Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"Shouldn't you hurry and thank Executive Liao for his kindness?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately cupped his fist in salutation to the two of them.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Executive Masters, for your kindness."</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Chu Ning did not leave himself out, a look of satisfaction appeared on He Changyu's face.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Liao, I'll leave Chu Ning to you. I'll take the other disciples back first."</p><p></p><p>After He Changyu said this to Liao Yunming, he turned his head to Chu Ning and said:</p><p></p><p>"After you finish with Senior Brother Liao, come find me at the Spirit Plant Hall's practice grounds."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Chu Ning respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liao Yunming smiled and said to Chu Ning: "Follow me!"</p><p></p><p>Saying that, he led Chu Ning directly to the third floor of the pavilion building.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Chu Ning and the others left, a Spiritual Talisman Pavilion disciple named Tan Zhang appeared in the main hall with nine other people.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, He Changyu immediately led the group out.</p><p></p><p>Xie Cai Tian and the others exchanged glances, realizing they did not see Chu Ning, and their faces showed doubt.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps because Xie Cai Tian was also familiar with He Changyu, he could not help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Executive He, aren't we waiting for Chu Ning?"</p><p></p><p>He Changyu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No need to wait for him. Chu Ning has an aptitude for talisman-making and has become a dual-sect disciple to learn the art of talisman-making."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other nine people looked at each other, their faces full of shock and envy.</p><p></p><p>They had joined much earlier than Chu Ning, so they naturally knew what a dual-sect disciple meant.</p><p></p><p>First of all, it meant automatically becoming an outer sect disciple.</p><p></p><p>While they were surprised that Chu Ning's aptitude for talisman-making was so high, they could not help but feel extremely envious.</p><p></p><p>They even felt that the talisman-making techniques they had just obtained were not so valuable anymore.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Chu Ning followed Liao Yunming to the third floor.</p><p></p><p>It was also a small hall of considerable size.</p><p></p><p>In this small hall, there were rows of shelves, and Chu Ning looked up.</p><p></p><p>He saw that different large characters were engraved on these shelves.</p><p></p><p>Talismans, talisman brushes, talisman ink, books... everything was complete.</p><p></p><p>"This is our Spiritual Talisman Pavilion's storage pavilion," Liao Yunming said.</p><p></p><p>"Although the items here are not the most precious in the pavilion, the quality is not bad.</p><p></p><p>I promised earlier that you can enjoy the same treatment as our Spiritual Talisman Pavilion disciples, so choose a few items."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Liao Yunming had already started walking forward.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at his every move with burning eyes. </p><p></p><p>Here, each category was divided into different shelves, and each shelf was further divided into different levels, clearly showing that the items were ranked by grade.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not know what items Liao Yunming would take for him.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning was pondering, Liao Yunming first went to the talisman pen shelf, and Chu Ning saw him take a talisman pen.</p><p></p><p>Then it was talisman ink, books... and finally, he even went to the talisman paper shelf.</p><p></p><p>After Liao Yunming made a round like this, he came back to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Although you have a talent for talisman making, you are still a beginner, so I didn't get you too high-grade items."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he handed the items one by one to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"A middle-grade talisman pen. A good talisman pen can increase the success rate of talisman making. This pen is much better than the broken one your Spirit Plant House gave you before. That pen couldn't even be considered low-grade."</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming clearly looked down upon it.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning couldn't say anything good, as that "broken pen" was not given to him, but one he had actually bought with spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Five boxes of ordinary talisman ink. This ink is more or less the same and can be used for making mid-grade talismans."</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, you can come and get a few boxes of talisman ink regularly every month after completing tasks for the house."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took them and didn't bother to look at them carefully, casually putting the talisman pen and ink into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Then Liao Yunming took out a jade slip and handed it to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"This jade slip records the basics of the initial talismans passed down by the Talisman Pavilion, including basic talisman-making knowledge and methods for making some low-grade initial talismans."</p><p></p><p>As Liao Yunming spoke, his face became more serious.</p><p></p><p>"Don't underestimate this basic talisman-making knowledge. The other nine who came today were only taught a few talisman-making methods, while this talisman basics systematically introduces talisman making and also includes the experience accumulated by generations of disciples in our Talisman Pavilion. If you want to learn this talisman art, you must start from here."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning immediately took it and said solemnly:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, your disciple will definitely study it carefully."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's solemn expression, Liao Yunming nodded in satisfaction and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Practice this basic initial talisman making well. As long as you master the knowledge in it and your success rate for the five talismans reaches sixty percent, you can apply to learn the Spiritual Talisman Codex in the house."</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Talisman Codex?" Chu Ning exclaimed in pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had seen this Spiritual Talisman Codex before from Mu Ling. It was also then that he learned from Mu Ling that he could study talisman making.</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming glanced at Chu Ning and smiled in response:</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Talisman Codex is one of the best initial talisman books in our Talisman Pavilion. It records the methods for making some low-grade and mid-grade talismans and is very precious."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, a hint of a smile appeared on Liao Yunming's face.</p><p></p><p>He would say this to almost every disciple who joined the Talisman Pavilion as encouragement.</p><p></p><p>The effect was quite good.</p><p></p><p>However, few new disciples could obtain this Spiritual Talisman Codex in a short time.</p><p></p><p>After all, for a new disciple to raise their success rate for the five talisman arts to sixty percent was too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning did not know Liao Yunming's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>After hearing these words from Liao Yunming, Chu Ning's only thought was...</p><p></p><p>He must obtain this Spiritual Talisman Codex!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

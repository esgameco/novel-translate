        <h1>Chapter 76</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping spoke up, and Chu Ning's gaze turned towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, these few shops in Yan Ji Fang have always been jointly managed by the Refining Chamber, Pill Refining Chamber, Talisman Pavilion, Spirit Beast House and Spirit Plant House. </p><p></p><p>However, only you were assigned from the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant House, so now you have two shops and a courtyard.</p><p></p><p>While Luo junior sister and I only have one shop and courtyard between us. </p><p></p><p>You can't possibly need that much space, so it should be okay to let one courtyard go, right?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback, never expecting Luo Yiping to make such a request when he came.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning remain silent, Luo Yiping continued:</p><p></p><p>"To be honest, you at the fourth level of qi refinement will be very busy cultivating spirit plants while also making talismans. You won't need this extra courtyard.</p><p></p><p>With Luo junior sister helping me, we can raise more spirit beasts on my side. </p><p></p><p>This way, in Yan Ji Fang, we won't be completely suppressed by those from Feng Xia Valley."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping spoke as if he was considering Chu Ning and the sect's reputation. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not answer directly, but turned to look at Gu Xiaoqing and Shen Zhengquan.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Gu and Senior Brother Shen, are you here for the same matter?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing shook her head, "I came to discuss spirit plant cultivation with Junior Brother Chu."</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan hesitated before saying:</p><p></p><p>"I didn't know Senior Brother Luo had this idea, but thinking it over, his proposal does seem reasonable. </p><p></p><p>If our talismans can't outcompete others, being able to sell more spirit beasts would be good."</p><p></p><p>After Shen Zhengquan voiced his support, Luo Yiping immediately smiled at him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning realized this idea was likely Luo Yiping's alone.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head and asked tentatively: </p><p></p><p>"If this courtyard goes to the Spirit Beast House, will the proceeds also go there?"</p><p></p><p>"How could that be? I'd just be using the courtyard," Luo Yiping laughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"But, I can help share one or two percent of the profits."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning sighed inwardly but looked conflicted as he said:</p><p></p><p>"This courtyard belongs to the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant House. I can't make the decision myself. Let me consult the sect's steward first?"</p><p></p><p>"Eh, no need to bother the stewards over such a small matter," Luo Yiping waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"It's just an unused courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning maintained a conflicted look and replied:</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid I must consult them first. The stewards of the Talisman Pavilion and Bai Yi Hall specifically assigned me some tasks before leaving. </p><p></p><p>I have my own use for this courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's words made the previously smiling Luo Yiping pause briefly.</p><p></p><p>He did not get angry directly, but asked in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"You need to use the courtyard? Isn't one courtyard big enough? What use is another?"</p><p></p><p>"To cultivate spirit plants!" Chu Ning did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual qi here in the market district was so abundant. If used to cultivate spirit plants, combined with the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art, his cultivation speed would definitely be faster than at the sect.</p><p></p><p>With such a great opportunity, how could Chu Ning give it up?</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's words made Luo Yiping's brows knit tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you joking? There are twenty mu of spirit fields outside. You still need to make talismans, yet you want to grow spirit plants here too? How can you possibly handle all that?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not show much emotional fluctuation at Luo Yiping's unhappy tone, only sighing:</p><p></p><p>"I have no choice, the two stewards did instruct me before I left.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it's because I've always been diligent, so the stewards arranged tasks for me on both sides.</p><p></p><p>Why don't you ask Steward Lin to inquire with the Talisman Pavilion and Spirit Plant House stewards for me, Senior Brother Luo?</p><p></p><p>If the two venerable stewards agree to reduce my workload, I would naturally be delighted."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning bring up the two stewards again, Luo Yiping's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>He clearly wanted to take advantage, but did not dare discuss it with the stewards.</p><p></p><p>Looking discomfited, Luo Yiping's gaze at Chu Ning held a hint of displeasure.</p><p></p><p>"My intention was for our Spirit Beast House to use this courtyard to raise more beasts that could sell better than Feng Xia Valley's, benefiting our sect and hall's reputation.</p><p></p><p>Since you have other brilliant uses for it, I won't insist."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu!" At this moment, Shen Zhengquan took the initiative to speak with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"If you feel Senior Brother Luo should take a larger share of the profits, you can propose that too."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, Senior Martial Brother Shen." Chu Ning shook his head. </p><p></p><p>"The Steward has assigned me a task to complete. I really do need this courtyard."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Chu Ning's words, Shen Zhengquan's smile gradually faded, but he quickly returned to normal, only nodding slightly unintentionally. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the room turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Of the two female disciples who had remained silent, Lu Miaoying opened her mouth as if wanting to say something. </p><p></p><p>However, catching Luo Yiping's obviously displeased expression, she did not dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the tense atmosphere, Gu Xiaoqing spoke up from the side:</p><p></p><p>"Since these two shops and courtyard were handed over to Junior Martial Brother Chu by the Spirit Symbol Hall and the Spirit Plant House to manage, it is naturally up to Junior Martial Brother Chu to make the arrangements. Junior Martial Brother Luo and the others were acting from the sect's perspective, there's no need for anyone to spoil the harmony."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing spoke in a calm and unhurried tone, but her words left the others unable to respond.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but glance at Gu Xiaoqing. This Senior Martial Sister was indeed a sensible person, frank and proper without taking sides.</p><p></p><p>Her words reminded Luo Yiping and the others that Chu Ning had the authority over these shops and courtyard, while also providing Luo Yiping a way out.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, after hearing this, Luo Yiping's expression flickered, he snorted coldly, and began walking out.</p><p></p><p>After a few steps, as if still unsatisfied, he spoke again:</p><p></p><p>"In this Falcon Market, our Qingxi Sect and their Wind Valley Gorge have always been in competition. Since you think you can take care of it, you'd better not embarrass our sect."</p><p></p><p>Leaving behind these unpleasant words, Luo Yiping left with a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan then looked deeply at Chu Ning and smiled: "Junior Martial Brother Luo's words were just to uphold our sect's reputation. Since the sect sent Junior Martial Brother Chu here, I'm sure you won't let us down."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled, pretending not to understand the provocative undertone in Shen's words. He was no less disgusted with Shen Zhengquan's hypocritical facade than with Luo Yiping.</p><p></p><p>After the two left, Lu Miaoying also departed.</p><p></p><p>Only Chu Ning and Gu Xiaoqing remained in the room.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu, it seems the other Senior Martial Brothers from the Spirit Plant House have been growing Primordial Spirit Grass in the spirit fields. I wonder if Junior Martial Brother Chu has any plans?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Gu Xiaoqing's words, a strange look flashed across Chu Ning's face. He had thought she would continue the previous topic and try to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, she did not mention it at all, and directly asked about the spirit field instead.</p><p></p><p>This was precisely what Chu Ning wanted to ask her about, so he immediately responded:</p><p></p><p>"I was also wondering what kind of spirit pills Senior Martial Sister Gu mainly sells in this market. Are they Primordial Pills as well?"</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing shook her head. "Of course I'll sell Primordial Pills, they seem to have been selling quite well. But I want to sell Gathering Pills more."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't help glancing at Gu Xiaoqing. This Senior Martial Sister's pill refining skills were quite good.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Pill and the Gathering Pill differed by only one word, and both were elementary spirit pills, yet their effects were completely different.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Pill was more basic, mainly used to restore spiritual power, and was considered a low-grade elementary pill.</p><p></p><p>The Gathering Pill, on the other hand, was used to increase spiritual power and improve one's cultivation. In terms of refining difficulty, the Gathering Pill was much harder than the Primordial Pill, considered a mid-grade elementary pill, bordering on high-grade.</p><p></p><p>While thinking this over, Chu Ning also asked: "Is the Golden Spirit Fruit the main ingredient for the Gathering Pill?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Junior Martial Brother is well-versed in spirit plants. The Golden Spirit Fruit is the most important ingredient in the Gathering Pill."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing's brilliant eyes gazed at Chu Ning with a hint of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Junior Martial Brother can grow Golden Spirit Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly. The Golden Spirit Fruit was the main ingredient for the Gathering Pill, which he had seen in the jade slip provided by He Changyou. That jade slip not only described the uses of the Golden Spirit Fruit, but also the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>For him, it was not a difficult task.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning's brow then furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The only problem is, I didn't bring any Golden Spirit Fruit seeds from the sect, and I don't know if the Steward Lin will be coming to the market again anytime soon."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

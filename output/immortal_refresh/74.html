        <h1>Chapter 74</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Yan Ji Fang was located in the branch ranges of the Qingxi Mountains. Because it was situated between the spheres of influence of two major sects, and was also close to Yanyun City, a human town to the north, this market town was not very large but still quite crowded whenever the market was open. The market opened once every three days. </p><p></p><p>Today was the closing day of the market. When Chun Ning and others arrived, there were not many people on the streets of the town. Lin Changqing led everyone to stop in front of several shops.</p><p></p><p>"There are four shops here, previously managed by different halls. Each has a courtyard for living quarters. The prohibition talismans can be activated, you can take a look respectively."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Lin Changqing waved his hand, and a small prohibition talisman appeared in front of each person, with Chun Ning having two.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the Spirit Plant House also had a shop here. Although the Qingxi Sect only cultivated 20 mu (about 3.3 acres) of spirit fields here, producing not much, the high grade of the spirit fields meant the spirit plants grown were also of high quality, allowing them to sell some spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, this shop did not only sell the produce from those 20 mu of fields. Normally, it would also purchase and sell spirit plants. It was even a rice shop, obtaining spirit rice from some cultivating clans or the Qingxi Sect to sell.</p><p></p><p>Chun Ning took the prohibition talismans and glanced at the two shops with the signs "Qingxi Spirit Talisman House" and "Qingxi Spirit Plant House". He walked into the Qingxi Spirit Talisman House by the side and entered.</p><p></p><p>Although the shop had been operating continuously, with people only leaving recently, it was quite tidy and cleaned up. There was an empty shelf above, naturally without anything on it. </p><p></p><p>Chun Ning simply glanced around, cast a few cleaning spells, and quickly tidied up the shop.  He then walked towards the back of the shop.</p><p></p><p>Behind the shop was a courtyard for resting and living. What surprised Chun Ning slightly was that although the shop itself was not large, the courtyard behind was quite spacious. Behind the living courtyard was an even larger courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Just considering the size of the courtyards, it was even a bit larger than the place Chun Ning used to live in the Ding District.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the housing sizes were prepared to be uniform here. Actually, the Spirit Talisman Pavilion doesn't really need so much space. But it's different for the Spirit Beast House. If they really are going to raise spirit beasts like the Grey Spirit Rabbits here, then a considerable amount of space would naturally be needed. The Spirit Plant House also needs space, as some spirit plants need to be replanted when collected."</p><p></p><p>What satisfied Chun Ning even more was that although this courtyard appeared to be adjacent to the others, it was clearly separated by some kind of boundary talisman, so they did not disturb each other.</p><p></p><p>Chun Ning also sensed the concentration of spiritual energy in the area, and immediately became even more satisfied. According to the information the Sect had provided them about Yan Ji Fang beforehand, this area used to have the highest concentration of spiritual energy in the region.</p><p></p><p>Previously, both the Qingxi Sect and Feng Xia Valley had obtained this area, and some cultivating clans also had the same idea. In the end, they compromised to turn it into a centralized market town.</p><p></p><p>So in terms of the richness of spiritual energy alone, it even surpassed the spirit fields that the Qingxi Sect had here.</p><p></p><p>"I was originally planning to just grow iron spirit vines here. But now it seems I can cultivate some higher quality spirit plants, which will be convenient for my future cultivation of the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Chun Ning's mind. Before he could think further, he heard Lin Changqing's voice transmission calling everyone to regroup, so he immediately left the courtyard and returned to the street.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Standing beside Lin Changqing on the street, there was another young man. </p><p></p><p>The man was around twenty-eight or twenty-nine years old, with a thin, long face. He stood straight and motionless.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning glanced at him and vaguely sensed a sharp aura about him. </p><p></p><p>However, judging from the Taoist robe he was wearing, he was also a member of the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was guessing the man's identity, Lin Changqing had already spoken:</p><p></p><p>"This is Du Han from the Law Enforcement Hall, with a cultivation level of the ninth layer of Qi Refining.  </p><p></p><p>If there is any trouble or danger caused by other cultivators, or if you need to report anything to the sect when I'm not around, you can find Du Han."</p><p></p><p>After saying that, Lin Changqing introduced Chu Ning and the others to Du Han one by one.</p><p></p><p>Before they could greet Du Han, he had already spoken in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"There is a law enforcement team formed by the major families in the market town. Normally, no one in Yanjixiang would dare to cause trouble for cultivators from our Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>So if you don't have any urgent matters, you don't need to come looking for me specifically."</p><p></p><p>Du Han's words immediately made Chu Ning silently sigh in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The sect really matched these two well, they both have a cold demeanor."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing, who was apparently already aware of Du Han's style, didn't say much more.</p><p></p><p>He only said to Du Han:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning will also be responsible for the cultivation of twenty acres of spirit fields. Take him to familiarize himself with the location. I still need to go to other market towns."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Lin Changqing immediately flew away on his spirit vessel amidst the respectful farewells of the others.</p><p></p><p>It was only then that Du Han turned his head to look at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit fields are not far from the market town, just about ten miles away. Let's go there."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Du Han didn't use any magical artifacts and simply flew away by riding the wind.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning followed him, also riding the wind.</p><p></p><p>The four people left behind watched as Chu Ning and Du Han went away. Luo Yiping, the male disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall, was the first to speak, shaking his head:</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Symbol Pavilion and the Spirit Plant Hall really have no one left, so they arranged for a fourth-layer Qi Refining disciple to take on two tasks."</p><p></p><p>"I don't think the Spirit Symbol Pavilion has high hopes for the business in Yanjixiang," replied Shen Zhengquan from the Artifact Refining Hall.</p><p></p><p>"The Wind Gorge Valley has always been known for its talisman-making skills. I've heard that our Qingxi Sect's talisman business in Yanjixiang is very small. Now..."</p><p></p><p>After the two spoke, the female disciple from the Spirit Beast Hall named Lu Miaoying immediately asked curiously:</p><p></p><p>"Since this Junior Brother Chu is alone, does he only need to hand in one harvest?"</p><p></p><p>"How could that be possible?" Luo Yiping immediately laughed lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Since he represents both the Spirit Symbol Pavilion and the Spirit Plant Hall, he definitely has to hand in two harvests.</p><p></p><p>Heh, this Junior Brother Chu...</p><p></p><p>I'm afraid he might not even be able to afford the harvests when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Luo Yiping's words, Lu Miaoying stuck out her tongue slightly, as if relieved that she didn't have to complete this task.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping then shook his head again and continued:</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't really matter whether he can afford the harvests or not, but Yanjixiang is jointly governed by our Qingxi Sect and the Wind Gorge Valley.</p><p></p><p>If his business here is completely suppressed by the Wind Gorge Valley, how will the cultivating families and scattered cultivators view us?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan also frowned and shook his head, seeming to express incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>Only Gu Xiaoqing, the female disciple from the Pill Refining Hall who had remained silent, calmly and gently said:</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this Junior Brother Chu has extraordinary abilities."</p><p></p><p>"What extraordinary abilities could a fourth-layer Qi Refining cultivator have?" Luo Yiping scoffed again.</p><p></p><p>As he said this, his gaze casually swept over the signboards of the two shops that Chu Ning was responsible for.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear what he was thinking.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

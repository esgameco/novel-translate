        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had such speculations in his mind, but his face did not reveal any abnormalities. </p><p></p><p>He silently watched as Cao Dongxin performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique on this patch of spirit rice again, and then continued to perform it on the area he did not work on yesterday.</p><p></p><p>"Guard here, don't let insects or birds eat the spirit rice!"</p><p></p><p>Leaving these words behind, Cao Dongxin left again on his own.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning waited for the other party to leave for a while, and his thoughts began to become active. He planned to first verify his previous speculation.</p><p></p><p>So, Chu Ning first found a farther field where Cao Dongxin had not performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique. </p><p></p><p>He sat cross-legged nearby, calmed his mind, and began cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Gong.</p><p></p><p>Everything proceeded normally, similar to yesterday afternoon, without the feeling of accelerated cultivation like yesterday morning.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning came to the last position where Cao Dongxin had just performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique. Next to this position was an area he had not performed the technique on. Even if there was some abnormality, at most Cao Dongxin would think he had made a mistake today, just like yesterday.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Chu Ning did not directly cultivate, but instead performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique on the adjacent unworked field.</p><p></p><p>Compared to yesterday, Chu Ning felt that he was obviously more relaxed and skilled.</p><p></p><p>This time when performing the technique, not only did the covered area increase to 10 stalks of red spirit rice, but after completing it, he still had energy left.</p><p></p><p>So, Chu Ning performed it again, but this time his spiritual power was weaker, only covering 8 stalks of red spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging spiritual power on these 18 stalks of red spirit rice, Chu Ning walked back a bit, then sat down and began formally cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Gong.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he circulated the technique, Chu Ning immediately felt a concentration and speed of spiritual qi completely different from before.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual qi originally possessed by heaven and earth, combined with the spiritual qi of the red spirit rice stalks, formed a more refined and vigorous spiritual qi that entered Chu Ning's body.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation speed of the Qingmu Changchun Gong was more than twice as fast as before!</p><p></p><p>"These red spirit rice stalks that have had the Qingmu Chunhua technique performed on them can indeed accelerate my cultivation speed!" Chu Ning inwardly rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>He then quickly calmed his mind and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>More than an hour later.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Gong (Yellow Realm Lower Grade), First Layer (7/300)]</p><p></p><p>After cultivating last night, the proficiency was 5. Now it had increased to 7, with the proficiency rising by 2 points!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly calculated in his mind as he looked at this proficiency.</p><p></p><p>"If the first layer of the Qingmu Changchun Gong corresponds to the initial Qi Refining realm, which is the first to third layers of Qi Refining, then it should be around 100 when the first layer of Qi Refining is fully completed.</p><p></p><p>And tomorrow I will be able to increase the proficiency to 10. In total, it will only take three days!</p><p></p><p>Doesn't this mean that at most in one month, I can fully complete the first layer of Qi Refining, or even break through to the second layer? Wow!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not know the cultivation speed of those outer and inner sect disciples, but he could definitely say that among these servant disciples, his cultivation speed was astonishing.</p><p></p><p>It's worth knowing that Cao Dongxin spent decades here, yet he was only at the fifth layer of Qi Refining without being able to break through the sixth layer.</p><p></p><p>"It's just not known whether there is a bottleneck from the initial to the intermediate stage of Qi Refining."</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed by, and Chu Ning couldn't help but laugh wryly. It had only been the third day of Qi Refining, and he was already thinking about breaking through later on - he was getting a bit carried away!</p><p></p><p>Hmm, stay low-key! Take it slowly!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning's mind became alert. His previous thoughts were a bit rash.</p><p></p><p>Every day after Cao Dongxin performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique, he would take advantage once, so he naturally had no guilt towards the other party's methods.</p><p></p><p>However, if it happened too many times, the other side would definitely become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a lot, even if tomorrow when the other party came to look, there was another area where the technique had been performed before but the growth was not as good as other areas, he might become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning glanced at those red spirit rice stalks.</p><p></p><p>Yesterday he had left in a hurry and did not pay attention, but now he could clearly see that the 18 stalks he had performed the technique on, as well as the 40 nearby stalks Cao Dongxin had worked on, no longer had the spiritual aura from when the Qingmu Chunhua technique was initially performed.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not much different from the unsworked stalks and did not seem additionally damaged.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning's heart moved.</p><p></p><p>"If I perform the Qingmu Chunhua technique on these stalks again, wouldn't it prevent being discovered?"</p><p></p><p>No sooner thought than done. Having just finished cultivating, he had abundant spiritual power. Moreover, with the increased Qingmu Changchun Gong proficiency, naturally he would have more comprehension when performing the Qingmu Chunhua technique.</p><p></p><p>Circulating his spiritual power, forming hand seals, and chanting the incantations, Chu Ning applied the Qingmu Chunhua technique to...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the rice paddy.</p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning covered a full 14 rice plants. </p><p></p><p>Another try, another 14 plants.</p><p></p><p>With a bit of energy left, Chu Ning performed it a third time, this time only covering 6 plants.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, that makes 34 plants!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked on with satisfaction and nodded. In the afternoon he could do it one more time and take care of the remaining 6 plants.</p><p></p><p>As for his dantian being completely drained of spiritual power at the moment, Chu Ning wasn't worried. </p><p></p><p>This spiritual power could be recovered through meditation, or even without meditating, it would slowly recover on its own.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly realized that he seemed to have found a shortcut for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could completely perform the Qingmu Chunhua Art on the spirit plants first, then cultivate. After his cultivation improved, he could perform the Qingmu Chunhua Art again.</p><p></p><p>This way, not only would the spirit plants grow, but his own cultivation would improve faster too.</p><p></p><p>It was just unknown whether this effect applied to everyone or if it was due to his special Yin Wood Spirit Body.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning guessed it was most likely the effect of the Yin Wood Spirit Body. If it worked for everyone, this method would definitely have been used for cultivation long ago.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the coverage of his Qingmu Chunhua Art was not enough to support his cultivation. </p><p></p><p>For that, he would naturally need to rely on Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>Given Cao Dongxin's attitude towards him, Chu Ning had no qualms about making him do hard labor.</p><p></p><p>The only thing was, he needed to confirm again whether everything he was doing would be discovered or not.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon, Chu Ning performed the Qingmu Chunhua Art once more on the remaining few stalks of red spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he did not choose to cultivate near the rice stalks he had cast the spell on, but waited to see if Cao Dongxin would notice anything.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, as usual after breakfast, Cao Dongxin brought Chu Ning to the fields.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Cao Dongxin did was go to the spot where the Qingmu Chunhua Art had been performed and inspect the growth of the rice plants.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he looked even more carefully than the day before.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he confirmed there were no issues, and a satisfied expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning secretly breathed a sigh of relief, thinking it was fortunate that he had been cautious and performed the Qingmu Chunhua Art on those rice stalks he had drained spiritual energy from.</p><p></p><p>If he discovered something like yesterday again, this Cao Dongxin would really become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, Chu Ning was convinced that his cultivation method would not be detected, at least not by Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>So in the following days, Chu Ning adopted a similar method every day.</p><p></p><p>And after a few days of cultivation, he gradually figured out the patterns, such as that cultivation was not most effective immediately after performing the Qingmu Chunhua Art on the rice plants.</p><p></p><p>Rather, it was most effective half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>He also figured out roughly the range within which he could borrow spiritual energy from the rice plants during cultivation, allowing him to choose his cultivation spot more accurately.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, Chu Ning had been at Qingxi Sect for fourteen days.</p><p></p><p>That afternoon, as Chu Ning was returning from the fields to go inside, Qiu Shunyi from the neighboring courtyard suddenly called out to him and waved.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning went over, Qiu Shunyi asked with a delighted expression:</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, tomorrow is when we go to the Cultivation Room to listen to lectures together. How is your cultivation of the Qingmu Changchun Art going?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Qiu Shunyi's expression, Chu Ning knew he must have made some progress, so he smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Shunyi, it seems you're about to succeed in your cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiu Shunyi's smile grew even wider, but he waved his hand and said:</p><p></p><p>"Eh, it's still far from succeeding. But these past two days I've become quite adept at sensing spiritual energy, and I'm just a tiny bit away from Refining Qi into the Body.</p><p></p><p>I feel there's a good chance I'll complete the Refining Qi into the Body stage tonight and officially enter the first level."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, he asked Chu Ning: "By the way, what about you? When do you think you'll be able to Refine Qi into the Body?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm also just a little bit away. Not sure when I'll be able to do it," Chu Ning said, habitually glancing at his proficiency level with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Art (Yellow Rank Lower Grade), First Level (61/300)]</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he pondered in his heart when would be an appropriate time for him to "break through" and Refine Qi into the Body.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had been using the supernatural powers of his Yin Wood Spirit Body to conceal his aura, afraid of revealing his First Level cultivation base too quickly.</p><p></p><p>But now it seemed the time was ripe, it was time for him to "break through"!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

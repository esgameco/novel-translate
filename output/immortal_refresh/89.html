        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The white little demonic beast tilted its head slightly at this moment, showing an expression of bewilderment similar to humans. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning recalled the voice that had just entered his mind, which sounded somewhat like the voice transmitted by the voice transmission technique. </p><p></p><p>He was immediately moved in his heart and asked the white little demonic beast using the voice transmission technique:</p><p></p><p>"Can you understand what I'm saying?"</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the white little beast did not react at all.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately felt a bit puzzled, thinking that the words just now were an illusion.</p><p></p><p>The white little beast kept waving its hooves, looking very anxious.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered that voice again, blinked his eyes, and spoke to the white little beast once more.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, he did not use the voice transmission spell, but instead used his divine sense to transmit messages.</p><p></p><p>"Can you understand what I'm saying?"</p><p></p><p>This time, the white little beast finally stopped its other actions and let out a "wu" sound.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was greatly astonished and asked again with his divine sense transmission: "You want me to release you."</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words fell, the white little beast kept nodding its head and making "wu wu" sounds from its mouth.</p><p></p><p>Then, it seemed to have remembered something, looking towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Release me!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, this voice resounded in Chu Ning's ears again.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had finally confirmed at this point that this white little beast could indeed communicate using divine sense, which made him extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't understand much about spiritual beasts and demonic beasts, he could tell at this moment that this white little beast was not an ordinary demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>After all, from Chu Ning's divine sense perception, this white little beast was just a mid-level first-grade demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Normally, demonic beasts of this level would absolutely not possess such intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt that such a spiritually-aware little beast would be a bit of a pity to directly kill.</p><p></p><p>However, this little beast was very fast, and it also seemed to have some special abilities.</p><p></p><p>Even a beast trapping talisman could not trap it, and it was unknown how it had passed through the protective forbidden formation to appear in the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>If he directly released it, it would probably run away immediately.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning communicated with the white little beast again using his divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"What if you run away after I release you?"</p><p></p><p>The white little beast kept shaking its head and waving its hooves, looking very anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Release me!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning heard this voice again.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning realized that although the white little beast could communicate using divine sense, it seemed to have just learned how to do so.</p><p></p><p>It could understand what he said, but it could not produce many sounds itself.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Chu Ning could only say to it with his divine sense:</p><p></p><p>"I can release you, but you cannot run around randomly. Otherwise, I will trap you again, and moreover..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning's hand had already produced a few more beast trapping talismans and a few sword talismans made of solid metal.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the talismans in Chu Ning's hand, a hint of fear appeared in the white little beast's eyes.</p><p></p><p>It then seemed to have thought of something, closing its eyes.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning saw a faint white halo appear on the white little beast's forehead.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the white little beast's weak voice also sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"Blood!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning hesitated slightly, understanding the white little beast's meaning.</p><p></p><p>It was asking him to drip his blood into that white halo, likely to establish some kind of contract relationship.</p><p></p><p>As a traveler from another world, Chu Ning roughly understood the intention behind the little beast's request.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was still somewhat hesitant.</p><p></p><p>He did not know much about spiritual beasts and demonic beasts, and was not sure whether establishing such a contract-like relationship would have any impact on himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, he knew that when cultivators formed contracts with higher-level spiritual beasts or demonic beasts, there were often certain conditions that had to be met.</p><p></p><p>In some cases, if the spiritual beast died after forming a contract, the cultivator would also suffer harm.</p><p></p><p>And this little beast was clearly not an ordinary being.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Chu Ning shook his head, not daring to act rashly.</p><p></p><p>However, considering how intelligent this beast seemed, he immediately communicated with it using his divine sense:</p><p></p><p>"Never mind, there's no need to form a contract. I'll trust you."</p><p></p><p>The white little beast opened its eyes, revealing an expression of human-like delight, and the white halo on its forehead disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Wu!"</p><p></p><p>The little beast then let out a happy sound.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled slightly after hearing it.</p><p></p><p>Following the method for using the beast trapping talisman, he made a hand seal and directed his spiritual power towards the white little beast.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the restraints originally binding the white little beast vanished.</p><p></p><p>Thinking further, Chu Ning also took out a healing talisman.</p><p></p><p>The white little beast's gaze flickered, showing a somewhat fearful look.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then communicated to it with his divine sense:</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, this is a spell to help heal your injuries."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, the white little beast looked at Chu Ning and nodded, as if saying "I trust you too."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled again, activated the healing talisman, and a healing spell fell upon the white little beast.</p><p></p><p>The wounds on the white little beast's body disappeared, and it joyfully spun around on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Wu!"</p><p></p><p>It called out happily towards Chu Ning again.</p><p></p><p>"This little beast is quite interesting," Chu Ning felt inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After entering Qingxi Sect, Chu Ning had always been cautious and on guard.</p><p></p><p>After this interaction with the little beast, his heart felt somewhat relaxed and joyful.</p><p></p><p>However, looking at the pitted ground of his spirit field beside him, he couldn't help but glare at the little beast again.</p><p></p><p>"Look at the mess you've made, ruining my spirit field."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the white little beast lay down on the ground, acting as if it was admitting its mistake and accepting punishment.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head, not saying anything further.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, these were plants he had just planted not long ago, and he hadn't come to tend to them since the beast disaster occurred after planting them.</p><p></p><p>So these two spirit plants hadn't grown very well over the past few days.</p><p></p><p>As long as he used the seeds to replant them with a catalyzing spell, and then applied the Green Wood Spring Blossom Technique, the impact shouldn't be too great.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning started from a corner of the spirit field, first taking out the seeds of the Golden Origin Fruit to catalyze and replant them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning cultivating, the white little beast followed a few zhang behind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning still could not fully trust this little beast, so he held the Silver Crystal Frost Bamboo Shield in one hand.</p><p></p><p>In any case, his catalyzing spell was instantaneous and did not require making hand seals.</p><p></p><p>However, the white little beast did not show any other unusual movements, and after following for a while, seeming to find it boring, the little beast directly found a spot to lie down and sleep.</p><p></p><p>Knowing that it had already been discovered by Chu Ning, the little beast did not choose to burrow into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the little beast's behavior, Chu Ning did not pay it any more attention.</p><p></p><p>He replanted the spirit plants section by section.</p><p></p><p>After catalyzing and replanting the Golden Origin Fruits, Chu Ning took out the seeds of the...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The purple crystal bamboo shoots began to sprout for supplemental planting. </p><p></p><p>After all the gaps were filled, Chu Ning did not leave directly either.</p><p></p><p>He casually took out some food from his storage bag, then adjusted his breath for a while to recover his magic power, and immediately began performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique. </p><p></p><p>During this process, Chu Ning paid attention to the white little beast a few times.</p><p></p><p>This little thing was sleeping so soundly, without any movement.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning also began to slowly let down his guard, at least for now, this little beast did not seem to have any other malicious intent.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning was about to finish performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, the white little beast finally woke up.</p><p></p><p>It came a few zhang away from Chu Ning, wagging its tail.</p><p></p><p>When it saw Chu Ning performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, it actually called out "wu wu" towards Chu Ning a few times.</p><p></p><p>Although it did not communicate with Chu Ning using divine sense, Chu Ning vaguely felt the meaning of these two calls.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning turned his head, somewhat amused.</p><p></p><p>"My technique is performed well, yet you little thing still need to praise it."</p><p></p><p>After performing the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique a few more times to ensure every part was fully covered, Chu Ning finally stopped and prepared to leave the spirit field.</p><p></p><p>However, at this time, looking at the white little beast, Chu Ning could not help but feel a bit troubled.</p><p></p><p>He did not know whether to take this little beast back to the town or how to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>It was definitely not okay to just let it go, after witnessing the extraordinary nature of this beast, how could Chu Ning let such a treasure leave directly.</p><p></p><p>It did not seem too good to let this little beast stay here either, who knows if the next day when he came back, his spirit field would become a mess again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had to take it back to the town, and if there was an opportunity, try to figure out what kind of spirit beast this was.</p><p></p><p>So, Chu Ning transmitted his voice to the little beast with divine sense:</p><p></p><p>"I'm going back, you come with me."</p><p></p><p>Originally, Chu Ning thought this little beast would resist, and he would have to coax it with threats or temptations.</p><p></p><p>Who knew, upon hearing these words, this little beast actually nodded repeatedly, looking obedient as if saying "Okay, I'll follow you."</p><p></p><p>Seeing it so obedient, Chu Ning was greatly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Leading the white little beast, he walked out, and when they exited the spirit field's formation, Chu Ning suddenly thought of something.</p><p></p><p>He asked the white little beast in puzzlement:</p><p></p><p>"My spirit field clearly has a protective formation, how did you get in?"</p><p></p><p>The white little beast blinked its eyes and turned around.</p><p></p><p>Then, right in front of Chu Ning's eyes, it went straight through the protective formation without any obstruction.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He checked the protective formation and found that it was undamaged.</p><p></p><p>Then he used a token to open the protective formation and entered the spirit field, only to find that the white little beast was standing inside, looking at him adorably.</p><p></p><p>"Can you go out directly?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had just finished transmitting his voice when the next moment, the white little beast darted out from the protective formation.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning came out again, the little beast was wagging its tail.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of spirit beast are you? How did you get here?"</p><p></p><p>After several experiences, Chu Ning felt more and more that this beast was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had never heard of any demonic beast having such abilities.</p><p></p><p>The white little beast did not respond when it heard Chu Ning's words.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it did not know its own origins or did not know how to express itself to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning could only gesture with his hand, indicating for it to follow him back.</p><p></p><p>One person and one beast headed towards the town.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning used a wind technique, yet the white little beast's speed was not inferior at all, which made Chu Ning extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning also realized that if the other party really wanted to escape, he probably would not be able to stop it.</p><p></p><p>After all, he could not hold the Beast Trapping Talisman in his hand all day long.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him even more was that this little beast did not show any intention of leaving at all. Instead, as time passed, it got closer and closer to him.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning returned to his shop in the town, this little beast was already walking side by side with him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning opened the shop door, and the white little beast followed him in.</p><p></p><p>It looked around curiously with its rolling eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, it called out "wu wu" towards the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly startled and led the white little beast to the backyard.</p><p></p><p>He saw the white little beast run towards one of the spirit plants.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly startled. This spirit plant was called Jade Orchid Fruit, which he had purchased from a wandering cultivator a couple of days ago.</p><p></p><p>This fruit was also an excellent medicinal ingredient for refining pills, and its value should be comparable to the Golden Element Fruit.</p><p></p><p>After selling the Jade Orchid Fruit to Chu Ning, this wandering cultivator also took out the Jade Orchid Fruit tree.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning guessed that the other party might have dug it up from somewhere and directly planted it in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>In the entire backyard, this Jade Orchid Fruit was the highest-grade spirit plant, with a higher quality than the Green Spirit Fruit that Chu Ning himself grew.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that this little beast had only broken into the spirit field that Chu Ning was in charge of in that patch of spirit fields,</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this spirit beast can distinguish the grades of spirit plants and has some special perception of spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning tried to communicate with it using divine sense.</p><p></p><p>"Can you sense the grades of spirit plants and the concentration of spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>The white little beast immediately raised its head, looking a bit smug.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning directly took out the Jade Orchid Fruit he had purchased before from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Then do you eat this thing?"</p><p></p><p>"Wu wu!" The white little beast immediately let out calls, looking quite delighted.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then directly threw it a Jade Orchid Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The white little beast swallowed it in one bite, blinking its eyes at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Then, it actually came up to Chu Ning and rubbed its head against him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback, tentatively squatting down and reaching out to gently stroke the white fur.</p><p></p><p>The white little beast did not resist, instead continuing to rub its head against Chu Ning's palm.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning gently stroked the white little beast's head and transmitted his voice with divine sense:</p><p></p><p>"You're all white and so small, I'll call you Little White.</p><p></p><p>And I'll give you a surname too, since you're so spiritually aware and a spirit beast, your surname will be Ling, Ling Little White."</p><p></p><p>"Wu!!" The white little beast called out, seeming to agree with the name Chu Ning gave it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning smiled happily, stood up and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>But after thinking for a moment, he squatted down again and transmitted his voice to Ling Little White with divine sense:</p><p></p><p>"Little White, if you want to eat something, you have to tell me first.</p><p></p><p>You can't just go and eat the things I grow."</p><p></p><p>"Wu!" Ling Little White clearly understood, letting out a soft call in response.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning paused, then added another sentence to it.</p><p></p><p>"Don't eat things grown by others either."</p><p></p><p>Ling Little White called out in agreement again, and only then did Chu Ning feel reassured.</p><p></p><p>In this town, it was not only him who had grown things.</p><p></p><p>He had only grown some spirit plants himself, but as for the good stuff used for pill refining grown by Gu Xiaoqing, it might be even better than his own.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not want to cause any major trouble because of this little thing.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ling Nong heard these words and his face also revealed a hint of perplexity.</p><p></p><p>"I also obtained these spiritual lingfruit seeds unintentionally. I know the spiritual lingfruit is not easy to cultivate, even catalyzing its growth is difficult for me. However, the income from spiritual rice is too low, so I want to try cultivating it."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but shake his head inwardly. This cultivator at the third level of qi refining seemed to be already struggling with growing spiritual rice. The spiritual lingfruit has even higher requirements for daily cultivation spells. He didn't think the other party could cultivate it well. After all, even within the sect, at least a top-grade spirit field in Area C would be needed to grow the spiritual lingfruit. </p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a thought arose in Chu Ning's mind, and he said to the other party: "This Daoist friend, why don't we make a trade? You give me the spiritual lingfruit seeds, and I'll give you some purple yam fruit seeds in exchange, as well as a supplementary spirit stone. I'll also give you a long-lasting talisman, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the middle-aged spirit farmer's face immediately lit up with delight as he asked Chu Ning in a tone of disbelief: "Does the shopkeeper really mean it?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded without saying much more. He took out a small handful of purple yam fruit seeds from his storage pouch, as well as two spirit stones and a long-lasting talisman, placing them on the counter.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged spirit farmer didn't hesitate and immediately put down the spiritual rice he had just mentioned, as well as the spiritual lingfruit seeds in his other hand. He then quickly grabbed the items Chu Ning had taken out, as if afraid that Chu Ning would change his mind.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning smiled and collected the spiritual rice and spiritual lingfruit seeds.</p><p></p><p>In this transaction, Chu Ning didn't make a profit. In fact, in terms of value, what he gave out was slightly higher.</p><p></p><p>If valued in spirit stones, the spiritual lingfruit would probably be worth twice as much as the purple yam fruit.</p><p></p><p>However, because the spiritual lingfruit was more difficult to cultivate and took longer, ordinary cultivators could only grow one season of spiritual lingfruit for every two seasons of purple yam fruit they grew.</p><p></p><p>So in terms of income, the difference between the two was not that great.</p><p></p><p>As for Chu Ning, there wasn't much difference in the difficulty of cultivating either of them.</p><p></p><p>The reason he wanted the other party's spiritual lingfruit seeds was entirely because the spiritual lingfruit fit his plans for the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual lingfruit grew on vines, which was very suitable for practicing the Thorny Vine Technique, even better than iron vines.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had always felt that the binding ability of the Thorny Vine Technique was quite good. It had been of great help when he fought Qi Chongmao in the past.</p><p></p><p>Although the Thorny Vine Technique was a low-grade elementary spell, the damage it inflicted after binding was greatly related to the strength of the spiritual plant itself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the spiritual lingfruit absorbed spiritual energy better than even the Ink Bamboo or the Purple Crystal Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>It was also very suitable for assisting in the cultivation of the Evergreen Wood Technique by absorbing spiritual energy from the Green Wood Longevity Art.</p><p></p><p>It was for these two reasons that Chu Ning chose to exchange for the spiritual lingfruit seeds.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged spirit farmer had almost come from the end of the market street, and after he left, there were hardly any people left on the lively street.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the market had finally dispersed, Chu Ning closed his shop and took the spiritual lingfruit seeds to the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual lingfruit's growth period for flowering and fruiting was longer than that of the iron vine, but not longer in terms of growing its vines.</p><p></p><p>The real difficulty in the early stages was catalyzing its growth.</p><p></p><p>Without reaching the instantaneous level of catalysis spells, it would be difficult to make the seeds sprout and grow.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was not a problem for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cast three consecutive instantaneous catalysis spells, and the spiritual lingfruit seeds began to sprout.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning followed up with the Evergreen Wood Technique, and the vines also started to grow slightly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning repeated this process, continuously catalyzing the growth of the spiritual lingfruit.</p><p></p><p>After planting the spiritual lingfruit vines around the perimeters of the two back courtyards, Chu Ning used his Blade Aura Technique to carve out a passageway in the connecting wall for people to pass through.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he nod in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>There was still room to plant other things in these two courtyards.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had already made plans in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard on the side of the Spirit Plant House would mainly be used to grow spiritual plants that had been purchased and could not be directly stored in storage pouches.</p><p></p><p>Even if these spiritual plants ultimately could not be sold, they...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>It was able to provide deductions on the harvest for the sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the courtyard of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, Chu Ning planned to plant some spirit plants that absorb spiritual energy relatively quickly.  </p><p></p><p>This was naturally convenient for cultivating using the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Green Spirit Fruit was currently acceptable for cultivation, but Chu Ning felt that as his cultivation base progressed, the speed at which the Green Spirit Fruit absorbed spiritual energy might not be able to satisfy his needs eventually.</p><p></p><p>"If there's an opportunity, I still need to obtain some higher quality spirit plants."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stroked his chin, this matter was completely up to chance, it wasn't something he could do just because he wanted to.</p><p></p><p>After finishing these tasks, Chu Ning began to tally up the day's earnings from the two shops.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning first looked at the Spirit Plant Shop.</p><p></p><p>He didn't bring any spirit plants to sell today, mainly focusing on purchasing instead.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Rice, Red Spirit Rice, Tranquility Grass, White Butterfly Flower, Apricot Spirit Fruit...</p><p></p><p>Most were some relatively common local spirit plants. After roughly categorizing them, Chu Ning put them into the special storage bags.</p><p></p><p>The large storage bags gifted by He Changyu were finally put to good use.</p><p></p><p>After putting away these storage bags, Chu Ning took out his own small storage bag and looked at the talismans.</p><p></p><p>He had 260 Wood Escape Talismans originally, now 200 remained, having sold 60.</p><p></p><p>He originally had 220 Blazing Fire Talismans and Profound Ice Talismans each, now 117 and 138 remained respectively, having sold 103 and 82.</p><p></p><p>For the Rejuvenation Talismans used for healing, he now had 155 left, having sold 45.</p><p></p><p>He now had 110 Evergreen Talismans left, having sold 40.</p><p></p><p>Only 105 Earth Armor Talismans remained, having sold 95.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning checked the quantity of spirit stones, he was truly startled.</p><p></p><p>Most were sold under the buy-five-get-one-free promotion, but some were also sold individually.</p><p></p><p>Just this one day, he had sold 837 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"If I had this income every day..."</p><p></p><p>But after a moment's thought, Chu Ning shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Today was obviously an exception.</p><p></p><p>First, it was thanks to his own buy-five-get-one-free promotion.</p><p></p><p>In this cultivation world completely unfamiliar with marketing, simply using some modern promotional tactics was enough to create a huge buzz.</p><p></p><p>Then, the high quality of his talismans compared to Wind Gorge also attracted a lot of curious people.</p><p></p><p>However, correspondingly, this had also depleted everyone's purchasing power.</p><p></p><p>It was impossible for so many people to need to buy talismans on every market day.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, Chu Ning's face was still filled with smiles at this moment.</p><p></p><p>These spirit stones had already been earned, which was real and tangible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning was also aware that not everyone could be like him.</p><p></p><p>After all, others' talisman success rates could not possibly be so high.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even for ordinary late Qi Condensation cultivators, it was impossible for them to cultivate their spiritual sense and use it to craft talismans like he did.</p><p></p><p>This meant that most talisman masters could not produce at the same intensity as Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, for normal mid or even late Qi Condensation disciples, in the same amount of time, being able to produce one-third of Chu Ning's talisman output would already be very good, not to mention the lower quality.</p><p></p><p>The talismans Chu Ning sold today were about one-fourth to one-third of his output from crafting talismans for a month.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the talismans Chu Ning sold in one day would take an ordinary first-rank talisman master almost a month to produce.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the sect has set the rule that this Talisman Shop must hand over 500 spirit stones to the sect every month. Calculated, that's about half the earnings."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The sect really calculated everything quite precisely."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>After tallying the talismans he sold today, Chu Ning began to seriously consider Luo Yiping's words.</p><p></p><p>Wind Gorge was preparing to sell quite a few low-grade spirit talismans.</p><p></p><p>It seemed it was time to learn the talisman crafting techniques recorded in the Spiritual Talisman Codex.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

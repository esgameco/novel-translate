            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chuning finally decided to take action.</p><p></p><p>If Old Man Sun had just escaped, and the three would have chased after him, Chuning would of course have chosen to find an opportunity to leave. </p><p></p><p>But now, Old Man Sun had not been able to escape.</p><p></p><p>It also meant that once the battle between the two sides was over, it was only a matter of time before Chuning's hiding place was exposed.</p><p></p><p>Although the fifth-layer cultivated Old Man Sun was at a disadvantage against the three just now, he was surprisingly able to withstand a few moves.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly made Chuning feel a little unexpected.</p><p></p><p>But, no matter what, facing Old Man Sun alone was better than facing the other three.</p><p></p><p>Several golden sword talismans were released, and Chuning's spells directly attacked the yellow-faced man closest to him.</p><p></p><p>This person was the only seventh-layer cultivator among the three.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the people finally reacted that something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke first was the effeminate young man facing inward.</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>The yellow-faced man, being close and of the highest level, also reacted.</p><p></p><p>He pointed his short spear, and a yellow light shot out, blocking one of Chuning's golden sword rays.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, his body was enveloped in a yellowish-brown protective shield.</p><p></p><p>This earth defense spell looked good, as it actually blocked several of Chuning's golden sword rays.</p><p></p><p>However, this also caused the protective light shield around his body to shatter.</p><p></p><p>When he looked up and saw Chuning wave his hand, unleashing several spells of different colors.</p><p></p><p>His face immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>He quickly activated a talisman, adding another layer of protective force around his body.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, on the other side, although Old Man Sun had many good things on him, his level was too low.</p><p></p><p>In his precarious situation, his protective light shield was broken, and he was directly struck by Old Man Liu's huge fist.</p><p></p><p>With a crisp cracking sound, Old Man Sun's whole body went limp and fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>At this time, the effeminate young man shouted again.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying his voice, a black light suddenly shot out from Old Man Sun's body.</p><p></p><p>It flew straight towards the yellow-faced man fighting with Chuning.</p><p></p><p>The yellow-faced man was putting all his effort into fending off Chuning's attacks. After several spells, his protective shield could no longer support him.</p><p></p><p>He never expected Old Man Sun to actually attack him.</p><p></p><p>By the time the black light reached him, he reacted, but it was already too late to dodge.</p><p></p><p>The black light pierced through the yellow-faced man's chest, and the next moment, he opened his eyes wide in disbelief and fell backwards.</p><p></p><p>However, this yellow-faced man was indeed a vicious person.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, he actually managed to condense all his magic power and fiercely threw his short spear.</p><p></p><p>Directly at Chuning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this yellow light rushing over, Chuning did not dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>The prepared low-grade superior defensive talisman, the Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman, was activated, forming a layer of shimmering white light shield to protect his body.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The yellow spear struck the white light shield and was blocked, falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, under this person's full-power strike before death, Chuning's Flowing Light Ice Shield Talisman was completely shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the yellow-faced man fall, Old Man Liu roared with bulging eyes.</p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man, however, did not look this way, but directly shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother..."</p><p></p><p>The next moment, several golden lights flew out from Chuning's hands, straight towards the effeminate young man.</p><p></p><p>Their might made this sixth-layer cultivated effeminate young man look extremely serious, not even finishing the words he was about to say.</p><p></p><p>What made him even more vigilant was that the unknown-level demonic beast also spat out a white light towards him.</p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man quickly released several red lights to meet those golden sword rays.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a faint red protective shield also appeared around his body.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Liu finally reacted as well, no longer paying attention to the fallen yellow-faced man.</p><p></p><p>Because at the same time, he saw several blue sword rays shooting towards him from the hands of the young man in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Old Man Liu activated a defensive talisman in his hand.</p><p></p><p>But what made him feel horrified was that behind those blue rays, there were also several golden lights attacking.</p><p></p><p>He clearly saw that the blue sword rays were the young man's spells, while those golden lights, like the ones attacking the effeminate young man, were talismans.</p><p></p><p>"How does this guy have so many offensive talismans on him?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Old Man Liu gritted his teeth and activated an escaping talisman, charging straight at Chuning.</p><p></p><p>He practiced body cultivation, so close combat was naturally more powerful for him.</p><p></p><p>All of this happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>From Chuning's appearance with Little White Spirit, to unleashing numerous talismans, </p><p></p><p>To Old Man Liu forcibly using the escaping talisman to charge at Chuning, it was just a matter of a few breaths.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the several golden lights at the other end had already reached the effeminate young man.</p><p></p><p>Although he released several spells to block them, against these extremely powerful golden sword talismans, those red lights were all directly shattered without exception.</p><p></p><p>The remaining spells, along with the white light spat out by Little White Spirit, all struck the effeminate young man's yellowish protective shield.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, the yellow shield was directly broken.</p><p></p><p>Two golden lights struck the effeminate young man's chest, and the effeminate young man...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, his face showed great alarm and his figure flashed as he tried to flee.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still a step too late. Two golden rays slashed down, directly severing the young man's two arms.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man let out a miserable scream, his gaze turning towards Chu Ning's direction. He gritted his teeth and let out a shrill cry:</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, at this moment Liu Laoda was using an evasion technique to dodge the golden spells while his figure charged towards that youth in blue robes. </p><p></p><p>It was unknown what was going on with that youth in blue robes, but he did not try to evade at all.</p><p></p><p>This caused the effeminate young man to rejoice greatly.</p><p></p><p>Although Liu Laoda was also at the sixth level of Qi refinement like him, since he cultivated the body, once in close combat his killing power would be even higher than the yellow-faced man at the seventh level of Qi refinement.</p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man gritted his teeth against the pain, eagerly anticipating the scene of Liu Laoda striking Chu Ning down with one blow.</p><p></p><p>But the next moment, what left him utterly dumbfounded was:</p><p></p><p>When Liu Laoda used his fleeing technique to approach the youth in blue robes and swung his hammer down,</p><p></p><p>A silvery-white radiance suddenly lit up in front of the youth in blue robes.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a silvery-white shield appeared, blocking Liu Laoda's iron hammer.</p><p></p><p>"A defensive magic artifact?"</p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man's eyes narrowed slightly. Knowing the attack power behind Liu Laoda's hammer strike, he quickly judged that this artifact must at least be a mid-grade magic artifact.</p><p></p><p>This made him astonished beyond words. He really could not fathom,</p><p></p><p>How could this youth in blue robes possess so many spirit talismans and treasures, one after another, even more than that old man Sun.</p><p></p><p>But just now when dealing with old man Sun, it was three people surrounding one.</p><p></p><p>Now, however, it was Liu Laoda against him one-on-one.</p><p></p><p>This made the effeminate young man worry for Liu Laoda.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, Liu Laoda himself was inwardly shocked as well.</p><p></p><p>When he saw Chu Ning not evading, he was overjoyed at first.</p><p></p><p>But now, with his full-force hammer strike being directly blocked by the other party, Liu Laoda immediately sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>His body was about to immediately flee.</p><p></p><p>He had not forgotten that just now, the spells and several talismans released by the other party had all locked onto him.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning would never give him another chance.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a fist burst out from behind that silvery frost bamboo shield.</p><p></p><p>Body cultivators, weren't they all the same?</p><p></p><p>*Bang!*</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's fist heavily struck Liu Laoda's body.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by a muffled sound, Liu Laoda's body was directly knocked backwards.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, there was also a faint cracking sound.</p><p></p><p>The sound of bones shattering.</p><p></p><p>"A body cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the effeminate young man's face showed horror as he turned and dashed straight for the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>He did not know what kind of person they had encountered.</p><p></p><p>This youth looked like he was at the fourth level of Qi refinement, yet he had all sorts of talismans and even a defensive magic artifact.</p><p></p><p>More critically, this person was actually a body cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Of the three of them, Liu Laoda had the strongest combat power, yet he was directly killed by a single punch in their first exchange.</p><p></p><p>Flee!</p><p></p><p>Hurry and flee!</p><p></p><p>This was the only thought in the effeminate young man's mind at this moment.</p><p></p><p>But just then, he saw this youth merely raise his hand, and a blue sword-shaped spell was fired straight at him.</p><p></p><p>The speed was so fast, as if there was no preparation at all.</p><p></p><p>The effeminate young man had to stop in his tracks, knowing that if he did not block this spell, he would be pierced through by this blue radiance.</p><p></p><p>However, after the earlier battle with old man Sun, and blocking Chu Ning's barrage of sword talismans, he had already depleted all the talismans he had.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could only cast a body protection spell to withstand the attack.</p><p></p><p>Circulating his spiritual power, a faint red glow appeared around the effeminate young man's body.</p><p></p><p>Yet, when this red glow came into contact with Chu Ning's blue radiance, its color quickly faded.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, that blue radiance grew even brighter.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Wood Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning watched this scene from afar, his eyes flickering slightly.</p><p></p><p>If the defensive barrier did not immediately and completely block the sword radiance, causing it to dissipate, then this barrier would only serve to nourish the sword radiance.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, in this situation of one waxing as the other waned,</p><p></p><p>In just two breaths of time, that faint red glow vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>While that intensely bright blue sword radiance struck the effeminate young man's body amidst his despairing gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Who...are you?"</p><p></p><p>With endless doubt, the effeminate young man fell heavily to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Watching the last person fall to the ground, Chu Ning finally let out a relieved breath.</p><p></p><p>Today's situation was quite dangerous.  </p><p></p><p>If he wasn't mistaken, that more cunning effeminate young man must have discovered him early on.</p><p></p><p>From Chu Ning's spiritual sense perception, this person had been carefully observing his surroundings after entering the cave.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown from where he noticed Chu Ning's traces.</p><p></p><p>But it was clear he must have sensed something, which was why he attacked old man Sun without a second word.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was able to react so quickly even after Chu Ning launched his attack.</p><p></p><p>"It's still too dangerous to face multiple opponents alone, especially when my level doesn't have an advantage.</p><p></p><p>Next time I'll need to prepare more life-saving items."</p><p></p><p>While squatting down to search Liu Laoda's body, Chu Ning inwardly muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

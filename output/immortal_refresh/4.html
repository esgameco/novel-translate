        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As He Changyou spoke, he picked up the jade slip that Elder Chen had previously given him. </p><p></p><p>"Bai Xiaotian, Fire Room!"</p><p></p><p>"Qiu Yu, Spirit Beast Room."  </p><p></p><p>"Chen Dao, Spirit Plant Room."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>He Changyou recited each name one by one, glancing at the jade slip before saying each name. Chu Ning guessed that he was probably checking their spiritual root information. </p><p></p><p>Then based on different attributes, he assigned them to different rooms, as he had mentioned that the cultivation methods and spells were different.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, Spirit Plant Room."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning heard him call out his own name.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that he was indeed going to the Spirit Plant Room, Chu Ning secretly felt relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After He Changyou had assigned everyone, Chu Ning roughly calculated in his heart that the Spirit Plant Room had the most people, nearly thirty, followed by the Spirit Beast Room.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that cultivation of plants and beasts were the major industries of the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a few more people came out of the house and led the groups to different places.</p><p></p><p>The one leading Chu Ning and the others was He Changyou himself.</p><p></p><p>"Those assigned to the Spirit Plant Room, follow me," he said, striding towards the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, many disciples full of anticipation showed disappointment on their faces, as the sect was located up the mountain, and heading downwards clearly meant moving away from the sect's core.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was not surprised. For farming, it was natural to be at the foot of the mountain. He just didn't know what differences there were between cultivating spiritual plants here versus regular farming back on Earth.</p><p></p><p>He was born in a rural village and had done tasks like transplanting rice seedlings and harvesting rice when he was young. It was only after becoming an office worker that he hadn't returned to his hometown to do such work.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a distance, everyone could see large stretches of fields from afar, with small courtyards scattered where the fields met the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual fields of our Qingxi Sect are divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D. The higher your cultivation level, the higher the grade of spiritual field you can cultivate, and the better the spiritual plants you can grow. </p><p></p><p>The A and B grade spiritual fields are managed by outer sect disciples, inner sect disciples, and even executors and elders. Our Baixi Hall mainly oversees the C and D districts. You are all newcomers, so you'll start by helping out in the D district first."</p><p></p><p>As He Changyou spoke, he led everyone further towards the outermost area of the spiritual fields.</p><p></p><p>There were already many people gathered here. Among them, there were fewer young people, and many were middle-aged. Upon seeing He Changyou's arrival, everyone greeted him respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Executor He."</p><p></p><p>Their words were quite deferential.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou merely nodded slightly in response.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning couldn't help but ponder in his heart:</p><p></p><p>"It seems the cultivation world really has clear hierarchies. This He Changyou was extremely respectful towards Elder Chen, but he holds a high position among the menial disciples."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he reminded himself that before becoming powerful enough, he should first cultivate stealthily.</p><p></p><p>"These are the newcomers who joined this year," He Changyou's voice rang out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Same old rules, each of you take one and be responsible for teaching them."</p><p></p><p>He Changyou spoke, then turned to Chu Ning and the others, saying:</p><p></p><p>"Later, I'll arrange for someone to deliver the cultivation methods and living supplies to you.</p><p></p><p>These are your senior martial brothers. They will teach you the techniques for cultivating spiritual plants in the D district, as well as some simple spells.</p><p></p><p>Every half month, you'll gather at the Cultivation Transmission Room to attend lectures, where there will be Cultivation Transmission Disciples to answer any questions you have about your cultivation.</p><p></p><p>For the next three months, you'll focus on cultivation and learning the planting techniques. After three months, those who pass the test can cultivate the spiritual fields independently."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, He Changyou began assigning the newcomers to different seniors. Soon it was Chu Ning's turn.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, you'll follow Cao Dongxin."</p><p></p><p>As He Changyou's words fell, a middle-aged man with dark skin, average build, and a slightly hunched back emerged from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>From his appearance, Cao Dongxin seemed to be in his...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Lao Qiao seemed to be nearly fifty years old. Even among this group of older servant disciples, he was considered elderly. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning walked up beside him and politely called out, "Senior Martial Brother Qiao."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Dongxin did not respond, only glancing at Chu Ning as an acknowledgment. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning assumed he was not a talkative person, so he did not say anything further.</p><p></p><p>After assigning everyone, He Changyou did not linger and left. At this time, those older servant disciples also dispersed, leading their assigned people away.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Dongxin still did not speak, not even giving Chu Ning any indication, as he turned and walked away.</p><p></p><p>"Could this senior martial brother be a mute?" Chu Ning followed behind him, unable to help muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, soon after, he was drawn to the conversations of others around him.</p><p></p><p>"There are hundreds of us in the Ding District, but since you newcomers are few, they only had us come out."  </p><p></p><p>"Most in the Ding District are at the early or middle stages of Qi refining. The highest is the fifth level of Qi refining. Anyone above the sixth level of Qi refining with the hope of reaching the late stages becomes an inner disciple cultivating in the higher-grade spirit fields. Simply put, we have the lowest aptitudes and are just waiting here to grow old and die."</p><p></p><p>"Every three years a new batch of disciples joins and helps us out for three months. It's a benefit for us old folks."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The neighboring martial brother spoke with some self-mockery, but was very optimistic and talkative, allowing Chu Ning and the other new disciples to understand the situation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then realized why these senior martial brothers lacked sharpness. Watching batch after batch of more talented youths cultivate to higher realms and move to higher-grade spirit fields, while they themselves could only be eliminated and remain here - experiencing this repeatedly would naturally wear away one's edge.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, Qiao Dongxin entered a small courtyard first, and Chu Ning followed him in.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chu Ning also noticed that the very talkative martial brother from before entered the neighboring courtyard. </p><p></p><p>He remembered that person's name was Shang Zhaoxiang. Chu Ning thought to himself that he should chat more with this senior when he had the chance to inquire about more information regarding the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>After entering the courtyard, Qiao Dongxin headed straight for the central room. Finally unable to restrain himself, Chu Ning spoke up, "Senior Martial Brother Qiao, may I ask which room I will be staying in?"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Dongxin continued walking but gestured with his hand toward a room on the east side.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning spoke again, "Senior Martial Brother, is there anything else you need to tell me?"</p><p></p><p>Qiao Dongxin's steps paused slightly. Without turning around, he finally opened his mouth, "Tomorrow morning, come work in the fields with me."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he went straight into the room.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning couldn't help muttering to himself, "So he's not actually mute, just has a rather unsociable personality."</p><p></p><p>Though he thought this, Chu Ning did not show any displeasure, instead calmly walking toward the east room.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Martial Brother Qiao clearly did not have a very amiable personality. Chu Ning did not want to reveal any emotion that could upset him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was simply being cautious, but he failed to notice that when Qiao Dongxin entered his room and closed the door, he glanced back to observe Chu Ning's reaction.</p><p></p><p>Only after seeing Chu Ning's normal expression as he walked to his room did Qiao Dongxin continue into his own room with no change of expression.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning entered the east room and found it tidy but rather simple. He did not mind much, putting down his belongings and giving it a quick clean.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, someone called from the courtyard entrance, "Chu Ning, come out and get your things."</p><p></p><p>Recognizing the voice, Chu Ning knew it must be what He Changyou mentioned earlier about receiving cultivation manuals and living supplies. He immediately exited the room.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation manuals provided here must be genuine transcendent arts - the very reason countless people clamored to join the Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>New author, new book, please support! </p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

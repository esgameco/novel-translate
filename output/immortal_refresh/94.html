            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Your urine can actually help the spirit plant grow?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning transmitted his voice in astonishment to Ling Xiaobai using his spiritual sense, and Ling Xiaobai responded with a "woo" sound. </p><p></p><p>There was even a hint of pride in that sound.</p><p></p><p>"Want to eat!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Ling Xiaobai's spiritual transmission resounded in Chu Ning's mind.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Ling Xiaobai could grasp more than just the three words "let me go."</p><p></p><p>However, communicating this way was actually more convenient.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, remember to help this iron orchid grow every day. If the iron orchid fruit really grows, I'll share a few with you to eat."</p><p></p><p>As soon as Chu Ning finished speaking, Ling Xiaobai let out a "woo" and went straight to the other iron orchid plants.</p><p></p><p>And urinated in a puddle again.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's reaction was no longer like yesterday's. His only thought at the moment was...</p><p></p><p>"If this little guy urinates like this every day, and I cultivate sitting in the middle of these iron orchids in the future, won't the smell be too strong?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, yet Chu Ning's hands did not stop, releasing stream after stream of Green Wood Spring Florescence Arts, covering the entire iron orchid ring.</p><p></p><p>It was only after thirty more Green Wood Spring Florescence Arts that Chu Ning ended his spellcasting on the iron orchids.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then turned towards the spirit fruits and released stream after stream of Green Wood Spring Florescence Arts.</p><p></p><p>After finishing all this, Chu Ning finally sat cross-legged in the most densely planted area of the spirit fruits, preparing to cultivate the Green Wood Longevity Art.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to the market town, his cultivation could not be considered normal.</p><p></p><p>Previously, it was mainly due to the occurrence of the beast calamity, which had distracted too much of his effort in talisman making.</p><p></p><p>Then the spirit plants he had planted had not grown well, so the Green Wood Spring Florescence Art he commonly used to aid his cultivation had not shown its effects yet.</p><p></p><p>A few days ago, he had caught up some progress with the help of spirit stones, but after cultivating the spirit fruits and iron orchids successively, his daily cultivation methods could be used again.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Longevity Art (Yellow Grade Lower Tier), Second Layer (528/900)]  </p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art, First Scroll, Deathless Bones 181/600]</p><p>[Spirit Refining Art, First Layer 171/1000]</p><p></p><p>After checking his current proficiency levels, Chu Ning closed his eyes and began cultivating in the next moment.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, streams of spiritual energy converged on Chu Ning's body from the spirit fruits.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai, who had never paid attention to Chu Ning's cultivation before, tilted its little head in surprise at this scene.</p><p></p><p>It then looked down at its own body, as if deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>However, it soon lay down and fell into a deep sleep again.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning cultivated for about half a day, feeling very satisfied with the speed of cultivation aided by the Green Wood Spring Florescence Art.</p><p></p><p>The Green Wood Longevity Art successfully increased by 1 proficiency point.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not stop there. In the next moment, he took out a jade vial from his storage bag and poured out a pill from it.</p><p></p><p>It was the Qi Gathering Pill he had just bought from Gu Xiaoxing.</p><p></p><p>All along, Chu Ning had not relied too much on pills for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The main reason was that Chu Ning had the enhancement of the Green Wood Spring Florescence Art, so his cultivation speed was not slow.</p><p></p><p>There was also another important reason - Chu Ning possessed a Tiger Wood Spirit Body, allowing him to absorb spiritual energy from spirit stones very quickly.</p><p></p><p>For ordinary cultivators unable to rapidly absorb spiritual energy from spirit stones, using spirit stones to buy pills to aid cultivation became the best method.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Chu Ning needed a major breakthrough, he would directly use spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was now prepared to give it a try. He had reached the sixth layer of Qi Refinement, and this Qi Gathering Pill would have better effects in the middle stages of Qi Refinement.</p><p></p><p>In the later stages of Qi Refinement, its effects would be average.</p><p></p><p>Taking a Qi Gathering Pill, Chu Ning swallowed it directly.</p><p></p><p>Feeling the spiritual power transformed from the pill in his body, Chu Ning began operating the Green Wood Longevity Art to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>It was only after the effects of the entire Qi Gathering Pill had been converted that Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he did was check on the Green Wood Longevity Art.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Longevity Art (Yellow Grade Lower Tier), Second Layer (532/900)]</p><p></p><p>"One Qi Gathering Pill increased the proficiency by 3 points."</p><p></p><p>This rate of increase was actually about the same as directly using 10 spirit stones, or even slightly less.</p><p></p><p>"However, directly refining 10 spirit stones would take me longer," Chu Ning began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"But if I use these Qi Gathering Pills, I can save some time, so it can still help speed up my cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Considering that the effects of pills will diminish if taken too frequently, these Qi Gathering Pills can only be taken for a period of time."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>For the time being, he could use some Qi Gathering Pills for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>And he didn't need to hide it anymore, he could just directly buy them from Gu Xiaoxing.</p><p></p><p>This way, there would be a reason for the increase in his cultivation speed, as he couldn't remain outwardly at the "fourth layer of Qi Refinement" forever.</p><p></p><p>Over the next ten days, Chu Ning cultivated, farmed, and played with Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>He intentionally trained Ling Xiaobai to understand his normal speech. Sometimes he would say something and then transmit it again with his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>The results were good - Ling Xiaobai gradually began to understand simple words.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation, without neglecting Body Refinement and Spirit Refinement, Chu Ning took one Qi Gathering Pill every day to cultivate the Green Wood Longevity Art.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, five days after planting the iron orchids, they had completely grown normally, and Chu Ning began using the iron orchids with the Green Wood Spring Florescence Art to aid his cultivation as well.</p><p></p><p>He even occasionally used spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>With these multiple enhancements, Chu Ning's Green Wood Longevity Art advanced at a rapid pace of nearly 5 proficiency points per day.</p><p></p><p>Within ten days, Chu Ning's proficiency in the Green Wood Longevity Art directly increased by 50 points.</p><p></p><p>And a whole bottle of Qi Gathering Pills was used up.</p><p></p><p>Having tasted the benefits, Chu Ning went straight to Gu Xiaoxing's shop early that day, intending to buy some more to continue using pills to aid his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai didn't know what was going on, but it seemed to be sleeping less than before these past couple of days.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning went out, it also waddled along behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Gu."</p><p></p><p>When he arrived at Gu Xiaoxing's shop, she was holding a few jade vials and working on some pills.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu has come."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoxing greeted Chu Ning first, then her gaze fell on Ling Xiaobai beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what a cute spirit beast!</p><p></p><p>Junior Brother Chu, is this a spirit beast you cultivated? I've never seen it before."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, Gu Xiaoxing's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this cute little pet still had quite an impact on women.</p><p></p><p>"No, I didn't cultivate it. I just picked it up on the road," Chu Ning casually replied, intending to ask Gu Xiaoxing about buying Qi Gathering Pills.</p><p></p><p>However, this woman was clearly attracted by the slightly adorable Ling Xiaobai and had her attention drawn to it.</p><p></p><p>She even walked over to Chu Ning's side at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai looked at the approaching Gu Xiaoxing with a somewhat wary gaze, appearing very guarded, as if ready to launch an attack at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning quickly transmitted to Ling Xiaobai with his spiritual sense, indicating that this was his friend and there was no danger.</p><p></p><p>After hearing the spiritual transmission, Ling Xiaobai finally dropped its guarded look.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chu Ning relax a little.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten that when he first met Ling Xiaobai, it could unleash offensive spells.</p><p></p><p>Although he had blocked it with a magic weapon back then, the Silver Crystal Bamboo Shield was a mid-grade magic weapon.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai's white spell seemed to be of the ice element, and its power didn't seem too weak either.</p><p></p><p>If Gu Xiaoxing wasn't careful and got hurt, that wouldn't be good.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ling Xiaobai's reaction, Gu Xiaoxing's interest clearly increased.</p><p></p><p>She squatted down, looking at Ling Xiaobai curiously and asked, "You picked it up? What kind of spirit beast is this? I don't recognize it."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head, "I don't know what kind of spirit beast it is either."</p><p></p><p>He did hope Gu Xiaoxing would recognize it, but it was evident that this fellow senior sister didn't know either.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoxing just curiously examined Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>"This little spirit beast is just too adorable..."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Gu Xiaoxing reached out her hand, wanting to pet Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>However, the little guy wasn't willing, leaping away and jumping straight onto Chu Ning's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>This startled Gu Xiaoxing.</p><p></p><p>"This little one is still a bit afraid of strangers since I just picked it up," Chu Ning quickly explained upon seeing Ling Xiaobai's reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister Gu, do you have any Qi Gathering Pills for sale? I want to buy some."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Ling Xiaobai didn't want to interact with her, Gu Xiaoxing retracted her hand with some regret, glancing at the little beast a few more times before looking at Chu Ning and saying, "Qi Gathering Pills? Junior Brother Chu wants to take them himself."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "Yes, I'm nearing a breakthrough, so I want to buy some to improve my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"So Junior Brother Chu is about to break through to the fifth layer of Qi Refinement," Gu Xiaoxing gave Chu Ning a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"How many do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought for a moment, "30 pills."</p><p></p><p>30 would be enough for a month's consumption.</p><p></p><p>"30 pills?" Gu Xiaoxing was slightly taken aback upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Then she said seriously, "Junior Brother Chu, it's not that the more of these pills you take, the better.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it's best to take one Qi Gathering Pill every three days to fully absorb the medicinal effects."</p><p></p><p>She paused, then continued, "Moreover, pills generally carry some pill toxins. This three-day period is also just enough time to expel the accompanying pill toxins through cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If you take them too frequently, the pill toxins will accumulate in your body, and over a long period of time, they will cause some damage."</p><p></p><p>"Pill toxins?" Chu Ning was slightly stunned upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>He had been taking them continuously for ten days now, but he hadn't felt any pill toxins.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, he asked Gu Xiaoxing, "Senior Sister Gu, can we sense these residual pill toxins in our bodies?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Gu Xiaoxing nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"We cultivators have sensitive perceptions. Not to mention 30 pills, even with just 5 or 10 pills, if the pill toxins are not expelled in time, we would be able to sense them during cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning blinked.</p><p></p><p>He had already continuously taken 10 pills, one per day, yet he hadn't felt any presence of pill toxins.</p><p></p><p>Was it because of his Tiger Wood Spirit Body? Or the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art?</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning brushed off this thought and didn't dwell on it further.</p><p></p><p>At least from the current situation, taking pills at this frequency didn't seem to have any effect on him.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, it shouldn't be a problem to continue taking them more frequently for a while.</p><p></p><p>At most, if he sensed any pill toxins, he could just stop taking the pills first, then expel the toxins.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning said to Gu Xiaoxing, "Senior Sister Gu, I'll pay attention. I'll buy some first and control the dosage myself."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning say this, Gu Xiaoxing naturally didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>She took out three vials of Qi Gathering Pills and handed them to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Then she took out another jade vial, poured out two pills from it, and smiled, "I won't give Junior Brother Chu a discount on the price. Let me gift you two extra pills. When your spirit fruits are ripe, don't forget to give me a price concession."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Sister," Chu Ning replied as he took out 300 spirit stones and handed them to her, then accepted the Qi Gathering Pills.</p><p></p><p>With these pills, he could focus on cultivating and improving his progress for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Bringing Ling Xiaobai back to the courtyard he was staying in, Chu Ning went straight to the back garden.</p><p></p><p>The iron orchids had grown half a foot taller than when he had first planted them.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Chu Ning performing the Green Wood Spring Florescence Art every day, Ling Xiaobai had also made an indispensable contribution.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because Ling Xiaobai had persisted in "irrigating" them every day that the iron orchids had grown so well.</p><p></p><p>What made Chu Ning even happier was that all 50 iron orchids had bloomed.</p><p></p><p>And these iron orchids would definitely bear fruit once they flowered.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't think this was due to his Green Wood Spring Florescence Art, it could only be Ling Xiaobai's ability.</p><p></p><p>"This little guy sure has quite a few abilities," Chu Ning praised Ling Xiaobai, then cast the Green Wood Spring Florescence Art on the iron orchids a full thirty times.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese novel excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>After the surgery.</p><p></p><p>The person was cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique on the side. </p><p></p><p>Recently, among Chu Ning's three cultivations of refining qi, body, and mind, the speed of body refining was the most moderate.</p><p></p><p>As for refining qi, needless to say, he had the Qi Condensing Pills and spirit stones.  </p><p></p><p>In terms of mind refining, the daily talisman drawing consumption, coupled with the black wooden sword, allowed Chu Ning's spiritual sense to not only recover quickly, but also grow rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The mind refining technique was basically improving at a rate of 2 to 3 proficiency points per day.</p><p></p><p>Only body refining lacked too many enhancements, so he could only grind away bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was not in a hurry either. His current Imperishable Bones proficiency was nearly 200.  </p><p></p><p>If his previous conjecture was correct, when Imperishable Bones reached 300, he would encounter a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he would use the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit to break through the bottleneck in one go.</p><p></p><p>Although this Imperishable Bones breakthrough might be slower than breaking through to the late Qi Refining stage, it should not be too much slower.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique for half a period, when the Green Wood Spring Blossoming Art began to take better effect on the iron-stemmed orchids,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning leapt up and landed in the very center of the circle of iron-stemmed orchids.  </p><p></p><p>He then began cultivating the Green Wood Everspring Technique.</p><p></p><p>After half a period, the spiritual qi absorbed by the iron-stemmed orchids was completely transferred and absorbed into Chu Ning's body.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not stop cultivating immediately. He took out the Qi Condensing Pills he had bought from Gu Xiaoqing,</p><p></p><p>and directly threw one into his mouth, then continued to circulate the Green Wood Everspring Technique.</p><p></p><p>It was not until he had completely refined the entire Qi Condensing Pill that Chu Ning stopped cultivating, and then began drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>After completing that day's various talisman drawings, Chu Ning's spiritual sense was also greatly depleted.</p><p></p><p>So, Chu Ning took out the black wooden sword and placed it on his feet, then began cultivating the Mind Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>For the period after that, Chu Ning lived an extremely regimented life.</p><p></p><p>If it was a market day, he would guard the shop for half a day in the morning, selling talismans and drawing talismans when he had time.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon and evening, he would calmly cultivate.</p><p></p><p>On non-market days, Chu Ning would go to the spirit fields to tend to the crops in the morning.</p><p></p><p>Then he would find a deserted place to cultivate the Azure Wood Sword Art. As he continuously cultivated this technique, its proficiency grew higher and higher.</p><p></p><p>It was estimated that it would not take too long for him to reach the instantaneous realm.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon and evening, he would similarly calmly cultivate the techniques and refine his body and mind.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, two months passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>In the middle, Chu Ning ran out of Qi Condensing Pills once, so he used the Illusory Form technique to change his appearance and bought another 30 pills from Gu Xiaoqing.</p><p></p><p>When he finished taking the last Qi Condensing Pill and completed the subsequent cultivation,</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Everspring Technique (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (899/900)]  </p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 251/600]</p><p>[Mind Refining Technique, First Layer 341/1000]</p><p></p><p>Casually scanning the progress of his cultivation in his mind, a look of delight immediately appeared on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>In the past two months, Chu Ning had devoted all his efforts to improving the Green Wood Everspring Technique, aided by Qi Condensing Pills, spirit stones, and the Green Wood Spring Blossoming Art.</p><p></p><p>He had even purchased cultivated spirit chickens, spirit rabbits, and other edible spirit creatures from some cultivator families, to be eaten together with spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Until today, the proficiency of the second layer of the Green Wood Everspring Technique had finally reached this critical point of 899.</p><p></p><p>And according to his previous conjecture, as long as he broke through this 900 proficiency threshold, he would be able to directly break through to the late Qi Refining stage!</p><p></p><p>He was out of Qi Condensing Pills and had no intention of buying more. Instead, he took out a pile of spirit stones, preparing to break through to the late Qi Refining stage in one go.</p><p></p><p>According to his previous experience, to increase the sixth layer of the Green Wood Everspring Technique by 1 proficiency point required 3 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But once he broke through this limit, it would no longer be the case.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not continue cultivating the Green Wood Everspring Technique right away, but first cultivated the Mind Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>After adjusting his spiritual sense to its optimal state, he gripped the spirit stones in his hand and began cultivating the Green Wood Everspring Technique.</p><p></p><p>He consumed one spirit stone after another.</p><p></p><p>When he had absorbed three spirit stones, Chu Ning felt that the sixth qi circulation ring in his dantian had become saturated.</p><p></p><p>Without the slightest pause, he continued to exert the effects of his Wood Spiritual Body, picking up more spirit stones to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual qi entered Chu Ning's body, into his dantian to be transformed into true qi, and then floated outside the sixth qi circulation ring.  </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately followed the incantation of the Green Wood Everspring Technique, integrating this scattered true qi and forcibly drawing it towards the sixth qi circulation ring.</p><p></p><p>As more and more true qi accumulated, a faint, larger qi circulation ring gradually formed above the sixth one.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning continued absorbing the spiritual qi from the spirit stones, consuming one stone after another.</p><p></p><p>After the tenth spirit stone by Chu Ning's side had turned to powder, Chu Ning finally slowly opened his eyes.  </p><p></p><p>A flash of brilliant light shone in his eyes, then returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Seventh Layer of Qi Refining!"</p><p></p><p>He murmured softly, a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>Two years after joining the sect, he had broken through to the late Qi Refining stage!</p><p></p><p>When he had just joined Qingxi Sect, this was something Chu Ning had never even imagined.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately looked at the proficiency prompts in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Everspring Technique (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Third Layer (1/2100)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, First Scroll, Imperishable Bones 251/600]  </p><p>[Mind Refining Technique, First Layer 341/1000]</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Green Wood Everspring Technique had entered the third layer.</p><p></p><p>Then, as Chu Ning's gaze continued downwards, his expression became exceptionally delighted.</p><p></p><p>[Talent Refreshed, Awarded Talent "Talisman Spiritual Body":</p><p></p><p>1. Talisman Technique: Can transform your own instantaneous techniques into talisman techniques for talisman drawing (requires corresponding spiritual body attribute)</p><p></p><p>2. Talisman Spell: Can transform the talismans you draw into talisman spells stored in your talisman ring for instantaneous use (talisman quantity has a limit)]</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning carefully read the description of the Talisman Spiritual Body, and at this moment, he only had one feeling - it was too powerful!</p><p></p><p>The first aspect of the Talisman Spiritual Body was easy to understand. Chu Ning possessed the Wood Spiritual Body attribute, which meant he could transform the wood-type techniques he had learned into corresponding talisman techniques.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Green Wood Spring Blossoming Art, the Azure Wood Sword Art...</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, after four months of cultivation, Chu Ning had cultivated the upper-grade beginning Azure Wood Sword Art to the instantaneous realm, turning it into an innate spell.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of Talisman Technique was that these techniques he could use instantaneously could be transformed into talisman techniques, allowing Chu Ning to directly draw these techniques onto talisman papers through talisman drawing.</p><p></p><p>This innate ability alone was already immensely powerful.</p><p></p><p>But the second aspect that followed left Chu Ning even more delighted.</p><p></p><p>It must be known that even talismans required channeling spiritual power to activate.</p><p></p><p>And they also needed to be taken out from one's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Yet in a life-or-death battle against others, victory was often decided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>If the description of Talisman Spell was accurate, it meant that the talismans he had previously drawn like the Glacial Talisman, Earth Escape Talisman, and so on, could all be directly transformed into talisman spells.</p><p></p><p>It was equivalent to turning the Glacial Technique, Earth Escape Technique, and others into his instantaneous spells.</p><p></p><p>Although it mentioned that the number of talisman spells was limited, it was still enough to greatly excite Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning could not hold back his eagerness to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>He leapt up, first going to the table to pick up a talisman brush and lay out talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to try out the wonders of this Talisman Technique first.</p><p></p><p>As the brush touched the paper, with a thought, the next moment Chu Ning's talisman brush began moving across the paper.</p><p></p><p>He was attempting the Azure Wood Sword Art!</p><p></p><p>Although he had never seen the talisman for the Azure Wood Sword Art before, and didn't even know if such a sword talisman existed in the cultivation world,</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, Chu Ning was able to do it intuitively without a teacher.</p><p></p><p>The insights about the Azure Wood Sword Art in his mind automatically transformed into talisman patterns, and in just a short while, the patterns on the paper were fully drawn.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning lifted his brush, a azure flash of light flickered, and immediately a talisman appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Upper-grade beginning talisman! Azure Wood Sword Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this high-quality talisman before him, Chu Ning could not help but be amazed by the wonders of the Talisman Technique.</p><p></p><p>He immediately wanted to give the marvelous Talisman Spell a try.</p><p></p><p>However, experimenting with various techniques in this courtyard was obviously inappropriate.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's figure flashed, and bringing along Spirit Pet White, he flew directly out of the market town to a small hill northeast of the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>This was the very place where he had been cultivating the Azure Wood Sword Art before.</p><p></p><p>When the Talisman Spiritual Body talent refreshed, Chu Ning naturally understood how to use Talisman Spells.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the next moment Chu Ning felt five small talisman-like light spots appear in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"These might represent being able to transform five talisman spells?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, Chu Ning casually took out a few talismans from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Binding Beast Talisman, Yin Lightning Talisman, Earth Escape Talisman, Martial Metal Sword Talisman, Adamantine Talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Integrate!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning first took the Binding Beast Talisman and brought it close to one of the light spots. The next moment, the talisman patterns on the Binding Beast Talisman flashed with white light.</p><p></p><p>Those true qi talisman patterns actually flew up directly from the talisman paper and drilled into one of the light spots in Chu Ning's palm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, that talisman paper also turned directly to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"So it has integrated just like that?"</p><p></p><p>Looking in surprise at the white talisman light spot flashing in his palm, Chu Ning turned his gaze to Spirit Pet White with interest.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's not-so-innocent look, the little creature immediately sensed something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid, White. I'm just going to try out the technique."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning waved his hand, and a white light shot out, enveloping Spirit Pet White.</p><p></p><p>It was the binding force formed by the Binding Beast Talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly bound by the Binding Beast Talisman, Spirit Pet White let out an aggrieved sound.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed to understand what Chu Ning had just said, so it did not resist for now.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then immediately made a hand seal, releasing the Binding Beast Talisman's binding.</p><p></p><p>He laughed heartily, not pausing before trying to integrate the other few talismans.</p><p></p><p>Picking up the Martial Metal Sword Talisman, Chu Ning brought it close to his palm.</p><p></p><p>A golden flash, and the talisman patterns drilled into the second light spot on his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Metal-type talismans work too!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He did not have a metal spiritual root, so when he had learned the Martial Metal Sword Art before, he had made zero progress.</p><p></p><p>Now trying it with the Martial Metal Sword Talisman, he unexpectedly succeeded on the first try.</p><p></p><p>But thinking it over, Chu Ning understood.</p><p></p><p>Although this talisman had transformed into a talisman spell, activating this spell was actually the same as activating a talisman.</p><p></p><p>Just as he could draw and use the Martial Metal Sword Talisman by guiding the metal spiritual qi of heaven and earth with the talisman patterns,</p><p></p><p>So whether he had a metal spiritual root or not was irrelevant.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Chu Ning then tried integrating the Yin Lightning Talisman and Earth Escape Talisman as well.</p><p></p><p>They were all successfully integrated into talisman spells without exception.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning picked up the Adamantine Talisman, he paused, putting this talisman down.</p><p></p><p>He then casually took out the upper-grade beginning Radiant Ice Shield Talisman from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This talisman was a gift from Liao Yunming at the Spirit Talisman Pavilion previously. It was actually an upper-grade beginning defensive talisman recorded in the Spirit Talisman Codex that Chu Ning had never used.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning brought this talisman close to the talisman light spots in his palm, it did not react at all.</p><p></p><p>"It really only works for talismans I drew myself."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head, recalling the previous description about Talisman Spells.</p><p></p><p>He put away the Radiant Ice Shield Talisman, and picked up the Adamantine Talisman again to bring it close.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the next moment, this talisman flashed and integrated into his talisman ring.</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning tried to bring another talisman close to the first talisman light spot again, he was unable to succeed.</p><p></p><p>"Cooldown period?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought of a possibility, and did not rush. Instead, he tried again every so often.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, another Binding Beast Talisman finally integrated into the talisman ring in his palm.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Chu Ning's palm lit up with a ring of talisman lights in different colors.</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Chu Ning, the next moment this ring of light disappeared from view.</p><p></p><p>When he raised his hand to look again, there was no visible difference.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning could still clearly sense that with just a thought, the five talisman spells in his hand could be activated at any time.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

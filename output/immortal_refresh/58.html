        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The disciples lined up one by one and came in front of the supervising disciple with the Liu surname, then each took out 12 spirit stones and gave them to him. </p><p></p><p>This supervising disciple named Liu had clearly prepared in advance, continuously taking out talisman pens, talisman ink, and talisman paper from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the line, Chu Ning vaguely heard faint voices coming from behind him.</p><p></p><p>"These talisman pens and ink seem to be of very ordinary quality. I remember the sect sells this level for cheap. The talisman pens only cost 8 spirit stones, and the ink and paper only 1 spirit stone each."</p><p></p><p>"Liu Shixiong worked so hard to exchange these for us from the sect. Making a 1 spirit stone profit is normal. If we went to buy them at the market, it would definitely cost 10 spirit stones. Moreover, going to the market would just waste time since we only have 5 days."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this conversation, Chu Ning remained silent. </p><p></p><p>He inexplicably thought of Zhuang Yunde and suddenly felt that plump senior brother wasn't too bad. At least if Zhuang Yunde wanted to gain something from him, he would first help Chu Ning obtain some benefits.</p><p></p><p>Although he thought this in his heart, when it was actually time for Chu Ning to take out spirit stones, he did so crisply and cleanly. </p><p></p><p>Taking the talisman pen, ink and paper from the other party's hands, Chu Ning turned and left the practice ground. </p><p></p><p>Even though he had many talisman papers in his own storage bag, he couldn't be bothered to explain at this moment.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his gaze unintentionally glanced at the other few who were also being promoted along with him.</p><p></p><p>Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang had naturally already left early. Chu Ning saw that Lu Ming and Chen Jinhua had also walked to the back of the line.</p><p></p><p>Only Jiang Dawei still had a conflicted look on his face at the moment. </p><p></p><p>But in the end, right when Chu Ning was leaving, he also stood up and joined the back of the line.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that for the vast majority of disciples, although it cost 12 spirit stones to give it a try, the price was a bit high.</p><p></p><p>But no one could resist this temptation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't look any further and quickly returned to his residence from the practice ground.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Plant House hadn't said how they would arrange his fields and residence yet, so Chu Ning temporarily didn't think about that matter.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned to his residence, Chu Ning went to his room and took out the talisman pen, ink and paper from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Then, he carefully looked at the paper recording the talisman inscribing method for wood escape talismans.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Chu Ning had completely memorized the inscribing method.</p><p></p><p>He was about to start writing, but after thinking it over, Chu Ning didn't rush into it. Instead, he closed his eyes and began cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>Inscribing talismans was a meticulous task that required a calm and focused mind during the whole process.</p><p></p><p>And to discuss calmness and focus, the Spirit Refining Technique was undoubtedly extremely effective.</p><p></p><p>After another two hours passed like this, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes, his gaze slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the effects of cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique today didn't seem as good as when he usually practiced it morning and night.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's because I was too preoccupied with inscribing talismans today." Chu Ning didn't think much of it at the moment.</p><p></p><p>His gaze returned to the various items on the table, and he reviewed all the details of inscribing talismans in his mind once more.</p><p></p><p>Ensuring he had completely memorized all the spirit talisman inscriptions.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Chu Ning lay out a talisman paper on the table and open the talisman ink.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a scent mixed with spiritual energy and a faint bloody smell assailed his nostrils.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had long heard that this talisman ink was basically made by mixing in some demonic beast blood, so he wasn't surprised at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the talisman pen, dipped it in the ink, infused it with spiritual energy, and in the next instant, the pen tip landed on the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy flowed through the spirit pen, enveloping the ink as it traced the inscriptions on the paper.</p><p></p><p>However, just as Chu Ning had barely started writing for a short while, the spiritual energy at the pen tip suddenly fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the talisman paper directly ignited and turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Announcing Chu Ning's failure on his first attempt at inscribing a talisman.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning put down the spirit pen, closed his eyes briefly, and recalled what had just happened, gaining some insights in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just now...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>His control over spiritual power was not very stable during the talisman making process, and a slight fluctuation led to the failure of talisman inscription. </p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not get discouraged. He had a spiritual body of talisman origin, so his talent was absolutely much stronger than ordinary people's.</p><p></p><p>His moment of insight just now, wasn't it also related to the talent of his spiritual body of talisman origin?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning took a deep breath and spread a new talisman paper on the table. He picked up the spiritual pen and dipped it in ink.</p><p></p><p>The pen touched the talisman paper again, and Chu Ning focused his spiritual power, guiding the pen tip to trace the talisman patterns once more. </p><p></p><p>The pen tip moved smoothly across the talisman paper.  </p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning finished the last stroke, a complete set of talisman patterns appeared on the paper.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning felt a little pleased and immediately picked up the pen again without pausing.</p><p></p><p>"......"</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the talisman paper covered in patterns burst into flames again and turned into ashes.</p><p></p><p>"I got a bit excited at the last moment and lost control."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head slightly, having understood the reason.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't ponder further. He quickly laid out a new talisman paper, channeled his spiritual power into the pen, dipped it in ink, and drew in one smooth motion.</p><p></p><p>With the experience from the previous two attempts, Chu Ning became more familiar with the talisman patterns.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power guided the pen tip like a spiritual snake slithering across the paper. At this moment, all of Chu Ning's mind was immersed in it without any distracting thoughts.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt as if the patterns were engraved in his mind - his hand movements were as natural as flowing clouds and water!</p><p></p><p>In even less time than before, a complete set of patterns emerged on the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's mind was calm like an ancient well. Without much pause, he lifted his pen smoothly.</p><p></p><p>At that very moment, the patterns on the paper lit up with a faint azure glow.</p><p></p><p>The azure light flashed and faded, disappearing into the talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, a talisman imbued with spiritual ripples appeared on the table in front of Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"I finally succeeded - this is the Wood Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the talisman with a smile on his face, his eyes shining brightly.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not tested its effects yet, based on his previous experience using talismans, the faint ripple of spiritual power represented the high quality of this talisman.</p><p></p><p>A top-grade Wood Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Just on the third attempt, he had successfully created a top-grade Wood Talisman!</p><p></p><p>"The talent of my spiritual body of talisman origin is indeed miraculous!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning silently muttered to himself. He casually picked up the Wood Talisman, preparing to test its effects.</p><p></p><p>But then he thought against testing it indoors. </p><p></p><p>Carrying the Wood Talisman, he went to the spiritual field where he had planted the Spirit Ink Bamboos before. Standing at one end of the field, he channeled his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Activate!</p><p></p><p>The Wood Talisman was successfully activated. In the next moment, Chu Ning's body was enveloped in a faint azure glow.</p><p></p><p>His figure flashed, and he appeared ten zhang (about 30 meters) away.</p><p></p><p>"I have mastered the creation of this Wood Talisman. Next, I'll see what the success rate is."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning chuckled and left the spiritual field, returning to his residence.</p><p></p><p>He took out the talisman pen, paper, ink and other materials from his storage bag and began his great talisman inscribing endeavor.</p><p></p><p>Half a period of time later, Chu Ning's face showed a hint of fatigue and excitement as he finally stopped inscribing talismans.</p><p></p><p>On the table in front of him lay a small stack of top-grade Wood Talismans.</p><p></p><p>Please keep reading, especially on Mondays and Tuesdays.

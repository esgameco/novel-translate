        <h1>Chapter 27</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After receiving these two jade slips, having finished all of today's tasks, Chu Ning immediately returned to his room and began examining them. </p><p></p><p>These jade slips were commonly used by cultivation sects to store various written records.</p><p></p><p>Generally, the original texts were kept by the sect, but if a disciple needed to take relevant books with them, they would be engraved on jade slips.  </p><p></p><p>Of course, these jade slips were naturally also registered within the sect, so Zhuang Yunde had specifically reminded Chu Ning not to lose them.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning initially wanted to understand the information about the Seven Star Spirit Fruit, after seeing that the jade slip recording the body refining techniques contained less content, Chu Ning chose to read that part first.</p><p></p><p>After reading for a while, Chu Ning's expression became somewhat complicated. </p><p></p><p>Not only did this jade slip contain detailed introductions to the way of body refining, it even had detailed explanations of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>The rise and fall of the body refining way was just as Zhuang Yunde had lectured yesterday. </p><p></p><p>And this Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique was indeed known as the greatest body refining technique of all time.</p><p></p><p>According to the contents of the jade slip, the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique consisted of three volumes, each further divided into different sections.</p><p></p><p>The five sections of the first volume were precisely the Undying Skin, Imperishable Bones, Unbroken Tendons, Undying Soul, and Deathless Golden Body that Chu Ning had seen before.</p><p></p><p>And according to ancient texts, each section of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique possessed a kind of innate divine ability secret technique.  </p><p></p><p>For example, upon fully cultivating the Undying Skin, one could very easily cultivate a divine ability secret technique called the "Heavenly Bagu Fist" and transform it into one's own innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The reason Chu Ning's expression was complicated was because although the copy of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique he had contained the cultivation methods for the five sections of the first volume, none of the sections mentioned these divine ability secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"It seems these divine ability secret techniques were likely lost during the process of transmission."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed, feeling some regret.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if there will be an opportunity to find these divine ability secret techniques again."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head and continued reading.</p><p></p><p>What piqued Chu Ning's interest was that the jade slip then went on to introduce comparisons between several realms and the current cultivator realms.</p><p></p><p>Upon refining the Undying Skin, one could use one's body to withstand ordinary spells from cultivators at the peak of the Core Formation stage and below when circulating qi.</p><p></p><p>And if one could cultivate to the Deathless Golden Body and circulate spiritual power, one could even withstand spells from cultivators in the late Core Formation stage.</p><p></p><p>However, cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique progressed much slower than cultivating normal techniques.  </p><p></p><p>To reach the Deathless Golden Body level would require twice as much time, or even more, than reaching the late Core Formation stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were great bottlenecks between each level.  </p><p></p><p>Unless one could obtain heavenly materials and earthly treasures for a powerful physical body, it would be difficult to break through.</p><p></p><p>In ancient times, there were many heavenly materials and earthly treasures in the world, and since there was no pill refinement technique, it was easier to find them.</p><p></p><p>But now, as more and more cultivators appeared, powerful physical body heavenly materials and earthly treasures were often excellent medicinal ingredients for refining high-grade pills, so they were not easy to find.</p><p></p><p>After all, when combined with other ingredients to refine pills, these materials could provide greater benefits to cultivators who practiced qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even if someone obtained them, they would be reluctant to directly consume them.</p><p></p><p>So gradually, fewer and fewer people cultivated the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip also recorded some heavenly materials and earthly treasures from ancient times that were useful for breaking through bottlenecks in the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.  </p><p></p><p>To Chu Ning's great surprise, one of them was something he was familiar with.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Spirit Fruit!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the effects of this Seven Star Spirit Fruit were indeed not bad. </p><p></p><p>According to the introduction in the jade slip, even for breaking through realms like the Indestructible Muscles and Undying Soul, the Seven Star Spirit Fruit had a certain effect.</p><p></p><p>After reading through the entire jade slip, Chu Ning's mood was undoubtedly extremely complex.</p><p></p><p>First, he did not expect that this Nine Evolution Body Refining Method actually contained divine abilities and secret arts. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, from the introduction in this jade slip, cultivating this body refining method seemed so difficult.</p><p></p><p>Just cultivating the first volume on the Immortal Skin alone was comparable to the peak of the middle stage of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>However, his cultivation of the Evergreen Vitality Art had the assistance of the Spiritual Wood Body and the Evergreen Vitality Art's blessings, but this Nine Evolution Body Refining Method currently did not seem to have any such assistance discovered.</p><p></p><p>The second thing Chu Ning did not expect was that the Seven Star Spirit Fruit was actually an excellent item for strengthening the physical body.</p><p></p><p>It was even effective for breaking through bottlenecks in the Nine Evolution Body Refining Method.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning subconsciously guessed, could it be that the man with sideburns also knew something?</p><p></p><p>Could he also want to cultivate this Nine Evolution Body Refining Method and know the effects of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit?</p><p></p><p>And then because he knew that Chu Ning went to help Old Man Sun cultivate the Seven Star Spirit Fruit, he set his sights on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Chu Ning to obtain this Nine Evolution Body Refining Method and the seeds of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit by chance.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Chu Ning stopped thinking about this issue.</p><p></p><p>For him, what the other party's motives were initially was no longer important. What mattered was that these two things were now in his possession.</p><p></p><p>Although the remnant volume of the Nine Evolution Body Refining Method he obtained only had the first volume and did not contain the divine abilities and secret arts,</p><p></p><p>But after realizing that the Nine Evolution Body Refining Method could produce proficiency prompts within his Golden Finger, Chu Ning did not give up on cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Chu Ning immersed his mind into another jade slip.</p><p></p><p>The content of this jade slip was much more than the previous one. Chu Ning spent over an hour reading it all.</p><p></p><p>And after reading it, a slight smile appeared on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>"Not only does this introduce various rare spirit medicines and spirit plants, it even has the cultivation methods for some of them. This is really a good thing."</p><p></p><p>What made Chu Ning even happier was that it actually had the cultivation method for the Seven Star Spirit Fruit!</p><p></p><p>The growth characteristics of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit were very special. For other spirit medicines, the longer they grew, the more spirit qi they absorbed and the better their effects.</p><p></p><p>However, this Seven Star Spirit Fruit had an extremely short overall growth cycle of only a few months.</p><p></p><p>During these few months, ensuring its survival while helping the spirit fruit absorb more spirit qi was the key to determining its final quality.</p><p></p><p>This book introduced one of the best cultivation methods for the Seven Star Spirit Fruit.</p><p></p><p>This method may still be difficult for people like Old Man Sun, but in Chu Ning's view, it was not that big of a problem.</p><p></p><p>Normal cultivation of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit required many harsh conditions and the cost would definitely not be small.</p><p></p><p>But for the people of the Qingxi Sect, there was a shortcut - the Evergreen Vernal Art.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could reach the level of instantaneous proficiency in the Evergreen Vernal Art,</p><p></p><p>Then after planting the Seven Star Spirit Fruit seedling, by continuously performing the Evergreen Vernal Art on it for a hundred days, it could survive normally.</p><p></p><p>After that, he could use the Evergreen Vernal Art to continuously raise its quality.</p><p></p><p>For Chu Ning now, the only thing he needed to do was to cultivate the Evergreen Vernal Art to the level of instantaneous proficiency.</p><p></p><p>And for Chu Ning, who had already achieved instantaneous proficiency in the Wood Element Catalysis Art and Purification Art,</p><p></p><p>He already vaguely felt that this step was not far away.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

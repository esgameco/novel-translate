        <h1>Chapter 85</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>It put Chu Ning at ease a little that nothing special happened that night. </p><p></p><p>After getting up in the morning, Chu Ning continued cultivating the Refining Divine Art, and also practiced the Qingmu Changchun Gong and Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>His overall state had fully recovered.</p><p></p><p>[Refining Divine Art, First Layer 145/1000]</p><p></p><p>Glancing at his progress in the Refining Divine Art, Chu Ning's eyes flickered slightly. </p><p></p><p>Yesterday, with his frantic talisman drawing and spirit sense cultivation, the proficiency of his Refining Divine Art had actually increased by a full 4 points in one day.</p><p></p><p>Normally, it only increased by 2 points.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning also felt some fatigue from the high-intensity use and recovery of his spirit sense.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this method was not sustainable.</p><p></p><p>He could appropriately reduce the intensity a bit, which shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>In the morning hours, Chu Ning opened the doors of his shop, and sure enough, cultivators who wanted to buy talismans but couldn't yesterday came.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took the opportunity to inquire around and learned that there was another beast calamity last night.</p><p></p><p>But this time, it wasn't just the Yangling Li Family that was attacked, some nearby cultivator clans were also assaulted.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, everyone was more prepared this time, so before dawn, the major cultivator clans had driven the beasts back.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the losses suffered by the other clans were clearly not as severe as the Yangling Li Family's.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning also learned that indeed many wandering cultivators had appeared near Yangling.</p><p></p><p>He even sold some more talismans to a few passing wanderers in the morning.</p><p></p><p>After selling off most of his talismans, Chu Ning closed his doors again to draw more.</p><p></p><p>In fact, he didn't reopen his shop that entire afternoon.</p><p></p><p>Over the rest of the day and half the night, Chu Ning drew many more low-grade and mid-grade elementary talismans.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until the morning of the third day that he reopened his shop doors to resume selling talismans.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the previous day, there was a big change in who came to buy talismans.</p><p></p><p>The day before, it was mostly people from the major cultivator clans.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't buy any on the market day, so when they learned Chu Ning would restock, they came even on non-market days.</p><p></p><p>But today it was mainly wandering cultivators from out of town, so the sales volume naturally wasn't as high as the previous two days.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't mind, and even took the time to draw some more low-grade elementary talismans.</p><p></p><p>After all, it would be the market day again tomorrow, and he didn't know if the other few talisman shops of Qingxi Sect would reopen.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was prepared to operate normally at least.</p><p></p><p>Rather than fighting and risking his life out there, it was better to sell talismans peacefully at the market.</p><p></p><p>It was the third day and market day, but the Qingxi Sect disciples still hadn't returned.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning chose to open normally, though there were clearly far fewer people at the market today compared to usual.</p><p></p><p>However, with Chu Ning's shop consistently offering high-quality mid-grade elementary talismans over the past few days, his talisman shop had quickly gained a reputation in the area.</p><p></p><p>So there was still a trickle of people coming to buy talismans.</p><p></p><p>Around noon, seeing no more customers, Chu Ning prepared to put away the talismans on the counter.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, over a dozen figures walked over from down the street.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked and realized they were from his own sect.</p><p></p><p>Leading them was Gu Xiaoqing, with a tall, sturdy cultivator beside her, followed by Shen Zhengquan, Luo Yiping, Lu Miaoying and others.</p><p></p><p>There were also more than ten others wearing Qingxi Sect robes, likely disciples sent as reinforcements.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Du Han was not among them.</p><p></p><p>When they saw Chu Ning holding talismans, the group naturally noticed him too.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning!" Luo Yiping shouted first.</p><p></p><p>He then rushed over, pointing at the talismans in Chu Ning's hand while gritting his teeth:</p><p></p><p>"You have so many talismans, yet a few days ago you told us you had none left?  </p><p></p><p>Do you know how difficult our situation was? If we had some talismans, we absolutely wouldn't be in such a sorry state now."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Luo Yiping's words, Chu Ning looked at them all in puzzlement.  </p><p></p><p>With their late Qi Condensation realm cultivations, plus Du Han who was almost at the Qi Condensation Perfection realm.</p><p></p><p>And looking at the group of reinforcements behind them, the sect had clearly sent aid.</p><p></p><p>Yet they were in a "sorry state" dealing with just some low-grade demonic beasts?</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning's gaze fell on the others...</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan also had an angry look, his robe tattered with four or five holes.  </p><p></p><p>Even Gu Xiaoqing's hair was slightly disheveled, and she frowned slightly at Chu Ning now.</p><p></p><p>"What, nothing to say?" </p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping glared angrily at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Though unaware of their predicament, Chu Ning naturally wouldn't admit fault with Luo venting at him in front of so many sect disciples.</p><p></p><p>He calmly met Luo's gaze. "These talismans are ones I drew myself."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Luo Yiping immediately scoffed.  </p><p></p><p>"You really think we're fools?</p><p>You sold so many high-quality talismans at this shop the other day, and it seems you haven't stopped selling either these past days. Could these really be ones you made?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan's voice rang out then too.  </p><p>"Junior Brother Luo, enough, let's just tell Executor Lin and Senior Brother Du about this when they return."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing hesitated slightly, then sighed lightly, her beautiful eyes turning to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, I used up all my healing pills during this trip. Could you perhaps draw me some Recovery Talismans?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning looked gratefully at Gu Xiaoqing.</p><p>"Senior Sister Gu, please wait a moment, I'll draw some Recovery Talismans right now."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning took out talisman paper and a brush from his storage pouch.  </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan didn't say anything more, only glaring coldly at Chu Ning as if watching his downfall.</p><p></p><p>The more than ten Qingxi disciples behind them looked on curiously, unaware of what was happening.  </p><p></p><p>One of them soon started asking Lu Miaoying about it.</p><p></p><p>Lu Miaoying glanced at Chu Ning and the others, hesitating briefly before explaining the situation in full.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the tall, sturdy male disciple who had been standing beside Gu Xiaoqing spoke up:</p><p></p><p>"If it's proven these talismans really were just drawn by Junior Brother Chu, then it's no issue. But if he was hiding them before...</p><p>Hmph, I, Ding Bo, detest those with no sect loyalty the most."</p><p></p><p>The other disciples didn't directly respond, but they all nodded in agreement with Ding Bo's view.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Chu Ning, having taken out his talisman drawing tools, didn't waste any more words.  </p><p></p><p>He adjusted his breathing slightly, placed a blank talisman paper in front of him, and swiftly began drawing a Recovery Talisman with his brush.</p><p></p><p>For Chu Ning, creating this low-grade elementary talisman wasn't difficult at all.</p><p></p><p>Even without much preparation and being watched by everyone, Chu Ning still...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>With flowing movements like drifting clouds and flowing water, Chu Ning completed the creation of an entire talisman paper in one go. </p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan watched this and were slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>However, since Chu Ning had only drawn one talisman at this point, the two of them did not show much expression and continued to observe coldly from the side.</p><p></p><p>Without any pause, Chu Ning put down this rejuvenation talisman and picked up another talisman paper.  </p><p></p><p>With the same posture, same speed, same composure, just like replicating the creation of the previous talisman, Chu Ning easily completed another rejuvenation talisman.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning effortlessly completed two talismans in a row, the onlookers' gazes finally changed.</p><p></p><p>The disciples who had previously looked at Chu Ning with some doubt now had softened expressions.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Xiaoqing's gaze held a hint of warmth.</p><p></p><p>The looks and expressions on Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan's faces also changed.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, outsiders watch for entertainment while insiders watch for the essence.</p><p></p><p>Although they were outer sect disciples who had never studied talisman drawing, Chu Ning's state while creating the talismans showed that he at least had a certain level of talisman drawing skills.</p><p></p><p>Especially when Chu Ning drew ten talismans in one go and successfully created seven of them, the onlookers' expressions showed even more astonishment.</p><p></p><p>They knew that such a high success rate was undoubtedly outstanding, even for them.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning put down his brush and took three talisman papers from beside him, handing them over to Gu Xiaoqing, Shen Zhengquan, and Luo Yiping.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Chu Ning wanted the three of them to examine the quality of the talismans, and they understood, so they accepted them.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the talismans were in their hands, Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The quality of these talismans was very high!</p><p></p><p>And Chu Ning had drawn them right in front of everyone, which proved the point.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing's face regained its previous warm expression, and she said slowly, "I didn't expect Junior Brother Chu's talisman drawing skills to be so superb. Otherwise, before setting out, we should have asked Junior Brother to draw some talismans to bring along."</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning could respond, a voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, so many people?"</p><p></p><p>Accompanying the voice, a young cultivator quickly walked over from behind the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning glanced at him and vaguely recalled that this seemed to be the cultivator who had bought talismans yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the young cultivator spoke urgently, "Shopkeeper, are all these people buying talismans? Do you still have the yin-thunder talismans and diamond-body talismans I bought yesterday? Let me buy five more of each."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Chu Ning didn't think too much about it.</p><p></p><p>He casually took out ten talisman papers from his storage bag and handed them to the young man.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the others didn't seem to want these talismans, the young man's face lit up with joy as he accepted them. He then took out spirit stones and handed them over.</p><p></p><p>"Thanks to coming early, many thanks to the fellow Daoists for your courtesy."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the young man hurriedly left with the talismans.</p><p></p><p>Once the young man left, Luo Yiping, who had previously been silent, sneered coldly again.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, don't tell me these high-quality primary mid-grade talismans were also drawn by you."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu's talisman drawing skills really surprise me," Shen Zhengquan added a sentence.</p><p></p><p>His tone sounded like praise, but the sarcasm it contained was something Chu Ning could easily detect.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had maintained appearances, but now he was shamelessly mocking Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing sighed lightly, but this time, she didn't say anything else.</p><p></p><p>Even Gu Xiaoqing didn't believe that Chu Ning could create such high-quality primary mid-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>In fact, apart from Mu Ling, no one else in the sect had ever seen Chu Ning create primary mid-grade talismans before.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning also sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't drawn these primary mid-grade talismans in front of everyone today, who knows how long this matter would have dragged on.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother will draw a diamond-body talisman. Please, Senior Brothers and Sisters, offer your guidance."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Chu Ning picked up his brush again.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers vaguely guessed what Chu Ning was about to do and showed some surprise in their expressions.</p><p></p><p>A flicker of doubt crossed Luo Yiping's face, and he exchanged a glance with Shen Zhengquan.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the two of them shook their heads, their eyes revealing disbelief.</p><p></p><p>They had some contact with the disciples of the Lingfu Hall, so they naturally knew the difficulty of creating primary mid-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>How could Chu Ning, who had just entered the outer sect from being a menial disciple, have mastered the art of creating primary mid-grade talismans in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>Especially since the talismans that the person had just bought seemed to be of similarly high quality.</p><p></p><p>As everyone watched, Chu Ning had already begun drawing the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Although the onlookers didn't understand the different talisman drawing methods, just from the more complex spirit patterns Chu Ning was drawing, they could guess that this talisman was of a higher grade than the rejuvenation talismans he had drawn earlier.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was showing surprise, a "whoosh" sound came from the diamond-body talisman in front of Chu Ning as it spontaneously combusted into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the last bit of doubt on Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan's faces completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, don't keep putting on this act and wasting everyone's time. Don't tell me you actually think you're a second-grade Talisman Master?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping's face was full of derision.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shen Zhengquan didn't say anything either.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the focused Chu Ning, he seemed pensive.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing was the same - unlike Luo Yiping from the Beast Taming Pavilion who had no contact with the Dao of pills, talismans, artifacts, and formations, she and Shen Zhengquan could vaguely sense something from Chu Ning's state while drawing this diamond-body talisman.</p><p></p><p>Although the talisman failed, Chu Ning's focused state hinted at his true skills.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning didn't bother responding to Luo Yiping. He just shook his head slightly and muttered to himself, "The success rate for these primary mid-grade talismans still needs to improve. I was planning to directly succeed and show them the talismans, but I didn't expect to fail."</p><p></p><p>Even though Chu Ning had been continuously drawing talismans for the past seven days, his success rate for the most difficult diamond-body talisman was still not as high as the lower-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>He dipped his brush in ink again, preparing to draw another talisman.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all gathered here for?"</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by this voice, Lin Changqing descended on a spirit boat in front of Chu Ning's shop, with Du Han arriving alongside him.</p><p></p><p>"Executive Lin, you've come at the right time!" Luo Yiping's face lit up with delight when he saw Lin Changqing and Du Han.</p><p></p><p>Before Lin Changqing could speak again, Luo Yiping rapidly started talking like a string of beans being poured out, "When Senior Brother Du previously called everyone to go and fend off the beast calamity, Chu Ning refused to participate due to his low cultivation. That's fine.</p><p></p><p>"But the key issue is that he clearly brought many talismans from the Lingfu Hall at the sect, yet when Senior Brother Du asked him to take them out, he refused to do so."</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Coming out from the outer gate, Chu Ning went to bid farewell to Qiu Shunyi. </p><p></p><p>The two had entered the sect in the same batch, but their circumstances were now worlds apart.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning found Qiu Shunyi, he was still using the hand seals of the catalyzing technique to plant this season's crimson spirit rice. </p><p></p><p>Seeing that Qiu Shunyi still didn't know when he could even reach the instant catalysis stage of the technique, Chu Ning sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>He casually took 20 talisman papers and gave them to Qiu Shunyi, telling him to give 10 to Lv Xingyuan. Chu Ning also gave him a few spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He didn't give too much, naturally understanding the consequences of possessing too much.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi was naturally both surprised and envious that Chu Ning was about to leave the sect for the market towns.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Qiu Shunyi's spirit field, Chu Ning went straight back to his own courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As for the others, Chu Ning had no intention of going to see them.</p><p></p><p>Back in the courtyard, he couldn't wait to take out the silver crystal frost bamboo shield from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This defensive magic artifact was the first proper artifact he had obtained.</p><p></p><p>Holding the silver crystal frost bamboo shield in his hand, it was only palm-sized at the moment, with a faint silver surface.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the usage that He Changyou had mentioned earlier, Chu Ning circulated his magic power into it.</p><p></p><p>As the magic power entered, the shield immediately grew to half a person's size.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a protective light barrier appeared on the silver crystal frost bamboo shield, enveloping Chu Ning's entire body.</p><p></p><p>With just a glance, Chu Ning knew that this body protection light barrier was far stronger in defensive power than the body protection talismans he had used before.</p><p></p><p>"This can be considered the first life-saving magic artifact I've obtained."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning withdrew his magic power with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>The silver crystal frost bamboo shield immediately shrank back to palm-size, and Chu Ning put it back into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Since he was about to leave the sect, Chu Ning decided to improve his strength first.</p><p></p><p>He had ideas on the road earlier, and now he planned to first cultivate spirit techniques to adjust his mental state to its optimal condition.</p><p></p><p>Then he would proceed with subsequent cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's gaze inadvertently swept over the black wood sword in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression became contemplative.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then sat cross-legged and began cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated for over an hour this time.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then cultivated the Green Wood Evergreen Skill for a while as a transition.</p><p></p><p>After that, Chu Ning took out the black wood sword from the storage bag and once again began cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>No one knows how long had passed when Chu Ning opened his eyes, his face showing a look of sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>"The reason why my progress in the Spirit Refining Technique has been fast at times and slow at others has actually been because of this black wood sword."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning let out a wry laugh first, but then the bitter smile disappeared, replaced by delight.</p><p></p><p>Previously, especially after talisman making, Chu Ning had noticed that his progress in cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique would sometimes be fast and sometimes slow.</p><p></p><p>He had always thought it was due to the impact of using his spiritual sense for talisman making.</p><p></p><p>Just now, a flash of inspiration suddenly struck him.</p><p></p><p>He recalled that during this period, especially after his two neighbors moved out, he did not always place the black wood sword beside him when cultivating at night like he used to.</p><p></p><p>This led him to vaguely guess the reason, which he then verified, finding it to indeed be true.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable that Chu Ning did not think in this direction at first.</p><p></p><p>The first time he felt the accelerated cultivation of the Spirit Refining Technique was on the second morning after the two neighbors moved in next door.</p><p></p><p>That morning when he was cultivating, it also happened to be the day his spiritual sense liquefied.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning had always thought that the accelerated spiritual sense cultivation was due to the liquefaction of his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Recently, when making talismans, there were times when he did not take out the wood sword while cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique, and he felt the fast and slow sensations.</p><p></p><p>It was only at this moment that he found the real reason.</p><p></p><p>"What material is this black wood sword made of? It actually helps with spiritual sense cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Holding this large black wood sword in his hand, Chu Ning was both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>During this period of cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique, he had deeply experienced the difficulty of improving his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had unexpectedly discovered that he had always had a treasure by his side that could accelerate the cultivation of the Spirit Refining Technique. How could he not be amazed?</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning carefully searched through the knowledge of spirit plants he had mastered before, but unfortunately could not find the answer.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"There was still quite a bit about spirit plants that he hadn't finished reading in the jade slip that He Changyou had previously given him. He didn't know if there was any information about it there."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered silently in his heart, but for the time being had no intention of going to look.</p><p></p><p>As for this black wood sword and the cultivation of the Spirit Refining Technique, he planned to try it out later. </p><p></p><p>Previously, he had discovered that after using spirit sense to create talismans, cultivating this Spirit Refining Technique was very helpful for his spirit sense.</p><p></p><p>If he could do so on this foundation while also using this black wood sword, the speed would undoubtedly be even faster.</p><p></p><p>However, right now, he planned to seclude himself for a few days to try and break through to the sixth level of Qi Refining!</p><p></p><p>Although He Changyou and the others said there was no danger in going to the Yan Gathering Place, Chu Ning still wanted to be prepared just in case.</p><p></p><p>Apart from getting some life-saving items from everyone, the most crucial thing was undoubtedly his own cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>During this period of time, although Chu Ning had been making talismans and cultivating spells, he had never stopped cultivating the key martial arts and secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>His mind sank into his consciousness, and Chu Ning had a direct understanding of his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), Second Level (432/900)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Mantra, First Volume, Deathless Bones 167/600]  </p><p>[Spirit Refining Technique, First Level 133/1000]</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the proficiency of the second level of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill had reached 432.</p><p></p><p>Originally, when the proficiency broke through 200, he went from the fourth level of Qi Refining to the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had basically confirmed that as long as the proficiency increased by 300 and broke through the value of 500, he would be able to advance from the fifth level of Qi Refining to the sixth level.</p><p></p><p>What Chu Ning needed to do now was to cultivate with full effort.</p><p></p><p>Take advantage of these five days to increase the proficiency of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill by 68 points and break through to the sixth level!</p><p></p><p>With a proficiency gap of 68, normal cultivation naturally wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>Even though Chu Ning possessed the Green Wood Spring Aura Technique, the proficiency increase from one day's cultivation would only be 2 or 3 points.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning had another good thing - spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Over the past few months, Chu Ning had gradually sold talisman papers to Mu Ling and accumulated quite a few spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>And the expenses were not high.</p><p></p><p>Apart from initially asking Qiu Shunyi to buy a few talisman papers for him in the market to guard against Qi Chongmu, the rest of the spirit stones were only occasionally used for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So now, Chu Ning had more than 200 spirit stones in his possession.</p><p></p><p>Before this, Chu Ning had already tried it out.</p><p></p><p>After entering the fifth level of Qi Refining, it took nearly two low-grade spirit stones to increase the proficiency of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>If he were to cultivate solely using spirit stones, such an expense would absolutely be unbearable for ordinary servant disciples or even outer disciples.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still quite a few outer disciples whose spirit stone income was decent. The reason why no one used spirit stones to madly cultivate and increase their proficiency was due to two major obstacles.</p><p></p><p>The first was that each person's absorption of spirit stone spiritual energy was different.</p><p></p><p>The poorer the spiritual root and the lower the cultivation method, the slower the disciple absorbed spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Among the servant disciples in Area D, many people would indeed cultivate faster using spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>But it might not necessarily be much faster than directly meditating and cultivating.</p><p></p><p>After all, the speed of absorbing spiritual energy was what it was.</p><p></p><p>The other, more important issue was the bottleneck problem.</p><p></p><p>After entering the middle stage of Qi Refining, each level of advancement was a process of breaking through a bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>This bottleneck was not something that could definitely be broken through just by absorbing a certain amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The poorer the aptitude, the harder it was to break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>A typical example was Mu Ling. In terms of resources, she was absolutely better off than the vast majority of Qi Refining disciples in the sect.</p><p></p><p>But after reaching the sixth level of Qi Refining, it was not easy for her to break through further.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these two problems did not exist for Chu Ning, who had obtained the Tiger Wood Spirit Body.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the bed in his room, Chu Ning, having cultivated the Spirit Refining Technique, had adjusted his spirit sense and physical state to their optimal conditions.</p><p></p><p>He then took out a pile of spirit stones from his storage bag and placed them in front of himself, grabbing a few in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Green Wood Evergreen Skill, circulate!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

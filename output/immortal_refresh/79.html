        <h1>Chapter 79</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>This side, the crowd around Chu Ning was in an uproar. Such a big commotion naturally also drew the attention of several other nearby shops. </p><p></p><p>Some cultivators who heard something, also couldn't help but inquire about it from Luo Yiping, Gu Xiaoqing and others.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping disdained to say anything, if someone asked, he would just give a light "hmm" in response.  </p><p></p><p>However, Gu Xiaoqing patiently explained, "This Junior Brother Chu is a disciple of our Qingxi Sect's Baiyi Hall and Lingfu Pavilion, managing these two shops all by himself."</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect actually had a young disciple managing two halls simultaneously, one person in charge of two shops.</p><p></p><p>The crowd originally surrounding Chu Ning's shop, after receiving this information, went from disbelieving to discussing it fervently. </p><p></p><p>Even some people in front of the neighboring shops of Luo Yiping, Gu Xiaoqing and others, also turned to go watch at Chu Ning's side.</p><p></p><p>However, it was just watching.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether it was because Chu Ning was too young,</p><p>Or because this dual-hall disciple surprisingly only had the fourth level of Qi refining, causing doubts about his abilities.</p><p></p><p>Not a single person came forward to inquire about making purchases.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Luo Yiping saw this and lightly laughed.</p><p></p><p>Especially when an hour passed, people gradually left Chu Ning's shop front, but not a single person came to inquire.</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping, watching from not far away, sneered repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>He transmitted his voice to Shen Zhengquan and Gu Xiaoqing, "Now you see, no one is even willing to enter, this Junior Brother Chu is really quite capable."</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan shook his head, not knowing what he meant.</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing did not respond, only slightly furrowing her brow.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's brow also unconsciously creased slightly.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had purposely taken a turn around the market street, mainly to check out the talisman selling area of Wind Gorge.</p><p></p><p>In order to understand the situation more clearly, he even specially asked someone to help buy a few talismans.</p><p></p><p>After looking over the talismans he bought, Chu Ning gained great confidence.</p><p></p><p>For the same low-grade beginner talismans, the quality of his was definitely better than theirs.</p><p></p><p>After all, his innate spirit root talent brought tangible improvements to talisman quality during the forging process.</p><p></p><p>So for pricing, Chu Ning chose to directly match their rates.</p><p></p><p>Higher quality talismans, but the same price - buyers would naturally know how to choose.</p><p></p><p>However, even good wine fears deep alleys.</p><p></p><p>No matter how good these talismans were, if they didn't sell, their value couldn't be realized.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like I need to employ some tactics." Chu Ning inwardly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he just wanted to make money quietly, without being too high-profile or showy.</p><p></p><p>But if the shop had no income, that wouldn't work.</p><p></p><p>According to the sect's rules, the Lingfu Pavilion shop had to hand over 500 spirit stones per month.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Plant House was lower at 200 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Added together, that was 700 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't open the shop, he couldn't afford that cost.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning took out a sign he had prepared earlier from his storage pouch and wrote a line in large characters on it:</p><p></p><p>"Opening Day Special, Buy Five Talismans Get One Free!"</p><p></p><p>Then, with a Controlling Objects Spell, he directly hung this extremely eye-catching sign outside the shop.</p><p></p><p>For the reincarnated Chu Ning, he had too many promotional tactics to use.</p><p></p><p>And now, he had just casually chosen the simplest one.</p><p></p><p>The facts proved that Chu Ning's move was indeed effective - shortly after hanging the sign, a man looking to be around thirty years old, with the appearance of a wandering cultivator, walked into the shop after reading Chu Ning's sign and came up to him.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, it says here 'Buy Five Get One Free' for your talismans - does that mean buy five talismans and get one free?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "Correct, if Fellow Daoist buys five talismans of the same price, I can give you one for free."</p><p></p><p>"The talisman quality is guaranteed, right?" The man asked hesitantly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning directly took out a talisman and handed it over to him.</p><p></p><p>"Produced by the Qingxi Sect, the quality is naturally assured."</p><p></p><p>The man took the talisman and...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He took it and looked at it, revealing a hint of delight on his face. </p><p></p><p>"The quality of these talisman papers is indeed not bad, it seems even better than those from Wind Gorge."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled without answering.</p><p></p><p>The man put down the talisman papers, and then asked Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"What if my companion and I buy together, but he wants to buy defensive talisman papers, is that possible?"</p><p></p><p>"Group purchases are supported," Chu Ning continued smiling.</p><p></p><p>"If my friend wants to buy defensive talisman papers, naturally he can combine them with the offensive ones. If you buy four 2 spirit stone talisman papers and one 3 spirit stone talisman paper, I can still give you one 2 spirit stone talisman paper for free."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the man immediately turned and called over another slightly older man.</p><p></p><p>After a brief discussion, they quickly decided and bought two Fire Talismans, one Profound Ice Talisman, one Rejuvenation Talisman, and one Earth Armor Talisman. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning also let them pick another Fire Talisman as a gift.</p><p></p><p>The two men left excitedly with the talisman papers in hand.</p><p></p><p>With these two men making purchases, everyone else also understood what was going on.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the discussions around grew louder.</p><p></p><p>Especially when the man just mentioned that the quality of Chu Ning's talisman papers was actually higher than those from Wind Gorge.</p><p></p><p>Many people were extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, one or two more people came to inquire about purchasing.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not buy as many as five, only scattered purchases.</p><p></p><p>But for those frequently dealing with talisman papers, they could still clearly sense that the quality of these was indeed very high.</p><p></p><p>For a time, it made many people extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>The market was not particularly large, and the talisman papers from the Qingxi Talisman Stall had higher quality than Wind Gorge Talisman Stall, plus buying more earned free gifts.</p><p></p><p>This news quickly spread through the market streets.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the Yan Ji Market Street, at this moment, a gray-robed youth of twenty-four or twenty-five years old was frequently looking around.</p><p></p><p>When he encountered lone cultivators, he would take the initiative to approach and inquire about something.</p><p></p><p>However, several people in a row ignored him.</p><p></p><p>Finally, when he asked a beautiful female cultivator in her thirties, she stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Is what you said true? The talisman papers from the Qingxi Talisman Stall really have higher quality than Wind Gorge, and buying five earns a free one?"</p><p></p><p>The beautiful lady looked at the gray-robed youth.</p><p></p><p>The youth immediately responded, "It's true, I just went to take a look. I want to buy 3 talisman papers. Does my friend plan to buy any? If possible, we can combine our purchases. For 3 talisman papers, we can save 1 low-grade spirit stone!"</p><p></p><p>After listening, the lady seemed moved and finally nodded, "Alright, let's go take a look then."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the gray-robed youth immediately revealed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>He led the lady to Chu Ning's talisman stall, and after inquiring, they each took out 5 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Then they happily left with 3 talisman papers each.</p><p></p><p>After all, before this, although talisman papers were not rare in major sects, they were still quite popular in Yan Ji Market.</p><p></p><p>To have a situation where buying talisman papers earned free gifts was almost unheard of.</p><p></p><p>After a few transactions, the news of Chu Ning's talisman stall promotion spread even wider.</p><p></p><p>Almost every so often, cultivators would come to make purchases.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was mostly groups combining their purchases.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Talisman Stall's business had quietly become the hottest in the market.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the steady stream of people at Chu Ning's stall and his decent talisman paper sales, the other members of Qingxi Sect were quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>Even Luo Yiping, who originally looked at Chu Ning with cold disregard, was slightly taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The traffic at their few stalls was normal, but compared to Chu Ning's, it was far less.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

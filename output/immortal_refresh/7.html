        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin's expression didn't look too good as he turned his face away. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was wondering what was wrong with what he said that made Cao Dongxin's expression look bad.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi next to him didn't seem to notice anything off, and asked in a low voice:</p><p>"Senior Brother, did we come too late? This Senior Brother Cao came so early."</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang smiled after hearing this, without looking at Qiu Shunyi, but rather looked at Chu Ning with interest and said:</p><p>"You don't know about this. Our Senior Brother Cao generally comes two to three months earlier, which is when you new disciples join. This is to temper you all."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning understood the meaning and was speechless again at Cao Dongxin's dark mentality.</p><p></p><p>However, his expression didn't show it. Instead, he revealed a hint of bewilderment, as if he didn't quite understand.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at Chu Ning, Cao Dongxin turned and looked at Qiu Shunyi with an unpleasant expression.</p><p></p><p>By this time, Qiu Shunyi had also realized it, withdrew his gaze in embarrassment, and quickly changed the subject, asking Chu Ning:</p><p>"Chu Ning, did you practice the Qingmu Changchun Gong yesterday? Did you find it difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning: "I just practiced it once, so I don't know if it's difficult or not."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Qiu Shunyi's face immediately turned bitter.</p><p></p><p>"I found it quite difficult. I practiced it once last night and once this morning, but I still can't sense the spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"I just asked a few people, and everyone is about the same. You've only practiced it once..."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi's implication was that since you've only practiced once, you definitely can't do it.</p><p></p><p>But then thinking that Cao Dongxin brought Chu Ning out so early, he stopped himself from finishing that sentence.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take it slow," Chu Ning replied this time, and didn't say anything more.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't very well tell the other that he had already circulated his spiritual energy into his body, entering the first level.</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang and Qiu Shunyi chatted idly for a few more sentences, not staying long, before walking into another field.</p><p></p><p>It was at this time that Cao Dongxin finally stood up and walked towards the field as well.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't know what he was going to do, so he followed along.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he moved his feet, he heard Cao Dongxin say, "Don't follow me, you'll affect my spell casting."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, okay." Chu Ning responded verbally, but wondered in his heart what kind of spell Cao Dongxin was going to cast in the field.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be the Qingmu Chunhua Shu?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought of the Qingmu Chunhua Shu spell that came with the Qingmu Changchun Gong manual, which was listed as a required spell for disciples of the Spirit Plant House.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he had only practiced for the first time last night, and hadn't gotten to practicing this spell yet.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Chu Ning saw Cao Dongxin making hand seals towards the field, so he quickly took out the small manual from his pocket and flipped to the Qingmu Chunhua Shu section.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the hand seals matched those of the Qingmu Chunhua Shu.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel that Cao Dongxin's spellcasting seemed a bit off.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like he was consuming too much energy?</p><p></p><p>He didn't have any particular basis for this judgment, but this feeling welled up in his heart, which was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin was unaware of Chu Ning's thoughts. Although he was indeed consuming quite a bit of spiritual power this time, he still managed to successfully cast the Qingmu Chunhua Shu over all the fields he needed to today.</p><p></p><p>After everything was done, he nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>After resting in the field for a while, Cao Dongxin walked back over to Chu Ning's side.</p><p></p><p>"These few fields are mine. You stand guard here. If any birds come, chase them away."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Cao Dongxin pointed out the area of the few fields.</p><p></p><p>Then, his gaze fixed on Chu Ning as he warned, "Don't slack off. Don't let the Chiling rice be eaten by the birds."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Brother," Chu Ning didn't ask any more questions and simply agreed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning being so obedient, Cao Dongxin's expression indeed improved quite a bit. Without saying anything more, he walked back the way he came towards the residence.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Cao Dongxin leave, Chu Ning thought for a moment before heading into the fields.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He found the corner of the plot where Cao Donxin had just performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique. He took out the small book on the Qingmu Changchun skill and carefully began studying this Qingmu Chunhua technique. </p><p></p><p>After reading for a while, he put the small book back in his pocket. He went over it in his mind, making sure he had memorized the essentials. Then Chu Ning began performing the hand seals toward the grain called crimson spirit rice in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Although it was his first time cultivating it and he was not very proficient, Chu Ning still managed to fully perform the hand seals.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, Chu Ning felt that within the area covered by his hand seals, the three stalks of crimson spirit rice swayed slightly. Immediately after, a trace of wood-attributed spiritual qi, so faint it was almost undetectable, began automatically gathering towards these three stalks of grain.</p><p></p><p>If Chu Ning had not just performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique, he would have been almost unable to sense it.</p><p></p><p>"So the Qingmu Chunhua technique can actually help spirit plants absorb spiritual qi, no wonder it can promote growth and improve quality."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself, then quickly focused his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique (100/100)]</p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Skill (Yellow Grade Lower Tier), First Layer (1/300)]</p><p></p><p>"Eh, why is there still no Qingmu Chunhua technique?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly puzzled that the prompts in his mind were exactly the same as this morning.</p><p></p><p>He had clearly successfully cultivated the Qingmu Chunhua technique just now, yet there was no proficiency prompt.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that I need to cultivate it a few more times?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered to himself, but felt that didn't seem quite right, because previously with the Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique and Qingmu Changchun Skill, he had proficiency prompts as soon as he prepared to start cultivating them.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning wanted to try the Qingmu Chunhua technique again, but then he had to give up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>Because he had run out of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power he had cultivated last night was only enough to perform the Qingmu Chunhua technique once, and then his dantian was empty.</p><p></p><p>"Why don't I just cultivate skills here?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought this was also a good idea. He was currently in a corner of the fields, where ordinary people would not pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Skill would also allow him to sense his surroundings, so if anyone came, he could just stop cultivating.</p><p></p><p>This was the sect's territory after all, so it should be safe under normal circumstances.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Chu Ning sat cross-legged and began cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Skill.</p><p></p><p>With the experience from cultivating last night, Chu Ning quickly entered the state. Sensing the surrounding wood-attributed spiritual qi, he swiftly guided it into his body.</p><p></p><p>Then Chu Ning discovered that it seemed today the spiritual qi was not only richer but also much purer, and his absorption speed was clearly faster.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it was because he had become more proficient, Chu Ning didn't dwell on it and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>However, what Chu Ning did not notice was that at this moment, including the three stalks of crimson spirit rice he had just performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique on, as well as the patch of crimson spirit rice that Cao Donxin had previously performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique on, were all emitting traces of spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>Then, as if pulled by guiding threads, the spiritual qi was drawn towards the area around Chu Ning's body. Following his breathing, the richer spiritual qi gathered and entered his body.</p><p></p><p>After entering Chu Ning's body and reaching his dantian, this spiritual qi not only quickly replenished the power consumed when he performed the Qingmu Chunhua technique earlier, but also condensed into new spiritual power at an even faster rate, settling in Chu Ning's dantian.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating like this for a while, Chu Ning vaguely heard the sound of conversation coming from the road and stopped his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"My cultivation state was really good today, it seems like I condensed quite a bit more spiritual power than last night."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly checked his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Skill (Yellow Grade Lower Tier), First Layer (3/300)]</p><p></p><p>His proficiency had actually increased by 2 full points, doubling the effect of last night's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning could confirm that the duration of his cultivation was definitely not as long as last night's.</p>

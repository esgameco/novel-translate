        <h1>Chapter 18</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The next day early morning.</p><p></p><p>After getting up and having breakfast, Chuning first went to the fields where the spirit rice was planted and walked around. </p><p></p><p>Using a clearing technique, he removed a few weeds, and then immediately went to the premium spirit fields where the spirit black bamboo was planted.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (17/900)]</p><p></p><p>Before cultivating, Chunning first took a look at the progress of the second layer of his Green Wood Evergreen Skill.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had thought before, although he had been diligently cultivating during this period, because he needed to recover his spiritual power through meditation after using the catalyzing technique, Chunning still could not reach 1 point of proficiency per day.</p><p></p><p>Now after 21 days, Chunning's second layer proficiency had only reached 17.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Chunning did not hesitate at all. After selecting a spirit black bamboo shoot within range, he directly circulated his spiritual power, made hand seals, and then cast the Green Wood Spring Technique.</p><p></p><p>After repeating this multiple times, Chunning chose a spot to sit down and wait for the Green Wood Spring Technique to take effect on the spirit black bamboo.</p><p></p><p>According to his experience over the past three months, cultivating the Green Wood Evergreen Skill half an hour after casting had the best effect.</p><p></p><p>So, half an hour later, Chunning immediately sat cross-legged and began cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The completely different speed of absorbing spiritual energy immediately made Chunning feel a sense of satisfaction surge in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He continuously urged on the skill, absorbing the spiritual energy transmitted out from the tips of the bamboo shoots.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating like this for a full one and a half hours, Chunning ended his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he naturally did was look at the cultivation results.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (18/900)]</p><p></p><p>His proficiency had increased by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, cultivating with the assistance of the Green Wood Spring Technique was more effective.</p><p></p><p>Normally, he could only increase 1 point of proficiency per day, but now with one cultivation session he had increased 1 point.</p><p></p><p>"If I keep doing this in addition to morning and evening cultivation sessions, I can increase 2 to 3 points per day.</p><p></p><p>This speed is 2 to 3 times faster than before, so in about a year to a year and a half, I should be able to complete the mid-stage of the second spirit-cultivating layer."</p><p></p><p>Chunning calculated in his heart, feeling much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the spirit black bamboo in front of him, and once again cast the Green Wood Spring Technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, this spirit black bamboo would be an important source of income for him in a few months, so he had to cultivate it well.</p><p></p><p>Performing the Green Wood Spring Technique once a day was absolutely necessary.</p><p></p><p>The effects of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill he had just absorbed were now being replenished.</p><p></p><p>After casting the Green Wood Spring Technique and feeling the vigorous life force in this area of spirit black bamboo, Chunning finally left feeling satisfied.</p><p></p><p>After eating lunch, Chunning did not choose to go to the spirit fields again, but instead went to the mountain behind the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>During the previous twenty days, in order to quickly plant the red spirit rice and spirit black bamboo, he had to suppress the idea of practicing the Thorn Binding Technique and Rattan Armor Technique.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could finally give it a try.</p><p></p><p>In theory, the Thorn Binding Technique could be cast using any plant by driving it with spiritual power, but of course it was best if the plant itself was a vine.</p><p></p><p>Chunning had already observed that there was a plant called rattan vine on the mountain behind the courtyard that was very suitable.</p><p></p><p>Although it didn't have thorns, its body was very tough and flexible, making it well-suited for practicing the Thorn Binding Technique.</p><p></p><p>Over the past period of time, although Chunning didn't have time to practice, he had long since memorized the spell incantations and such.</p><p></p><p>Coming to the mountain, Chunning found a place with rattan vines.</p><p></p><p>The rattan vines were not thick, gray-black like iron wire, with small but lush leaves, and some mature rattan vines even had purple flowers blooming.</p><p></p><p>Chunning stood beside the rattan vines, looked at a tree not far away, quickly made hand seals, and then pointed with his hand.</p><p></p><p>A rattan vine "whooshed" up and rapidly flew towards the tree.</p><p></p><p>"Thud!"</p><p></p><p>The next moment, however, it fell straight back down.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chunning shook his head. Just then, he had failed to control his spiritual power properly, resulting in a failed casting.</p><p></p><p>He took a light breath and calmed his mind, then began casting again.</p><p></p><p>The vine flew up once more, and under Chunning's guidance, it went straight to the tree and wrapped around it tightly. This tree was about the size of a washbasin.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chunning made another hand seal.</p><p></p><p>Visible to the naked eye, thorns grew out from the vine, and the entire vine tightened more and more, with the sharp thorns piercing directly into the tree trunk.</p><p></p><p>As long as the vines bound the designated person or object, Chunning no longer needed to use his spiritual power to control them.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Driven by motivation. </p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning, no longer needing to use spells, couldn't help but walk up to the tree.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the vines tightly wrapped around and almost embedded into the tree trunk, he couldn't help but inwardly click his tongue. </p><p></p><p>"If this was bound on an ordinary person..."</p><p></p><p>No wonder mortals revere cultivators so much, even an initial intermediate-level offensive spell has such destructive power.</p><p></p><p>While feeling pensive, Chu Ning made another hand seal. </p><p></p><p>The thorns on the iron vine instantly disappeared, and the vines quickly loosened and retracted from the tree, returning to their original state.</p><p></p><p>Only deep grooves were left on the tree trunk. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning began casting spells on another vine.</p><p></p><p>After practicing the Thorn Technique for a while, Chu Ning started practicing the Vine Armor Technique.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the Thorn Technique which requires plants, the Vine Armor Technique uses one's own spiritual power to form a protective vine armor around the body. </p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, the caster needs to constantly channel spiritual power to maintain it.</p><p></p><p>As another initial intermediate-level wood elemental spell, Chu Ning's innate affinity for wood allowed him to cast it after a few attempts.</p><p></p><p>However, due to the depletion from previously practicing the Thorn Technique, the Vine Armor only lasted briefly.  </p><p></p><p>Having learned one offensive and one defensive spell, all that was left was diligent practice to shorten his casting time and increase the power of his spells.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that night was about to fall, Chu Ning prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>But just as he took a step, he stopped and looked at the iron vine, an idea forming.</p><p></p><p>Why doesn't he plant this iron vine in his courtyard?</p><p></p><p>This iron vine is actually a spiritual plant, and even has some medicinal properties as an ingredient for pill refinement. </p><p></p><p>It's just that because it grows so prolifically and is so common, no one pays much attention to it or chooses to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>But for him, it's different.</p><p></p><p>If the iron vine blooms, it would actually look quite nice decorating the courtyard walls.  </p><p></p><p>Moreover, in case of an emergency, he could use the Thorn Technique right in his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, could he perhaps use the Spring Wood Technique to cultivate in the courtyard at night with the iron vine?</p><p></p><p>The sect discourages disciples from staying out in the spiritual fields at night, as the sect patrols don't cover those areas then.  </p><p></p><p>Occasionally, demonic beasts or rogue cultivators appear, so being alone just increases the risk of an attack.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had been considering using the Spring Wood Technique to accelerate his night cultivation.  </p><p></p><p>But not all spiritual plants are as easy to cultivate as the lowly iron vine.</p><p></p><p>Most have specific soil requirements for planting.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning suddenly looked upon the ordinary iron vine with appreciation.  </p><p></p><p>He didn't choose to dig up the iron vines already growing above ground, as those common vines were too low in quality.</p><p></p><p>After searching the mountain for a while, he found an iron vine with dark purple flowers and took its seeds back to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Planting was too easy for Chu Ning.  </p><p></p><p>With a Catalyzing Spell, all the seeds germinated. Chu Ning then planted the iron vines in a ring along the courtyard walls.</p><p></p><p>He then applied the Spring Wood Technique in batches to each iron vine.</p><p></p><p>Testing it out, Chu Ning indeed felt the amplifying effect of the Spring Wood Technique again.</p><p></p><p>However, since the iron vine wasn't as high-quality as the Ink Bamboo, the amplification wasn't very noticeable.  </p><p></p><p>But after trying it once in the evening and once in the morning, it seemed about twice the cultivation would increase his proficiency by 1 point, which was still faster than before.</p><p></p><p>Adding the once-daily cultivation in the Ink Bamboo spiritual field, he could now guarantee gaining 2 proficiency points per day, while reserving nearly half a day for spell practice.</p><p></p><p>So in the time that followed, Chu Ning cultivated the Ink Bamboo and Spiritual Rice while also practicing the Thorn Technique, Vine Armor Technique, and the Purification, Blade Aura, Gentle Rain, and Repulsion Techniques he had yet to master.</p><p></p><p>In between, Chu Ning visited the Instruction Hall again and learned the Fireball and Breath Sensing Techniques, which were considered basic spells.  </p><p></p><p>After establishing their own spiritual fields, disciples could still visit the Instruction Hall once a month to learn techniques and gain insights, though less frequently than the previous bi-weekly visits.</p><p></p><p>Just like that, over a month passed as half a year had gone by since Chu Ning joined the Green Creek Sect.</p><p></p><p>That morning, just as Chu Ning was about to leave his courtyard for the spiritual field, he heard someone calling from outside.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

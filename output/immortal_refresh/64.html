        <h1>Chapter 64</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"This Spirit Symbol Pavilion is quite generous. It seems their regular income is not bad." </p><p></p><p>After leaving the Spirit Symbol Pavilion, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a bit of joy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After giving Chu Ning the jade slip for talisman-making, Liao Yunming also gave Chu Ning five talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Unlike the low-grade beginner talisman papers Chu Ning had bought before, four of the five talisman papers given by Liao Yunming were mid-grade beginner talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>One of them was even a high-grade beginner talisman paper!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was the most valuable defensive talisman paper among all talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>In Liao Yunming's words, the Spirit Symbol Pavilion might not have much else, but they definitely had plenty of talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning knew that the Spirit Symbol Pavilion made a living by making talismans, he was still extremely surprised that Liao Yunming gave him a high-grade talisman paper on his first visit.</p><p></p><p>Even at the very end before leaving, Liao Yunming unexpectedly gave him 500 blank talisman papers and instructed him to practice diligently on a daily basis.</p><p></p><p>If he had any questions, he could come here to seek advice from the senior disciples, and Liao Yunming introduced a disciple named Tan Jing to him.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning already had quite a few talisman papers on him, the Spirit Symbol Pavilion's comprehensive gifting still left him deeply impressed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about today's unexpected gains, he felt his steps became a bit lighter.</p><p></p><p>For him today, gaining the talisman-making art by joining the Spirit Symbol Pavilion was naturally one of the major gains.</p><p></p><p>The other was that he had officially become an outer disciple!</p><p></p><p>Previously, he also knew that if he revealed his true cultivation level, he could definitely become an outer disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, in order to avoid exposing the secret of his constantly refreshing talent, he dared not show his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>But this did not mean that he had no thoughts about becoming an outer disciple, as he was very clear about it.</p><p></p><p>There was a huge difference between the menial disciples and outer disciples of Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Like before, when Zhuang Yunde helped bring information about body refining and spirit plant cultivation, it was just a small part of it.</p><p></p><p>Later on, there would also be a huge difference in the choice of cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Qingmu Changchun Gong that Chu Ning currently had was only a cultivation manual for the late Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, menial disciples could generally only purchase things in the market.</p><p></p><p>Outer disciples, on the other hand, could purchase things at the Hundred Treasures Pavilion of the outer sect, which was not only more convenient but also more cost-effective in terms of prices.</p><p></p><p>And so on.</p><p></p><p>Now, being able to become an outer disciple in this way was naturally a cause for joy for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about what He Changyou had said to him before, Chu Ning prepared to head directly to the Spirit Plant House's practice grounds outside the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>But after some thought, Chu Ning took a detour and headed towards the residence of Zhuang Yunde and Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>When Zhuang Yunde saw him enter the outer sect earlier, he must have guessed the reason for his appearance here.</p><p></p><p>Although Zhuang Yunde had received quite a few benefits from him before, he had actually taken care of Chu Ning even more.</p><p></p><p>Mu Ling had also provided him with such important information.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he should thank both of them, both out of gratitude and duty.</p><p></p><p>He came to Mu Ling's residence first, as they were both from the Spirit Symbol Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Ling was not at her residence, so Chu Ning left a voice transmission talisman on her door after some thought.</p><p></p><p>He mentioned that he had gained the qualification to learn talisman-making through the competition and thanked Mu Ling for providing the information earlier.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Chu Ning left Mu Ling's residence and headed towards Zhuang Yunde's residence.</p><p></p><p>He had only taken a few steps when he saw Zhuang Yunde walking towards him from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning could greet him, Zhuang Yunde spoke first.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, I've heard your good news. Congratulations, congratulations on becoming an outer sect disciple of the two halls."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't expect Zhuang Yunde's information to be so well-informed, so he said, "I was just about to go find Senior Brother Zhuang to share this news, but I didn't expect you already knew it first."</p><p></p><p>"I just came back from the Dao Field, and I heard it from the executor He," said Zhuang Yunde, then said to Chu Ning, "It's not convenient to talk here, let's go to my courtyard instead."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was stunned for a moment, then followed him to the courtyard. </p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde's round face showed his usual smile, and he smiled at Chu Ning, "Junior Brother must have just come out of the Lingfu Pavilion and was about to go find the executor He, right?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded. Since the other party had just returned from the Lingzhi House Dao Field, it was normal for him to know these things.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled and said, "Does Junior Brother know that there's another good thing waiting for you?"</p><p></p><p>These words made Chu Ning slightly stunned, not knowing what Zhuang Yunde meant.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde didn't beat around the bush and immediately continued, "If the executor He asks, Junior Brother can just tell him all the things the executor of the Lingfu Pavilion gave you, even the things he mentioned he would give you in the future."</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Chu Ning didn't understand and asked in confusion, "Why is that?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled and answered, "The Baiyi Hall has never had a high status in the sect, and the Lingzhi House that the executor He manages also has a general status in the hall. This time, with Junior Brother Chu becoming a disciple of the two halls, if the executor He knows that the Lingfu Pavilion gave you so many benefits, with his face-conscious personality..."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Zhuang Yunde smiled meaningfully.</p><p></p><p>"What do you think he would do? He can't just do nothing, right?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, how could Chu Ning not understand Zhuang Yunde's words? In his heart, he deeply admired this Senior Brother Zhuang's keen sense and skill in taking advantage of situations. No wonder Zhuang Yunde, who was only a disciple executor in the Ding District, could live so comfortably.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother, for the advice," Chu Ning cupped his hands again.</p><p></p><p>Only then did Zhuang Yunde smile and accept the courtesy, then continued to advise, "Of course, our Lingzhi House doesn't have as many good things as the Lingfu Pavilion. After all, some rare spirit plants are either in the hands of the elders of the hall or directly controlled by the sect. However, the executor He does have the cultivation methods for some rare spirit plants. Also, since Junior Brother has just joined and hasn't cultivated much in these arts or prepared any magic tools, you can just ask for them. Even if it's really not possible, you can ask for more spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>After listening to Zhuang Yunde's words, Chu Ning didn't know how to respond for a moment, as he was deeply impressed by the other party's ingrained shrewdness.</p><p></p><p>After expressing his gratitude, Chu Ning finally left. However, on the way from the outer sect to the Lingzhi House, Chu Ning was also full of doubts in his heart. With Zhuang Yunde's shrewdness, why would he want to participate in the sect's dangerous mission a month later? Was it really just for the hope of entering the inner sect and gaining better resources to aid his breakthrough?</p><p></p><p>Of course, such doubts only flashed through his mind briefly, and he didn't think too much about it. What he was really thinking about was whether He Changyou would really let him receive benefits, as Zhuang Yunde had guessed. Thinking of this, his pace quickened.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 83</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Did Junior Brother Chu also bring some low-grade medium spiritual talismans?" Gu Xiaoqing asked with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shen Zhengquan, Luo Yiping, and Lu Miaoying, who were nearby, had also opened their stalls. </p><p></p><p>Hearing Gu Xiaoqing's words, their eyes all turned towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally heard that Gu Xiaoqing said "bring," but he did not refute it. He only responded, "I prepared a few."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Luo Yiping, who had originally planned to watch Chu Ning's spectacle today, immediately opened his mouth slightly wider.</p><p></p><p>"Could this guy be the son of one of the executives from the Spiritual Talisman Hall? Even low-grade medium spiritual talismans, he has prepared so many?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning's response, a gentle smile appeared on Gu Xiaoqing's face.</p><p></p><p>"I was going to remind Junior Brother Chu that the person in charge of selling talismans in this market town is said to be a second-grade talisman master. It seems Junior Brother was well-prepared."</p><p></p><p>This woman's appearance was not stunning, but with this smile, her gentle and lovely demeanor was quite attractive, causing Luo Yiping and Shen Zhengquan to glance sideways.</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning could respond, several figures rushed over, heading towards their respective stalls.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, I want to buy talismans. Do you have..."</p><p></p><p>The one who came to Chu Ning was a middle-aged man with thick eyebrows and big eyes. As soon as he approached Chu Ning, he spoke urgently.</p><p></p><p>Then, after glancing at the sign hung outside Chu Ning's stall, he immediately exclaimed with delight, "You have low-grade medium spiritual talismans? What talismans do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was puzzled by the man's hurried manner but responded calmly, "All kinds. You can take a look yourself."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning casually pointed to the counter in front of him, where various talismans were displayed along with their corresponding prices.</p><p></p><p>The thick-browed, big-eyed middle-aged man immediately began looking and muttering, "Yin Lightning Talisman, Evasion Talisman, Cleansing Wind Talisman for five low-grade spirit stones. Oh, there's also the Beast Binding Talisman..."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, the middle-aged man immediately called out, "Shopkeeper, give me twenty Beast Binding Talismans, ten each of the Yin Lightning Talisman, Adamantine Talisman, Earth Escape Talisman, and Cleansing Wind Talisman. Also, thirty each of the low-grade offensive and defensive talismans..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. "So many?"</p><p></p><p>The thick-browed, big-eyed middle-aged man immediately became a bit anxious. "Shopkeeper, you don't have that many?"</p><p></p><p>"I do, of course I do!" Chu Ning responded immediately.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he began taking out talismans from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>While taking out the talismans, Chu Ning calculated the cost.</p><p></p><p>"Thirty Blazing Fire Talismans for sixty low-grade spirit stones, thirty Earth Armor Talismans for ninety low-grade spirit stones. Twenty Yin Lightning Talismans and Cleansing Wind Talismans for one hundred low-grade spirit stones, thirty Beast Binding Talismans and Earth Escape Talismans for one hundred and eighty spirit stones, ten Adamantine Talismans for seventy spirit stones. In total, five hundred low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>For such a substantial transaction, he should offer a discount.</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning could suggest a lower price, the thick-browed, big-eyed middle-aged man swiftly took out a pile of spirit stones from his storage bag and placed them in front of Chu Ning. He then grabbed the talismans and hurriedly left, seemingly heading towards Gu Xiaoqing's stall selling spirit pills.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly taken aback. "He's in such a hurry?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to observe what the man was going to do at Gu Xiaoqing's stall, but at that moment, another person rushed over from the other side.</p><p></p><p>"Shopkeeper, what talismans do you have..."</p><p></p><p>This time, it was a cultivator around fifty years old with a goatee on his chin.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he glanced at Chu Ning's price listings and pointed to several talismans, saying, "Ten each of the Yin Lightning Talisman, Cleansing Wind Talisman, and Earth Escape Talisman. Fifteen Adamantine Talismans, twenty Beast Binding Talismans, forty each of the Blazing Fire Talisman and Glacial Talisman, thirty Rejuvenation Talismans, and twenty Wood Escape Talismans."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, this goateed old man had already started taking out spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Following the example of the previous middle-aged man, Chu Ning didn't say much and quickly gathered the various talismans for him.</p><p></p><p>Then he swiftly calculated the cost again.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty Yin Lightning Talismans and Cleansing Wind Talismans for one hundred low-grade spirit stones, fifteen Adamantine Talismans for one hundred and five spirit stones, thirty Beast Binding Talismans and Earth Escape Talismans for one hundred and eighty spirit stones. Eighty Blazing Fire Talismans and Glacial Talismans for one hundred and sixty spirit stones, thirty Rejuvenation Talismans for sixty spirit stones, twenty Wood Escape Talismans for sixty spirit stones. In total, six hundred and five low-grade spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>After calculating, Chu Ning immediately followed up, "Let's make it six hundred spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>The goateed man didn't hesitate and took out the spirit stones, placing them in front of Chu Ning. He then grabbed the talismans and left.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning, who had originally wanted to ask a few more questions, could only let it go this time.</p><p></p><p>This isn't right, something's not right!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's brow immediately furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The two men seemed to be from cultivating families, but even for cultivating families, it was unlikely they would need so many talismans at once.</p><p></p><p>And it seemed like they were not only buying talismans but also spirit pills and magical treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Could something have happened?"</p><p></p><p>When the third person, a female cultivator around thirty-six or thirty-seven years old, appeared in front of Chu Ning and immediately asked for two hundred talismans, Chu Ning finally couldn't help but ask as he took out the talismans, "Fellow Daoist, what exactly happened? Why are all of you in such a hurry and buying so many talismans at once?"</p><p></p><p>The beautiful woman appeared more composed, but her expression also became more serious.</p><p></p><p>She sighed lightly and said, "It's a beast calamity!"</p><p></p><p>"Beast calamity?" Chu Ning exclaimed with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't the first time he had heard this term.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when He Changyou and Liao Yunming had asked him to come to the Yan Ji Market Town, they had mentioned that the biggest disaster in this market town was the beast calamity.</p><p></p><p>For cultivators at the middle stage of Qi Condensation, dealing with it wasn't too troublesome because in this branch area, most were low-level first-grade initial and intermediate spirit beasts, with first-grade initial spirit beasts being the most common, equivalent to the early stage of Qi Condensation for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the sects and major cultivating families had formed law enforcement patrols, so there wasn't much to be afraid of.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the market town, Chu Ning also learned that in the area around the Yan Ji Market Town, there would occasionally be outbreaks of spirit beasts, which were known as beast calamities.</p><p></p><p>During such times, all kinds of goods tended to sell best.</p><p></p><p>So when he heard the beautiful woman mention a beast calamity, Chu Ning's eyes immediately lit up.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to inquire about the details, the beautiful woman had already urged him, "Shopkeeper, please hurry up. I still need to buy some other things and then rush back to my family."</p><p></p><p>"This beast calamity seems to be like previous ones. I heard that some first-grade intermediate and advanced spirit beasts have appeared. Last night, the Li Family of Yang Ling was attacked by spirit beasts, with heavy casualties."</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning was taking out the talismans, he hurriedly asked upon hearing this, "How many first-grade advanced spirit beasts?"</p><p></p><p>First-grade intermediate spirit beasts were roughly at the level of the fourth or fifth layer of Qi Condensation, while first-grade advanced spirit beasts had reached the level of the seventh or eighth layer of Qi Condensation for cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Some formidable first-grade advanced spirit beasts could even reach the level of...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The water level reached the ninth floor.</p><p></p><p>The lady hesitated for a moment, seeming a bit uncertain as she said: </p><p></p><p>"I heard that the attack on the Li Family in Yangling last night encountered quite a few first-level intermediate demonic beasts, and one first-level advanced demonic beast. But it's uncertain if there were any higher-level ones. Logically speaking, there were rarely such high-level demonic beasts in the mountain ranges around Yanjifang before."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing the lady's words, Chu Ning felt somewhat relieved. He handed the talisman papers to her and also deducted ten spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>A first-level advanced demonic beast did pose a certain threat to the local cultivating clans. However, the main reason was probably due to lack of preparation, otherwise there wouldn't be such great losses.</p><p></p><p>After all, among these cultivating clans affiliated with the Qingxi Sect, there might not be any Foundation Establishment cultivators, but generally the larger clans would have one or two late Qi Condensation cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's only concern at the moment was whether the talisman papers he prepared would be enough. In the past three days, he had only prepared around three hundred intermediate-grade primary talisman papers.  </p><p></p><p>But now, the first three families had already taken over a hundred of them.</p><p></p><p>The lady received the talisman papers handed over by Chu Ning and sensed them briefly, immediately brightening up.</p><p></p><p>"Friend, your primary intermediate and low-grade talisman papers are even better than those from Fengxia Valley."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning only smiled without responding. Although he didn't know the level of that second-grade talisman master from Fengxia Valley, he reckoned it was definitely inferior compared to his own innate talisman spiritual body talent.</p><p></p><p>After the lady left, a few more people came to Chu Ning's side one after another. Chu Ning's concern was not without reason - the talisman papers he prepared were quickly sold out.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning there were no more primary intermediate-grade talisman papers, even the primary low-grade ones were swept clean by the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Such a scene made Luo Yiping's eyes nearly pop out of their sockets.</p><p></p><p>The demonic beast calamity in the nearby area was no longer a secret in Yanjifang. At such times, everyone naturally needed to prepare things that could kill demonic beasts or protect their lives.</p><p></p><p>Hence, whether it was Chu Ning's talisman papers, Gu Xiaoqing's spirit pills, or Shen Zhengquan's magic weapons, they were all being snatched up.</p><p></p><p>As for Luo Yiping's spirit beasts, naturally no one would consider them at this time. So he could only watch as Chu Ning and the others' shops were bustling with people coming and going, while his own place was deserted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning had no time to consider Luo Yiping's thoughts. Seeing how popular the talisman papers were selling, he was inspired.</p><p></p><p>He had no more pre-made talisman papers, but he could draw them!</p><p></p><p>No sooner thought than done, Chu Ning hung up a "Temporarily Closed" sign and went to his room. </p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning didn't bother with primary low-grade talisman papers, but directly started drawing primary intermediate-grade ones.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until he had laid out 50 intermediate-grade talisman papers in front of him and vaguely felt some discomfort in his Nidan Palace that he finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning was taking out the intermediate-grade talisman papers, in another street at the Fengxia Valley Talisman Shop, a yellow-robed cultivator looked at the few people in the shop with an arrogant expression.</p><p></p><p>"These intermediate-grade attack talisman papers are seven spirit stones each. Take it or leave it. Talisman papers are a hot commodity in Yanjifang now, so naturally the prices can't be calculated the same as usual."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, a young man in black robes immediately shouted:</p><p></p><p>"But you can't raise the prices that much! The Qingxi Talisman Shop sold a hundred or two hundred primary intermediate-grade talisman papers today, and their prices weren't like this. Moreover, their quality is even better than yours."</p><p></p><p>The yellow-robed cultivator's face twitched. Learning that the Qingxi Talisman Shop also had primary intermediate-grade talisman papers for sale, and that their quality was actually better than his, made him extremely infuriated.</p><p></p><p>Earlier that morning, his talisman shop basically had no customers at all.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment he still sneered disdainfully:</p><p></p><p>"Qingxi Talisman Shop? Hmph, so what if they brought out some talisman papers from the sect? Now they're out of stock anyway, right?</p><p></p><p>I, Lai Weiquan, am the only second-grade talisman master in Yanjifang who can draw talismans himself. Even if you buy them now and use them up, you can come back to me tomorrow to buy more.</p><p></p><p>Can that Qingxi Talisman Shop do that? How dare they compare with me?"</p><p></p><p>The young man in black was about to say something when he suddenly walked out, then received a voice transmission talisman.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, his face showed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingxi Talisman Shop has primary intermediate-grade talisman papers for sale again!"</p><p></p><p>With a low exclamation, the man quickly left without turning back.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the other people in the shop also left one by one.</p><p></p><p>The second-grade talisman master from Fengxia Valley named Lai Weiquan now had a doubtful look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"They have primary intermediate-grade talisman papers for sale again? Didn't he just sell out?</p><p></p><p>How did they get more talisman papers in such a short time? Could it be that the Qingxi Sect actually has someone here who can draw primary intermediate-grade talismans?</p><p></p><p>Impossible! Absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Lai Weiquan immediately shook his head, dismissing this thought.</p><p></p><p>"They must have transferred talisman papers from other shops, or perhaps someone came from the sect and brought talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Hmph, even so, they can't have that many. The others will still come back to me."</p><p></p><p>Lai Weiquan was full of confidence at the moment.</p><p></p><p>However, Lai Weiquan waited and waited, but until the market closed, only one person came to him to purchase, buying just three sheets.</p><p></p><p>When he learned that the Qingxi Talisman Shop had somehow managed to put out another 100 primary intermediate-grade talisman papers for sale in such a short time, and even announced that they would open their shop to supply talisman papers the next day despite it not being a market day, Lai Weiquan was completely flustered.</p><p></p><p>Just where were all these talismans from the Qingxi Talisman Shop coming from?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, these talismans were drawn by Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>After selling out the first 50 talisman papers in a few batches, Chu Ning went back into his room again.</p><p></p><p>Then after a while, he brought out a few dozen more talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>This time, he didn't have to wait long before the crowd who had received the news snatched them all up.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not choose to continue drawing talismans at this point.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense could not recover that quickly.</p><p></p><p>He did have a bottle of Spirit Nourishing Pill obtained from Qi Chongmao in his storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning had not carefully studied the effects of this pill, and despite some guesses, he did not dare to consume it recklessly.</p><p></p><p>So he announced that people could come to buy talismans the next day even though it wasn't a market day, then directly closed up shop.</p><p></p><p>He planned to spend the remaining half day and the entire night cultivating the Soul Refinement Technique while also drawing talismans.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could implement this plan, Du Han came looking for him first.</p><p></p><p>When Du Han solemnly gathered everyone, Chu Ning had a vague feeling that some trouble seemed to be coming.</p><p></p><p>Here there are modifications to the demonic beast levels, please take note everyone. A reader left a comment today saying my classification of demonic beasts was too unclear and hard to compare, so I took a careful look and agreed it made sense, so I'll adjust it slightly.</p><p></p><p>First-level demonic beasts are equivalent to Qi Condensation demonic beasts, with the initial, intermediate and advanced levels corresponding to the early, middle and late Qi Condensation stages respectively.</p><p></p><p>Second-level demonic beasts are at the early Foundation Establishment stage.  </p><p>Third-level are middle Foundation Establishment.</p><p>Fourth-level are late Foundation Establishment.</p><p></p><p>And so on, thanks everyone for the valuable feedback.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

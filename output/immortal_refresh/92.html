        <h1>Chapter 92</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After the illusory form spell was cast, Chu Ning lost interest in the subsequent auction items. </p><p></p><p>He did not wait any longer and directly got up and left the room.</p><p></p><p>Outside, he found that attendant and spent 200 low-grade spirit stones to purchase the Beast Compendium.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a little while and seeing that Lin Changqing had not come down yet, Chu Ning decided to wander around the Yunhai Pavilion. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's main focus now was talisman crafting and spirit plant cultivation, so naturally he looked more at those two areas.</p><p></p><p>In the talisman selling area, Chu Ning saw some low-top grade talismans and even mid-grade talismans.</p><p></p><p>But for now, Chu Ning did not have any need for talismans of that level. </p><p></p><p>He also looked at those low-mid grade talismans, and there were indeed many varieties.</p><p></p><p>However, in terms of talisman quality, they could not compare to the ones he drew himself.</p><p></p><p>This made Chu Ning feel a slight sense of pride in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Just talking about talisman quality, truly no one could compare to the ones he made.</p><p></p><p>In the end, besides buying ten boxes of talisman ink, he did not buy anything else.</p><p></p><p>When he turned to the spirit plant selling area, Chu Ning's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Yunhai Pavilion, there were quite a few spirit plants that he had only seen in the jade slips provided by He Changfeng before, but had never actually encountered.</p><p></p><p>He could not help but look at them carefully.</p><p></p><p>After walking a short distance, Chu Ning stopped in front of a spirit plant about a foot tall with thin, long leaves.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, an attendant came forward to introduce it to him.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator, this is the Iron Stem Orchid, which our Yunhai Pavilion introduced from other mountain ranges.</p><p></p><p>This spirit plant can be used directly in medicine, and is one of the excellent auxiliary medicinal materials for refining body strengthening and qi/blood nourishing pills.</p><p></p><p>And if someone is willing to cultivate it carefully and spend some time, it has a chance of producing Iron Orchid Fruits.</p><p></p><p>These Iron Orchid Fruits are excellent body tempering spirit medicines."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not show any change of expression due to the attendant's words.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Revolutions Body Refining Art he cultivated was different from current body refining techniques, and did not really need external assistance for body tempering.</p><p></p><p>So the so-called body tempering effect of the Iron Orchid Fruits was not something Chu Ning cared about.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning had previously learned about another characteristic of this spirit plant from the jade slips provided by He Changfeng, which made him very interested.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, that attendant continued introducing it.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, cultivating the Iron Stem Orchid requires absorbing a large amount of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Although it absorbs spiritual energy quickly, if it is in a place lacking spiritual energy, the cultivation time will be very long.</p><p></p><p>And whether it produces Iron Orchid Fruits is completely a matter of probability, and currently there is no known method to help it bear fruit.</p><p></p><p>This is also something that needs to be made clear to you, Fellow Cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly, as he was already aware of this information.</p><p></p><p>The Iron Stem Orchid absorbed a lot of spiritual energy, which was precisely the reason Chu Ning had stopped here.</p><p></p><p>In his backyard courtyard, what he needed were spirit plants that absorbed spiritual energy in large and fast quantities.</p><p></p><p>He had to know that by using the Green Wood Evergreen Art to aid his cultivation of the Green Wood Longevity Art, the more spiritual energy the spirit plants absorbed, the greater the benefits to his cultivation would be.</p><p></p><p>He had previously planned to plant some spirit plants in one of the two backyard courtyards at the Yan Collective to assist his cultivation of the Green Wood Longevity Art.</p><p></p><p>However, the few types of seeds he had brought from the sect were not very suitable.</p><p></p><p>The Green Spirit Fruits he was currently growing were just barely enough.</p><p></p><p>After all, normally the faster and greater the spiritual energy absorption of a spirit plant, the more precious it was.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the higher quality of the spirit plant, the higher the requirements like planting spacing and so on.</p><p></p><p>This Iron Stem Orchid was not very expensive because whether it produced the Iron Orchid Fruits was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning saw that the listed price here was twenty spirit stones per plant.</p><p></p><p>And Chu Ning had read in the previous jade slips that this Iron Stem Orchid could even be planted very densely.</p><p></p><p>Of course, correspondingly, the quality would also be affected.</p><p></p><p>But for Chu Ning, these were not major issues.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning immediately asked the attendant, "How many of these Iron Stem Orchids do you have here?"</p><p></p><p>The attendant was slightly stunned, then replied, "Around 50 plants or so."</p><p></p><p>"50 plants, one thousand spirit stones." After some mental calculations, Chu Ning asked again, "Do you sell seeds for the Iron Stem Orchid?"</p><p></p><p>The attendant shook his head, "This Iron Stem Orchid is also not a spirit plant native to our Qingxia mountain range, so our pavilion does not have the seeds currently."</p><p></p><p>"However, if Fellow Cultivator has need, our pavilion can help collect them on your behalf."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning's brow furrowed slightly as he gritted his teeth and asked, "If I buy all 50 of these Iron Stem Orchid plants, can we negotiate the price?"</p><p></p><p>"Buying all 50 plants together?" The attendant's eyes lit up, pondered for a moment, then said to Chu Ning, "If it's all 50 Iron Stem Orchid plants together, I can apply to the pavilion for 19 spirit stones per plant."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "Good, help me get these 50 Iron Stem Orchid plants."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the attendant's smile widened, "Please wait a moment, Fellow Cultivator, I'll go get them right away."</p><p></p><p>After a short while, he came back carrying two large jade boxes.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow Cultivator, all 50 Iron Stem Orchid plants have been placed in these two jade boxes.  </p><p></p><p>If used for medicine, they can be stored in these jade boxes for some time without issue.</p><p></p><p>However, if used for planting, they must be planted within ten days, otherwise it will be difficult for them to survive."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded to indicate he understood, took the two jade boxes, and handed 950 spirit stones to the other party.</p><p></p><p>The attendant accepted the 950 spirit stones with a continued smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"If Fellow Cultivator obtains any Iron Orchid Fruits from cultivating these Iron Stem Orchids, you can also bring them to our Yunhai Pavilion to sell.</p><p></p><p>Our Yunhai Pavilion offers high prices for all kinds of treasures..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning neither confirmed nor denied it with a nod.</p><p></p><p>He did not know if the prices this Yunhai Pavilion offered for purchases were high or not, but the things they sold were certainly not cheap.</p><p></p><p>In just half a day's time, he had spent over 2,800 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The talismans had been selling so well recently that he had used up a large portion of his spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning did not choose to wander around any longer and directly went downstairs to wait for Lin Changqing.</p><p></p><p>After a short while, the entire auction dispersed and the Qi Condensation cultivators left one after another.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning waited for about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea before Lin Changqing finally came down from upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Observing his expression, although his face was still cold, there was a hint of a faint smile at the corners of his eyes, indicating he had also gained quite a bit from this trip.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning, Lin Changqing casually asked, "Did you get all your things?"</p><p></p><p>"I got them."</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning's reply, Lin Changqing did not ask any further and simply nodded, "Then let's go back."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing did not inquire about what exactly Chu Ning had bought at this auction, and on the return journey he still allowed Chu Ning to ride on his flying boat.</p><p></p><p>After over an hour, the two returned to the Yan Collective once more.</p><p></p><p>After letting Chu Ning off outside the shop, Lin Changqing then guided his boat away.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning went back into the shop, first running to the backyard courtyard to take a look, and saw that Little White was there.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As expected, it was still sleeping soundly in the backyard, so he felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>After glancing at Chu Ning, Ling Xiaobai also continued to sleep soundly. </p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning didn't bother with him and started fiddling with the things he had bought from Yunhai Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Zhuifeng Shuo, this flying magic tool that Chu Ning had purchased for the first time at such a high price.</p><p></p><p>It was about five feet long, with pointed ends, and the widest part in the middle was about two and a half feet wide. </p><p></p><p>Whether standing or sitting on it, there was enough space.</p><p></p><p>Although the price was a bit expensive, when Chu Ning thought about being able to fly in the sky with a magic tool instead of using wind manipulation every time, he still had a slight sense of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow when I go to the Ling Field, I can try it out."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning did not take out the jade slip of the Illusory Transformation Spell, but first took out the two jade boxes filled with Iron Stem Orchids.</p><p></p><p>These Iron Stem Orchids cost 20 spirit stones each, which was undoubtedly the most precious spirit plant that Chu Ning had ever cultivated so far.</p><p></p><p>In fact, as a spirit medicine, this thing itself was not meant for mass cultivation like ordinary spirit plants.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Chu Ning who needed to cultivate, at this moment, it had the same value as ordinary spirit plants in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning found a relatively spacious place and took out the Iron Stem Orchids one by one to start planting them.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning planted them very densely, leaving a space in the middle for sitting cross-legged within a circle of less than 2 zhang.</p><p></p><p>The outer area was then filled with two circular rings of 50 Iron Stem Orchids.</p><p></p><p>After all the Iron Stem Orchids were planted, Chu Ning directly used his magic to cast the Sweet Dew Spell.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, his ordinary Sweet Dew Spell still couldn't be cast instantly until now.</p><p></p><p>But it was enough.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning instantly cast the Green Wood Spring Spell, enveloping the 50 Iron Stem Orchids.</p><p></p><p>After one cast of the Green Wood Spring Spell, the Iron Stem Orchids showed no reaction, so Chu Ning continued casting.</p><p></p><p>One after another, a total of thirty casts of the Green Wood Spring Spell later, Chu Ning finally stopped.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a hint of delight on his face, he looked at the Iron Stem Orchids.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he only knew that the Iron Stem Orchids had high requirements for absorbing spiritual energy, but he didn't have a very clear concept.</p><p></p><p>Now, after casting the Green Wood Spring Spell, Chu Ning suddenly had a more intuitive understanding.</p><p></p><p>These Iron Stem Orchids absorbed spiritual energy even better than the Blood Persimmon Trees he encountered during the assessment in Area C.</p><p></p><p>However, because the Blood Persimmon Trees had thick trunks after growing up, they needed to be planted at a greater distance apart.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's backyard could only accommodate about two of them.</p><p></p><p>So although one tree could absorb a lot of spiritual energy, the number that could be planted was too small, which meant that cultivating the Green Wood Spring Spell would not be very effective for Chu Ning in the short term.</p><p></p><p>This was also the reason why Chu Ning had never considered planting the Blood Persimmon Trees.</p><p></p><p>But now, these tiny Iron Stem Orchids were able to absorb so much spiritual energy with the help of the Green Wood Spring Spell, which made Chu Ning both surprised and delighted.</p><p></p><p>After a few days, when these Iron Stem Orchids grew normally, and he cast the Green Wood Spring Spell again to aid his cultivation, Chu Ning could imagine that the effect would far surpass that of other spirit plants before.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ling Xiaobai was also awakened by the commotion of Chu Ning's spellcasting.</p><p></p><p>After looking at the Iron Stem Orchids, it actually let out a "wu" sound towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this "wu" sound, Chu Ning was stunned for a moment, until Ling Xiaobai expressed "want to eat" with its spiritual sense, and he finally realized.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and asked, "You want to eat the fruit that grows from these Iron Stem Orchids?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai let out another "wu" sound, which could be taken as an answer.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled and shook his head, "I want it to grow some fruit too, but the key is for it to be able to grow them first."</p><p></p><p>No matter the jade slip given by He Changfeng before or the attendant at Yunhai Pavilion, they had all mentioned that the Iron Stem Orchid flowering and bearing fruit was a matter of probability.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it wouldn't be called the Iron Stem Orchid, but would be directly called the Iron Orchid Fruit.</p><p></p><p>If improving the quality could help it bear the Iron Orchid Fruit, Chu Ning had absolute confidence in his Green Wood Spring Spell.</p><p></p><p>But for such a random, unpredictable event, Chu Ning could only hope that he was a child of good fortune.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's words, Ling Xiaobai blinked its cute little eyes and started circling around the ring of Iron Stem Orchids.</p><p></p><p>Then, to Chu Ning's astonishment, it simply lifted its leg and urinated.</p><p></p><p>"I was planning to cultivate in there, couldn't you hold it and go somewhere else? Even peeing on the Jade Orchid Tree would be better than here."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at Ling Xiaobai in exasperation, but the latter only let out a "wu" sound towards him.</p><p></p><p>Then, it walked away on its own and lay down again, seemingly ready to sleep some more.</p><p></p><p>"I hope your little urine won't harm these spirit plants."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could only shake his head helplessly and ignore it, leaving the backyard directly.</p><p></p><p>As he cooked the spirit rice, Chu Ning also checked the jade slip of the Thousand Beast Illustrations that he had bought from Yunhai Pavilion today.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, it recorded a lot of information about demonic beasts and spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Not only were there textual descriptions, but there were also lifelike illustrations.</p><p></p><p>Since he only wanted to see if there was any information about Ling Xiaobai, Chu Ning browsed through it very quickly.</p><p></p><p>But after browsing through the entire jade slip, Chu Ning was a little disappointed and put it down.</p><p></p><p>This Thousand Beast Illustrations did have a lot of information recorded about spirit beasts and demonic beasts, but after going through the entire jade slip, Chu Ning didn't find any records related to Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>"However, this jade slip does have a lot of classifications for the levels of spirit beasts and demonic beasts."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning held the jade slip, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>According to this jade slip, there was actually not much distinction between spirit beasts and demonic beasts in the current cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators were accustomed to calling the ones they raised spirit beasts, while those living in the wild were called demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, in ancient times, only those with special spiritual powers that accompanied the heavens and earth were called spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>And these spirit beasts, once they grew a little, generally could reach the sixth level or above.</p><p></p><p>The levels of spirit beasts and demonic beasts were equivalent to cultivators at the Golden Dan stage.</p><p></p><p>But even at the sixth level or above, if they didn't have special talents, they could only be called demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>However, as those heavenly and earthly spirit beasts dwindled, the terminology gradually changed as well.</p><p></p><p>And spirit beasts with special spiritual powers were now called ancient spirit beasts in the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these introductions about spirit beasts and demonic beasts, this Thousand Beast Illustrations also had quite a few descriptions of demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>It allowed Chu Ning to gain a more comprehensive understanding of demonic beasts for the first time.</p><p></p><p>Although the levels of these demonic beasts were generally below the fifth level, with only a few at the sixth level, Chu Ning didn't feel that the 200 spirit stones were not worth it.</p><p></p><p>It was just that he was a little disappointed that he couldn't find any relevant information about Ling Xiaobai.</p><p></p><p>However, since Ling Xiaobai had been here for a day or two, and Chu Ning hadn't noticed any major issues, he wasn't in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>If he had the chance in the future, he would try to find some higher-level books about spirit beasts and demonic beasts.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had a feeling that this Ling Xiaobai seemed a bit extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>But its level was indeed very low, which was quite strange.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

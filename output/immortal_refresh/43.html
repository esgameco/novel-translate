            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>As the spiritual fruit entered his mouth, Chu Ning immediately felt his mouth watering. </p><p></p><p>A rich spiritual energy enveloped his entire oral cavity.</p><p></p><p>As he slowly chewed, the fruit juice entered his stomach. </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a surge of hot energy gushed up from his dantian, flowing towards his limbs and entire body.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, this surge of heat abruptly became extremely intense. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning only felt his body becoming scorching hot, with his skin, muscles and bones all feeling a burning sensation, as if his blood was about to ignite.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, Chu Ning felt his consciousness becoming somewhat blurred, as though he could be overwhelmed by the tidal wave of heat at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The effect of this Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit on the body is so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the surging energy within his body that seemed about to burst out, he dared not let this unrestrained energy run rampant in his body.</p><p></p><p>He immediately began practicing the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique in the relatively spacious backyard.</p><p></p><p>Although he had cultivated it countless times before, Chu Ning had never felt it as difficult as this time.</p><p></p><p>The searing heat made every inch of his body feel like it was being torn apart. </p><p></p><p>It was as if with every movement, his entire being would split open.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning finished one set of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, his body was already drenched in sweat.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, the surging heat within his body was still extremely ferocious.</p><p></p><p>However, what made Chu Ning slightly gratified was that some of that heat had been expended.</p><p></p><p>Continue!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning unhesitatingly continued practicing.</p><p></p><p>Set after set.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Chu Ning felt the burning sensation gradually subsiding.</p><p></p><p>And his body became increasingly unobstructed.</p><p></p><p>He did not know how many sets he had practiced.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>Until at a certain moment, Chu Ning suddenly felt some kind of shackle within his body being broken open.</p><p></p><p>The burning sensation completely disappeared, and his body became exceptionally light and transparent.</p><p></p><p>"Phew!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning exhaled deeply, finally stopping his cultivation, his gaze also becoming exceptionally bright.</p><p></p><p>It could be seen that with a casual clench of his fist, his entire skin took on an ancient bronze hue.</p><p></p><p>When he lightly flicked it with one finger, it even seemed to produce a faint ringing sound.</p><p></p><p>And when he relaxed his hand, all his skin returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could feel that his body still contained the medicinal effects of the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit.</p><p></p><p>However, it would no longer affect his normal cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"When this Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit was auctioned off, they said it would be effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators refining their bodies, and it seems that was true.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing I realized quickly, and that I was practicing the ancient Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, otherwise my body might not have been able to withstand the potency of the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit."</p><p></p><p>Recalling this, Chu Ning felt a bit of lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>He had been somewhat reckless at the time.</p><p></p><p>However, the result was undoubtedly also something that made Chu Ning extremely gratified.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness swiftly descended into his sea of consciousness, and his cultivation progress immediately appeared before him...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The rotten skin realm was perfected, and what was refreshed was the innate divine ability of the Heavenly Pillars Fist. </p><p></p><p>According to the ancient texts, this was originally an innate divine ability that came with the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>"So the innate abilities I refreshed and the cultivation content I practiced are closely related."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning vaguely felt that if he continued cultivating the qi refining method, what might be refreshed could be cultivation innate abilities similar to the spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>As for body refining methods, what would likely be refreshed were innate divine abilities like the Heavenly Pillars Fist.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning checked the complete information about the Heavenly Pillars Fist in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Pillars Fist was a close-combat divine secret technique specifically for body cultivators. It could utilize one's own yuan qi to drive the spiritual forces of heaven and earth, unleashing powerful and fierce attacks.</p><p></p><p>It could break through ordinary spells with defensive power below the late qi refining stage with just one punch!</p><p></p><p>If an ordinary qi refining cultivator tried to block it with their body, they would almost certainly die.</p><p></p><p>Although he had never come into contact with this divine secret technique before, at this moment,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt that it was like the catalyzing spell, the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art, and other spells he could already cast instantly.</p><p></p><p>It had completely transformed into his own innate divine ability!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that with just a thought, he could unleash a powerful and fierce punch at any time.</p><p></p><p>"I finally have another skill for self-protection!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning felt slightly more at ease about the impending danger.</p><p></p><p>In the next half day, Chu Ning practiced the Heavenly Pillars Fist twice in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Pillars Fist consumed a tremendous amount of spiritual power. Chu Ning promptly took a Recovery Pill to restore his spiritual power, keeping it at an abundant level.</p><p></p><p>Then, he reviewed all the spells and talisman arts he knew.</p><p></p><p>He was prepared for any possible danger that might arise.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had also considered whether he should go hide in the outer sect, or directly ask Zhang Yunde to come to his place.</p><p></p><p>But this thought only flashed briefly before Chu Ning dismissed it.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, you can avoid the first day, but not the fifteenth.</p><p></p><p>If the previous feeling of being watched came from Qi Chongmao, it also meant that he would naturally know if there was any movement in Chu Ning's courtyard.</p><p></p><p>If Zhang Yunde was here, the other party definitely would not show up.</p><p></p><p>And if Chu Ning went to the outer sect, he would have to return at night according to the rules.</p><p></p><p>Even if he handed over the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit to the sect, it didn't necessarily mean that Qi Chongmao would ignore him.</p><p></p><p>Unless he was just being overly paranoid, the confrontation between the two of them seemed unavoidable.</p><p></p><p>As night fell, although the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit had been picked, Chu Ning still stayed in the backyard to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Because there were many iron vine ropes here.</p><p></p><p>Soon, that familiar and extremely uncomfortable feeling of being watched appeared again.</p><p></p><p>However, this feeling only appeared for an instant before disappearing immediately, leaving Chu Ning slightly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning was puzzled, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Because at that moment, the sound of someone riding the wind and landing came from the front courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao had arrived!</p><p></p><p>The well-prepared Chu Ning immediately extended his hands, grasping a few talisman arts in each hand.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual power in his dantian surged, ready to act at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a figure appeared in the backyard under the moonlight.</p><p></p><p>Thorny Entanglement Art!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was about to unleash this spell that could bind and restrain his opponent.</p><p></p><p>But then, he suddenly felt a "weng" sound by his ear and a stinging pain in his head.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The sudden intense pain caused Chu Ning to let out a low groan of agony.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you've already picked the matured Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, haven't you?</p><p></p><p>I never would have imagined that you would actually get lucky enough to obtain such a spirit fruit."</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Qi Chongmao's voice, which normally sounded kind, now sounded extremely sinister.</p><p></p><p>"For us in the Qingxi Sect, cultivating and planting this Seven-Star Spirit Fruit is not difficult, nor is preserving it.</p><p></p><p>But this fruit is very special. Not only is its maturation period extremely short, just a few months, but it will also automatically rot and leave only the seed if it touches the soil.</p><p></p><p>If the seed is not taken out and put into a jade box within a day, even the seed will rot.</p><p></p><p>So unless there's a fortuitous opportunity, it's extremely difficult to obtain these seeds."</p><p></p><p>In Qi Chongmao's sinister voice was a hint of excitement and greed.</p><p></p><p>"But your good luck has run out, kid. This Seven-Star Spirit Fruit is all mine."</p><p></p><p>Accompanying this voice, Chu Ning saw several ice blades flying towards him!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

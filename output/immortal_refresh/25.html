        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>There was no movement. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's catalyzing technique struck the seed, but the seed did not react at all.</p><p></p><p>He was not too surprised, after all, not all seeds could be easily catalyzed. </p><p></p><p>In his previous studies about spiritual plants, Chu Ning had already known that catalyzing some spiritual plants was quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his finger technique, Chu Ning once again unleashed his catalyzing technique on the seed.</p><p></p><p>The seed still did not react, but Chu Ning did not get discouraged.</p><p></p><p>Three times, four times, five times...ten times!</p><p></p><p>It was not until after the tenth use of the catalyzing technique that Chu Ning felt signs that the seed was cracking its shell.</p><p></p><p>Eleven times, twelve times...fifteen times!</p><p></p><p>With Chu Ning's continuous casting of spells, the seed gradually cracked open bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>It was only after Chu Ning completed the fifteenth catalyzing technique that this seed finally sprouted and grew completely.</p><p></p><p>The slender seedling's stem was brown in color, and it had already grown some small branches and leaves, which were very tiny and completely green.</p><p></p><p>However, when Chu Ning looked closely, he saw that the back of those leaves had faint hints of seven-colored hues appearing!</p><p></p><p>The colors were extremely faint, flickering in and out of view. If one did not look carefully, they would not be discovered at all.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit!"</p><p></p><p>After carefully confirming it was unmistakably so, Chu Ning carefully placed the seedling into a jade box, his eyes showing a hint of excitement.</p><p></p><p>Although he was still not clear about what exactly this Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit was used for,</p><p></p><p>Just from how precious this old man Suns treated it, and the fact that he was willing to spend so many spirit stones to have Chu Ning help cultivate it,</p><p></p><p>It must absolutely be something good!</p><p></p><p>"Spirit stones, divine talisman symbols, and the Golden Sword Technique are certainly not bad for me either.</p><p></p><p>But this time, the true biggest gains are the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique and the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning silently recited in his heart, "These two things, I still need to figure them out."</p><p></p><p>After taking stock of his gains, Chu Ning began to seriously ponder the origins of this whole affair, as well as his next plans.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not know where that old codger got the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit seed from, Chu Ning had a vague guess.</p><p></p><p>That was, the person who ambushed him might be related to this thing.</p><p></p><p>It's possible that the person also knew about Chu Ning helping Old Man Sun cultivate the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit using the Green Wood Spring Blossom Technique.</p><p></p><p>For the time being, it's best not to go to the market area, as no one knows if that demonic cultivator has any accomplices.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he naturally could not go ask Old Man Sun about the cultivation method for the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit, so he could only try to inquire within the sect.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but Chu Ning also wanted to see if he could find any information about the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had rather easily obtained the Nine Oxen Forging Body Technique and the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique one after another, so there might be some information within the sect.</p><p></p><p>As for the Seven-Star Spiritual Fruit, the Green Creek Sect was quite skilled in cultivating spiritual plants, so they might have relevant cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>If there really wasn't any information, he could try going to the market area later.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that it would be time to go to the Cultivation Room in a couple of days, Chu Ning decided to inquire about it then.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with young spiritual plants like this, they could generally be stored in a jade box for seven to ten days without issue.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Chu Ning went to the mountain behind the courtyard as usual to cultivate techniques like the Thorny Vine Technique and the Rattan Armor Technique.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's current goal was to quickly master the Thorny Vine Technique and Rattan Armor Technique, transforming them into innate spirit abilities he could unleash instantly.</p><p></p><p>Apart from cultivating these two techniques, Chu Ning had also added two more techniques to his cultivation - the Driving Force Technique and the Golden Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>For the Driving Force Technique, Chu Ning used the wooden sword he had bought from Old Man Sun to practice.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if it was because he was wielding a wooden sword, but Chu Ning felt it was very natural.</p><p></p><p>Plus, despite the wooden sword's weight being quite real, its striking power was actually not bad.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had not cultivated any sword wielding arts yet, Chu Ning could use just the Driving Force Technique to wield the wooden sword and smash trees as thick as a fist.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Driving Force Technique Chu Ning was currently using could only attack in a straight line, and had no spiritual power augmentation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Chu Ning would have considered making this wooden sword striking attack an important part of his training regimen.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivating the Golden Sword Technique, it was not going smoothly at all, completely incomparable to cultivating wood-based techniques.</p><p></p><p>In fact, among all the techniques Chu Ning was currently cultivating, this Golden Sword Technique was the most difficult for him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could only approach it with the mindset of giving it a try for now. If he really could not cultivate it, he would have to give up.</p><p></p><p>After a full half-day of cultivation like this, Chu Ning suddenly felt that time seemed much tighter compared to before.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>No wonder previously in the Practice Room, Shi Yao was always unwilling to teach him more spells. Indeed, the more spells one cultivates, the more unavoidable it is to get distracted.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his innate Wood Spirit Body, allowing him exceptional talent and rapid progress in cultivating wood-based spells, he wouldn't be able to spare so much effort cultivating other types of spells.  </p><p></p><p>What surprised Chu Ning was that even before he had a chance to go to the Practice Room, someone came looking for him the very next day.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, you've decorated this courtyard quite nicely." </p><p></p><p>The plump disciplinary disciple Zhuang Yunde stepped into Chu Ning's courtyard and couldn't help but praise.</p><p></p><p>"This barbed vine is very suitable for cultivating the Thorny Spell. But to transplant so many mature and decent quality barbed vines here, Junior Brother must have put in quite some effort. Although common, those of good quality are actually quite rare."</p><p></p><p>After listening, Chu Ning responded:  </p><p></p><p>"You flatter me, Senior Brother. I just brought some in for decoration and embellishment. Being an uncultured person, I don't really appreciate flowers and plants. But this neglected barbed vine feels rather familiar to me."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't interact much with Zhuang Yunde, so he naturally left some reservation when speaking.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled without further discussing the topic, and changed the subject to ask:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, it's been almost two months since you planted the Ink Bamboo. How is its growth? Would it be convenient for me to take a look?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly stunned upon hearing this, unsure of Zhuang Yunde's intentions. </p><p></p><p>But recalling two months ago when Zhuang Yunde had specifically asked if he was interested in talisman-making, mentioning he would check on the Ink Bamboo's growth later, Chu Ning's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>He sensed Zhuang Yunde's visit was likely related to this.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Chu Ning immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it would be my honor for Senior Brother to provide guidance."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Chu Ning led Zhuang Yunde to the superior spirit field where he planted the Ink Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Just arriving at the outskirts of the Ink Bamboo field, Zhuang Yunde's eyes immediately revealed an unusual look as he quickened his pace towards the bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the main bamboo stems gradually turning from green to black, a surprised expression flashed across his face.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, the growth of your Ink Bamboo is truly impressive. In just two months, it has achieved such quality."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Zhuang Yunde gave Chu Ning a meaningful look.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Junior Brother's mastery of the Vernal Wood Invigoration Spell is quite remarkable."  </p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother flatters me," Chu Ning remained composed.</p><p></p><p>"I seem to have a slightly stronger comprehension for wood-based spells like the Vernal Wood Invigoration Spell, so I've focused most of my efforts there. As for other spells, my cultivation is merely average."</p><p></p><p>Saying that, Chu Ning casually cast a Sweet Rain Spell.</p><p></p><p>He had spent very little time and effort on this spell. Combined with his ordinary talent in water-based spells, the Sweet Rain Spell he cast was no different from, or perhaps even worse than, that of a new disciple.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the meaningful look in Zhuang Yunde's eyes faded.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Chu Ning's talent in wood-based spells from the start, he didn't think much of it and smiled:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother need not overthink it. I'm not questioning your cultivation progress, but rather thinking that our transaction may proceed."</p><p></p><p>"Transaction?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning, who was inwardly wondering if he should maintain a lower profile, was slightly surprised to hear this.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Zhuang Yunde with some confusion, who then smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother must still remember our discussion about talisman-making two months ago. </p><p></p><p>The reason I didn't continue then was because if the quality of your Ink Bamboo was poor, even with a harvest, it would likely all be submitted to the Sect, leaving none for yourself.</p><p></p><p>But now seeing the quality of your Ink Bamboo, if it continues like this, you can keep about half after submitting to the Sect."</p><p></p><p>Pausing briefly until Chu Ning nodded, he continued:</p><p></p><p>"According to the Sect's rules, you can dispose of the remaining half of the Ink Bamboo yourself. You can sell it to the Sect for spirit stones, sell it to others, or even use it to make talisman paper yourself."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde smiled at Chu Ning and said:</p><p></p><p>"So I'd like to make a deal with you, Junior Brother. I'll provide you the technique for making talisman paper. In return, you give me one-tenth of your remaining Ink Bamboo as compensation. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That night, nothing special happened. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning slept even more soundly than usual and woke up feeling refreshed and energized, which was a bit unexpected for him.</p><p></p><p>When he looked at the sky outside, Chu Ning realized he had woken up earlier than usual. </p><p></p><p>He didn't mind though, and sat cross-legged on the bed to begin practicing his Refining Spirit Technique.</p><p></p><p>His morning cultivation sequence was the opposite of the evening - first the Refining Spirit Technique, then the Evergreen Qimu Technique, and finally the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique. After that, he would have breakfast and go to the fields.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning began cultivating the Refining Spirit Technique, he was slightly surprised again. The whirlpool of spiritual sense within the Mud Pill Palace was spinning faster than usual.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't know the reason, but he knew this was a sign of faster cultivation progress. Though slightly taken aback, he immediately focused his mind and continued cultivating.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the whirlpool of spiritual sense spun faster and faster, yet smaller and smaller.</p><p></p><p>No one knows how long it took, but then:</p><p></p><p>"Drip!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning seemed to hear the sound of a liquid drop in his ear.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mud Pill Palace, all the gaseous whirlpools had disappeared, turning into a single drop of liquid.</p><p></p><p>Solidification of spiritual sense - the first step of Refining Spirit!</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Technique that Chu Ning had been cultivating recently had finally made progress at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Chu Ning felt that everything around him became clearer.</p><p></p><p>He could sense the purple flowers on the iron vines in the front and back courtyards gently swaying in the wind. He could feel the breathing of Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang in the neighboring courtyard...</p><p></p><p>Extending spiritual sense outward was also an important sign of taking the first step in Refining Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, after exiting his cultivation state, Chu Ning immediately checked his proficiency levels:</p><p></p><p>[Evergreen Qimu Technique (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), Second Layer (275/900)]</p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, First Scroll, Deathless Bones 51/600] </p><p>[Refining Spirit Technique, First Layer 11/1000]</p><p></p><p>"So it seems crossing the threshold of 10 proficiency counts as the first step," Chu Ning thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>But then he couldn't help clicking his tongue, realizing that if just taking the first step was so difficult at only 10 proficiency, to fully cultivate the first layer would require a whopping 1000 proficiency.</p><p></p><p>The road ahead was arduous indeed!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then carefully contemplated the state of extending his spiritual sense outward, which seemed to reach about 2 zhang (around 6 meters).</p><p></p><p>Did that mean when the first layer of Refining Spirit was fully cultivated, his spiritual sense could only extend to 4 zhang?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning felt the Refining Spirit Technique didn't seem that powerful. But then he suddenly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>No, the book said when the first layer of Refining Spirit was fully cultivated, one's spiritual sense would double.</p><p></p><p>However, in this process of cultivating Refining Spirit, the spiritual sense itself could be strengthened.</p><p></p><p>In other words, after truly reaching full cultivation, the extension of his spiritual sense would be far more than just twice the current range.</p><p></p><p>But if it was only twice the current range, how could he possibly unleash supernatural martial skills like the Illusory Spirit Piercing?</p><p></p><p>So the effect after fully cultivating the first layer of Refining Spirit actually depended on how much his spiritual sense could be strengthened during this period.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this point, Chu Ning felt more anticipation, since his inborn spiritual sense was already close to twice as strong as others'.</p><p></p><p>According to the book's records, the effect should be even better for him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then got up from the bed, preparing to go to the courtyard to practice the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>But after taking a few steps, he suddenly stopped, realizing he might have overlooked something.</p><p></p><p>Why were the neighboring couple Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang sleeping in separate rooms?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the middle-aged couple had grown weary of each other?</p><p></p><p>Or were they worried their cultivation would interfere with each other? But that didn't seem right, since they weren't cultivating, just sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Or could it be that they weren't actually a married couple at all?</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, and Chu Ning's expression suddenly became somewhat inscrutable.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt he might be overthinking it, Chu Ning still became a bit more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Originally planning to practice the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique in the courtyard, he decided not to at this point.</p><p></p><p>Instead, after eating breakfast, he prepared to go cultivate in the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>Although the mid-grade spirit field was adjacent to the neighboring couple's field, the high-grade field for growing spirit bamboo was relatively independent, more suitable for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>What surprised Chu Ning a bit was that after he finished breakfast and left the courtyard, the neighboring couple also left their courtyard at the same time.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The two saw Chu Ning and Lu Yunfang immediately greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu is up so early too? Are you going to the fields?" </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded calmly, continuing to appear as if he didn't particularly enjoy talking, just like yesterday.</p><p></p><p>Lu Yunfang then smiled and said, "We were actually planning to visit Junior Brother Chu at noon to give you some spirit tea that we brought back from our cultivation family."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, Lu Yunfang took out a porcelain jar from her storage bag and handed it to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly stunned. After entering the sect, this was the first time he had encountered someone so courteous like in the mortal world. </p><p></p><p>However, the more courteous the other party was, the more wary Chu Ning became.</p><p></p><p>He was just a disciple at the third level of Qi Refinement, while these two were at the sixth level. Was there really a need for them to be so polite to him?</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Chu Ning didn't want to appear too blunt either, as a normal lower-level disciple wouldn't act too blunt towards higher-level disciples.</p><p></p><p>So, he hesitated and looked at them, "Senior Sister Lu, this spirit tea must be quite precious. I'm just a rough person and may not be able to appreciate it."</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing too valuable, just an ordinary quality spirit tea, probably around the same price as spirit rice."</p><p></p><p>Before Chu Ning could say anything else, Lu Yunfang directly stuffed the porcelain jar into Chu Ning's hands and continued, "Actually, I wanted to ask Junior Brother Chu about something."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning's heart skipped a beat, vaguely sensing that the other party probably wanted to ask about Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, Chu Ning said, "Thank you, Senior Sister Lu, but I'm a new disciple who hasn't been in the sect for long. I don't know what Senior Sister Lu wants to ask about, I may not be clear on it."</p><p></p><p>"Just a small matter." Lu Yufang lowered her voice, with a gossipy look on her face. </p><p></p><p>"I heard that the courtyard we're living in now used to be occupied by someone else? And then that person suddenly went missing?"</p><p></p><p>Just as expected! Hearing the other party really asking about Qi Chongmao, Chu Ning's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the one who used to live here was a Senior Brother named Qi Chongmao. </p><p></p><p>It seems like about a month ago or so, he suddenly went missing. Oh, that's right..."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning paused slightly, his gaze shifting to the two of them as he spoke, observing their expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The Enforcement Hall even sent a Foundation Establishment enforcer to investigate this matter."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke in a gossipy tone, Chu Ning's heart sank slightly.</p><p></p><p>He clearly saw that when he mentioned the Foundation Establishment enforcer from the Enforcement Hall, the expressions of the two changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Although this change was actually very minor, to Chu Ning, whose spiritual sense was more sensitive and who was intentionally observing them, he still clearly noticed it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the two concealed it extremely well, and Lu Yufang's gossipy expression even became more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>"So did the Enforcement Hall find anything?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning shook his head with an embarrassed look, "I don't know about that. When I saw that enforcer back then, I didn't dare breathe loudly, let alone ask anything."</p><p></p><p>Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang exchanged a glance, and the latter immediately said in a relaxed tone, "Since the Enforcement Hall has been involved, then there shouldn't be any issues. Otherwise, we'd be worried that the fellow cultivator might suddenly return while we're in the middle of tending the fields."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't respond and started walking towards the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Lu Yunfang pointed at the porcelain jar in Chu Ning's hand and said, "Junior Brother Chu, it's inconvenient to carry these tea leaves around. Do you want to put them back in your storage bag or leave them in your room?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning wouldn't take out his storage bag in front of the two, so he said, "I don't have a storage bag yet, I'll just leave it in my room."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then we'll head to the fields first." Lu Yunfang said, and she and Luo Hongping left directly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning reopened the courtyard gate, went in, and closed it again. The next moment, he released his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, Chu Ning's expression became even more serious.</p><p></p><p>Because he sensed that the two people who hadn't gone far were now using voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Although his spiritual sense wasn't strong enough to hear what they were saying, the fact that they had something they couldn't let others overhear, to the point of even having to use voice transmission and be wary of him, a low-level disciple, meant these two were very likely really after Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they clearly seemed afraid that the Enforcement Hall would find something out.</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning couldn't grasp the full situation, he had a vague feeling that his killing of Qi Chongmao seemed to be entangled in some trouble.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Relaxing his whole body, Chu Ning began to recall today's dangerous scene. </p><p></p><p>He was unclear who this bearded man was, but judging from the pleased expression on his face when he first saw Chu Ning, this guy most likely had been lying in wait for him.</p><p></p><p>So it's very possible that Chu Ning's frequent solo trips between the sect and the market town recently had caught the attention of this rogue cultivator. </p><p></p><p>The other party may have even seen Chu Ning go to Old Man Sun's place and knew he could earn spirit stones, so he chose to ambush him there.</p><p></p><p>It's just that this rogue cultivator obviously didn't expect that today would be Chu Ning's last trip, and that he had purchased so many talisman papers with spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning felt somewhat relieved. It's a good thing he was vigilant enough, it's a good thing he bought four talisman papers, otherwise he might have perished there today.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity the Thorn Art can't be instantly cast, otherwise I wouldn't have had to waste that body protection talisman," Chu Ning muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>That body protection talisman was mainly used to buy time for casting the Thorn Art to trap the opponent.  </p><p></p><p>But this thought had just flashed across his mind when Chu Ning shook his head again.</p><p></p><p>In fact, no matter what, he still had to use that body protection talisman.</p><p></p><p>This rogue cultivator's offensive spells were clearly much stronger than his own. The Golden Sword Art was extremely powerful, and its casting speed was faster too.</p><p></p><p>The only thing the other party seemed to lack was defensive talismans or related spells, otherwise Chu Ning couldn't have succeeded so smoothly.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, he had the Rattan Armor Art first, then the body protection talisman, enduring the opponent's Golden Sword Art three times, before finally being able to stand here safely.</p><p></p><p>Staying alive is the key to being able to attack!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning felt he should engrave this line firmly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he still needs to prioritize survival techniques, and only think about attacking afterwards.  </p><p></p><p>Remember, remember!</p><p></p><p>However, using up two talisman papers at once did make Chu Ning feel a bit of a pinch, as those cost five low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning took out what he had obtained from the bearded man.</p><p></p><p>There was only one low-grade spirit stone, which was better than nothing.</p><p></p><p>A Talisman of Agility, which could temporarily enhance the user's movement speed, was meant for escaping.</p><p></p><p>That guy didn't get a chance to use it after being trapped.</p><p></p><p>Its value was barely worth two low-grade spirit stones, which could offset Chu Ning's consumption of the Golden Sword Talisman.</p><p></p><p>Taking out two books, Chu Ning began flipping through them.</p><p></p><p>The thinner one recorded a metal-attribute spell called the Golden Sword Art, which was clearly the one that bearded man had just used.</p><p></p><p>The offensive power of this spell was considerable, and Chu Ning felt tempted at first glance.</p><p></p><p>But thinking of his poor aptitude and slow progress in cultivating spells outside the wood system, Chu Ning let out a slight sigh.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if he could practice it.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning turned to the slightly thicker book.</p><p></p><p>When he saw the title on the book, Chu Ning couldn't help being slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>The book was clearly titled 'Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual'.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual? I've been practicing the Nine Rhinos Body Tempering Art before, could these two be related?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's heart stirred, and he flipped through it eagerly.</p><p></p><p>His Nine Rhinos Body Tempering Art had the best effect before qi was circulated into the body, and still had some body improvement effects in the early qi refining stage.</p><p></p><p>But after entering the middle qi refining stage, it had no body tempering effects at all.</p><p></p><p>Yet the first line that caught Chu Ning's eyes after opening the book was: "Refine the body before refining qi."</p><p></p><p>Without further explanation, Chu Ning didn't ponder too much and continued flipping through.</p><p></p><p>"These two are really related!"</p><p></p><p>Just flipping through a few pages, Chu Ning was extremely surprised inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The body refining postures recorded in this Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual were exactly the same as the Nine Rhinos Body Tempering Art he had practiced before.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that it added the qi circulation pathways, which could leverage spiritual energy to better achieve the body refining effects.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was instantly enlightened.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"So this Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique is the mortal version of the Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual?" </p><p></p><p>Continuing to flip through, he found that the contents of this small book were far more extensive than just the Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>The first volume alone had five recordings, respectively titled Undying Skin, Unwithering Bones, Unbroken Tendons, Undying Soul, and Deathless Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>However, after the last "Deathless Golden Body", it simply said "End of Volume One."</p><p></p><p>The Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual he obtained was only the first volume. How many volumes were there in total, and what was the complete Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual like?</p><p></p><p>Obviously, there was no one to answer his question for the time being.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning was also extremely puzzled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>That was, how did this clearly wandering cultivator with a stubbly beard obtain the Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from his appearance, he didn't seem to be a body cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Although he had these doubts in his heart, Chu Ning was still very delighted. The Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual was an excellent thing for him.</p><p></p><p>During this period of time when he had been practicing various techniques, there had been no prompts on the proficiency panel in his mind. There were only the Green Wood Evergreen Skill and the Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique.</p><p></p><p>Since the Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual and the Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique were from the same lineage, was it possible that there would be a proficiency display?</p><p></p><p>With this thought in mind, Chu Ning memorized the path of qi circulation for the Undying Skin technique and immediately began practicing it.</p><p></p><p>The various movements his body was making were the Nine Ox Body Tempering Technique that Chu Ning had practiced before and was already very familiar with. What he needed to do now was simply to add the qi circulation.</p><p></p><p>There were still nine movements, but because he had added the qi circulation, in order to maintain the stability of his qi, Chu Ning's speed was much slower than before.</p><p></p><p>However, after practicing one set of body refinement movements, there was a smile on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>That long-lost feeling of his body slightly heating up and his physical constitution clearly improving had appeared once again.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning's consciousness sank into his mind, he immediately discovered that there had indeed been a slight change.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Evergreen Skill (Yellow Rank Lower Grade), Second Layer (70/900)]</p><p>[Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual, Volume One, Undying Skin 1/300]</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual really does have a proficiency level!" Chu Ning inwardly rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>Having a proficiency level meant that if he could cultivate it to perfection, he would receive a reward of an innate divine ability.</p><p></p><p>However, the Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual seemed very difficult to cultivate. The starting proficiency requirement for Undying Skin was 300.</p><p></p><p>The total proficiency requirement for the first layer of the Green Wood Evergreen Skill was only 300, corresponding to the first to third levels of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he would have to spend some time cultivating this.</p><p></p><p>But in any case, this was an extremely great gain.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the small book of the Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual, Chu Ning looked at the last item, the small jade box.</p><p></p><p>Opening this jade box, there was a black-colored seed inside.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of seed is this?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was slightly puzzled because this seed gave him a very familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, Chu Ning's eyes suddenly lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Star Spirit Fruit!!"</p><p></p><p>For nearly ten days, Chu Ning had been using the Green Wood Spring Aura technique on the Seven Star Spirit Fruit at Old Man Sun's place every day, so he was very familiar with this spirit plant.</p><p></p><p>Although this was only a seed, that familiar feeling almost directly confirmed it for Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be such a coincidence? Could it be that this bearded wanderer's attempt to intercept and kill me had something to do with this?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Recalling Old Man Sun's treasuring of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel his heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, I have to confirm whether it is the Seven Star Spirit Fruit or not. If it really is, then I've hit the jackpot!"</p><p></p><p>In fact, having obtained the Nine Profound Body Refinement Manual, Chu Ning had already hit the jackpot, but he still wanted to see what this seed was.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, Chu Ning instantly released his Catalyzing Technique onto the black seed.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

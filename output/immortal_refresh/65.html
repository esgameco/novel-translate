        <h1>Chapter 65</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning arrived at the Spiritual Cultivation Hall, and He Changyou was indeed still waiting there. </p><p></p><p>However, it was not in that main hall, but in a small room beside the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Executive He," Chu Ning cupped his hands and slightly bowed to the other party.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou slightly nodded, glanced at Chu Ning, and then went straight to the point and asked:</p><p></p><p>"Has the Talisman Pavilion already taught you the art of talisman making?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning recalled Zhuang Yunde's previous words, and with a let's-give-it-a-try attitude, he honestly said:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Executive Liao from the Talisman Pavilion gave this disciple the basic talisman making techniques inherited in the pavilion. </p><p></p><p>Additionally, he also gave this disciple a mid-grade talisman pen, some talisman ink and paper.</p><p></p><p>And he promised that after mastering these basic techniques, he would further teach this disciple the Talisman Scriptures."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning spoke with a very honest and respectful expression. When He Changyou heard about the Talisman Scriptures, he was slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning did not stop and continued:</p><p></p><p>"Besides that, he also gave this disciple five talisman scriptures, four of which are initial mid-grade, and one is an initial high-grade scripture.</p><p></p><p>Oh, Executive Liao instructed this disciple to go get more if I run out of materials, and to ask senior martial brothers if there's anything I don't understand."</p><p></p><p>After saying all this, Chu Ning appropriately showed a hint of joyful expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Just like an inexperienced disciple who had just received a great reward.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he really was like that.</p><p></p><p>Only after Zhuang Yunde's reminder did he express it more overtly.</p><p></p><p>As for He Changyou, while listening, his gaze flickered slightly.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning finished speaking, he calmly said with a calm expression:</p><p></p><p>"Your Master Liao has indeed treated you well, even promising to teach you the Talisman Scriptures.</p><p></p><p>I was thinking of helping you get some things, but it seems there's no need. The Talisman Pavilion also values your talent in talisman making greatly."</p><p></p><p>From He Changyou's words, Chu Ning did not sense anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>He was continuing to say:</p><p></p><p>"You became a disciple of the Spiritual Cultivation Hall first after joining the sect. I've seen your performance over this past year.</p><p></p><p>Although your spiritual root is lacking, you have a high affinity for wood-type cultivation methods and spells.</p><p></p><p>If you focus on cultivating wood-type methods and spells, you can still achieve something."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he paused slightly, and then continued:</p><p></p><p>"Actually, when you revealed your talent in spells during the Outer Court assessment, I already had the idea of nurturing you. This talisman competition came at just the right time.</p><p></p><p>According to the sect's convention, since you've been recognized by two halls, you can naturally become an outer court disciple.</p><p></p><p>You don't need to go to the Outer Court for now."</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning heard this, his expression changed slightly. He did not expect that before reaping the benefits Zhuang Yunde mentioned, he would first be told not to work in the fields anymore.</p><p></p><p>Although he had obtained the talisman making techniques, logically he should have decent income and resources next.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning had not forgotten that he had another important talent - the Yin Wood Spiritual Body!</p><p></p><p>He could use spiritual plants and the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art to rapidly increase his cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>He did not want to give up such a shortcut.</p><p></p><p>Not letting him work in the fields, how could that be?</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"Executive He, I've just started learning spiritual plant cultivation. I still want to continue cultivating them."</p><p></p><p>"Who said you can't cultivate them anymore?" </p><p></p><p>He Changyou looked at Chu Ning with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"I plan to find you a residence in the outer court area, where the spiritual qi is denser and more beneficial for you.</p><p></p><p>As for cultivation, you can still do it in the Outer Court. In a couple of months, some disciples will be going out and their spiritual fields will be vacated.</p><p></p><p>We can arrange for you to take over some of the better ones then."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The field. </p><p></p><p>"Wait until you reach the late Condensing Qi realm, then you can apply to the sect to cultivate in Area B."</p><p></p><p>Hearing what He Changyou said, Chu Ning finally relaxed a bit. </p><p></p><p>The person he referred to in a month's time must be some disciples with decent cultivation bases who would go on that mysterious mission like Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>"In the next month, you should focus on cultivating at your residence and improving your cultivation base and spells. Also learn talisman crafting arts. After a month, once your residence and spirit field are arranged, I'll let you know."</p><p></p><p>He Changyou continued speaking, and his gaze turned towards Chu Ning again.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Talisman Pavilion has rewarded you. Naturally, our Spirit Plant House won't be stingy either. What do you want?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde really meant what he said.</p><p></p><p>This was Chu Ning's only thought at the moment.</p><p></p><p>He originally thought that when He Changyou said he would let him reside in the outer sect and assign him a good spirit field later, that was already a decent treatment.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect the other party to actually offer extra rewards.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning appropriately showed a hint of surprise, then pretended to ponder with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>After a moment, Chu Ning raised his head again.</p><p></p><p>"Executor, I've only learned about cultivating some common spirit plants so far. My main practice has been cultivation support spells related to planting. For offensive and defensive spells, I only know basic Thorn Spell and Vine Armor Spell. I don't know if after becoming an outer sect disciple, I can learn about some other spirit plants and spells."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's words were quite modest, but He Changyou also knew that Chu Ning actually wanted something.</p><p></p><p>After pondering briefly, he waved his hand and took out two jade slips from his storage bag. Chu Ning's gaze immediately became fixated on them.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou then handed one of the jade slips to Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Plant Treasure Manual. It records the cultivation methods and effects of most commonly used spirit plants. It also contains knowledge about some rarer spirit plants and spirit medicines, with most of their planting and cultivation methods included."</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Chu Ning immediately took it.</p><p></p><p>Last time, Zhuang Yunde had brought him a jade slip that also introduced spirit plants. However, that one was mostly just introductions with only a few cultivation techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that the jade slip He Changyou had would be more comprehensive.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou then picked up the other jade slip and handed it to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"This is a set of initial advanced-grade wood-element offensive spells called the Azure Wood Sword Manual. It's very suitable for disciples who have cultivated the Green Wood Spring Blossom Art to practice."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He had actually wanted to cultivate a more offensive spell.</p><p></p><p>The Thorn Spell did have binding abilities, but its attack power was too weak.</p><p></p><p>Previously, he had obtained a copy of the initial intermediate-grade Golden Sword Art from Old Luo, but after practicing it for a while without much progress, he gave up.</p><p></p><p>Now, He Changyou had actually brought out a set of initial advanced-grade offensive spells, which undoubtedly delighted Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning quickly took it and said with a bow, "Many thanks, Executor!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning spoke these words very sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Although there was Zhuang Yunde's previous hint, being able to obtain such good things from He Changyou all at once still greatly surprised Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you can go back first. I'll notify you once the sect has made arrangements."</p><p></p><p>After He Changyou said this, Chu Ning thanked him again before leaving.</p><p></p><p>He had obtained quite a few good things today and needed to go digest them properly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

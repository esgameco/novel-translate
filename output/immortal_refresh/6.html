        <h1>Chapter 6</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had already read through the general content of the Qingmu Changchun Gong before, but at this time, he still took out the small book and carefully read through the key points of cultivating this technique several times again.</p><p></p><p>After ensuring he was fully familiar with all the essentials of the breathing meditation, Chu Ning put down the small book. </p><p></p><p>He slightly closed his eyes and began to sense the existence of spiritual energy according to the technique.</p><p></p><p>For a mortal to enter the ranks of cultivators, the first step is to absorb spiritual energy into the body, officially entering the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>To achieve this step, one must first sense spiritual energy, and then further distinguish and sense the wood-attributed spiritual energy from the sensed energies.</p><p></p><p>Whether sensing spiritual energy or absorbing it into the body is related to one's innate aptitude, which is tied to one's spiritual root. The higher grade one's spiritual root, the easier it is to accomplish this step.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had a pseudo-spiritual root of four attributes. Under normal circumstances, it would not be easy for him to achieve this step. Just this single step alone often requires several days.  </p><p></p><p>For those with even poorer aptitudes, it could very likely take ten days, half a month, or even a full month.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, after Chu Ning closed his eyes, slowly calmed his mind, and entered an profound state, he sensed the faint spiritual energy around him in just a short while.</p><p></p><p>Among these energies, a strand of green wood-attributed spiritual energy stood out prominently in his perception.</p><p></p><p>"Is this already sensing spiritual energy?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was astonished in his heart, almost breaking out of the cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he promptly reined in his mind and maintained the state.</p><p></p><p>Originally intending to just sense spiritual energy first, Chu Ning subconsciously proceeded to the next step upon feeling that distinct wood-attributed spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing energy into the body!</p><p></p><p>Following the incantations of the Qingmu Changchun Gong, Chu Ning regulated his breathing exhalations and inhalations.</p><p></p><p>The stray spiritual energies around Chu Ning quickly became ordered. A strand of wood-attributed spiritual energy separated from the surroundings and followed Chu Ning's breathing to enter his body.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning effortlessly accomplished absorbing energy into his body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, however, Chu Ning did not dwell on these thoughts. His mind was completely focused on cultivation as he guided this strand of energy along his meridians into his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy washed over his meridians, strengthening them. In the end, only an extremely faint trace of spiritual energy entered the dantian.</p><p></p><p>Originally empty, the bottom of Chu Ning's dantian now had a wisp of extremely diluted spiritual energy drifting within.</p><p></p><p>Afterward, more and more spiritual energy continued to flow in.</p><p></p><p>When these wisps of spiritual energy condensed into a strand of power settling in the dantian, Chu Ning's body trembled slightly as he exited the cultivation state.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning knew it was because his mind power was insufficient to continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not feel the slightest regret.</p><p></p><p>He could clearly sense the changes within his dantian just now, allowing him to understand his current cultivation state clearly.</p><p></p><p>Refining Qi into the body! First level of Qi Refining!</p><p></p><p>He had actually completed absorbing qi into his body and officially entered the first level of Qi Refining on his very first attempt at cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Looking again at the timekeeping hourglass in the room, it had only taken about an hour.</p><p></p><p>"Even those with a Heavenly Spiritual Root probably couldn't do better than this. Is this the talent of the Unicorn Wood Spiritual Body?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sighed inwardly, then checked the cultivation progress in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Gong (Yellow Rank Lower-Grade), First Layer (1/300)]</p><p></p><p>Just this single cultivation had increased his proficiency by 1 point.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning would not think this meant the Qingmu Changchun Gong was easier than the Nine Unicorn Body Refining Art.  There was naturally only one reason for this.</p><p></p><p>The Unicorn Wood Spiritual Body!</p><p></p><p>"This innate talent is truly formidable!" Chu Ning inwardly exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the other function of the Unicorn Wood Spiritual Body - "The wood-attributed spiritual energy cultivated can conceal probing, allowing one to reveal the strength of one's spiritual energy at will" - Chu Ning quickly discovered he could control the aura of his spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the aura of the first level of Qi Refining could be completely...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He restrained himself, appearing as an ordinary person again. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's gaze became exceptionally bright. This innate talent was too miserly ah!</p><p></p><p>It was perfect for his current identity as a servant disciple. If he completed Body Refinement in just one day, people would know he had a secret. </p><p></p><p>After all, for a false spirit root disciple to complete Body Refinement in a single day was a bit too shocking.</p><p></p><p>"Over these days, it's more stable to observe the person's cultivation progress first, then reveal the aura of having completed the first layer of Body Refinement in due time."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made up his mind, tidied up the small book, and then slept soundly.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because he had cultivated the technique, although he had slept quite late the previous night, Chu Ning woke up energetic early the next morning.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Chu Ning did not choose to cultivate the Qingmu Changchun Gong again, but instead practiced the Nine Oxen Tempering Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't know if Cao Dongxin would make him do something again, and he didn't want to be interrupted while cultivating the Qingmu Changchun Gong. The Nine Oxen Tempering Body Technique took less time and could be stopped at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He had already mastered the Nine Oxen Tempering Body Technique, but Chu Ning also found that after going through the set, his body still felt more refreshed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems this Nine Oxen Tempering Body Technique can be practiced further," Chu Ning thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he vaguely heard the "creaking" sound of a door opening, knowing it was Cao Dongxin coming out of his room. He hurriedly opened his door and went out as well.</p><p></p><p>"Good morning, Senior Martial Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Although he already knew Cao Dongxin's eccentric personality, Chu Ning was still very polite to him, after all, he would have to follow him for the next three months.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning, Cao Dongxin gave a cold snort.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, get up half a period earlier every day and prepare breakfast."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Martial Brother." Chu Ning didn't say much more and agreed directly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go make breakfast now."</p><p></p><p>However, Cao Dongxin then said, "No need, we're going to the fields now."</p><p></p><p>Not eating breakfast? Chu Ning's thoughts turned, realizing the other party had likely eaten something in the room already.</p><p></p><p>It's a good thing he was prepared, otherwise he would have gone hungry.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning took out two fried bread pancakes, which he had specially bought from Qingxi City and brought with him over the past two days. These dry fried bread pancakes kept well and wouldn't spoil if left for a while. He had bought twenty of them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning take out the fried bread pancakes, Cao Dongxin's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pretended not to notice and smiled at him, "Would Senior Martial Brother like one?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin didn't say a word and headed straight out of the courtyard. Chu Ning munched on the bread as he followed him.</p><p></p><p>After walking about a mile, Cao Dongxin stopped in front of a field.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at this field and saw it was filled with a kind of pale red grain. He couldn't help but wonder greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be spirit rice?"</p><p></p><p>He wanted to ask Cao Dongxin, but thinking of the other party's personality, he would probably not get an answer even if he asked, so he didn't bother opening his mouth.</p><p></p><p>If there was anything to do, the other party would definitely say so.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled Chu Ning was that Cao Dongxin only sat at the edge of the field, not doing or saying anything.</p><p></p><p>And he just sat there for half a period of time.</p><p></p><p>This... could it be that he was deliberately not giving Chu Ning time to cultivate?</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning couldn't help but speculate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of conversation gradually came over. Chu Ning turned his head to look.</p><p></p><p>It was the talkative Senior Martial Brother Shang Zhaoxiang who lived next door, and beside him was the new disciple Qiu Shunyi who had entered together with Chu Ning yesterday.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning saw them, they also saw Chu Ning and Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>Shang Zhaoxiang spoke first, "Yo, Old Cao, you're here so early again today?"</p><p></p><p>His tone had a somewhat teasing quality.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

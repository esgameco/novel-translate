        <h1>Chapter 40</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>After everyone responded in agreement, Elder Chen's gaze swept around the group. </p><p></p><p>His eyes eventually fell on Yuan Guang and Chu Ning for a moment, before settling on Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this gaze, Chu Ning's heart immediately felt a tinge of nervousness.</p><p></p><p>His actual cultivation had already reached the fifth level of Refining Qi, but he intentionally used the innate abilities of his Yin Wood Spirit Body to display a cultivation level of only the third level of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>Previously, no one had discovered this.  </p><p></p><p>But could it be that this Elder Chen, who was rumored to be a truly mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator, had noticed something from his gaze?</p><p></p><p>"As disciples of the Spirit Plant House, it's not bad that you two have advanced to the third level of Refining Qi in nearly a year," Elder Chen said slowly.</p><p></p><p>This allowed Chu Ning to breathe a slight sigh of relief, while also inwardly marveling at the incredible power of the Yin Wood Spirit Body's innate abilities.  </p><p></p><p>A mid-Foundation Establishment cultivator was completely unable to detect his actions.</p><p></p><p>As Elder Chen spoke, he continued looking at Chu Ning with a slightly surprised expression:</p><p></p><p>"You cultivate the Green Wood Everspring Skill too, right? Your spiritual energy is so pure, it's quite unexpected."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning hurriedly cupped his fists and replied:  </p><p></p><p>"In response to the Elder, I was previously told by the sect's instructors and servant disciples that I may be particularly suited to this wood-type skill."</p><p></p><p>"What about wood-type spells? Are there any you can cast instantly?" Elder Chen asked another question.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's thoughts raced, and he answered:</p><p></p><p>"I'm also quite suited to them. I can cast the Catalyzing Spell and Purification Spell instantly, but the Green Wood Spring Bloom Spell is just a bit short."</p><p></p><p>His words were half-truth, half-falsehood. In fact, he could also cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Spell instantly.  </p><p></p><p>However, considering he had only joined the sect for nearly a year, if he revealed he could instantly cast even the Green Wood Spring Bloom Spell, it might seem too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had not forgotten that previously, Shang Zhaoxiang had told him that the sect had far fewer servant disciples in recent years, as many were selected to go on some missions outside.  </p><p></p><p>Although he only said the sect was currently arranging for those above the sixth level of Refining Qi, there was no guarantee there wouldn't be other circumstances.</p><p></p><p>If he displayed abilities in wood-type spells that were too extraordinarily heaven-defying, would he also be selected?</p><p></p><p>Before fully understanding what exactly these selected disciples were tasked with, Chu Ning did not want to take that risk.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, even so, Elder Chen still nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Very good! You should practice the Green Wood Spring Bloom Spell more, it's very beneficial for cultivating spirit plants."  </p><p></p><p>"Yes, Elder," Chu Ning responded.</p><p></p><p>After that, Elder Chen did not say anything more, but the other people on the spirit boat looked at Chu Ning with rather complex expressions.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi and Lv Xingyu's gazes contained quite a bit of delight.</p><p></p><p>As for the few around Yuan Guang, after glancing at Yuan Guang and then at Chu Ning, many revealed looks of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>After all, from the conversation between Chu Ning and Elder Chen, they realized that Chu Ning's current cultivation was clearly much higher than Yuan Guang's.</p><p></p><p>At least among those who often spent time together, they did not know of any spell Yuan Guang could cast instantly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Elder Chen from the Instruction Hall even said Chu Ning's spiritual energy was extremely pure.</p><p></p><p>This left those like Chen Youdao, who had always thought Chu Ning was being overambitious in cultivating the Ink Spirit Bamboo and that his cultivation was far behind Yuan Guang's, utterly astonished and dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuan Guang, his expression was extremely awkward at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In fact, ever since learning that Chu Ning had been recommended as a student cultivator by Zhuang Yunde, he had already vaguely guessed that Chu Ning's cultivation was higher than his own.</p><p></p><p>Now, Elder Chen's words in front of everyone had undoubtedly stripped away his fig leaf.</p><p></p><p>However, regardless of Qiu Shunyi, Yuan Guang, Chen Youdao, or the others, no one would say anything in front of Elder Chen.</p><p></p><p>But along this journey, the way everyone looked at Chu Ning had changed significantly.  </p><p></p><p>Even Chen Youdao and the others no longer had the mocking or ridiculing looks they previously gave Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>The spirit boat traveled swiftly, and in just a short while, they arrived at the mountain gate.  </p><p></p><p>Elder Chen let Chu Ning and the others off.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Then the spiritual boat disappeared instantly on the horizon. </p><p></p><p>As soon as Elder Chen left, Qiu Shunyi immediately turned to Chu Ning with a surprised look and asked, "Chu Ning, you can actually cast several spells instantly!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and there are two more spells," Lv Xingyu chimed in.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, have you also mastered the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique? I just learned it not long ago."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning smiled slightly, "It's just that the wood-element inner cultivation method happens to be very compatible with spells."</p><p></p><p>Watching the three converse, Yuan Guang's face twitched slightly. </p><p></p><p>Chen Youdao, who had been standing beside Yuan Guang, hesitated, as if wanting to join and say something to Chu Ning, but looked somewhat embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, another voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning? Oh, you all are here too?"</p><p></p><p>It was Zhuang Yunde who happened to be passing by the mountain gate and inquired.</p><p></p><p>As they were all from the Spiritual Vegetation House's Ding District, everyone naturally recognized Zhuang Yunde and greeted him.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde had a good temper and returned the greetings, then asked Chu Ning, "Did you just return from the market? Oh right, Mu Ling told me earlier to ask if you bought the things she asked you for? She tried to reach you with a voice transmission talisman this morning, but you weren't home."</p><p></p><p>"I bought them, I'll deliver them now," Chu Ning replied.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhuang Yunde nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you can go. She lives at Outer Gate Number 32, you can go find her directly."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning immediately turned and headed towards the inner gate, going in the direction of the outer gate.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Zhuang Yunde went with the others from the Spiritual Vegetation House towards the spiritual fields.</p><p></p><p>After a few steps, Chen Youdao couldn't help but ask, "Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, can that Chu...Senior Brother enter the outer gate by himself?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he can," Zhuang Yunde said matter-of-factly. </p><p></p><p>"He was recommended to study at the Academy of a Hundred Arts, so he has two or three chances each month to enter and exit the outer gate."</p><p></p><p>"He was recommended to study at the Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang, what is Senior Brother Chu studying?"</p><p></p><p>Except for Yuan Guang, the others were just learning about this for the first time, so they curiously asked.</p><p></p><p>"Making talisman papers," Zhuang Yunde didn't hide it and casually answered, then looked at everyone with some surprise. </p><p></p><p>"Oh, you didn't know?"</p><p></p><p>They all shook their heads, but after hearing that Chu Ning was learning to make talisman papers, they could roughly guess a few things.</p><p></p><p>Only Chen Youdao still wasn't convinced and asked, "Then is his yield of spirit ink bamboo not bad?"</p><p></p><p>It was then that Zhuang Yunde finally seemed to realize something, giving Yuan Guang and Chen Youdao a meaningful look, then smiled and said, "Chu Ning has already learned to make talisman papers, what do you think about his spirit ink bamboo yield?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone immediately understood the implication behind his words. Recalling how they had invited Chu Ning to see Yuan Guang's purple yam fruits, their faces showed great embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuan Guang, he was so embarrassed that he wanted to dig his toes into the ground.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde left first without saying much more to them. Yuan Guang also didn't linger, leaving in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning was unaware of all this, adhering to the principle of low-key development. He hadn't actively told anyone about being recommended as a student of the arts.</p><p></p><p>After parting from the group, he hurried to the outer gate.</p><p></p><p>He handed 1000 talisman papers to Mu Ling and received 22 spirit stones from her to purchase talisman papers for next month. Then he quickly rushed back to his courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Ever since learning how precious the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was, he couldn't stop worrying about it.</p><p></p><p>After all, there wasn't much time left before the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit would be fully ripe for harvesting.</p><p></p><p>Still some distance from his courtyard, Chu Ning saw a figure standing outside his gate from afar.</p><p></p><p>He quickened his pace.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

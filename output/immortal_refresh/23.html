        <h1>Chapter 23</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning flew through the wind for a while, and found it inconvenient to hold this wooden sword in his hand. </p><p></p><p>This thing, if not infused with spiritual power, was a bit too heavy, somewhat affecting his wind-traveling technique. </p><p></p><p>But infusing it with spiritual power would also disperse his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had tried before - after consecutively casting the Green Wood Spring Blossom Technique 10 times, his spiritual power could barely sustain him until he returned to his residence. </p><p></p><p>So for the past few days, he hadn't taken any Spirit Restoring Pills, just to save one pill.</p><p></p><p>But today, if he didn't take one, his spiritual power would obviously be insufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Or should I just walk back the last part of the way?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought about it, but eventually shook his head, found a relatively secluded place, took out a Spirit Restoring Pill from his body and swallowed it.</p><p></p><p>His cautious nature made him unwilling to linger too long outside the sect and the market towns.</p><p></p><p>After swallowing this Spirit Restoring Pill, he could actually recover without meditating, it would just be slower.</p><p></p><p>But if he meditated and refined it with spiritual power, the effect would be better and much faster.</p><p></p><p>The first time Chu Ning was at Old Man Sun's place, he also recovered his spiritual power through this method.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, Chu Ning's spiritual power was fully recovered, so he stood up, ready to continue on his way.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he walked back to the main road, Chu Ning was slightly taken aback, as a figure approached from not far away.</p><p></p><p>And this person's dress and appearance were not that of a disciple of the Green Creek Sect.</p><p></p><p>"How could a cultivator from outside appear on this road leading to the Green Creek Sect?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Chu Ning's mind, and he immediately became alert.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, after seeing Chu Ning, the sideburn-bearded cultivator's face flashed with a look of delight.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Although the sideburn-bearded man's expression was just a fleeting one, the ever-observant Chu Ning still noticed it.</p><p></p><p>His face remained expressionless, but his hand secretly gripped a talisman.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Chu Ning swiftly circulated his spiritual power, activating the Rattan Armor Technique.</p><p></p><p>With that one glance, Chu Ning had already confirmed that the other party was at the same fourth level of Qi Refinement as himself, so he dared not be the slightest bit careless.</p><p></p><p>Sensing Chu Ning's fluctuation of spiritual power, the sideburn-bearded man looked slightly surprised, then flashed a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>With an incantation gesture, just as the Rattan Armor Technique covered Chu Ning's body, a fierce beam of light shot out from the sideburn-bearded man's hand.</p><p></p><p>The light seemed to contain the killing intent of the most offensive metal element among the five phases, a formidable metal-type spell.</p><p></p><p>"My full-power fourth level of Qi Refinement Golden Sword Technique should be worthy of you..."</p><p></p><p>A smug look appeared on the sideburn-bearded man's face, but in the next moment, that smug expression vanished.</p><p></p><p>He clearly saw that under his spell's attack, the Rattan Armor Technique on Chu Ning's body swayed as if about to be broken through, but it stubbornly held on, actually deflecting his Golden Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? You...you're not at the second level of Qi Refinement."</p><p></p><p>The sideburn-bearded man suddenly realized this point, his expression slightly changing.</p><p></p><p>And at the same time, another protective shield appeared outside of Chu Ning's body, while Chu Ning's hands flew through incantation gestures.</p><p></p><p>"Talismans?"</p><p></p><p>A greedy look flashed across the sideburn-bearded man's eyes, and he let out a cold laugh before unleashing another Golden Sword Technique towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Although his spellcasting was not yet at the instantaneous level, the release was extremely fast, clearly showing he had immersed himself in this technique for no short time.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sword Technique slammed into the protective shield formed by the Body Talisman, sending a booming sound into Chu Ning's ears within the shield.</p><p></p><p>However, this Body Talisman's defensive ability was quite impressive, and the shield showed no signs of damage.</p><p></p><p>The sideburn-bearded man's expression finally changed slightly, and with another incantation gesture, another Golden Sword Technique blasted forth.</p><p></p><p>As the Golden Sword Technique laced with light hurtled towards Chu Ning, Chu Ning flung out his hand, and the wooden sword that had been set aside flew towards the opponent, guided by his Object Manipulation Technique.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that black, giant sword-like object slowly flying over, the sideburn-bearded man's expression became strange.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, he did not dare to directly confront it. </p><p></p><p>Instead, he shifted sideways about ten feet, trying to avoid it.</p><p></p><p>"Pata!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the black wooden sword suddenly dropped from midair.</p><p></p><p>This caused the man with sideburns to be slightly surprised. He subconsciously looked towards Chu Ning, thinking that his Golden Sword technique had already struck and killed Chu Ning. </p><p></p><p>What he saw was that Chu Ning had already formed a hand seal and cast another spell.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, four iron vine whips flew up from both sides of the man with sideburns, coiling towards him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the man hurriedly dodged to the side.</p><p></p><p>However, he had just shifted to avoid the black wooden sword, and now the four iron vine whips locked onto him from different directions.</p><p></p><p>The man with sideburns only dodged two of them, but the other two directly entangled his body.</p><p></p><p>Originally darting through the air, the man's movement was momentarily stalled.</p><p></p><p>And in that instant, the other two iron vine whips also swiftly bound him, the four vines tying the man up tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Sword technique struck Chu Ning's body shield talisman again, forming a light barrier.</p><p></p><p>After withstanding two Golden Sword strikes, the light barrier could no longer hold and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>However, the last glimmer of golden light was blocked by Chu Ning's Thorn Armor technique.</p><p></p><p>This scene caught the man's attention, but there was not a hint of joy on his face. Instead, his eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw that Chu Ning was catalyzing another talisman in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"He's just a young servant disciple, how can he have so many talismans?"</p><p></p><p>The man was utterly baffled, but it was clear he would not get an answer. A fierce and familiar golden radiance was charging straight at him!</p><p></p><p>Its speed was even faster than his Golden Sword technique.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, the man entangled and immobilized by the Thorn Whip technique could only watch helplessly as the light pierced through his chest!</p><p></p><p>"Golden Sword Talisman!"</p><p></p><p>He only had time to shout this out before feeling a chill in his chest as his body fell backwards.</p><p></p><p>Then, pulled by the unrelenting iron vines, he was bound in a bizarre posture.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning finally let out a light breath.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not let down his guard in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Forming a hand seal, the second set of thorns from the Thorn Whip technique emerged, the four iron vines lacerating the man's body, drawing blood.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, with a wave of his hand, the black wooden sword that had dropped earlier flew up again, heavily striking the man in the head.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Thorn Whip or the black wooden sword, the man clearly had no spiritual power left to resist.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning confirmed the opponent must be dead.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he approach to within ten feet, one hand holding a body shield talisman, the other a Golden Sword talisman.</p><p></p><p>He stood there for a little while longer.</p><p></p><p>Seeing no signs of the man with sideburns feigning death, his body mangled beyond recognition by the four iron vines, Chu Ning finally made a hand seal to release the Thorn Whip technique.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable for him to be so cautious - it was his first time battling a cultivator, so he did not know if this cultivator had other tricks up his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Next, Chu Ning searched the man's body.</p><p></p><p>This guy clearly was not wealthy - after searching for a while, Chu Ning only found a low-grade spirit stone, a similarly low-level Lightfoot Talisman, two small booklets, and a very small jade box.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning did not have time to check what was inside the booklets and jade box. After confirming the man had nothing else hidden, he used two Fireballs to incinerate the corpse, then swiftly left.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the journey was uneventful. It was only after returning to his residence that Chu Ning finally let out a long breath of relief.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 42</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>That night, Chu Ning was practicing martial arts as usual in the backyard. </p><p></p><p>However, he felt an inexplicable discomfort in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The feeling was strange, as if someone was watching him.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning opened his eyes calmly, scanning around with his gaze, but saw no one at all.</p><p></p><p>Yet this made Chu Ning even more vigilant in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In fact, this feeling of being watched had occasionally appeared in the past few days.</p><p></p><p>But it usually just flashed by briefly.  </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought it was just his illusion, caused by being tense, so he didn't take it too seriously.</p><p></p><p>However, today, this feeling persisted for quite some time, making Chu Ning feel it was exceptionally obvious.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's body stiffened slightly, and his hand unconsciously reached for his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Just in case there was any anomaly, he wanted to be able to act swiftly.</p><p></p><p>But after the time it took to drink a cup of tea, apart from the feeling of being watched,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made no other discoveries.</p><p></p><p>After another half stick of incense worth of time, this feeling of being watched suddenly disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Letting out a light breath, Chu Ning relaxed slightly, but his brow furrowed tightly.</p><p></p><p>Without guessing, Chu Ning could tell that this feeling probably came from Qi Chongmao.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart he became increasingly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The two were separated by a courtyard, and his side was even blocked by a vine fence.</p><p></p><p>How could he have the feeling of being watched by the other party?</p><p></p><p>As far as he knew, only spirit sense cultivated by the Foundation Establishment realm could perceive across such a distance.</p><p></p><p>Could Qi Chongmao, a fifth level Qi Refining cultivator, actually use spirit sense as well?</p><p></p><p>Or did the other party cultivate some secret technique?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning's heart jolted, and he became even more vigilant.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Chu Ning focused his mind to check on his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>[Green Wood Everspring Art (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), Second Layer (234/900)]  </p><p>[Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, First Volume, Immortal Skin 150/300]</p><p></p><p>The Green Wood Everspring Art had progressed more slowly recently.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of the Green Wood Spring Art, no matter how long he meditated each day, he could barely manage to gain 1 familiarity point per day.</p><p></p><p>What truly surprised Chu Ning was the progress of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>Previously when cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, he could also gain about 1 familiarity point per day, so in these past five months, the familiarity had increased to 150.</p><p></p><p>But in the last two to three days, Chu Ning found that the familiarity of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual had not increased at all.</p><p></p><p>"Even though I didn't go to the fields, spending more time cultivating this Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual, why did it stop increasing these past two days?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered for a while, suddenly recalling the original introduction about this Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual has actually reached a bottleneck period?"  </p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through his mind, but Chu Ning didn't dare believe it.</p><p></p><p>For cultivation methods and the like, bottlenecks were more likely to be encountered when nearing or reaching completion, but his familiarity had only reached halfway.</p><p></p><p>For the bottleneck period to be so long?</p><p></p><p>Harboring some doubts, over the next two days Chu Ning did not slack off in cultivating the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual.</p><p></p><p>He maintained his previous habit of cultivating it early morning, noon and night each day.</p><p></p><p>What left Chu Ning feeling helpless was that the familiarity of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual still did not increase at all.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly made Chu Ning certain that the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual had indeed reached a bottleneck period.</p><p></p><p>This made Chu Ning extremely surprised, but also vaguely expectant.</p><p></p><p>Surprised that the bottleneck of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Manual could be so long, no wonder normal cultivation was so difficult.</p><p></p><p>Expectant because after overcoming this bottleneck, the Seven Star Spirit Fruit would be able to mature.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English, without reproducing any copyrighted material:</p><p></p><p>Since the Seven Star Spirit Fruit was effective for breaking through the bottlenecks of the Inexhaustible Bones and Unbroken Tendons realms, it should work for breaking through the bottleneck of the Undying Skin realm as well, right?</p><p></p><p>The only thing that made Chu Ning uneasy was that the feeling of being watched at night was becoming more and more obvious and lasting longer.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning vaguely guessed that the day the Seven Star Spirit Fruit ripened was most likely when the other party would take action!</p><p></p><p>After another four days passed like this.</p><p></p><p>Early that morning, Chu Ning stayed in the room, looking out the window towards the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>During these days, Chu Ning had also figured out some of Qi Chongmao's patterns.</p><p></p><p>For example, he would still go out to the fields in the morning, but in the afternoon he would basically stay in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As for the night, he would basically watch Chu Ning's side for nearly half a shi before resting.</p><p></p><p>As usual, not long after eating breakfast, Chu Ning saw Qi Chongmao leave the courtyard and head towards the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>However, when passing by Chu Ning's courtyard, Qi Chongmao did not reveal any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning stayed in the room, watching until the other's figure completely disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>After waiting a while more to confirm that the other had indeed not turned back as usual, he quickly went to the back courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Standing in front of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit tree that he had cultivated for a few months, Chu Ning carefully examined it.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the seven-colored hues on the leaves of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit tree were distinct.</p><p></p><p>And the originally green Seven Star Spirit Fruits had turned completely red, looking as if they could fall at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Just by getting close, Chu Ning could clearly sense the extremely rich spiritual energy emanating from the Seven Star Spirit Fruits.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this state, how could Chu Ning not know what was going on?</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Spirit Fruit had fully ripened!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Seven Star Spirit Fruit was brimming with spiritual essence, clearly of much better quality than the one from Old Man Sun before.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning only realized this after cultivating the Seven Star Spirit Fruit for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, Old Man Sun had only asked him to perform the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique ten times consecutively to improve the quality, because their cultivation methods differed.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Sun relied more on external objects.</p><p></p><p>So when Chu Ning performed the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique ten times back then, he had already reached the limit of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit's quality.</p><p></p><p>Even if he performed it again, the quality would not improve further.</p><p></p><p>After that, Old Man Sun was just waiting for the fruit to fully ripen.</p><p></p><p>However, because Chu Ning had used the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique to draw in the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth from the very beginning of planting, this supplementary technique remained effective.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after the quality improved to a certain level, it could no longer be increased further.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning could still sense that the Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique had a subtle effect in promoting the absorption of spiritual energy and the ripening process.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had almost never stopped performing it.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Seven Star Spirit Fruit now possessed such spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning no longer hesitated, taking out six jade boxes that he had prepared earlier from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>He picked six of the Seven Star Spirit Fruits and put them into the boxes, then put the boxes back into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>As for the last Seven Star Spirit Fruit, Chu Ning picked it and directly put it into his mouth after picking it.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already determined that the first level of his Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique had reached a bottleneck, Chu Ning was prepared to break through this bottleneck with the help of the Seven Star Spirit Fruit.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not sure whether Qi Chongmao would detect that he had picked the Seven Star Spirit Fruit, and whether Qi Chongmao would take any action.</p><p></p><p>If he could break through the bottleneck in his body refining, he would naturally gain an additional advantage.</p>

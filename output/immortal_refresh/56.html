        <h1>Chapter 56</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After returning to his own residence, a slight smile appeared on Chun Ning's face. </p><p></p><p>Although he had felt that his performance today was a bit too high-profile, he was undoubtedly still happy to have been admitted into the third-level disciple rank.</p><p></p><p>Even though he didn't know exactly how the sect would arrange for them to learn various skills, as Mu Ling had mentioned earlier.</p><p></p><p>But at least he was now considered a third-level disciple, which gave him hope.</p><p></p><p>If he could truly learn talisman scripting, with his innate talent for talisman sources, the income he could earn from that would be far higher than just making talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>While cultivators' innate talents were certainly important, resources were no less crucial.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chun Ning was feeling a bit excited, he vaguely heard the sound of conversation coming from the courtyard next door. </p><p></p><p>His excitement faded a bit, and he frowned instead.</p><p></p><p>In fact, what truly made Chun Ning uneasy after this promotion was not that he had stood out too much.</p><p></p><p>After all, people might forget about that kind of thing after some time.</p><p></p><p>What really made Chun Ning uneasy was that Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang had also both successfully been promoted.</p><p></p><p>If they were arranged residences or spirit fields in the third-level disciple area, he didn't know if they would end up too close to him.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he suspected that the two of them might have some connection to Qi Chongmao, Chun Ning had been somewhat wary of interacting with them.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the third-level disciple area isn't overseen by Zhuang Yunde. Otherwise, I could have asked him to help arrange things before he left the sect."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, Chun Ning felt a bit of melancholy.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know if things would still be as convenient in the third-level disciple area without Zhuang Yunde there.</p><p></p><p>As melancholic as he felt, Chun Ning quickly adjusted his mindset.</p><p></p><p>He continued with his regular cultivation.</p><p></p><p>That night, after practicing the Qingmu Changchun Gong, he sat cross-legged on the bed and began cultivating the Spirit Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>This Spirit Refining Technique was not only for strengthening his spiritual sense, but also contained methods for utilizing the spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>In addition to higher-level spirit sense attack secrets like the Illusion Piercing Thorn, there were also some simpler applications, such as using the spiritual sense for detection and telepathic communication.</p><p></p><p>Chun Ning had actually learned the voice transmission technique before, but it was still different from this.</p><p></p><p>The voice transmission technique involved making an extremely subtle sound with the mouth and transmitting it to others through spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Whereas this spiritual sense technique allowed one to directly transmit messages into the recipient's mind without making any sound at all, which was more advanced.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating for a while, just as Chun Ning was about to end his session and rest, his mind stirred.</p><p></p><p>He sensed someone appearing in the courtyard and walking towards his bedroom.</p><p></p><p>He released his spiritual sense without a second thought!</p><p></p><p>After a period of cultivation, his spiritual sense had improved, and its external range had expanded from about 2 zhang to an additional half chi.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a familiar figure appeared within the range of his spiritual sense.</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin?</p><p></p><p>When he sensed the visitor's identity, Chun Ning let out a slight sigh.</p><p></p><p>"So he's come after all!"</p><p></p><p>Today, Chun Ning had deliberately ignored Cao Dongxin, with the intention of provoking or testing him.</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin had a reclusive personality, the kind of person most prone to taking extreme actions.</p><p></p><p>This meant that if he realized Chun Ning's future accomplishments would surpass his own, he might worry about retaliation.</p><p></p><p>As for whether he could swallow this grievance or would take an extreme path, Chun Ning wasn't sure.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to probe a bit.</p><p></p><p>And now it seemed that Cao Dongxin had indeed not disappointed him in this probing.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chun Ning continued sensing him with his spiritual sense while preparing to respond accordingly.</p><p></p><p>When Cao Dongxin arrived near Chun Ning's room door, he took something out from his body and used a Driving Force Technique to fling it towards Chun Ning's room.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chun Ning's body flickered as he leapt off the bed.</p><p></p><p>Activating his Wind Riding Technique, he flashed out to the rear courtyard after a few movements.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what Cao Dongxin had thrown,</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning did not dare to be careless. </p><p></p><p>After entering the backyard, Chu Ning continued to release his spiritual sense to probe the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw that the thing Cao Dongxin had thrown at the doorway, after silently falling to the floor, actually emitted a hazy gray smoke.</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin immediately used a simple spell to force that gray smoke directly into the room.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, how could Chu Ning not understand the other party's intentions?</p><p></p><p>Although unclear what this gray smoke was, since the other party used it, it must be effective against cultivators.  </p><p></p><p>Either to make one lose their powers, or to poison and knock out.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Cao Dongxin was also worried about being discovered, so he resorted to these despicable means.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were people living next door to this courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, a pitiful person must have despicable traits!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Before this, he really had not intended to do anything to the other party.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't want to show Cao Dongxin a good face.</p><p></p><p>But now that the other party had taken the initiative to provoke him, and had clearly revealed such hostility towards him,</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally had nothing good to say.</p><p></p><p>In the backyard, Qi Chongmao was alone, and he didn't mind letting the other party accompany him.</p><p></p><p>The only trouble was that the couple next door might notice too much commotion and link Qi Chongmao's disappearance to him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning remained in the backyard, calmly using his spiritual sense to monitor Cao Dongxin's every move.</p><p></p><p>He saw that after about the time it takes to drink a cup of tea, Cao Dongxin threw a pill into his mouth, then pushed open Chu Ning's room door and walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Why is no one here?"</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin entered the room and, seeing no sign of Chu Ning, his dark face immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>Then, he glanced at the backyard, his gaze flickering, holding a talisman in his hand as he walked towards the backyard.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had completely concealed his aura in his Yinmu Spiritual Body, using his spiritual sense to detect the other party's distance.</p><p></p><p>The moment Cao Dongxin stepped out of the room into the backyard, the well-prepared Chu Ning gripped a Spiritual Movement Talisman in his hand.</p><p></p><p>In the next moment, he flashed over, appearing right in front of Cao Dongxin.</p><p></p><p>Tiangang Fist!</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't give the other party any time to react, striking out with a lethal move!</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin only then reacted, trying to activate the talisman in his hand, but it was too late.</p><p></p><p>"Bang!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's fist struck Cao Dongxin directly.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Cao Dongxin's eyes were wide, filled with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Even until his death, he couldn't figure out</p><p></p><p>How Chu Ning had discovered him in advance. He had been extremely cautious, even using the Mind-Muddling Powder.</p><p></p><p>And how had Chu Ning, at the fourth level of Qi Refining, become a Body Cultivator who had cultivated such an extraordinary ability?</p><p></p><p>He was at the fifth level of Qi Refining, yet didn't even have the strength to fight back.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't care what Cao Dongxin was thinking before he died. He swiftly collected all the items on his body, then shot out a few fireballs, burning him to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Chu Ning released his spiritual sense again to probe the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Finding that the couple next door was still resting with no abnormalities, he finally relaxed a bit.</p><p></p><p>His actions just now had been extremely decisive and swift, so the two neighbors should not have noticed anything.</p><p></p><p>However, even so, Chu Ning did not let his guard down in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>That night, Chu Ning simply sat in meditation to cultivate. It wasn't until dawn with still no anomalies that he truly set his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>After tidying up a bit, Chu Ning left the courtyard to head to the Dao Cultivation Hall.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Leaving Ling Xiaobai alone in the backyard, Chu Ning returned inside to cook Ling rice. </p><p></p><p>After all, he hadn't eaten properly during the day, so he had to eat something in the evening.</p><p></p><p>"I should find an opportunity to buy some fasting pills from Senior Gu. It's more convenient to have them on hand."</p><p></p><p>While taking Ling rice out of his storage bag, Chu Ning murmured softly. </p><p></p><p>As he cooked the Ling rice, he thought for a moment, then took out some more.</p><p></p><p>He would cook some Ling rice porridge to see if Ling Xiaobai would eat it.</p><p></p><p>After all, although he had some spirit stones, he was not rich enough yet to let Ling Xiaobai eat spirit medicines like jade orchid fruits and golden yuan fruits every day.</p><p></p><p>While cooking, Chu Ning couldn't help but wonder about the origins of this little spirit beast. </p><p></p><p>The book of strange tales that Zhuang Yunde had given him last time did have some introductions about spirit beasts. </p><p></p><p>But no matter how Chu Ning thought about it, he couldn't figure out what kind of little creature this was.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the jade slip Mr. He gave me only contained information about spirit plants and medicines, and nothing about spirit beasts."</p><p></p><p>Luo Yiping and the others probably had information about spirit beasts, but of course Chu Ning had no interest in asking them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning suddenly remembered what Lin Changqing had said about the recent beast disaster.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, a third-grade demonic beast came out from the Qing Xia Mountain Range, which frightened the lower-grade demonic beasts and caused the disaster.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai naturally couldn't be a third-grade demonic beast, otherwise it wouldn't have been so easily trapped by him.</p><p></p><p>However, could the appearance of this third-grade demonic beast be related to this little creature?</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning thought about it, he vaguely felt that there might be some possibility in this direction.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then Ling Xiaobai must have an important background.</p><p></p><p>And if I keep it with me, it might cause inconvenience, so I should probably prepare a spirit beast bag to take it out in sometimes, putting it inside the bag."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After a while, the Ling rice porridge was cooked. Chu Ning also made two other dishes, then called Ling Xiaobai over.</p><p></p><p>Ling Xiaobai hesitated for a moment when it saw the Ling rice porridge, but still ate it.</p><p></p><p>However, it didn't even glance at the other two dishes.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Ling Xiaobai finish a bowl of Ling rice porridge, Chu Ning finally felt a little relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter what else, at least he could provide food without any problems.</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of cooking some extra Ling rice porridge, which he could afford.</p><p></p><p>"For now, I can't give it too many good things, otherwise it will get used to them and I won't be able to afford it."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning made up his mind, then instructed Ling Xiaobai to go to the backyard.</p><p></p><p>As for himself, after cleaning up, he began the process of talisman scripting and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The next day was market day. Early in the morning, Chu Ning went to a shop in the market and bought a spirit beast bag.</p><p></p><p>What made him speechless was that when he took out the spirit beast bag and tried to put Ling Xiaobai inside, the little creature kept shaking its head and refused to go in.</p><p></p><p>Also, since Chu Ning didn't have any contract with it, he couldn't force it into the spirit beast bag.</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, Chu Ning could only give up for the time being. He instructed it to stay in the backyard.</p><p></p><p>The little creature obediently stayed in the backyard and fell into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>After half a day of interaction, Chu Ning realized that this spirit beast really loved to sleep.</p><p></p><p>Except for eating and occasional activity, it spent most of its time sleeping.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning also sold some talisman papers, but not many. In the afternoon, close to the end of the market, a voice transmission talisman landed outside his door. It was from Lin Changqing, saying he would take Chu Ning to Feng Xia Town the next day.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, very early.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaobai, I have to go out today. Stay in the backyard and don't go anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Don't wander off. People outside all have trapping talismans like mine.</p><p></p><p>They are ruthless. If you fall into their hands..."</p><p></p><p>After threatening it, Ling Xiaobai nodded its little head rapidly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that even if he tried to take it out, it would take some effort.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that it promised to stay in the backyard, Chu Ning left the courtyard and went out to the shop.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Lin Changqing came riding a spirit boat to pick up Chu Ning and flew away.</p><p></p><p>"Was your spirit field damaged?" Not long after leaving Yan Ji Town, Lin Changqing asked.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Chu Ning had planned to report some losses, but after discovering Ling Xiaobai, he gave up that idea.</p><p></p><p>If Lin Changqing asked, he wouldn't have a good explanation.</p><p></p><p>So this time, he shook his head, "There are protective formations, so the spirit plants inside were not damaged.</p><p></p><p>It's just that I was delayed for a few days, so the growth of the spirit plants slowed down a bit."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Lin Changqing nodded slightly, then suddenly said:</p><p></p><p>"Then it was still affected. Don't pay the monthly fee for the first month."</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning heard this, he was stunned for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Then he quickly reacted.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your consideration, Officer Lin."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Chu Ning took out 50 spirit stones from his storage bag and handed them to Lin Changqing.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too familiar with Feng Xia Town, so please give me some guidance, Master Lin."</p><p></p><p>"Good, if there's nothing else, you can come out with me more often."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chu Ning being so sensible, Lin Changqing felt very satisfied and nodded.</p><p></p><p>With a casual wave of his hand, the 50 spirit stones from Chu Ning disappeared, stored into Lin Changqing's own storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning didn't feel annoyed at all. Instead, he felt much more relieved.</p><p></p><p>The information provided by Zhuang Yunde was really good. Although this Officer Lin had a cold appearance, he was indeed the same kind of person as Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>Getting things done by giving money, this was quite good.</p><p></p><p>It saved Chu Ning a lot of trouble.</p><p></p><p>Feng Xia Town was not close to Yan Ji Town, but fortunately Lin Changqing piloted the spirit boat at a fast speed, so it didn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Slowly.</p><p></p><p>After more than an hour, the two appeared in a prosperous market town. </p><p></p><p>It was called a market town, but it would be more accurate to call it a small city.</p><p></p><p>Wind Gorge was closer to the western side of the Green Gorge Mountains than Green Creek Sect, and further west was the Illusory Moon Palace. </p><p></p><p>Because there was some trade with the two neighboring sects, as well as more cultivating families and wandering cultivators in the surrounding area, the scale of this market town was much larger than the Qinghe Market near Green Creek Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for this Yan Ji Market, it was incomparable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as soon as Chu Ning entered Wind Gorge Market, he found that there were far fewer mortals inside the market town than in Yan Ji Market and Qinghe Market. </p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether this was because this place was farther away from mortal cities or for some other reason.</p><p></p><p>"Master Uncle, are we going straight to Cloud Sea Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Lin Changqing entered the market town without any intention of lingering, but headed straight for the center of the market town, Chu Ning asked.</p><p></p><p>This address of "Master Uncle" was what Lin Changqing had asked Chu Ning to call him on the way, saying that it was inconvenient to call him an executor while out and about.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's question, Lin Changqing nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Sea Pavilion's reputation is still guaranteed. Today, the Cloud Sea Pavilion in Wind Gorge Market happens to have an auction. Let's go take a look."</p><p></p><p>"Auction?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was naturally not unfamiliar with the Cloud Sea Pavilion's auctions.</p><p></p><p>Previously in Qinghe Market, Chu Ning had witnessed one as an observer.</p><p></p><p>It was there that Chu Ning learned about the high value of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit.</p><p></p><p>And it was also on that day that Qi Chongmao discovered the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit in his backyard, which then triggered a series of subsequent events.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't expect that on the first day of arriving at Wind Gorge Market, he would be attending another auction at the Cloud Sea Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, with Lin Changqing leading him, he...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning immediately asked, "Master Uncle, are you planning to have me purchase a flying artifact at the auction?"</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing nodded, "You can't use too advanced flying artifacts yet, as your spiritual power is insufficient.</p><p></p><p>If there are artifacts suitable for the Qi Condensation realm being sold at this auction, their quality will generally be better than those purchased directly."</p><p></p><p>"If the auction doesn't have any, we can still buy from them later."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Lin Changqing's words, Chu Ning nodded slightly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't say anything more, following the other all the way until they reached the Cloud Sea Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After all, although this market town was said to be more prosperous than the ones Chu Ning had been to before, there really wasn't anything too interesting along the way.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the center of the market town, two relatively tall buildings stood tall.</p><p></p><p>One had a sign hanging that said "Cloud Sea Pavilion", while the other had a sign that said "Wind Gorge Pavilion", which must have belonged to Wind Gorge Valley.</p><p></p><p>The two went straight to the Cloud Sea Pavilion. Upon entering, an attendant saw that Lin Changqing was a Foundation Establishment cultivator and immediately came forward to usher them upstairs.</p><p></p><p>Walking up the stairs to the second floor, the attendant stopped and asked Lin Changqing,</p><p></p><p>"Senior, would you like to go to the second floor or the third floor?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go to the third floor," Lin Changqing said, then pointed at Chu Ning and said, "This is my junior martial nephew. He wants to see if there are any suitable items at the second floor auction."</p><p></p><p>The attendant smiled, "Very well, Senior please go upstairs. I'll take the fellow Daoist to find a room on the second floor!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning was slightly puzzled. So there were transactions on the third floor as well?</p><p></p><p>Previously when he attended that Cloud Sea Pavilion auction, he had always thought that auction was the main event of the day.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Lin Changqing turned his head to look at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"The items auctioned on the second floor are of no use to me. You go take a look yourself. If there's anything suitable, bid on it. Wait for me downstairs when it's over."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master Uncle." Chu Ning knew that Lin Changqing didn't talk much, so he didn't ask too many questions.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Changqing went up to the third floor, the attendant gestured for Chu Ning to follow.</p><p></p><p>"This way, Fellow Daoist."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning followed him, using his spiritual perception to examine the attendant.</p><p></p><p>He found that this person's cultivation was higher than his own, a late Qi Condensation cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"This Cloud Sea Pavilion has attendants at the late Qi Condensation realm, and despite seeing my low cultivation, there wasn't the slightest neglect.</p><p></p><p>This number one major trading company is indeed no ordinary place."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this in his heart, and recalling Lin Changqing going to the third floor, he couldn't help but ask:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother, may I ask, is there also an auction on the third floor?"</p><p></p><p>The attendant turned to look at Chu Ning and explained:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the third floor is a smaller auction, only open to Senior Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The items traded will be of a higher grade than those on the second floor."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, then recalled that when he was at Qinghe Market, there were also Foundation Establishment cultivators participating in the auction of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, so he asked doubtfully:</p><p></p><p>"Are there no Foundation Establishment cultivators on the second floor?"</p><p></p><p>"There are some, but relatively few," the attendant replied.</p><p></p><p>"Most are late and full Qi Condensation cultivators. However, sometimes when Senior Foundation Establishment cultivators know that certain specific items will be suitable for their use, those Senior Foundation Establishment cultivators will also participate in the second floor auction."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning finally understood.</p><p></p><p>At the Qinghe Market auction of the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, it was probably because that Seven-Star Spirit Fruit also had some effect on Foundation Establishment body cultivators, so they participated.</p><p></p><p>After all, from what he later learned about body cultivation, most current body cultivators no longer practiced ancient body cultivation methods like the Nine Evolution Body Refinement Technique.</p><p></p><p>Instead, they used external tempering methods.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that their bottlenecks were not as difficult as directly cultivating the Nine Evolution Body Refinement Technique, so the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit was also effective for Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After these thoughts ran through Chu Ning's mind, the attendant had already led Chu Ning to the room marked number twenty-two.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

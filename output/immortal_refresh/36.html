            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Carrying a storage bag, Chu Ning returned to his former place. </p><p></p><p>Although everything that happened today was far beyond Chu Ning's expectations, after some careful thought, it didn't seem like a bad thing for him.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Chu Ning had so many talisman papers in hand, and he planned to turn in a portion to the sect for recycling, and then sell another portion in the market.</p><p></p><p>But now, it seemed he didn't need to go through all that trouble, he could just directly sell them periodically to Mu Ling.</p><p></p><p>Not only was it safer, but the income would also be higher.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was determined to play his role thoroughly. </p><p></p><p>For example, before going to find Mu Ling, he still needed to go to the market and randomly buy some talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>After all, the records of entering and exiting the sect were accurate when checked.</p><p></p><p>Having figured this out, Chu Ning started packing things into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The things he had previously hidden could now be properly stored.</p><p></p><p>First, he took out the 30 spirit stones from his pocket and put them together with the 22 spirit stones already in the bag, making 52 in total.</p><p></p><p>Although nominally 20 of them still belonged to Mu Ling, they were essentially his now.</p><p></p><p>He could just give her talisman papers later.</p><p></p><p>Next, Chu Ning packed up all the remaining talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had originally made 10,800 talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Today he had turned in 3,500 to the sect.</p><p></p><p>And he had sold 2,050 to Mu Ling, leaving 5,250 remaining.</p><p></p><p>"These should be enough for Mu Ling for 5 months. </p><p></p><p>And by the 6th month, the new season's spirit bamboo will have almost matured, providing a seamless transition."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning said to himself with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit, he felt the sensation of being on a monthly subscription wasn't too bad.</p><p></p><p>No need to worry about sales.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Chu Ning put all the other things into the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The books on the Green Wood Longevity Technique, Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, Golden Sword Art and other martial arts and spells.</p><p></p><p>There were also three talisman papers, and the large wooden sword he had bought from Old Man Sun.</p><p></p><p>As he was about to put away the wooden sword, Chu Ning paused.</p><p></p><p>With a Repulsion Technique, the wooden sword instantly turned into a black light shooting straight out.</p><p></p><p>Just as it was about to hit the window, Chu Ning summoned it back with another Repulsion Technique.</p><p></p><p>"Should I find a way to learn a Sword Guiding Art?"</p><p></p><p>Holding the heavily weighted wooden sword, Chu Ning was becoming increasingly adept at using the Repulsion Technique.</p><p></p><p>He had tried before, and this wooden sword could smash through a decent sized tree if thrown out.</p><p></p><p>But without learning the Sword Guiding Art, he could only make it go straight, and the speed couldn't be increased further.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the killing power would naturally be quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't heard of servant disciples being allowed to learn the Sword Guiding Art though.</p><p></p><p>But since talisman paper making and talisman arts are from the same lineage, when the next season's submissions are collected, I can ask if I can learn the talisman arts."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered for a moment, also thinking about his cultivation progress.</p><p></p><p>He was considering whether to reveal his Refining Qi Layer 3 cultivation level. If his realm was too low, he might face limitations in learning the talisman arts later on.</p><p></p><p>"It's been half a year since I joined the sect, and I've reached the third layer of Refining Qi. This speed shouldn't be too fast, right?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking it over, he felt he still couldn't act rashly. He would investigate over the next couple of days to see the cultivation progress of the others who joined at the same time.</p><p></p><p>If others had already broken through, then he...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>If he chooses an appropriate timing to reveal it, there would be no problem at all. </p><p></p><p>As for whom to inquire from, naturally he chose Qiu Shunyi.</p><p></p><p>It's unknown whether Qiu Shunyi received the true teachings from Shang Zhaoxiang, but this guy has a good relationship with the new disciples. </p><p></p><p>Making many friends, he is very well-informed about information from all sides.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Chu Ning took the opportunity to check on Qiu Shunyi's new planting season and successfully learned quite a bit of useful information.</p><p></p><p>From Qiu Shunyi, he learned that among the group of servant disciples they entered with, several had already reached the third level of Refining Qi. </p><p></p><p>On the spiritual plant side, Yuan Guang had also successfully broken through the second level of Refining Qi and entered the third level a couple days ago.</p><p></p><p>Although the number was not very large, it did not cause any reaction within the sect.  </p><p></p><p>After all, the initial three levels of Refining Qi were the easiest to break through, and outer and inner sect disciples basically broke through within a few months.</p><p></p><p>The real obstacle was going from the third to the fourth level of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>So in the following days, Chu Ning also found an opportunity to "break through" the second level of Refining Qi and officially announced that he had entered the third level.</p><p></p><p>Since Chu Ning had previously shown a similar cultivation progress as Yuan Guang and the others, it did not surprise people too much.</p><p></p><p>Even Zhuang Yunde believed that Chu Ning's level was consistent with the others, only that he was more proficient in using spells.</p><p></p><p>During this period, Chu Ning did not idle around but continued planting.</p><p></p><p>The area where Qingxi Sect was located was not too cold, so even in winter the spiritual fields would not be empty, with corresponding spiritual plants that could be grown.</p><p></p><p>For Chu Ning, the cultivation of Ink Bamboo could continue, as this spiritual plant could be grown all year round.  </p><p></p><p>Especially with the enhancement of the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique, it was basically unaffected by the weather.</p><p></p><p>However, in the medium-grade spiritual fields of Area D, spirit rice could not be grown after the temperature dropped, so Chu Ning switched to planting Purple Caltrop.</p><p></p><p>This was an excellent grass feed for raising spiritual fish, and one of the spiritual plants the sect encouraged everyone to grow. The sect would buy back all of it.</p><p></p><p>In over twenty days, not only did Chu Ning plant these two spiritual plants, but he also cultivated them using the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique.  </p><p></p><p>All went smoothly, and what Chu Ning needed to do next were just the regular tasks of weeding, pest control, and casting the Green Wood Spring Bloom technique.</p><p></p><p>With the one-month period he agreed upon with Mu Ling approaching, Chu Ning decided to leave the sect and go to the market town.</p><p></p><p>On one hand, if others knew he obtained over a thousand talisman papers without leaving the sect, everyone would know he was hoarding resources.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, Chu Ning also needed to buy some jade boxes in the market town.</p><p></p><p>The Seven-Star Spiritual Fruits he had been continuously cultivating would mature soon.  </p><p></p><p>After a hundred days and over two more months of cultivation, the fruits had become increasingly plump and full of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>They should be ripe in less than a month, so Chu Ning had to prepare some jade boxes in advance to store the fruits after picking them.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, Chu Ning hadn't been to the market town for several months since the encounter with that rogue cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This time, Chu Ning felt he should stay together with his companions as much as possible and not separate.</p><p></p><p>Especially on the way back, he should have more people accompany him to avoid any accidents.</p><p></p><p>So Chu Ning found Qiu Shunyi and agreed to go to the market town the next day.  </p><p></p><p>He specifically told the other that he could invite a few more people, as having company would be more lively.</p><p></p><p>The next day when Chu Ning arrived at the mountain gate plaza, his eyes went wide at the sight.</p><p></p><p>Good lord, there were so many people! Were the new disciples going on a team building trip?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

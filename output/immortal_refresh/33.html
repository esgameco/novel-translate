        <h1>Chapter 33</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>As Qingmu Changchun's cultivation method circulated, Chu Ning immediately felt a surge of abundant spiritual energy coming from the spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>The abundance of this spiritual energy was even greater than the Qingmu Chunhua technique.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder these are spirit stones, the effect is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>With an admiring thought in his heart, Chu Ning immediately focused his mind and began to fully immerse himself in the circulation of the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual qi from within the spirit stones rapidly rushed into Chu Ning's body, and the spiritual radiance also quickly faded away.</p><p></p><p>Until at one point, Chu Ning felt that the spiritual qi inside the spirit stone had been completely absorbed by him. </p><p></p><p>He had been prepared and began absorbing spiritual qi from the spirit stone held in his left hand.</p><p></p><p>When the spiritual qi of this spirit stone was about to be completely exhausted, the four layers of power in Chu Ning's dantian had already reached perfection, and the fifth layer of power slowly appeared.</p><p></p><p>He continued cultivating to stabilize his realm.</p><p></p><p>After a while, Chu Ning slowly opened his eyes, and at this time the spirit stones in his hands had turned into powder.</p><p></p><p>"Refining Qi fifth layer!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning laughed lightly as he felt the changes in proficiency deep in his mind.</p><p></p><p>[Qingmu Changchun Technique (Yellow Grade Lower Rank), Second Layer (201/900)]</p><p></p><p>Just as he had thought, the second layer of the Qingmu Changchun Technique did not allocate the proficiency evenly across the three realms of the middle stage of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>At this time, his proficiency in the Qingmu Changchun Technique had increased, breaking through 200.</p><p></p><p>And his own cultivation had successfully crossed the fourth layer of Refining Qi, reaching the fifth layer of Refining Qi.</p><p></p><p>"If I estimate based on this, then to cross the fifth layer of Refining Qi, I'm afraid the proficiency of the second layer of the Qingmu Changchun Technique needs to increase by another 300 to reach 500.</p><p></p><p>And if I want to cross the sixth layer of Refining Qi to reach the late stage of Refining Qi, then I need to add another 400 proficiency points."</p><p></p><p>"It really does get more difficult with each layer."</p><p></p><p>While Chu Ning understood this point, he also had a general grasp of the effect of cultivating with spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Three spirit stones increased his proficiency by 3 points, which was equivalent to 2 to 3 days of his regular cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, this referred to cultivation aided by the Qingmu Chunhua Technique.</p><p></p><p>If it was normal cultivation, it would probably take more than ten days.</p><p></p><p>"Although cultivating with spirit stones can speed up the process, the cost is indeed not something that can be easily afforded."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning shook his head secretly.</p><p></p><p>Even though he now mastered the art of talisman paper making, continuously cultivating with spirit stones like this would be unaffordable, not to mention other ordinary disciple servants.</p><p></p><p>"If I want more spirit stones, I'll have to sell these talisman papers, which are the most valuable things I have now."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pondered in his heart how to deal with these talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there were only two ways: one was to hand them over to the sect for recycling in exchange for spirit stones, and the other was to sell them in the market.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's plan was to take both routes.</p><p></p><p>After all, the sect's recycling price would be a little higher, basically 55 talisman papers could be exchanged for one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>While in the market, it usually took 60 talisman papers to get one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't give everything to the sect for recycling, otherwise everyone would know that he had previously concealed his harvest, so he still had to sell some in the market.</p><p></p><p>Speaking of which, recently he had taken the opportunity to probe people like Zhuang Yunde and Qiu Shunyi about whether there were any cases of robbery cultivation in the market.</p><p></p><p>However, from their introductions, there didn't seem to be any such cases.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had basically determined that the previous encounter with the man with sideburns was just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>He had happened to be targeted by that person during that period of time.</p><p></p><p>However...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ning had also made up his mind that if he were to go out, he would have to be cautious and definitely go with others. </p><p></p><p>Before going out, Ning felt he should first complete the task of handing in talisman papers to the sect.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was not a trivial matter to have so many talisman papers with himself.  </p><p></p><p>It was uncertain when Zhang Yunde would come.</p><p></p><p>Recalling that the other party had said that as a recommended servant disciple, he might have a chance to go to the outer sect, Ning decided to take the initiative to find him.</p><p></p><p>He divided the talisman papers in his hands, first putting the 3,500 sheets to be handed over to the sect into a cloth bag.</p><p></p><p>Then he put another 2,050 sheets into a smaller cloth bag.  </p><p></p><p>Of these talisman papers, 550 sheets were prepared as Zhang Yunde's share, and the rest were to see if they could be sold back to the sect.</p><p></p><p>After separating 5,550 sheets, Ning put the remaining 5,250 sheets into a cloth bag and hid it in a cabinet in the room.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Ning also made up his mind that he seemed to need to prepare a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>After all, as his belongings became more and more, he always felt insecure just leaving them in this room without carrying them with him.</p><p></p><p>Carrying a large and a small cloth bag, Ning left the courtyard and headed towards the outer sect inside the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Come to think of it, this was the first time Ning took the initiative to go to the outer sect to find Zhang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while from the Spirit Plant Area towards the mountain, Ning arrived at the outer gate of the Qingxi Sect and stopped.</p><p></p><p>Although Ning was also a disciple of the Qingxi Sect, living in the mountain gate of the Qingxi Sect, he was not qualified to enter and live within the outer sect area.  </p><p></p><p>As for Zhang Yunde, as an outer sect disciple, he could live inside the sect.</p><p></p><p>Ning's appearance immediately drew the attention of the disciple on duty at the entrance of the outer sect. Seeing Ning's servant disciple attire, a disciple of average build with a slightly arrogant look on his face immediately shouted:</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? How dare you come to the outer sect?"</p><p></p><p>Ning saw the disdain in the other party's eyes, but did not show too much expression, giving a slight bow with his hands together.</p><p></p><p>"In response to Senior Brother, this disciple is Chu Ning from the Spirit Plant Servant Area, here to find Servant Disciple Zhang Yunde to hand over the harvest."</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the harvest? Don't they usually come to collect it from you?"  The disciple who spoke earlier frowned, seeming somewhat doubtful of Ning's words.</p><p></p><p>Ning did not want to explain in too much detail, so he said vaguely, "I was recommended to learn skills at the Baiyi Hall, so the harvest was handed over a bit late."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, Ning handed over his identity token.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the disciple took Ning's identity token with some doubt.</p><p></p><p>It was only after verifying that Ning's token was valid that he waved his hand to let Ning enter the outer sect.</p><p></p><p>Ning had entered the outer sect area of the Qingxi Sect for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is where the outer sect disciples reside and cultivate, with better resources!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the outer sect area, he immediately felt the more concentrated spiritual qi. Ning sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, Ning could also feel that the concentration of spiritual qi still could not compare to when he practiced the Qingmu Chunhua Technique with the help of the Ink Bamboo, so he was not overly envious.</p><p></p><p>After a slight perception, Ning immediately lowered his head slightly and walked quickly towards the direction Zhang Yunde had mentioned before.</p><p></p><p>As an inconspicuous servant disciple in the sect, his appearance in the outer sect area was somewhat noticeable.  </p><p></p><p>Ning did not want to accidentally offend an outer sect disciple and get himself into trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, this low-key approach did not seem to have the desired effect.</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, just as he was about to reach Zhang Yunde's residence, he was stopped by a crisp voice.</p><p></p><p>"Hey, that junior brother, stop for a moment."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

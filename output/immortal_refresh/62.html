        <h1>Chapter 62</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the Chinese excerpt to English:</p><p></p><p>"Liao Yunming, what do you want to do? Don't tell me you still don't trust my words?" </p><p></p><p>Hechang You's expression looked somewhat unpleasant, and he even stopped addressing Liao Yunming as "Senior Brother", directly calling him by his name instead.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qingxi Sect had always been adept at cultivating spirit plants, since spirit plant cultivation was supplementary and most of the work could be completed by menial disciples, the status of the Spirit Plant Pavilion was not actually high within the Sect. </p><p></p><p>This time, Hechang You personally brought Chu Ning, whom he had discovered, which was essentially to show off to Liao Yunming. Therefore, Liao Yunming's questioning undoubtedly made Hechang You extremely angry.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother He, don't be angry," Liao Yunming smiled and waved his hand. "I'm not questioning you, I just want to see Junior Nephew Chu's talent in talisman making. If he is truly a promising material, then our Talisman Pavilion can naturally teach him more advanced talisman crafting techniques."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Liao Yunming's words, Hechang You's expression improved slightly. However, his expression also showed some hesitation. Although he had previously told the disciples in the Spirit Plant Pavilion's practice ground that Chu Ning's success rate was not due to luck, deep down, he still somewhat believed Chu Ning's words. Hechang You also felt that Chu Ning's relatively relaxed state of mind was because the first three talisman papers had two successes. Therefore, Hechang You was not certain whether Chu Ning would still have such a high success rate if he tried again at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Liao Yunming seemed to notice Hechang You's thoughts and smiled, "Junior Brother, you don't need to worry. The success rate may be affected by various factors. I only need to observe Junior Nephew's state when making talismans to make some judgments."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Liao Yunming's words, even if Hechang You wanted to say something, he couldn't open his mouth, and could only look towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Since Senior Uncle Liao wants to test you, you must perform well."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Chu Ning cupped his hands in response, but at this moment, a slight ripple arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had clearly heard Liao Yunming's words just now. If he could truly demonstrate a 50% talisman making success rate again, he would be able to learn more advanced talisman crafting techniques.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a huge temptation for Chu Ning. After making the Wood Escape Talisman, Chu Ning had already confirmed the monstrous talisman making talent of his spirit source spirit body. If he could seize this opportunity to learn better talisman crafting techniques, Chu Ning would naturally be happy to do so.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fear that revealing his true abilities would be too shocking and instead draw too much attention to his secret, Chu Ning would have even been tempted to demonstrate an even higher success rate.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning quickly suppressed this impulse. Of course, he was also determined to perform well and impress that Executive Liao.</p><p></p><p>At least for now, it didn't seem too hard to accept that he, a newly joined disciple, had a talent for talisman making.</p><p></p><p>After responding, Chu Ning took out a brush, ink, and paper from his storage bag, calmed his mind, and then began another attempt at making the Wood Escape Talisman.</p><p></p><p>The first one still had some flaws, but it had already made that Executive Liao's eyes light up slightly.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, when Chu Ning smoothly succeeded in making several Wood Escape Talismans, Executive Liao's expression immediately became somewhat heated.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, no, Senior Brother He, let me discuss something with you."</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning completed making five Wood Escape Talismans, Liao Yunming suddenly spoke to Hechang You.</p><p></p><p>Hechang You was slightly startled upon hearing this and looked at him in surprise.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Liao Yunming then said something that shocked them both.</p><p></p><p>"Let this Junior Nephew transfer to our Talisman Pavilion. We'll give your Spirit Plant Pavilion enough talismans as compensation."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Hechang You immediately realized what was going on. He had now determined that Chu Ning's performance just now was absolutely not a coincidence or luck - he clearly had an excellent talent for talisman making.</p><p></p><p>With such a talent, even Liao Yunming, the Executive of the Talisman Pavilion...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"You've really made a good plan," Ho Chang-yu laughed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning is also extremely gifted in the cultivation of wood element spells. He is our Spirit Plant House's, no, I should say he is a disciple that the Bai Yi Hall focuses on cultivating.  You'd better give up this idea."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning, listening from the side, had an extremely strange expression on his face. </p><p></p><p>When did he become a key disciple cultivated by the Spirit Plant House?</p><p></p><p>Just a few days ago, he was still in the Ding district of the Spirit Plant House. </p><p></p><p>Except for Zhuang Yunde, probably no one in charge of the entire house knew him.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a bit uneasy.</p><p></p><p>His performance during this period had been too high-profile, conflicting with his long-held tenet of steady cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He still hoped this episode would pass quickly so he could return to his peaceful days of farming and cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, it was obvious that, at least for the moment, this wish of his could not be fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>"Ho Chang-yu, don't mislead the younger generation," Liao Yunming also seemed a bit anxious at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This junior has outstanding talisman-making talents, extremely rare even in our Lingfu Hall. </p><p></p><p>Do you really want him to be stuck in the fields his whole life?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with the fields?" Ho Chang-yu snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Without the Spirit Plant House, a branch under the Bai Yi Hall, providing logistical support, where would you get so many resources? </p><p></p><p>The talisman paper, talisman pens...aren't all the materials you use provided by our Spirit Plant House?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Liao!" Ho Chang-yu's tone became heavier.</p><p></p><p>"You've witnessed Chu Ning's talisman-making talents yourself, so you should quickly pass on the talisman arts to him.</p><p></p><p>This was already decided by the sect previously. Are you saying the Lingfu Hall wants to go against it?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing Ho Chang-yu bring up the sect's authority, Liao Yunming's expression wavered slightly.</p><p></p><p>Then, he frowned slightly and suddenly said, "Alright, instead of having Chu Ning transfer from your Bai Yi Hall to our Lingfu Hall, we can directly register him as an outer door dual disciple of both halls, can't we?"</p><p></p><p>"Outer door dual disciple?"</p><p></p><p>"Outer door dual disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Ho Chang-yu and Chu Ning spoke up one after the other, but with completely different tones. </p><p></p><p>Ho Chang-yu seemed to be pondering it, while Chu Ning's tone was full of surprise, as if he had never heard of such a thing before.</p><p></p><p>Seeming to sense the surprise in Chu Ning's words, Liao Yunming smiled at him.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu may not know, but in the past there have been cases of outer door disciples having certain talents in multiple areas.  </p><p></p><p>Generally in such situations, the various halls would argue over them. Later, the sect created this dual disciple status.</p><p></p><p>Disciples of this kind can learn the spells and skills of two halls, but correspondingly, they also have to complete the tasks of both halls.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite, of course, is that this disciple must qualify to become an outer door disciple."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Liao Yunming seemed afraid Chu Ning might misunderstand, so he immediately sped up and said:</p><p></p><p>"But don't worry Junior Martial Brother Chu, the tasks of our Lingfu Hall are not many.  </p><p></p><p>We'll just have you cultivate the talisman arts every day, and periodically hand in a certain number of talismans.</p><p></p><p>These things, you'll be able to complete in your spare time from farming."</p><p></p><p>After listening, Chu Ning's heart immediately stirred with excitement.  </p><p></p><p>There was actually such a good opportunity?</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Liao, this is indeed a good solution," Ho Chang-yu chimed in.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning reached the fourth level of qi cultivation in just over a year. If he has a talent for talisman-making, he meets the outer door disciple requirements."</p><p></p><p>"But if Chu Ning becomes a dual disciple, will he be able to enjoy the same treatment as the other disciples in the Lingfu Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Liao Yunming said with certainty.  </p><p></p><p>"As long as the sect agrees, he'll be a formal disciple of our Lingfu Hall. </p><p></p><p>I'll immediately pass on to him an excellent talisman art."</p><p></p><p>Ho Chang-yu nodded, then turned to Chu Ning and asked, "Are you willing?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

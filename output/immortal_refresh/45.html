        <h1>Chapter 45</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Qi Chongmao's disappearance might attract the attention of the sect, and even lead to an investigation, but even so, Chu Ning had never considered handing over Qi Chongmao's corpse to the sect. </p><p></p><p>Because once the sect deeply investigated the fight between the two of them, and even checked their storage bags, Chu Ning's little secret would naturally be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Chu Ning was a little interested in the things in Qi Chongmao's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had slightly regained his senses. </p><p></p><p>The so-called secret technique that Qi Chongmao had used against him at the beginning was very likely a spiritual attack.</p><p></p><p>However, under normal circumstances, cultivators at the Qi Refining stage could not cultivate spiritual power, let alone use it to attack.</p><p></p><p>Even though Qi Chongmao had said that he had broken through to the sixth level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, Chu Ning did not have time to look into the other party's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The sect would still have disciples patrolling every night.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, their fight was short, so it should not have been discovered.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, he still needed to tidy up the slightly messy scene caused by their fight.</p><p></p><p>After a few cleaning spells, he scattered some iron vine seeds, and quickly grew them using a catalyzing spell and a green wood spring spell, covering part of the ground.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Chu Ning finally picked up the black wooden sword he had used to block the other party's thorn technique and put it into his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Just now, thanks to this wooden sword blocking the other party's thorn technique, his attack rhythm was not disrupted.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning finally had time to erase the imprint on Qi Chongmao's storage bag with his spiritual power and open it.</p><p></p><p>"He's not at the sixth level of Qi Refining? Why is he so poor?"</p><p></p><p>Taking out the things from Qi Chongmao's storage bag, Chu Ning couldn't help but curl his lip.</p><p></p><p>There were only more than 40 spirit stones, which was even less than what he had.</p><p></p><p>With just these spirit stones, it was not enough to cover the cost of the talisman papers he had used earlier.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, Chu Ning had used both low-grade offensive and defensive talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>In addition, there were two more talisman papers, one for water-based attacks and the other was surprisingly also a movement talisman.</p><p></p><p>"This movement talisman is a good thing, useful for escaping or getting close for my Tian Gang Fist."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought to himself, and his gaze continued to examine the two bottles of pills beside them.</p><p></p><p>He reached out, took the bottle labeled "Recovery Pill", opened it, and found 10 Recovery Pills inside, immediately happily putting them away.</p><p></p><p>He had previously obtained these Recovery Pills from Old Man Sun, and they were very effective in restoring spiritual power, but he had not used many before.</p><p></p><p>But now that he had acquired the Tian Gang Fist, the effect of these Recovery Pills could be fully utilized.</p><p></p><p>After all, just now he had only used the Tian Gang Fist at full power once, and it had consumed nearly 30% of his spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Then, Chu Ning took the other bottle labeled "Spirit Nourishing Pill".</p><p></p><p>Opening it, there were only 5 pills inside.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had never encountered these Spirit Nourishing Pills before and did not know their effects, so he could only temporarily store them in his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning's gaze finally fell on the last two items.</p><p></p><p>A jade slip and a bamboo plate of unknown use.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had previously encountered jade slips containing recorded content from Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>Recalling what Qi Chongmao had said about the secret technique earlier, his eyes could not help but light up slightly.</p><p></p><p>He held the jade slip close to his forehead, and immediately, the information in the jade slip appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning had finished viewing the entire content of the jade slip, he felt both relieved and frightened.</p><p></p><p>This jade slip actually recorded a remnant secret technique called the "Spirit Refining Art".</p><p></p><p>This secret technique did indeed cultivate spiritual power, and its power lay in the fact that even cultivators in the middle stage of Qi Refining could practice it.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Refining Art had four levels in total.</p><p></p><p>Upon succeeding in cultivating the first level, one's spiritual power would increase by 1 fold. The second level would increase it by 2 folds, the third level by 4 folds, and the fourth level would increase it by 8 folds or more.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, this jade slip only recorded the first two levels of the Spirit Refining Art.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, this Spirit Refining Art had two accompanying secret techniques, one before and one after. The first secret technique could test the innate spiritual power state of the cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Although this Refining Spirit Technique can be cultivated by cultivators in the middle stage of Refining Qi, as mentioned above, the stronger one's innate spiritual consciousness, the easier and more effective the cultivation will be. </p><p></p><p>Conversely, if one's innate spiritual consciousness is too weak, then cultivation will be extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>And another secret technique recorded here is called the Illusory Spirit Thorn. It can use spiritual consciousness to launch attacks, instantly restraining the opponent's spiritual consciousness and preventing them from using their magic power.</p><p></p><p>Because according to this Refining Spirit Technique, even though Qi Refining cultivators cannot cultivate spiritual consciousness, spiritual consciousness is still important. Once the spiritual consciousness is subjected to a powerful attack, one will be unable to wield magic power.</p><p></p><p>This secret technique is best used after reaching the perfect realm of the first level of Refining Spirit Technique, making it more powerful. If cultivated to the third or fourth level where the spiritual consciousness is strong enough, it can instantly erase the opponent's spiritual consciousness and kill them silently.</p><p></p><p>However, the downside of this secret technique is also very obvious. First, if one's own spiritual consciousness is not strong enough, using the secret technique will damage one's spiritual consciousness. Second, if the opponent's spiritual consciousness is powerful, it is easy to suffer a backlash.</p><p></p><p>After reading through this jade slip, Chu Ning now understood what had happened to Qi Chongmao before.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that Qi Chongmao wanted to end the battle quickly, so he used the Illusory Spirit Thorn on Chu Ning right away. From this point, it seems that the opponent had obtained this Refining Spirit Technique for quite some time and had cultivated the secret technique.</p><p></p><p>As for why the opponent's Illusory Spirit Thorn allowed Chu Ning to recover in such a short time, it was either because the opponent's spiritual consciousness was not strong enough and had not yet reached the perfect realm of the first level, so the effect of the Illusory Spirit Thorn was average.</p><p></p><p>Or...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning's eyes flickered with a faint glow. Could it be possible that his own innate spiritual consciousness was quite good?</p><p></p><p>However, this thought only flashed briefly, and the excitement in Chu Ning's heart disappeared again. After all, the many previous attempts had already made it clear to him that without a spiritual root talent, his performance in other aspects was indeed average.</p><p></p><p>Neither the Tiger Wood Spiritual Root nor the Talisman Source Spiritual Root contained information about spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Of course, although he had these thoughts, he still needed to test it, since it was related to whether he could cultivate this secret technique or not. The role of spiritual consciousness, even setting aside the Illusory Spirit Thorn, was immense in terms of perception and sensing.</p><p></p><p>Slowly closing his eyes, Chu Ning began to sense his own spiritual consciousness according to the method described in the secret technique, testing the strength of his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>An hour later, when Chu Ning opened his eyes again, they were filled with excitement and delight.</p><p></p><p>"My spiritual consciousness is actually so strong, almost twice that of an ordinary Qi Refining cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was indeed greatly surprised. He did not expect that despite his average spiritual root talent, he would have such an outstanding performance in terms of spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>This also explained why Qi Chongmao's Illusory Spirit Thorn only prevented Chu Ning from using magic power for a short time before he quickly recovered.</p><p></p><p>If Qi Chongmao's spiritual consciousness was at the normal level of an ordinary cultivator, then even though he had cultivated the Illusory Spirit Thorn, without reaching the perfect realm of the first level, his spiritual consciousness would only be slightly stronger than Chu Ning's at best.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have an innate advantage in spiritual consciousness, I naturally have to cultivate this Refining Spirit Technique. As for not having the later levels, I'll have to find a way to obtain them in the future."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning muttered to himself. It was then that he realized there were still quite a few techniques he needed to find.</p><p></p><p>The Green Wood Evergreen Technique could only be cultivated up to the late stage of Qi Refining. He only had the first volume of the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique, and for this Refining Spirit Technique, he only had the first two levels.</p><p></p><p>While making up his mind to cultivate it, Chu Ning also reminded himself inwardly that he should avoid using the Illusory Spirit Thorn unless absolutely necessary, since he was not sure about the opponent's spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he might end up like Qi Chongmao. With Qi Chongmao's sixth level of Qi Refining cultivation, if it weren't for the fact that he used the Illusory Spirit Thorn and happened to encounter Chu Ning's innately strong spiritual consciousness, causing him to suffer a great loss, those talismans and spells could have caused Chu Ning some trouble.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 20</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The three of them entered the market street, and immediately a lively scene was presented before Chu Ning. </p><p></p><p>"Selling high-quality talismans, all kinds of attack and defense talismans available."</p><p></p><p>"High-quality spirit rice, from the Chen Family, quality guaranteed." </p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>After taking just a few steps into the market street, Chu Ning heard a chorus of hawking voices, immediately finding it interesting yet somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that the market streets in this cultivation world would be so similar to those in the mortal realm. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the things being sold here were all related to cultivation - various talismans, spirit plants, magic artifacts, pills, a dazzling array that really opened Chu Ning's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi, who had been here twice before, played the role of guide.</p><p></p><p>"These shops near the outskirts of the market are mostly run by smaller cultivation families, so the quality of what they sell is relatively lower. The closer you get to the center, the greater the family power, and right in the middle are the large shops of our Qingxi Sect and other major businesses."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning asked in slight surprise, "Isn't our Qingxi Sect's shop the biggest in Qinghe Market?"</p><p></p><p>"No!" Qiu Shunyi shook his head. "I heard from Senior Martial Brother Shang that the biggest shop here is Yunhai Pavilion. Not just here, but in all the market towns along the Qingxia Mountain Range, the biggest is always Yunhai Pavilion. After all, we major sects have many disciples, so a lot of good resources are used internally within the sect. But Yunhai Pavilion specializes in doing business with cultivators, so they sell many rare and exotic treasures."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, finding this easy to understand.</p><p></p><p>As they strolled and looked around, Chu Ning soon discovered that not only were there shops selling goods in this market street, there were also many looking to purchase items. Some shops had signs saying "Purchasing All Kinds of Spirit Herbs and Medicines" or "Purchasing Spirit Beasts", while others even had recruitment notices posted.</p><p></p><p>The strange contents on those notices really surprised Chu Ning:</p><p></p><p>"Blood Moon Cow about to lactate, hiring Beast Tamer to cast Milking Technique (requires instant spell casting), price negotiable."</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Grass needs catalyzing, hiring Plant Cultivator to cast Catalyzing Technique (requires instant spell casting), price negotiable."</p><p></p><p>......</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pointed at the notices in the shops and asked Qiu Shunyi, "Do our sect's disciples do these kinds of jobs?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling his own surprise the first time he saw this, Qiu Shunyi smiled and said, "Of course, these are meant for people like us. Our Qingxi Sect has many servant disciples, and we all need resources for our cultivation, so the sect actually allows us to come out and earn some side income. But I heard from Senior Martial Brother Shang that the ones posting these recruitment notices are mostly cultivation families affiliated with our sect, as well as some major businesses that cooperate with our sect. Other forces can't just randomly post recruitment notices here, as our sect doesn't want too many of our disciples working for other powers."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded again, then asked with some doubt, "I wonder how many of our sect's disciples take on these recruitment jobs?"</p><p></p><p>"Not many, from what I know," Lyu Xingyuan, who hadn't spoken much until now, answered.</p><p></p><p>"I heard from the senior martial brother I used to follow that these cultivation families actually have people who can perform basic techniques themselves. They only post these recruitment notices when they have special requirements. The compensation these families can offer is generally not high, sometimes just a few spirit stone shards. For example, jobs related to spirit plants are probably only looked at by our junior disciples in the Ding region, but they often don't meet the technique requirements. So it's usually when a senior disciple from the Bing region happens to be here and is really short on spirit stones that they might take on these recruitment jobs."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning understood. Although this was his first time at this market street, after a few months of exposure to the cultivation world, he was no complete novice. So-called spirit stone shards were incomplete spirit stones whose spiritual energy was not as abundant as whole spirit stones, so they were less valuable. For example, a whole low-grade spirit stone usually weighed around ten liang. But if exchanged for shards, it often took twelve or even thirteen liang of shards to get one whole stone, and most people wouldn't make that exchange.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the C District, the miscellaneous disciple servants may not care much about a few shattered spirit stones. </p><p></p><p>Because for the miscellaneous servants in the middle cultivation stage of the C District, those who could instantly cast spells basically had decent income from cultivating plants already.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning's heart moved a little. These people looked down on it, but he valued it!</p><p></p><p>He had never learned the Lactation Technique, but he knew the Catalyzing Technique!</p><p></p><p>He was now at the fourth level of Qi cultivation. He was proficient in techniques like the Catalyzing Technique, Purification Technique, Green Wood Spring Bloom Technique, etc. He could instantly cast the Catalyzing and Purification Techniques.</p><p></p><p>If he took on these hiring tasks himself, it seemed he could gain some shattered spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, performing these auxiliary spells would not really expose his cultivation level.</p><p></p><p>Although they were just shattered spirit stones, for the impoverished Chu Ning, it was enough to move his heart.</p><p></p><p>With these thoughts in mind, Chu Ning remained calm on the surface and continued strolling with the two others.</p><p></p><p>They also went to the very center of the market street and took a look at the shops of major sects like Qingxi Sect and Yunhai Pavilion, which were indeed more magnificent.</p><p></p><p>After strolling for about half an hour, Chu Ning patted his head and said, "Oh, I forgot that a senior brother asked me to do something earlier. You two can continue browsing. I'll go take care of that and come back."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi and Lv Xingyu were slightly taken aback when they heard this but didn't say much, only agreeing to meet at the market entrance in an hour.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning thought that his time was uncertain, and considering his speed, he would definitely be faster than the other two. So he said, "If I'm not there in an hour, you two can leave first. I'll be faster, so don't wait for me."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi and the other, knowing that Chu Ning had already reached the "second level of Qi cultivation," agreed that he would indeed be faster than them and didn't object.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning bid them farewell and turned onto a side path they had passed earlier, quickly arriving at the shop he had seen that needed catalysis for its spirit grass.</p><p></p><p>Entering the shop, there was a middle-aged man in a cloth shirt with some stubble, looking amiable and business-minded.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning sensed him briefly and found that he was probably at the second level of Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man also noticed Chu Ning coming in.</p><p></p><p>He found that he couldn't sense Chu Ning's depth of cultivation and knew Chu Ning was at a higher level than himself, so his smile grew broader as he approached the counter to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"What can I do for this customer? My humble surname is Song, and I am the shopkeeper here."</p><p></p><p>It was normal that this Mr. Song couldn't sense Chu Ning's depth, because at this moment, Chu Ning had quietly released his cultivation aura to appear as the third level of Qi cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was clear that if he appeared at the second level of Qi cultivation, these shops might not be willing to hire him for these tasks, but the third level would be different.</p><p></p><p>The Qingxi Sect had many miscellaneous servant disciples at the third level of Qi cultivation who were skilled in spells.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning pointed directly at the sign outside and asked, "Shopkeeper, I saw the sign outside that says you need to catalyze some spirit grass?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct!" Shopkeeper Song's eyes lit up when Chu Ning asked about catalyzing the spirit grass.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this friend is skilled in the Catalyzing Technique?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded slightly. "I can instantly cast the Catalyzing Technique. If that's the only requirement, I should be able to do it."</p><p></p><p>Shopkeeper Song immediately came out from behind the counter and handed Chu Ning an iron vine seed, saying, "This is an iron vine seed. Could this friend please demonstrate first?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the iron vine seed, Chu Ning inwardly laughed as he was very familiar with it.</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, it made sense - after all, the iron vine was very common, so it was most suitable for testing.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning even wondered if the tests for spirit plant techniques in this market street all used the iron vine seed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Chu Ning didn't reach out to take the seed. Instead, he channeled his spiritual power, pointed at the seed in Shopkeeper Song's hand, and instantly cast the Catalyzing Technique on it.</p><p></p><p>The iron vine seed quickly sprouted a slender green vine, the appearance of a newly grown iron vine.</p><p></p><p>After doing this, Chu Ning looked at Shopkeeper Song.</p><p></p><p>"Can we discuss the compensation now?"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 37</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After seeing Chu Ning, Qiu Shunyi went up to greet him. </p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, you said yesterday to invite more people to make it livelier, so I asked a few more.</p><p></p><p>Little did I know that after asking around, it turned out to be quite fortuitous - everyone hadn't been to the market for a while, so there ended up being quite a few people."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the group of nearly twenty people and thought to himself, this is far more than just "quite a few."</p><p></p><p>The entire Spirit Plant House had only around thirty new disciples, and here was more than half of them.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning was secretly delighted. The more people, the better - safety in numbers.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, the more the merrier."</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning said this with a smile, Qiu Shunyi's expression became even more awkward.</p><p></p><p>"I just heard from others that Yuan Guang will also be coming."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning couldn't be happier. Even better - having a leader makes him seem more low-key.</p><p></p><p>If anything did happen, it wouldn't fall on him.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuan Guang's apparent dislike of him, Chu Ning didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the fifth level of Qi Refining, while the other was only at the third - what reason did he have to feel inferior?</p><p></p><p>"It's fine, we're all fellow disciples from the same sect, there's no enmity." Chu Ning said as he patted Qiu Shunyi's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi thought Chu Ning was comforting him. Seeing a senior from the sect arrive on a spirit boat, he quickly pulled Chu Ning over.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many people to fit on one boat, let's go ahead."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning didn't object - it was better to go to the market early so he could look around more, since this time he would be returning with everyone else.</p><p></p><p>Nearly ten people boarded the spirit boat together. Besides Chu Ning, Qiu Shunyi, and Lv Xingyuan who had gone to the market with them before, there were a few other cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, the remaining few clearly didn't seem very eager to leave first.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning could guess their thoughts - they probably wanted to wait for Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>This disciple, who had "simultaneously" reached the third level of Qi Refining with him, had apparently become the de facto leader among the new Spirit Plant House disciples.</p><p></p><p>It was not long after Chu Ning and the others left that Yuan Guang finally showed up fashionably late.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he appeared, quite a few people proactively surrounded him, clamoring:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Yuan, you're just arriving now? You didn't see earlier - as soon as Chu Ning heard you were coming, he rushed off first."</p><p></p><p>"He was probably too embarrassed to see Senior Brother Yuan. Last season he tried to show off by planting Spirit Ink Bamboo, if it weren't for the Spirit Rice he grew, he might have gone hungry this month.</p><p></p><p>Unlike Senior Brother Yuan, who has already started getting all kinds of cultivation resources."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Hearing these words, Yuan Guang forced an unnatural smile onto his face.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Zhuang Yunde told him last time that Chu Ning's spell cultivation was far better than his, and that Chu Ning had even been recommended as a student cultivator, he had been avoiding meeting Chu Ning as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Chu Ning was a rather low-key person who rarely showed up, so the two didn't have many chances to run into each other.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that Chu Ning would also be going to the market today.</p><p></p><p>However, after hearing that Chu Ning had already left, he let out a long sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>A smile returned to his face as Yuan Guang said, "We're all fellow disciples from the same sect, there's no need to gossip behind his back. Maybe...Senior Brother's Spirit Ink Bamboo turned out quite well."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Yuan is truly magnanimous."  </p><p>"Indeed, Senior Brother Yuan is so humble, addressing him as Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>A few flattering voices rang out from around him, making Yuan Guang's expression even more unnatural.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, at that moment, another senior from the sect arrived piloting a spirit boat.</p><p></p><p>Everyone then dispersed, as of course no one would dare discuss such things on a senior's spirit boat.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Chu Ning was completely unaware of everything that had happened after he left.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>He didn't even know that Yuan Guang had already learned from Zhuang Yunde that he had been recommended as a student cultivator. </p><p></p><p>As the group entered the market street, they gradually dispersed. Chu Ning continued on with Qiu Shunyi.</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning, everyone has had some income after a season of planting. Previously when we came out, they all bought some things. Do you want to buy anything?" Qiu Shunyi asked Chu Ning first.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "I need to buy some talisman papers for others."</p><p></p><p>Qiu Shunyi didn't think much of it, thinking it was just for some fellow cultivator near Chu Ning's residence who asked him to buy things, so he immediately said:</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to Yunhai Pavilion. It has the most comprehensive collection of items commonly used by cultivators, and the quality is also the best."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, come to think of it, I haven't been to Yunhai Pavilion yet." Chu Ning agreed, and the group continued walking deeper into the market street.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Chu Ning saw those temporary tasks again that were similar to what he had done before.</p><p></p><p>However, with dozens of spirit stones already in his pocket, he really didn't care much for those few stray spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Unless it was a task like Old Man Sun's that could earn ten to twenty spirit stones, that would be another story.</p><p></p><p>However, to avoid being recognized by others and accidentally revealing himself in front of everyone, Chu Ning didn't intend to go check on Old Man Sun's place again.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Old Man Sun's shop was slightly off to the side, so unless one intentionally headed in that direction, they wouldn't pass by it.</p><p></p><p>As the group leisurely strolled towards Yunhai Pavilion, they unexpectedly found that not only were there more people in the market street today, but there were also more people heading towards the center of the market.</p><p></p><p>Not understanding the reason, Chu Ning asked Qiu Shunyi, "Shunyi, why are there so many people today? Isn't this a bit unusual?"</p><p></p><p>"Today is the auction day that Yunhai Pavilion holds every two months," Qiu Shunyi said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>"You didn't know this and wanted to come watch the excitement, so you invited me to the market street today, right?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning finally realized it. He had thought Qiu Shunyi had a strong ability to rally people to have gathered so many.</p><p></p><p>It turned out everyone just wanted to join in the fun.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Chu Ning clearly didn't know much about it, Qiu Shunyi began explaining.</p><p></p><p>Yunhai Pavilion would hold a public auction day every two months, where they would put out some good items for auction.</p><p></p><p>Although the prices would be higher due to bidding, these items were usually not sold regularly.</p><p></p><p>So on this day, many cultivators would make a special trip to come.</p><p></p><p>There were even some at the Yuan Ying stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>To enhance its influence, Yunhai Pavilion would provide private rooms for capable buyers, but the entire auction process would be open to the public.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, many lower-level cultivators would also come to join in the excitement and broaden their horizons.</p><p></p><p>According to Qiu Shunyi, he had attended twice before.</p><p></p><p>After listening, Chu Ning finally had a general understanding of the situation.</p><p></p><p>By the time this conversation ended, the group had arrived at Yunhai Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering Yunhai Pavilion, there was first a large hall that could accommodate two to three thousand people, with rows of chairs arranged in a stepped formation.</p><p></p><p>The chairs towards the front were already occupied, with Chu Ning estimating around four to five hundred people.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many people today. The auction won't start for a little while, so we can sit closer to the front," Qiu Shunyi said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>He then turned and asked, "Chu Ning, do you want to buy the talisman papers first?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning looked at the counters crowded with people and the occasional cultivator going upstairs. Not wanting to join the commotion, he shook his head and said:</p><p></p><p>"The talisman papers can be bought anytime. Let's watch the auction first."</p><p></p><p>He didn't feel very safe buying things in a place with so many cultivators around.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning decided to just find a small shop outside later to buy some.</p><p></p><p>Since they had come here, he might as well watch this auction and broaden his horizons.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

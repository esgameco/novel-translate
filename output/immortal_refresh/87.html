        <h1>Chapter 87</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Ling Changqing slightly nodded his head, then coldly snorted and said:</p><p></p><p>"This is precisely the identity token of the Yin Demon Sect in the Emerald Secluded Mountains."  </p><p></p><p>"The Yin Demon Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing Ling Changqing's words, all the disciples of the Qingxi Sect present were shocked and exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Although there was occasional friction between the seven sects of the Qingxia Mountain Range, and competition in some markets.</p><p></p><p>But on the whole, the seven sects still coexisted harmoniously. </p><p></p><p>Almost every disciple of the Qingxi Sect, after joining, would hear about the name of the Yin Demon Sect in the Emerald Secluded Mountains.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that this sect practiced evil arts, was cruel and committed massacres, and had even brutally slaughtered an entire city of mortals before.</p><p></p><p>However, because the two mountain ranges were quite far apart, with numerous mortal cities in between.</p><p></p><p>Plus the righteous and demonic sects were opposed, so no one had ever seen those demonic disciples.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, Ling Changqing said those wandering disciples were from the Yin Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>This undoubtedly caused the crowd to be extremely surprised.</p><p></p><p>If the others were just surprised, then Chu Ning's heart was like a raging storm at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He now vaguely guessed that those people like Du Han who appeared in the market town late at night after leaving were most likely from the Yin Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>This token was the Yin Demon Sect's token, and since Qi Chongmao had this bamboo plaque, did that mean he was also from the Yin Demon Sect?</p><p></p><p>If he was from the Yin Demon Sect, how could Qi Chongmao be in the Qingxi Sect?</p><p></p><p>And the couple Lu Yunfang and Luo Hongping who appeared later seemed to be looking for Qi Chongmao.  </p><p></p><p>Could they also be from the Yin Demon Sect?</p><p></p><p>Demonic infiltration? Some scheme? But why would it be menial servant disciples?</p><p></p><p>There were also Yin Demon Sect disciples appearing during this beast disaster, could it be related too?</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning was puzzled, that Du Han had also asked Ling Changqing:</p><p></p><p>"Master Ling, why would people from the Yin Demon Sect appear near our Qingxia Mountain Range?"</p><p></p><p>Ling Changqing's brow slightly furrowed, and he gently shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Those who came are all low-level disciples.</p><p></p><p>It's not clear yet whether this was the independent action of these disciples discovering the beast disaster and coming on their own, or if there were instructions from higher ups in the demonic path.</p><p></p><p>I have already reported this matter on the way here to the sect, and the sect will immediately send people from the Law Enforcement Hall to purge them."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Ling Changqing's gaze swept over everyone again.</p><p></p><p>"I took out this token just to remind you, before the sect completes the purge, you must be vigilant and not go out recklessly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Everyone responded in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Enforcer Ling, what is the strength of the Yin Demon Sect?" This time the one asking was Ding Bo.</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!" Ling Changqing's face became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"It's said this sect has more than a dozen experts at the Golden Dan realm, not one of our seven sects can compare.</p><p></p><p>If the seven great sects unite, we should be able to contend with them."</p><p></p><p>"Woah!"</p><p></p><p>When Ling Changqing's words fell, the disciples immediately erupted into an uproar.</p><p></p><p>"Over a dozen Golden Dan experts?"</p><p></p><p>"It requires the seven great sects to unite just to match them?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew of the Yin Demon Sect's evil reputation, but did not expect this sect to be so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning also felt a chill, the Yin Demon Sect was truly so formidable.</p><p></p><p>He finally confirmed that when he killed Qi Chongmao initially, he had indeed provoked a huge trouble.</p><p></p><p>But if the Yin Demon Sect was so powerful, why would they infiltrate with just menial servant disciples?</p><p></p><p>It's known that although there were many Qi Refining disciples in the Qingxi Sect,</p><p></p><p>The ones with real authority were Foundation Establishment cultivators like the Enforcers.</p><p></p><p>"Qi Refining disciples, unless..." </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning suddenly thought of the missions in the sect that only Qi Refining disciples could take.</p><p></p><p>"I can't mention this to anyone now." Chu Ning immediately became vigilant.</p><p></p><p>He was almost 100% certain that since the Yin Demon Sect infiltrated even the menial servants, they definitely had a grand conspiracy.  </p><p></p><p>If there were Yin Demon Sect disciples among the menial servants, what about the outer sect disciples, or even these Enforcers?</p><p></p><p>There might be many Yin Demon Sect people within the Qingxi Sect!</p><p></p><p>And if the Yin Demon Sect knew he had discovered their infiltration plot, the danger he could face...</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Chu Ning couldn't help but feel a chill all over.</p><p></p><p>"You all can rest in the market town these days."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ling Changqing's voice rang out again, addressing those Qingxi Sect disciples who came to assist.</p><p></p><p>"I need to station in the market town for the next two days, so I can't escort you all back.</p><p></p><p>Wait for the other sect people to arrive, then you can return to the sect together. </p><p></p><p>Du Han, you lead them."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" After replying, Du Han led everyone to leave.</p><p></p><p>Ling Changqing's gaze then turned to Gu Xiaoqing, Chu Ning and the others.  </p><p></p><p>"You all lost quite a few things for the sect this time. If you need the various halls of the sect to replenish anything, you can tell me. I can continue sending requests for people from the sect to bring them over.</p><p></p><p>I won't be returning to the sect for a while, the businesses in this market town have been delayed for a few days, so the shops need to reopen."</p><p></p><p>Eliminating the beast disaster was important, but the income from the various market towns also impacted Ling Changqing's own interests.</p><p></p><p>So he naturally also placed great importance on it.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Gu Xiaoqing, Shen Zhengquan, and Luo Yiping all spoke up, asking Ling Changqing to help request things from the sect.  </p><p></p><p>And from their words, it seemed the three had indeed suffered considerable losses this time.</p><p></p><p>They were even missing some basic items.</p><p></p><p>After asking the three of them, Ling Changqing's gaze turned to Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>"Enforcer Ling, I'd like to request the sect to bring more talisman papers. If there are none, spirit bamboo or purple crystal bamboo will also work.</p><p></p><p>I've sold a lot of talismans recently, so my talisman papers are almost used up."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Chu Ning's words, the others exchanged glances, their expressions a bit unnatural.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Chu Ning said he wouldn't go kill demonic beasts, they mocked him. </p><p></p><p>But now, after a few days, due to the interference from the Yin Demon Sect, they have suffered considerable losses.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Chu Ning has been peacefully selling talisman papers here and earning a great deal.</p><p></p><p>When Lin Changqing heard this, he also nodded slightly, then was about to walk out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning hurriedly transmitted his voice, "Executive Lin, I still have something to report to you."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing immediately paused his steps slightly, then said to Gu Xiaoqing and the others, "You all go back first, I still need to understand the situation in the market these past few days from Chu Ning."</p><p></p><p>Gu Xiaoqing and the others had no suspicions, and left Chu Ning's stall on their own.</p><p></p><p>However, Luo Yiping's face currently showed some embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, regarding everything that had happened before, he still felt somewhat uncomfortable in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After the group left, Lin Changqing turned his head and asked Chu Ning, "What do you want to tell me?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Executive Lin."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning responded, then took out spirit stones from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"These past few days, due to the beast calamity, many people in the market have been buying talisman papers. This disciple has accumulated some spirit stones, and wants to pay the monthly rent for the talisman stall in advance. It's not safe to carry them on myself."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing scanned with his spiritual sense and got a rough idea of the number of spirit stones Chu Ning took out.</p><p></p><p>"Five hundred and fifty spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"This is the monthly rent for the talisman stall this month," said Chu Ning, separating fifty spirit stones from the other five hundred.</p><p></p><p>First, he pushed the five hundred spirit stones in front of Lin Changqing, then picked up the other fifty.</p><p></p><p>"I want to ask Executive Lin for a favor with these fifty spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Lin Changqing's gaze flickered, but he didn't say anything as he looked at Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning then continued, "This disciple travels between the spirit field and the market, although the distance isn't long.</p><p></p><p>But with my low cultivation, if there are any special circumstances, it would be inconvenient.</p><p></p><p>So I want to ask the executive to help me find a suitable flying artifact."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing looked at Chu Ning with some surprise, "Find a flying artifact?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded. He had actually had this idea for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when he rode the executives' spirit boats, he found it very convenient, so he had always wanted to purchase a flying artifact.</p><p></p><p>But at that time, he didn't have many spirit stones, and it also wasn't that urgent.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had left the sect, Chu Ning felt this item was very urgent.</p><p></p><p>After all, his Wind Traveling Art was too slow, and his Escape Talisman couldn't support long-distance flight.</p><p></p><p>With a flying artifact, at least he would have some assurance of escape if there was any danger.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Chu Ning had earned quite a lot of spirit stones this time.</p><p></p><p>As long as the price wasn't too outrageous, he felt he could afford it.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had left the sect, Chu Ning didn't know where to find one for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Shen Zhengquan from the Refining Pavilion might be able to get one, but after a few incidents, there was obviously some distance between them.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning naturally wouldn't go to him.</p><p></p><p>Recalling what Zhuang Yunde had said about Lin Changqing before, Chu Ning decided to try asking him.</p><p></p><p>"Artifacts that can carry multiple people are not easy to buy. But if it's just for single person use, I can find one," Lin Changqing said, the chill in his voice lessening slightly. He collected the two portions of spirit stones without a sound.</p><p></p><p>"You're asking me for help to find one, so you must not be planning to exchange for one within the sect."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing pondered briefly, then said, "Since many disciples went out on missions previously, the best artifacts may indeed be gone from the sect.</p><p></p><p>Here's what we'll do - after things stabilize here, in a few days I'll take you to Wind Gorge Market. It's much closer to us than to the sect.</p><p></p><p>We'll go take a look at the Cloud Sea Pavilion there. They should have artifacts that meet your needs."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, a hint of joy appeared on Chu Ning's face.</p><p></p><p>This Wind Gorge Market was actually a larger market near Wind Gorge Valley, even bigger than Qinghe Market near Qingxi Sect.</p><p></p><p>Since Lin Changqing was willing to take Chu Ning there to choose one himself, it was naturally the best outcome.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, spirit stones open many paths.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already brought it up, Chu Ning continued, "Executive Lin, these past few days, the spirit plant shops haven't received any valuable spirit plants.</p><p></p><p>And I don't dare go cultivate the twenty mu spirit field outside, not knowing if it has been damaged.</p><p></p><p>The harvest from the spirit plant room this month will likely..."</p><p></p><p>Lin Changqing immediately waved his hand and said, "I'm aware of this matter. In the next day or two, some executives from the sect will come over.</p><p></p><p>We'll clear out the remaining Yin Demon Sect remnants and any third-grade demonic beasts in the area. After a couple of days, you can safely go farm.</p><p></p><p>As for the losses, go check the spirit field then. If there are any, tell me, and I'll request an exemption for this month's rent from the sect."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning felt grateful once again.</p><p></p><p>His words also implied that if the spirit field had a harvest, he would give Lin Changqing an appropriate amount.</p><p></p><p>This immediately caused the latter's cold expression to lessen further.</p><p></p><p>After Lin Changqing left, Chu Ning returned to his room, a smile appearing on his face as well.</p><p></p><p>The exemption for this month's rent should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred spirit stones was no small amount.</p><p></p><p>Although he had earned quite a lot of spirit stones these past few days.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning began tallying up his spirit stone earnings over the past few days.</p><p></p><p>When he calculated it, he was given quite a fright.</p><p></p><p>Even after giving Lin Changqing 550 spirit stones for the monthly rent, Chu Ning currently had over 4,200 spirit stones on him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

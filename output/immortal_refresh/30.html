        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang!" Chu Ning cupped his fists in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde's round face still had the same smile as before.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, was the spirit rice harvest decent? I'm here on behalf of the sect to collect the portion that must be handed over."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning nodded, "It was decent. The spirit rice is inside, Senior Brother please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde followed Chu Ning into the house, reached out to grab some spirit rice, and then nodded in satisfaction:</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, Junior Brother's spirit rice is of superior quality. </p><p></p><p>According to the sect's rules, disciples must hand over half of their average spirit crop yield to the sect.</p><p></p><p>The average spirit rice yield is 700 jin of paddy per mu, with a milling rate of 70%, so 490 jin per mu. For 5 mu, that's 2,450 jin, so you need to hand over 1,225 jin."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Zhuang Yunde smiled and said:</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu's spirit rice is of superior quality, so according to the sect's regulations, we can reduce the amount slightly. Just hand over 1,100 jin."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Chu Ning hurriedly thanked him with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The price of spirit rice is around 50 jin per low-grade spirit stone, so Zhuang Yunde just helped Chu Ning save two and a half low-grade spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Chu Ning didn't tell Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>His spirit rice yield was 800 jin per mu due to the effects of his Qingmu Chunhua technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the milling rate reached 75%, so the total spirit rice yield was around 3,000 jin. So in reality, he had stored some more at home.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, they separated out 1,100 jin of spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde then took out a leather pouch from his waist, gave it a casual slap, and the 1,100 jin of spirit rice instantly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Chu Ning's gaze unconsciously fell on that pouch.</p><p></p><p>"This is a storage pouch," Zhuang Yunde explained upon seeing Chu Ning's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"This one was specially bestowed by the sect for my use, with a larger space.</p><p></p><p>For regular storage pouches with smaller spaces, you can buy one for 20 spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Junior Brother Chu, since your spirit rice and spirit ink bamboo harvests are so good, you should be able to afford one."</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning was tempted but still shook his head, "It's too expensive, I can't afford it right now."</p><p></p><p>This wasn't him being deliberately humble - he really didn't have that many spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>After handing over the spirit rice harvest to the sect this season, he had 1,900 jin left.</p><p></p><p>Converting that to spirit stones, it was only 38, so he wasn't willing to spend 20 of them on a storage pouch all at once.</p><p></p><p>After all, Chu Ning hadn't even tried using spirit stones for cultivation yet.</p><p></p><p>Of course, things would be different later on when he harvested the spirit ink bamboo and could make talisman papers.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the spirit ink bamboo, Chu Ning immediately took a bag and filled it with about 50 jin of spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>Then, without drawing attention to it, he handed it to Zhuang Yunde who was about to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Zhuang, thank you for your guidance recently. This bag of rice is a small token of Junior Brother's gratitude."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, you're too kind!" Zhuang Yunde said, but didn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he reached out to take it and put it into a smaller storage pouch with practiced ease.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother Chu, I'll take my leave then and come back in a few days to collect the spirit ink bamboo."</p><p></p><p>"Safe travels, Senior Brother Zhuang."</p><p></p><p>After seeing Zhuang Yunde out of the courtyard, Chu Ning slowly closed the gate and returned to the house.</p><p></p><p>As the saying goes, the cultivation world isn't just about fighting and killing, but also about human relations and worldly affairs. This is indeed true.</p><p></p><p>This Senior Brother Zhuang is a bit greedy, but he does put in effort to help.</p><p></p><p>With Chu Ning's gesture today, he should be able to get some consideration for the upcoming spirit ink bamboo harvest as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, regarding the deal they had made about recommending him in the past, Chu Ning also had other plans.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, after leaving Chu Ning's courtyard, Zhuang Yunde headed to the residences of others.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at where Yuan Guang lived.</p><p></p><p>Following the normal procedure, Zhuang Yunde...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>After collecting Yuan Guangling's rice harvest, Zhuang Yunde was preparing to leave. </p><p></p><p>Yuan Guang cleared his throat lightly and called out to stop Zhuang Yunde:</p><p></p><p>"Senior Martial Brother Zhuang, I've heard that the sect can regularly recommend one disciple to learn crafting talismans. Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde, who was about to leave, turned around and smiled at Yuan Guang.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Junior Martial Brother Yuan wants to recommend himself?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Guang rubbed his hands and quickly replied, "I hope Senior Martial Brother can make it happen for me."</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde immediately shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You're too late. That recommendation has already been given to Chu Ning."</p><p></p><p>"Chu Ning?"</p><p></p><p>Yuan Guang exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"What...what was he recommended to learn?"</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde didn't hide it and said directly, "Talisman paper making. Chu Ning grows spirit ink bamboo, which is most suitable for making talisman paper."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Yuan Guang immediately became anxious and said, "But the quality of the spirit ink bamboo he grows is not good at all, how could he be recommended to learn talisman paper making?"</p><p></p><p>"Who says the quality of his spirit ink bamboo is not good?" Zhuang Yunde looked at Yuan Guang in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Then he seemed to vaguely understand something, recalling the time when he led everyone to divide the spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, "This Junior Martial Brother Chu is really low-key. For such a long time, he hasn't boasted to anyone."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Zhuang Yunde smiled at Yuan Guang, his tone carrying a hint of playfulness.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Martial Brother Chu Ning's cultivation of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art is really excellent. The spirit ink bamboo he grows is also of superb quality."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Zhuang Yunde's words, the anxious expression on Yuan Guang's face instantly turned to one of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Then, his astonished expression became one of embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Recalling the encounter on the road a few days ago, when everyone showed off his purple yam fruits in front of Chu Ning, Yuan Guang's face felt burning hot.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yuan Guang finally realized that since Chu Ning's cultivation of spirit ink bamboo could gain Zhuang Yunde's approval, his skills in spell cultivation and spirit plant cultivation must be higher than his own.</p><p></p><p>He regretted calling the others to come see him harvest those purple yam fruits in a few days.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how other new disciples would know the truth in the future, Yuan Guang's face alternated between flushing red and turning pale.</p><p></p><p>Under Zhuang Yunde's smiling gaze that seemed to see through everything, he felt like finding a hole to crawl into.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even notice when Zhuang Yunde left.</p><p></p><p>When Yuan Guang raised his head again, wanting to ask for more details, there was no trace of Zhuang Yunde left.</p><p></p><p>Two days later, Chu Ning accidentally ran into Yuan Guang on the road.</p><p></p><p>The other person left hurriedly with a complicated expression, which made Chu Ning quite puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, Chu Ning didn't dwell on it. His mind remained focused on cultivating the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit and the upcoming harvest of the spirit ink bamboo.</p><p></p><p>After completing the harvest of the spirit rice, Chu Ning no longer went to the intermediate spirit fields.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he either cultivated the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit in his courtyard or practiced the Nine Revolutions Body Refining Technique.</p><p></p><p>Or, he would go to the spirit ink bamboo field and use the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art to cultivate the Green Wood Evergreen Skill.</p><p></p><p>Ten days later, it was time to harvest the spirit ink bamboo.</p><p></p><p>Although harvesting each stalk of spirit ink bamboo was slightly slower than spirit rice, the overall quantity was not as large.</p><p></p><p>So the harvesting time was about the same, just a few days.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning had been waiting for this day.</p><p></p><p>After all the spirit ink bamboo was harvested, without waiting for Zhuang Yunde to come and collect the harvest, he couldn't help but start making talisman paper.</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, it's important to keep up with the latest chapters during the new book release period.

        <h1>Chapter 54</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The location chosen for the promotion assessment in District C was a medium-grade spirit field in District C. </p><p></p><p>District C did not have any low-grade spirit fields, but its medium-grade spirit fields were already somewhat better than the high-grade spirit fields in District D.</p><p></p><p>When Chu Ning and the others arrived, dozens of people had already gathered in the fields. </p><p></p><p>What surprised Chu Ning slightly was that Cao Dongxin and Shang Zhaoxiang were also present.</p><p></p><p>However, after a moment's thought, Chu Ning felt it was normal. The two of them had already been at the fifth level of Qi refining for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that making greater breakthroughs in District D was not easy, so it was normal for them to try their luck and see if they could obtain better resources by coming to District C.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's appearance also surprised the two of them to some extent. Cao Dongxin continued to have an expression as if others owed him something.</p><p></p><p>As for Shang Zhaoxiang, he smiled at Chu Ning, but since they were far apart, he did not say much.</p><p></p><p>After Chu Ning and the others arrived, more people continued to come, eventually reaching nearly a hundred people.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, Chu Ning was not the only one who wanted to advance and obtain better resources.</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, He Changyou appeared, accompanied by several disciple enforcers from the Spirit Plant House, including Zhuang Yunde.</p><p></p><p>"You are all here to participate in the promotion assessment. There's no need for further explanation. The assessment method is very simple.</p><p></p><p>I will give each of you a blood teak seed. Within half a day, the top six people who grow the best quality plants will complete the promotion."</p><p></p><p>After He Changyou finished speaking, many people in the field already looked displeased, including Cao Dongxin and Shang Zhaoxiang.</p><p></p><p>The blood teak was notoriously difficult to cultivate, requiring several years of time before it could be harvested.</p><p></p><p>Yet now, He Changyou was only giving them half a day to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>He Changyou did not provide any explanation and directly instructed the enforcers beside him to distribute the seeds to everyone.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the blood teak seeds, Chu Ning and the others were arranged to stand apart from each other, with a distance of five zhang between each person to avoid interfering with each other's spellcasting.</p><p></p><p>Once He Changyou saw that everyone was in position, he waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"The assessment begins!"</p><p></p><p>Following He Changyou's words, nearly a hundred people immediately sprang into action.</p><p></p><p>During the past half month, Chu Ning had roughly understood the spirit plants suitable for cultivation in District C, including the blood teak.</p><p></p><p>He first placed the dark red blood teak seed in the soil of the spirit field, burying it about one finger-joint deep. Then he sat cross-legged on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Catalyzing Technique, instant cast!</p><p></p><p>Without any hand seals, he simply waved his hand, and a spell formula struck the spot where the blood teak seed was buried in the soil.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Chu Ning, some others capable of the Catalyzing Technique also began casting their spells.</p><p></p><p>However, not everyone in the field could instantly cast the Catalyzing Technique at this time.</p><p></p><p>For example, Cao Dongxin and others were still forming hand seals to gather spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning and those who could instantly cast had already gained some time advantage over the others.</p><p></p><p>Catalyzing the blood teak was indeed not a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's instant cast of the Catalyzing Technique saved a bit of time, but in the overall catalyzing process, it was not too significant.</p><p></p><p>However, after repeated castings of the Catalyzing Technique, the time and effect would be different.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for Chu Ning, the instant cast of the Catalyzing Technique was not just for saving time.</p><p></p><p>The instant cast Catalyzing Technique not only conserved spiritual power but also had a better catalyzing effect.</p><p></p><p>As the spiritual power from the first Catalyzing Technique fully merged into the blood teak seed, Chu Ning unhesitatingly cast the second one.</p><p></p><p>Then the third, the fourth...</p><p></p><p>Catalyzing the blood teak was very difficult. In terms of difficulty, it was the most difficult spirit plant Chu Ning had encountered so far in catalyzing.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Chu Ning catalyzed the Seven-Star Spirit Fruit, he had only used ten Catalyzing Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Chu Ning had used a total of twenty catalyzing spells before the blood teak seed finally reacted and began to crack its shell. </p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's spiritual sense perceived the changes in the blood teak seed, and he immediately felt delighted.</p><p></p><p>The catalyzing spell was cast again. This time, his spiritual power was released more precisely, directly penetrating through the cracked gap and striking into the interior of the seed.</p><p></p><p>This was completely an unconscious action by Chu Ning. After all, he had not catalyzed any spirit plants since cultivating the Refining Spirit Art. </p><p></p><p>However, this method produced an amazing effect.</p><p></p><p>As Chu Ning's spell struck, the cracked gap in the blood teak seed instantly widened, and a tender sprout directly grew out, about to emerge from the soil.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, how could Chu Ning hesitate? Another catalyzing spell was released.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, that tender sprout grew as if aided by divine forces, directly breaking through the soil.</p><p></p><p>"Eh?"</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning's movements were first noticed by He Changyu.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept over, and he discovered that Chu Ning was actually the first to complete the catalysis of the blood teak gift, immediately revealing an astonished expression.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, Zhuang Yunde and the others also noticed and turned their gazes towards Chu Ning.</p><p></p><p>A flash of surprise appeared on Zhuang Yunde's face, but then his round face regained its usual smile.</p><p></p><p>"This Junior Brother Chu can really surprise himself."</p><p></p><p>At this time, Chu Ning had already stood up and begun performing the hand seals for the Sweet Rain Art.</p><p></p><p>Just as Chu Ning stood up and started the hand seals for the Sweet Rain Art, four more people also successively completed the catalysis.</p><p></p><p>Two were men in their late twenties, and the other two were surprisingly Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang.</p><p></p><p>The five of them simultaneously performed the Sweet Rain Art, but Chu Ning, who had started first, fell behind.</p><p></p><p>The reason was simple - the other four could instantly cast the Sweet Rain Art.</p><p></p><p>But Chu Ning took some time to complete the hand seals before finishing the Sweet Rain Art.</p><p></p><p>Zhuang Yunde silently shook his head at this moment.</p><p></p><p>From his observation of the quality of the Ink Bamboo that Chu Ning cultivated, Chu Ning's mastery of the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art should definitely not be low.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't cast it instantly, it shouldn't be much different.</p><p></p><p>Yet this even simpler Sweet Rain Art, how could Chu Ning not be able to cast it instantly?</p><p></p><p>However, Zhuang Yunde soon realized the reason.</p><p></p><p>He recalled that Chu Ning had previously told him that he was extremely compatible with wood-type techniques and spells like the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Sweet Rain Arts of the few people had all concluded.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, Luo Hongping and Lu Yunfang were the first to use the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art, and it seemed they could also cast it instantly.</p><p></p><p>Not just them, even the disciples with the surnames Lu and Chen could instantly cast the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Chu Ning did not lag too far behind them and soon completed casting the Sweet Rain Art as well.</p><p></p><p>Instant cast! Green Wood Spring Bloom Art!</p><p></p><p>Although Chu Ning had reserved some spiritual power, he did not hold back on his spells.</p><p></p><p>His instantly cast Green Wood Spring Bloom Art was not inferior to the other four at all and was even better at gathering spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Chu Ning unleashed one Green Wood Spring Bloom Art after another, casting nearly twenty of them in total.</p><p></p><p>After a half hour's pause, he used the Green Wood Spring Bloom Art again.</p><p></p><p>The blood teak in front of Chu Ning grew at a pace no weaker than the other four disciples at the Refining Qi sixth level.</p><p></p><p>Until a few hours later, He Changyu's voice suddenly rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Time's up, everyone stop casting."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Chu Ning and the others immediately stopped casting.</p><p></p><p>The advancement assessment had officially concluded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

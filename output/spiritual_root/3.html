        <h1>Chapter 3</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Concentrating his spiritual power into his eyes, he immediately saw the person's face clearly.</p><p></p><p>"The visitor has ill intentions!"Zhou Xun inwardly became cautious. </p><p></p><p>It was Wei Shangren.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Zhou, Brother Zhou, you've finally returned. Wei has been waiting for you for a full hour!" </p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Xun slightly raised his eyes and casually cupped his fist in salutation:</p><p></p><p>"It's Brother Wei. I don't know what brings you to my humble abode?"</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday when I went to work, I didn't see Brother Zhou, so I was quite worried. After inquiring, I learned that Brother Zhou had actually been fired. So I came to visit and see how you are doing!" The young man smiled cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wei's kindness is appreciated." Zhou Xun perfunctorily said a polite phrase, about to take out his token to open the door.</p><p></p><p>Wei Shangren hurriedly laughed loudly: </p><p>"Why does Brother Zhou need to reject me from a thousand miles away? Although we've had some disagreements, we worked together after all. Won't you invite me in for a cup of spirit tea?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wei need not put on airs. Since you are an ill-intentioned guest, I won't entertain you further. Please leave!" Zhou Xun was too lazy to engage with the snake any longer.</p><p></p><p>Wei Shangren smiled fully, glancing towards the west with satisfaction:</p><p>"It seems Brother Zhou came from West Square, surely you went to look for work? How did it go? If Brother Zhou is amenable, I can introduce you to a position or two!"</p><p></p><p>"After all, I am now a talisman apprentice, so I do have some face."</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for Brother Wei to trouble yourself over this!" Zhou Xun remained calm and composed. His left hand gripped the token, infusing it with spiritual power to cast a blue light on the main door.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Zhou Xun ignore him completely, his expression not changing at all, Wei Shangren couldn't help feeling a twinge of anger. He lowered his voice to continue provoking:</p><p>"Doesn't Brother Zhou wonder why you were fired?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun let out a light laugh:</p><p>"For this matter, besides you, who else could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Wei Shangren nodded with satisfaction:</p><p>"Brother Zhou is indeed very intelligent. Four days ago, my elder brother was promoted to the next talisman master rank. After receiving the news, I immediately found the manager and had you fired. With my elder brother's face, he naturally didn't dare refuse!"</p><p></p><p>Every talisman master is a core member of the Talisman Bureau. Moreover, his elder brother is only in his early twenties but has the potential to reach the highest master rank in the future. His status will increase greatly, far above those managers.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, even the managers who originally favored Zhou Xun didn't dare speak up.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Xun smiled faintly, completely unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>He had the Secret Spring Scripture, his future destined to be illustrious. This temporary setback was just a small amusement on his path to heaven.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Wei Shangren angrily said:</p><p>"Zhou Xun, you really can act. Without the shop's work, you probably can't even afford to rent this house anymore."</p><p></p><p>"At that time, you'll be kicked out of Red Leaf Lane, only able to live scattered among those wild cultivators outside. Living day to day, who knows when you might die in a stinking gutter. When that happens, I'll be sure to burn some extra incense sticks for you!"</p><p></p><p>"But I'm different. Now that I'm a talisman apprentice, I'll become a master in the future, an elite of Red Leaf Lane from now on!"</p><p></p><p>"Then please allow me to congratulate Brother Wei in advance!" Zhou Xun laughed heartily, then strode into the main door.</p><p></p><p>Watching Zhou Xun's back, a murderous intent flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"My brother said, if you don't kill the snake, you'll be harmed by it. If you act, then put in full effort to crush it dead. Only a dead enemy is a good enemy!"</p><p></p><p>"I was able to get rid of your uncle, so I can naturally get rid of you too!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Shangren immediately turned and walked in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Back in the house, Zhou Xun's face was deep in thought!</p><p></p><p>Wei Shangren's visit this time did remind him that with his personality, he definitely wouldn't let this go so easily and must have further schemes.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Wei Shangren's elder brother is currently only a low-rank talisman master without much influence yet.</p><p></p><p>As long as he had enough spirit stones to live within Red Leaf Lane, they would have no way to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>Fighting is strictly prohibited in Red Leaf Lane, the rules extremely strict. Even with grievances, they must leave Red Leaf Lane to fight, or go through the Lane's justice system.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Death Platform. </p><p></p><p>Apart from this, any internal fighting by cultivators in the town is punishable by execution.</p><p></p><p>Two hundred years ago, there was a cultivator at the Foundation Establishment stage who secretly killed an enemy by relying on his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>When the cultivator died in Redleaf Town, the four major clans simultaneously took action. Eventually, the investigation led to this Foundation Establishment cultivator. The four patriarchs of the Wu, Lin, Sun, and Li clans of Redleaf Town personally captured and publicly executed him.  </p><p></p><p>Since then, Redleaf Town has maintained strict discipline. A large number of cultivators have taken up residence in Redleaf Town, making it even more prosperous and ranking among the top five in the entire Xu nation.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou Xun felt slightly relieved.</p><p></p><p>After a simple dinner, he entered the quiet room with some anticipation to begin his daily cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The next day, just as Zhou Xun finished drinking his spirit rice porridge, there was a knock at the door.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun got up, opened the main door, and a plump figure squeezed in.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's Manager Lin. What brings you to my place?" Zhou Xun hurriedly invited him to sit down and brewed a cup of spirit tea for him.</p><p></p><p>The place where Zhou Xun lived belonged to the Willow Lane in the southeast area of Redleaf Town, and this Manager Lin was in charge of managing the houses on Zhou Xun's lane. His cultivation level was the fifth layer of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun had no relationship with him.</p><p></p><p>Apart from collecting rent, this manager had never visited at any other time.</p><p></p><p>"I heard you were expelled from the Wondrous Talisman Pavilion?" Manager Lin held the spirit tea brewed by Zhou Xun in his left hand, gently blew on it, and then took a sip.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Manager Lin is well-informed!" Zhou Xun answered calmly.</p><p></p><p>Manager Lin nodded and got straight to the point:</p><p></p><p>"You can probably guess the reason for my visit â€“ to collect next year's rent. However..." The plump manager paused, his eyes revealing a hint of complexity as he looked at Zhou Xun.</p><p></p><p>"However, someone passed down a message telling me not to rent this house to you anymore."</p><p></p><p>"But I, Lin, am not someone who is controlled by others. I will still rent this house to you, but the rent will increase by fifty percent. Otherwise, I won't be able to explain myself!"</p><p></p><p>"Consider whether you want to rent it or not!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he raised the spirit tea and took another sip.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty percent!" Upon hearing this number, Zhou Xun fell silent. After a long while, he finally asked, "I wonder if the person who passed down the message has the surname Wei?"</p><p></p><p>"Correct! That person advanced to become a Talisman Master at the age of twenty-three and is currently in his prime. He has a good chance of reaching the first-rank upper-grade in the future. I advise you not to offend him!"</p><p></p><p>"A Talisman Master?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that person successfully advanced to become a Talisman Master three days ago!"</p><p></p><p>So that's how it is. Zhou Xun instantly understood. As someone from the Wondrous Talisman Pavilion, how could he not know the status of a first-rank upper-grade Talisman Master?</p><p></p><p>It was definitely no less than that of a cultivator who had perfected the Qi Refining stage.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was expelled so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your advice, Manager. I will remember it. I'll rent this house!"</p><p></p><p>The houses in the southeast area of Redleaf Town were the cheapest. Apart from this place, he couldn't afford to rent anywhere else.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun bowed and immediately took out 150 spirit essences and gently placed them down.</p><p></p><p>After Manager Lin counted and confirmed the amount, he pocketed it and left.</p><p></p><p>After Manager Lin's departure, Zhou Xun fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the Wei brothers had struck him directly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this Manager Lin was helpful. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to rent a house and would have to live outside Redleaf Town with his second-layer Qi Refining cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Wei brothers only needed to spread the word that he was from the Hundred Talisman Pavilion and had accumulated a large number of spirit stones, and he would certainly end up dead without a proper burial.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a chill ran through Zhou Xun's heart.</p><p></p><p>"I underestimated them. I didn't expect the deceitful Wei Shangren to have such cunning schemes!"</p><p></p><p>"I must find an opportunity to eliminate them, or I will never have peace!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

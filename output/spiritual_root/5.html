        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Returning home, Zhou Xun couldn't wait to close the main door. </p><p></p><p>He then took out the medicine bottle, gently removing the stopper. A medicinal fragrance and faint spiritual energy wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun's spirit was instantly invigorated. He carefully examined it for a while, then put the stopper back on.</p><p></p><p>"Once I've eaten the spirit-infused rice and my body is brimming with spiritual energy, then taking this medicine will have double the effect!"</p><p></p><p>Although feeling somewhat excited, Zhou Xun still restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a knocking sound came from outside the door.</p><p></p><p>"Knock knock knock--"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun hurriedly stuffed the medicine bottle into his bosom, patting it down neatly. Feeling that others wouldn't be able to detect it, he then got up and opened the main door.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother Zhou!" A robust voice rang out.  </p><p></p><p>What entered his eyes was a tall, dark-skinned youth who looked around the same age as Zhou Xun. In his hands he was carrying a completely snow-white rabbit that weighed over ten jin.</p><p></p><p>"Da Hai, when did you return!" Zhou Xun exclaimed in pleasant surprise.</p><p></p><p>This person was none other than Zhou Xun's childhood friend - Shan Xionghai. He was one year younger than Zhou Xun, hence addressing him as Big Brother.</p><p></p><p>What he was carrying in his hands was that delicacy that Zhou Xun had endless cravings for - the Snow Mole Rabbit.</p><p></p><p>"This story is a long one. We should go inside and prepare this Snow Mole Rabbit first, and eat while we talk!" The youth smacked his lips a few times as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Please, please come in--"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun hurriedly ushered Shan Xionghai inside.</p><p></p><p>Before long, the Snow Mole Rabbit had been prepared, and the two ate while chatting.</p><p></p><p>Shan Xionghai lounged sideways on the chair, shamelessly tearing off a huge rabbit leg to devour heartily.</p><p></p><p>"Da Hai, I've noticed many demon-hunting cultivators returning to Hongye Town. Did something happen?"</p><p></p><p>Recalling the groups of demon-hunting cultivators he had seen in Hongye Town over the past two days, Zhou Xun asked.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother is still as smart as ever," the youth said indistinctly with his mouth full of rabbit meat.</p><p></p><p>"Something seems to have happened at the heart of Mount Baimang, causing large numbers of demon beasts to spread outwards!"</p><p></p><p>"Spread outwards?" Zhou Xun asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This Mount Baimang stretched for unknown millions of li, with countless demon beasts living within.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the center, the higher the level of the demon beasts. The demon-hunting cultivators of Hongye Town made their living by hunting low-level demon beasts on the outskirts of Mount Baimang.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, some even claim to have seen second-grade demon beasts, which are equivalent to the Foundation Establishment stage for us cultivators! Normally we'd only see one every few years, but this time, the reports mention no less than five of them!"</p><p></p><p>"Because this happened so suddenly, inflicting heavy casualties on the demon-hunting cultivators, my second uncle decided to return to Hongye Town first to avoid the brunt of it."</p><p></p><p>So that was it. Zhou Xun nodded in understanding.</p><p></p><p>Normally, demon beasts spreading outwards would be a feast for demon-hunting cultivators like them.</p><p></p><p>However, with even second-grade demon beasts appearing, it was beyond what they as mere Qi Refining cultivators could handle. Returning to Hongye Town was the right move.</p><p></p><p>The two then recounted what had happened since they parted ways. Shan Xionghai spoke of his experiences hunting demon beasts, which sounded ordinary from his mouth, but Zhou Xun understood the dangers involved.</p><p></p><p>Demon beasts were born with formidable physiques and innate magic arts, making them extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Hence, human cultivators of the same level were no match for demon beasts of equal standing.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Zhou Xun had previously declined Shan Xionghai's second uncle's invitation to join them demon hunting on Mount Baimang.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you probably don't know - my cultivation has now reached the peak of the third level of Qi Refining!" Shan Xionghai said, emanating a robust aura of spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>Feeling this aura, Zhou Xun couldn't help feeling somewhat envious.</p><p></p><p>"What about you?" Shan Xionghai asked.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Xun felt a bit embarrassed, but he still recounted his own experiences, omitting only the part about the Wei brothers.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that Zhou Xun had been defrocked, Shan Xionghai was indignant.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Damn scoundrels, just wait until I get the chance, I'll definitely catch that manager and give him a good beating!" </p><p></p><p>"So what will you do now, have you found any work?" Single Xionghai asked with concern.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet," Zhou Xun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Single Xionghai pondered for a moment, then slowly said:</p><p></p><p>"Brother, there's actually another matter I came for today."</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What is it?" Zhou Xun asked curiously.  </p><p></p><p>"Yesterday on my way back to Hongye House, by a fortuitous opportunity in a valley, I discovered a nest of Golden Spirit Rats. You were at the Miaofuqe, so you should know the wonders of this beast."</p><p></p><p>"Naturally I know," Zhou Xun nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Spirit Rat is a first-grade lower-level metal-attribute demonic beast, with a golden-brown body color. Its blood can be used to refine talisman ink, its whiskers to make talisman brushes, its skin to make talisman paper. Even its demonic flesh can sell for two or three spirit crystals. All in all, a full-grown Golden Spirit Rat is worth over 60 spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, since you don't have work now, why don't you come with me to slaughter this nest of Golden Spirit Rats? We can get quite a few spirit crystals to tide you over!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, thousands of miles away from Hongye House, in a valley, a nest of Golden Spirit Rats were squeaking away, living in a hidden mountain cave. Strangely, the spirit qi density inside the cave far exceeded the outside.  </p><p></p><p>The spirit qi of the entire valley seemed to be guided and gathered into the cave, which was extremely bizarre.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Single is at the fifth level of qi refining, hunting these Golden Spirit Rats should be easy, right?" Zhou Xun asked doubtfully after hearing his words.</p><p></p><p>"There were some sudden matters at Baiman Mountain, so Uncle couldn't come with me," Single Xionghai explained.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun nodded, not agreeing immediately. </p><p></p><p>"Can just the two of us manage it?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry Brother, these Golden Spirit Rats are just first-grade lower-level demonic beasts, they're not hard to deal with at all!" Single Xionghai said confidently, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>If he could wipe out the whole nest alone, he wouldn't have asked Zhou Xun for help. However, Zhou Xun needed to focus all his efforts next month on preparing for the Danbaoge disciple recruitment, so he explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Single Xionghai laughed heartily, "No problem Brother, you can prepare for the disciple recruitment first. This matter won't happen immediately, so I'll have time to get ready too!"</p><p></p><p>The two then discussed other matters they had witnessed.</p><p></p><p>By the time Single Xionghai left, it was already night.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun took a bath, then entered the meditation room and lit a low-grade calming incense stick. This incense was blended with a small amount of spirit calming grass, helping cultivators settle their minds, costing two spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Breathing in the faint sandalwood fragrance, Zhou Xun's mind quickly calmed down. He picked up the vial in front of him, lightly removed the stopper, and poured out the round Qi Guiding Pill into his palm. He pinched it with two fingers and lightly put it into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>As the pill entered his stomach, a stream of pure spiritual energy was released, spreading through his meridians into his whole body. Zhou Xun quickly circulated his Yangxuan Technique to refine this spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The next morning, the meditation room door opened and Zhou Xun walked out. Recalling yesterday's experience, he didn't know whether to feel happy or sad.</p><p></p><p>After taking the Qi Guiding Pill, he diligently cultivated without slacking off. As his cultivation deepened, he soon reached the peak of the second level of qi refining.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, the remaining medicinal power was insufficient for him to break through to the third level of qi refining. However, he had a feeling that if he took one more pill, he could break through!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, a glimmer of light flashed in Zhou Xun's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I only have less than 20 spirit crystals left, not enough to purchase a Qi Guiding Pill."</p><p></p><p>"It seems the matter of slaughtering the Golden Spirit Rats needs to be moved up!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

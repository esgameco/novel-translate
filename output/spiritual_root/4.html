        <h1>Chapter 4</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>According to the original plan, after renting a place, he would still have 110 spirit stones left. But now that the rent has increased by 50%, he only has 60 left. </p><p></p><p>Not counting cultivation resources, just purchasing spirit rice would only be enough to sustain him for half a year.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he still needs to prepare for next year's rent in advance.</p><p></p><p>"I'd better find a job quickly!"</p><p></p><p>When he came to the West Square again, it was bustling with people, and everyone seemed excited and enthusiastic. </p><p></p><p>Puzzled, Zhou Xun asked an elderly man beside him, "Excuse me, senior fellow cultivator, may I ask what happened here that has everyone so excited?"</p><p></p><p>The old man had graying hair, and the robe he wore seemed to be an unusual material, though quite old and with some burn marks. There was also a faint medicinal fragrance lingering!</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had lived an illustrious life before falling into hard times.</p><p></p><p>"Fellow cultivator?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing a rosy-cheeked, jade-like youth addressing him, the old man's expression became a bit odd, but he still patiently explained:</p><p></p><p>"You must not be aware, friend. Five days ago, Master Yun Ku of the Lin Family Pill Pavilion successfully broke through to the Foundation Establishment realm, simultaneously advancing to become a second-grade middle-rank pill refiner.</p><p></p><p>To celebrate and expand, the Lin Family Pill Pavilion has decided to recruit 10 pill refining apprentices and 30 spirit contract laborers. This is a great opportunity for us wandering cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>"What!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this news, Zhou Xun's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely remembered that the reason his previous life allowed him to join the Miaofuoge as a spirit contract laborer was because three years ago, when the second elder of Miaofuoge advanced to become a second-grade talisman master, Miaofuoge expanded and recruited six apprentices and twenty spirit contract laborers. That was how Zhou Xun got the opportunity to join.</p><p></p><p>Now that such an opportunity has presented itself again, he definitely cannot miss it.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you know the requirements for this recruitment?"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there must be certain thresholds to become an apprentice or spirit contract laborer at a pill pavilion. Not just anyone can join casually.</p><p></p><p>"First, you must have a clear background and an unblemished family. Of course, it would be better if you were a disciple raised in our Hongye Sect.</p><p></p><p>Secondly, for the pill refining apprentices, you must be under 18 years old and have a cultivation base above the third level of Qi Refining. They will then select the best candidates.</p><p></p><p>As for the spirit contract laborers, you need to be under 30 years old with at least the third level of Qi Refining, or under 18 with the second level of Qi Refining!" After saying this, the man glanced at Zhou Xun and said regretfully:</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that you, my friend, are about to complete the second level of Qi Refining. You're just a bit short of the standard for an apprentice. What a pity!"</p><p></p><p>The old man sighed as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Xun's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>There were so many conditions for becoming a pill refining apprentice, and he only lacked one requirement regarding his cultivation base. Perhaps there was room for him to turn things around? However, he remained humble on the surface:</p><p></p><p>"There's no need for pity. As an ordinary wandering cultivator, I would already be satisfied to join the Lin Family as a spirit contract laborer. As for becoming an apprentice, I dare not have such lofty aspirations!"</p><p></p><p>"Not arrogant or rash, understanding what to pursue and what to let go, self-aware - an excellent temperament. It's just a pity your innate talents and cultivation base are too lacking!" The old man stroked his beard, with a hint of a worldly demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"Being content with one's lot is good!" </p><p></p><p>"Do you know when the registration will be?" Zhou Xun asked urgently.</p><p></p><p>For such a large-scale recruitment, there is usually an announcement made in advance, with registration first, followed by selection.</p><p></p><p>If he was given some time, and was willing to pay a certain price, perhaps he could break through before the selection!</p><p></p><p>"One month from today, registration will be open here, and the selection will take place simultaneously. I hope you can achieve your wish then, friend!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" Zhou Xun cupped his hands in a respectful gesture.</p><p></p><p>'One month, I still have a chance!'</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Among the hundred arts of cultivation, the status of pill refiners was the most revered.</p><p></p><p>An ordinary first-grade top-rank pill refiner could become an honored guest to Foundation Establishment cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Master Yun Ku, before his breakthrough, was merely a second-grade low-rank pill refiner. Although his cultivation base was only at the ninth level of Qi Refining, his status was even higher than an ordinary early Foundation Establishment cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has advanced to the middle-rank of the second grade, his status directly rivals that of late Foundation Establishment cultivators, making him one of the top five existences in the entire Hongye Sect.</p><p></p><p>If he could join the Lin Family Pill Pavilion and become Master Yun Ku's pill refining apprentice, the Wei brothers would definitely not dare to trouble him again.</p><p></p><p>Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Becoming a pill refining apprentice had another advantage, which was being able to openly access various spirit plants. </p><p></p><p>His Ningchun Scripture would finally have a use.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Zhou Xun no longer had the intention to look for a job.</p><p></p><p>He immediately went towards the east without hesitation, heading to the pill refining workshop. </p><p></p><p>He decided to go purchase a Qi Attracting Pill.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Attracting Pill is a foundation-strengthening spirit pill, suitable for cultivators in the early Qi refining stage. Many peak late second level Qi refining cultivators used this pill to break through. </p><p></p><p>However, this pill was quite expensive, costing at least 40 spirit crystals per pill.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm not at the peak of the second level of Qi refining, the probability of directly breaking through to the third level by taking the Qi Attracting Pill is not high, but such an opportunity is right in front of me, it's worth giving it a try!"</p><p></p><p>Walking along the long stone path and turning a few street corners, he arrived in front of the Lin Family Pill Refinery.</p><p></p><p>The Lin Family Pill Refinery was the largest pill store in Hongye Town, extremely magnificent. This building had one main hall and four side halls, with the tallest part being about seven or eight zhang high, the rooftops towering. The entire building occupied nearly a hundred zhang square area, with winding corridors, high overhanging eaves, carved railings and painted ridges, truly grand and majestic.</p><p></p><p>Two guards were stationed in front of the entrance, both peak third level Qi refining experts.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun stepped in through the entrance and went straight to the area selling pills for the early Qi refining stage.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, what kind of pill would you like to buy?"</p><p></p><p>"Qi Attracting Pill!"</p><p></p><p>"A total of 41 spirit crystals!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun unhesitatingly took out the spirit crystals, received the bottle containing the Qi Attracting Pill from the shopkeeper's hand, and hurriedly left, heading towards his home.</p><p></p><p>Just as he reached the alleyway, Zhou Xun encountered many passersby, all cultivators living on Green Willow Alley.</p><p></p><p>The neighbors looked at him with an odd gaze!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun found it strange.</p><p></p><p>Only when he got closer did he hear them talking about him, their voices faintly reaching his ears.</p><p></p><p>"Did you know? I heard Zhou Xun was expelled from the Miaozhu Hall!" The one speaking was a young man dressed like a servant boy, who usually addressed Zhou Xun as 'Brother Zhou' in a respectful manner.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, so he ended up like this too!" The person next to him said gleefully.</p><p></p><p>Originally working odd jobs at the Miaozhu Hall, many were jealous of him.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Xun didn't say anything, brushing past them indifferently. Such disdainful treatment, whether in his previous life or this one, he had seen plenty.</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head, Zhou Xun continued walking forward.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a tall figure approached and asked with concern, "Brother Zhou, I heard you were expelled from the Miaozhu Hall?"</p><p></p><p>This man had a scholarly appearance, with a foot-long butcher's knife hanging from his waist. He was around forty years old.</p><p></p><p>"Master Gao, so you've heard about this matter too!" Zhou Xun cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>This man surnamed Gao also lived on Green Willow Alley and was a spirit butcher cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world, when slaughtering spirit fish, demonic beasts and the like, special processing was often required. Otherwise, the spiritual energy would dissipate, greatly reducing their value. Thus, the profession of spirit butchers emerged.</p><p></p><p>This middle-aged man surnamed Gao was a hereditary spirit butcher cultivator. His skill in butchering spirit fish was unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>He currently worked at the largest cultivator tavern in Hongye Town, responsible for slaughtering spirit fish.</p><p></p><p>"News of your matter has already spread throughout the entire alley. Why don't I help put in a word for you to work as a servant boy at my tavern? Although it can't compare to the Miaozhu Hall, it's still a way to make a living!" The middle-aged man said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhou Xun felt warmth in his heart, but still declined.</p><p></p><p>This Master Gao, Zhou Xun had felt there was something profound about him ever since transmigrating here. Now with the Ningchun Scripture in hand and the opportunity at the Pill Refining Hall, he politely refused:</p><p></p><p>"Thank you Master Gao, but I still want to try finding something myself. If I really can't, then I'll have to trouble you at that time!"</p><p></p><p>"Very well, you're still young, you should explore more opportunities. If it really doesn't work out, come find me then!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun nodded in agreement, clutching the Qi Attracting Pill as he hurried home.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

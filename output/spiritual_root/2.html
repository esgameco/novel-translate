        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>Two years ago, when Zhou Xun first entered this dream realm, he learned about the effects of the Ningchun Scripture and planned to take root in the Miaofuge of Hongye Alley. </p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the opportunity to be a spirit contract laborer in Hongye Alley, he accumulated spirit stones to buy spirit medicines to enhance his spirit root.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun took a fancy to a peace-inducing grass at the Baobao Pavilion, which cost only 150 spirit essences. </p><p></p><p>He had originally saved up 120 spirit essences, so in just another month he would be able to purchase that spirit medicine and try its effect of enhancing his spirit root.</p><p></p><p>However, he was unexpectedly kicked out.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun had his own guesses about the reason for being fired.</p><p></p><p>As an orphan, he was able to join the Miaofuge only because of the grace left behind by his previous life's parents.</p><p></p><p>One of the overseers of the Miaofuge had a close relationship with Zhou Xun's previous life's father, and through this connection, Zhou Xun was able to become a spirit contract laborer.</p><p></p><p>After joining the Miaofuge, Zhou Xun worked diligently and earned the appreciation of the various overseers.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, the Miaofuge suddenly announced that they would select one person from all the spirit contract laborers to participate in the talisman apprentice examination.  </p><p></p><p>This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for all the laborers to ascend to heaven in a single step.</p><p></p><p>If one could become an apprentice, they would have access to the Miaofuge's talisman-making methods and have the chance to become a talisman master.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that even a first-rank low-grade talisman master's status in the entire Miaofuge would be no less than those overseers.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that a talisman master's income would be many times that of an overseer.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a great path.</p><p></p><p>For Zhou Xun, it was even more so. With the Ningchun Scripture in hand, enhancing his spirit root required a large quantity of spirit medicines. A stable and lucrative talisman master position was crucial for him.</p><p></p><p>However, there was only one apprentice spot, so the competition was extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, due to Zhou Xun's diligent work, all the overseers of the Miaofuge had an excellent impression of him. With the full support of that maternal uncle, he had the loudest calls to obtain the spot.</p><p></p><p>Ranked second was Wei Shangren.</p><p></p><p>This person was also a spirit contract laborer of the Miaofuge, but he was an arrogant and lazy bum.</p><p></p><p>However, he had an elder brother who was the most talented talisman apprentice in the Miaofuge, highly valued by the higher-ups, who even wanted to take him as a son-in-law.</p><p></p><p>With such a brother's support, the calls for Wei Shangren to obtain the spot were also not insignificant.  </p><p></p><p>The competition for the path led to conflicts between the two, and they quickly became sworn enemies.</p><p></p><p>It was at this time that an accident occurred.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun's maternal uncle suddenly met with a fatal accident.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after, Zhou Xun was immediately fired and kicked out.</p><p></p><p>"The spot has not been announced yet, but the Miaofuge has suddenly turned against me and fired me. This must be related to the Wei brothers!"</p><p></p><p>A fierce glint flashed in Zhou Xun's eyes.</p><p></p><p>But it was soon replaced by calmness.</p><p></p><p>"My current cultivation level is only the second level of Qi Refining. Against the Wei brothers, I have no ability for revenge."</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I have the complete Ningchun Scripture in hand, which can enhance my spirit root quality."</p><p></p><p>"I shall wait until my cultivation reaches a certain level before taking revenge!"</p><p></p><p>The next day, Zhou Xun got up early.</p><p></p><p>"My current top priority is to quickly find a job and accumulate spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>With spirit stones, he could purchase spirit medicines to enhance his spirit root and rapidly improve his cultivation!</p><p></p><p>Then earn more spirit stones, buy better spirit medicines, and reach even higher levels of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Faster and faster, like a snowball rolling.</p><p></p><p>After simply drinking some spirit rice porridge, he left home and headed for the West Square.</p><p></p><p>The West Square, located in the northwest of Hongye Alley, was where the overseers of various shops and spirit field masters would come when in need of recruiting cultivators. Over time, it had become a talent market for the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>Along the main street, there were many passing cultivators coming and going.</p><p></p><p>Some dressed like scholars, some like Taoists, all kinds of appearances.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally there were even some cultivators dressed in animal hides for demon hunting, hurrying by with cautious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Brother Shan is back," Zhou Xun muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>This Brother Shan, named Shan Xionghai, was a childhood friend who grew up with Zhou Xun. He was currently following his uncle, a fifth level Qi Refining demon hunting cultivator, learning demon hunting in the Baimang Mountains.</p><p></p><p>The last time the two met was a year ago. Shan Xionghai had specially brought Zhou Xun some Xuemang Rabbits, a delicious low-grade demon beast.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the taste of that demon beast meat, Zhou Xun couldn't help but swallow his saliva!</p><p></p><p>Lost in thought, he arrived at his destination.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, fellow Daoists. I am Wu Gui, the spirit field overseer of the Wu Family," said a middle-aged man in a red brocade robe, standing in the center of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Family was one of the four major cultivating families in Hongye Alley, occupying three-tenths of its territory.</p><p></p><p>The 100 spirit essences rent Zhou Xun paid each year had 30 of them going into the hands of the Wu Family.</p><p></p><p>For the lower-level cultivators living in Hongye Alley, this Wu Family was like the heavens of Hongye Alley.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone knows that when the spirit grains mature and release their fragrance, it easily attracts spirit aphids. My Wu Family's spirit fields are nearing maturity now, so we need fifteen fellow Daoists to help exterminate the pests for a period of seven days."</p><p></p><p>"As for the compensation, we will provide all the spirit rice consumed during this period. Additionally, after the extermination is completed, we will present ten spirit essences!" The middle-aged man in the red robe opened with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing about the seven days for ten spirit essences, the cultivators became excited.</p><p></p><p>"The Wu Family is indeed generous!"</p><p></p><p>"Such treatment..."</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>"Let's show the grandeur of the Wu family!"</p><p></p><p>"The Wu family has great ambitions!" </p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that on regular days, they could only earn around ten spirit essences per month from doing odd jobs. But now, they could earn 10 spirit essences in just seven days' time. This was an extremely lucrative job.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Zhou Xun was also quite tempted. </p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect to come across such a good job right after arriving!"</p><p></p><p>"But we do have some requirements!"</p><p></p><p>The red-robed steward pressed his hands down to quiet the clamoring crowd, then continued speaking:</p><p></p><p>"First, those signing up must cultivate basic metal or fire elemental skills."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this requirement, a large group of cultivators immediately sighed, revealing looks of "as expected."</p><p></p><p>When dealing with spirit aphids, there were typically two parts. </p><p></p><p>First, cultivators practicing fire elemental skills would use spells on the perimeter to drive away incoming spirit aphids. Within the spirit fields, cultivators of metal elemental skills would use spells to exterminate them.</p><p></p><p>Spirit aphids were innately afraid of fire, so fire elemental spells had a multiplying effect in driving them away.</p><p></p><p>As for metal elemental spells, they had the characteristics of being sharp and precise, able to kill the spirit aphids in the spirit fields without harming the fields themselves.</p><p></p><p>Of course, spells of other elemental attributes could also work, but they were far less efficient compared to fire and metal.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that I chose to cultivate the wood-attribute 'Nourishing Primal Scripture' back then!" Zhou Xun regretted inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the red-robed steward's voice rang out again.</p><p></p><p>"The second requirement is that the cultivation level must be at least the third level of Qi Refining. Those below the third level of Qi Refining, don't bother coming to make a scene!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun sighed, knowing he had no chance, and prepared to leave.</p><p></p><p>"It's just clearing out spirit aphids. Even cultivators at the second level of Qi Refining can handle it completely. Please be a bit more lenient, Steward Sir!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a middle-aged cultivator in a blue robe beside Zhou Xun spoke up.</p><p></p><p>He specialized in metal elemental spells, and many spirit farmers near Red Leaf Alley liked to hire him to exterminate pests. Unfortunately, he was only at the second level of Qi Refining, not meeting the steward's requirement.</p><p></p><p>But he was not resigned to letting such a lucrative seven-day job that paid 10 spirit essences slip by.</p><p></p><p>His words resonated with the crowd.</p><p></p><p>After all, the vast majority of cultivators present were at the second level of Qi Refining. The steward's words had effectively excluded most of them, so they began voicing their agreement.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, Steward Sir, we have ample experience in clearing spirit aphids!"</p><p></p><p>"We at the second level of Qi Refining can definitely handle it."</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the middle-aged man in the red robe immediately scowled.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, he released his spiritual power outward, instantly erupting with the aura of a mid-level Qi Refining cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of cultivators was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"It's not up to the likes of you to make noise about matters of our Wu family!" The red-robed steward glared piercingly at those who had spoken out.</p><p></p><p>Wherever his gaze fell, people hastily moved aside. Immediately after, those below the third level of Qi Refining retreated, while those at the third level beamed and lined up to register.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun was only at the second level of Qi Refining, not meeting the registration criteria, so he blended into the crowd behind, enviously watching those registering.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a commotion among those registering, as a white-haired old man was dragged out by the red-robed steward, who contemptuously scolded him:</p><p></p><p>"An old bag of bones coming to make a scene!"</p><p></p><p>The old man pleaded incessantly:</p><p></p><p>"Steward Wu, please make an exception for me. I'm also at the third level of Qi Refining. Let me through, please!"</p><p></p><p>"Pah! Let you through? Do you think I'm an idiot? Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>It turned out that once cultivators surpassed sixty years of age, their physical abilities would start declining, and their spiritual sense and spiritual power would gradually wither.</p><p></p><p>Although this old man was at the third level of Qi Refining, judging from his appearance, he was nearly a hundred years old. His spiritual power was likely no match for Zhou Xun, who was at the second level of Qi Refining. Naturally, the red-robed steward was unwilling to recruit him.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the red-robed steward from the Wu family left with the recruited cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun shook his head and went to the next recruitment.</p><p></p><p>"What's your cultivation level?"</p><p>"Second level of Qi Refining."</p><p>"We're only recruiting those at the third level of Qi Refining and above. Move along."</p><p></p><p>"Second level of Qi Refining? Get going!"</p><p></p><p>"Second level of Qi Refining? No, no!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun went through all the recruitments, and almost every one required at least the third level of Qi Refining.</p><p></p><p>The only one without any cultivation requirements was mining.</p><p></p><p>However, mining sites typically had scarce spiritual energy, coupled with intense labor, leaving no time for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, although the pay was extremely high, no one was willing to take those jobs, except for cultivators whose prospects had been cut off or parents earning resources for their children's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun aspired to the Great Way, so he naturally would not join them.</p><p></p><p>After waiting all day without finding any suitable jobs, Zhou Xun could only return home first.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred yards from home, Zhou Xun spotted a figure loitering outside his door from afar.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

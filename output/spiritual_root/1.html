        <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation world of Xu Nation, Red Leaf Manor. </p><p></p><p>It was deep autumn again. The sky was gloomy and dim yellow. The big trees by the road had also withered, with only a few dried leaves hanging on the dew-covered spider webs, twirling around in the cold wind.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Xun, from today onwards, you are fired!"</p><p></p><p>A domineering voice rang out. </p><p></p><p>A man in his forties with a fleshy face pushed him out of the gate.</p><p></p><p>"These 90 spirit fragments are your compensation!"</p><p></p><p>He then threw a bag filled with spirit fragments onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>These spirit fragments, which were pieces of spirit stones, had even lower spiritual energy content than regular spirit stones. They were a kind of low-grade currency used by cultivators in this world. Generally, one hundred spirit fragments could be exchanged for one spirit stone.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun didn't say a word. He rubbed his slightly aching shoulder and silently picked up the bag of spirit fragments from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, 91 fragments!"</p><p></p><p>Weighing the cloth bag in his hand, Zhou Xun gave a self-mocking laugh.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the magnificent buildings in front of him, with a pavilion every five steps and a kiosk every ten steps, the corridors winding and the ridges hooked.</p><p></p><p>No matter how big the platform was, he was ultimately just a worker there. Despite his many years of contribution, he was still mercilessly fired!</p><p></p><p>Snorting, Zhou Xun turned and left without any reluctance.</p><p></p><p>Walking on the street.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold wind blew, gushing into Zhou Xun's clothes through the gaps. He couldn't help but shiver his neck and sigh:</p><p></p><p>"It's been two years since I transmigrated here!"</p><p></p><p>Recalling his life after transmigrating here, it was hard to put into words.</p><p></p><p>In his previous life, he was a corporate slave, living the 996 life, though it was tiring, his life was still manageable.</p><p></p><p>However, misfortune befalls the suffering, and eventually, after endless overtime, one day he collapsed and transmigrated to this cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>When Zhou Xun first transmigrated and learned about the existence of cultivators, he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the scenes from novels, where "one rides the auspicious clouds across the nine heavens, commands all things with a wave of the sword, and the heavenly gates open with a single strike," would become a reality.</p><p></p><p>And he would have the opportunity to glimpse the path of longevity and witness the changing of seas into mulberry fields.</p><p></p><p>More fortuitously, the young man named Zhou Xun that he had transmigrated into was also a cultivator, fifteen years old, with the second level of Qi Cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>The first realm of cultivation is the Qi Cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>Qi Cultivation has nine levels in total.</p><p></p><p>Levels one to three are the early stage, four to six the middle stage, and seven to nine the late stage.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun had done a simple statistical analysis, and it matched the Pareto principle in this world.</p><p></p><p>Eighty percent of cultivators could only reach the early stage of Qi Cultivation in their lifetime, while only twenty percent could break through to the middle and later stages.</p><p></p><p>"If the heavens had not given birth to my ancestor Zhou, the path of immortality would be an eternal night!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, Zhou Xun would not consider himself part of that eighty percent, carrying the hope of longevity. He quickly integrated into the life of the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>When he transmigrated, his previous self was working at the largest talisman shop in Red Leaf Manor, Miaofuyan, as a spiritual contract laborer.</p><p></p><p>A spiritual contract laborer could be understood as a contract worker in Zhou Xun's previous world, except that in this world, there was no concept of human rights. He had to work from dawn to dusk without rest.</p><p></p><p>"996 in the previous life, 007 in this life, I'm really going backwards!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun had worked at Miaofuyan for three years in total.</p><p></p><p>Although the work was tedious and arduous, it was an extremely enviable job compared to others.</p><p></p><p>With a guaranteed income, he earned 30 spirit fragments per month, enough for him to live and cultivate in Red Leaf Manor.</p><p></p><p>One should know that most early-stage Qi Cultivation cultivators here earned less than ten spirit fragments per month.</p><p></p><p>That wasn't even enough to rent the cheapest shacks in Red Leaf Manor, which were covered by the array formation.</p><p></p><p>The cheapest shacks required 100 spirit fragments per year in rent, and that's where Zhou Xun lived.</p><p></p><p>Calculated monthly, it was eight spirit fragments.</p><p></p><p>Nearly one-third of his income went to rent, reminding Zhou Xun of his previous life's struggle in the big city.</p><p></p><p>Back at his wooden hut, Zhou Xun took out a blue-green wooden plaque.</p><p></p><p>Murmuring an incantation, he then imprinted a spell onto the plaque.</p><p></p><p>Here is a full translation of the excerpt from Chinese to English:</p><p></p><p>The wooden plaque emitted another beam of blue light, striking the large door in front of it. </p><p></p><p>The blue light seeped into the door, flickering briefly before disappearing.</p><p></p><p>With a gentle push, Zhou Xun opened the door.</p><p></p><p>Although referred to as a slum area, all the properties here were owned by the Redleaf Manor. Each wooden house was set up with simple defensive talismans. </p><p></p><p>If anyone attempted to break in by force, it would immediately alert the manor's law enforcement squad, providing a certain level of security.</p><p></p><p>Every cultivator of means in the Redleaf Manor was willing to rent such a house.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the house, it was still early in the day. </p><p></p><p>Having some free time, Zhou Xun felt a bit unsettled for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Normally during the day, he would be working at the shop, with no need to worry about what to do.</p><p></p><p>After sitting idly for a while, Zhou Xun began contemplating his next steps.</p><p></p><p>In the two years since crossing over, he had accumulated a total of 120 spirit beads, plus the 90 compensated during the day, making 210 in total, worth over two spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>He also had a first-grade low-tier Golden Thorn Talisman, a reward for his diligent work at the Wondrous Talisman Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"With my current assets, I'm considered well-off among the early cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>However, it had been nearly a year since he last paid rent. </p><p></p><p>Deducting the 100 beads for rent, he only had 110 spirit beads at his disposal.</p><p></p><p>"One spirit bead is worth three pounds of spirit rice. I consume 30 pounds per month. Even if I economize, the remaining beads would barely last a year!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun calculated that he needed to find another job.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would have to move to the outskirts of the manor, without the protection of talismans or law enforcement patrols.</p><p></p><p>Murders and robberies occurred frequently there. Often, a cultivator chatting and laughing with friends one day would end up dead in a foul ditch the next, their cultivation gone.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun did not want to meet such a fate.</p><p></p><p>After making his plans, night had fallen. </p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun went into the kitchen and made a meal of spirit rice.</p><p></p><p>He did not eat mundane food because it contained too many impurities, unsuitable for long-term consumption by cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Many in the Redleaf Manor, unable to afford spirit rice and relying on mundane food long-term, found their cultivation progress severely hindered.</p><p></p><p>Aspiring to the great path, Zhou Xun would not make such a mistake.</p><p></p><p>After eating the spirit rice, Zhou Xun rested for half an hour before beginning his meditation practice.</p><p></p><p>This was a cultivation technique he had discovered.</p><p></p><p>Meditating half an hour after consuming spirit rice could increase efficiency by about ten percent.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun guessed that after half an hour, the essence of the spirit rice had been fully absorbed, leaving the body's spiritual energy at its peak, making cultivation twice as effective.</p><p></p><p>For two years, Zhou Xun had persisted in this arduous daily practice.</p><p></p><p>Now, he was only a step away from the peak of the second level of Qi Condensation.</p><p></p><p>Considering his age of seventeen, he was considered a prodigy among lower-level cultivators, with the potential to break through to the later Qi Condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>As his meditation deepened, Zhou Xun's mind wandered again, appearing in a magnificent palace, with a jade book emanating purple light enshrined in the center, inscribed with the words "Condensing Spring Scripture."</p><p></p><p>"This dream again, the third time in two years!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this Condensing Spring Scripture that can condense the essence of spirit plants to make up for a cultivator's foundation?"</p><p></p><p>One's spiritual root was part of that foundation, so supplementing it meant enhancing the spiritual root.</p><p></p><p>"One sword opens the heavenly gate, soaring among the clouds to ascend, long life from constant contemplation."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Xun was extremely excited, gazing at those three words that seemed like the true dao itself, and opened the first page.</p><p></p><p>"The way of heaven, taking from the surplus to compensate the deficient."</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Zhou Xun awoke, his eyes bright.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I've perceived the complete scripture!"</p><p></p><p>This is my first book, please give me your support!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 514</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tianshe said this, all the realm lords fell silent. Although the crisis was approaching, they were still reluctant to support Tianshe becoming the new lord of heaven and earth, ruling over them.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshe, how can you be so confident that you can wield the authority of heaven and earth?" one realm lord asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I, Tianshe, am not only the top figure of the third generation of the Cang Heaven, but I also participated in the great war of heaven and earth back then. Naturally, I have obtained some opportunities. Since I dare to scheme for the authority of heaven and earth, I certainly have confidence."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tianshe's aura erupted, displaying his immense power.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Jiang Feng and said, "Jiang Feng, do you acknowledge that I, Tianshe, am the number one of the third generation?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Feng's gaze was deep, his aura hidden. He remained silent, seemingly acquiescing to Tianshe's claim as the top figure of the third generation.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll make it clear - I must compete for the authority of heaven and earth, and I must have no less than 60%. Whoever disagrees can come at me, let's see who has the real ability!</p><p></p><p>"But I, Tianshe, have schemed for so long. If anyone thinks they can snatch my authority, don't blame me for being merciless. The crisis is upon us, there's no need to hide anything anymore."</p><p></p><p>Tianshe's gaze swept over the realm lords, laying everything out in the open.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's see who has the real ability," one realm lord said with a dry laugh.</p><p></p><p>No one was willing to give up, so in the end, it could only come down to each person's true capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, be careful," Jiang Feng suddenly said, his expression changing.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the Netherworld Realm. Five powerful auras were rapidly approaching, like rolling waves of blood, their momentum shocking.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Realm was even more broken than the Demon Realm, and was the weakest of the three existing realms.</p><p></p><p>Five Blood Lords from the Netherworld Realm had survived the great war back then. They were all former minor realm lords who had once followed the Lord of the Netherworld Realm.</p><p></p><p>In recent days, the Netherworld Realm had been unstable. The Blood Sea of the Netherworld would often surge, and the laws of the realm would occasionally shake.</p><p></p><p>With no other choice, the five Blood Lords had to withdraw all the laws that had extended into the Cang Heaven Realm, temporarily stopping Netherworld warriors from entering the heavenly caves of the Cang Heaven Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Blood Lord Ming said, standing on the Blood Sea with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's related to the imminent great decline of the laws of heaven and earth," Blood Lord Yu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Cang Heaven Realm is too domineering. Why don't we contact the Demon Realm again and attack Cang Heaven together, forcing them to give us a place!" Blood Frenzy said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Among the surviving Blood Lords of the Netherworld Realm, Blood Lords Ming and Yu were the leaders. Their names came from "Mingyu" (Netherworld), bestowed by Mingyu himself. They were once Mingyu's capable subordinates!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the Blood Lords' expressions changed drastically as they looked up towards the outside of the Netherworld Realm.</p><p></p><p>A figure was walking towards them, wearing a mask on his face. His blood-colored cape was like waves of blood, and on his black robe was embroidered the pattern of a gray palace.</p><p></p><p>He walked step by step towards the Netherworld Realm. The cape behind him stirred up shocking waves of blood, as if about to engulf heaven and earth. His powerful aura gradually revealed itself.</p><p></p><p>A Lord of Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>Blood Lords Ming and Yu were shocked. They hurriedly dove into the Blood Sea and said in deep voices, "Quick, activate the laws of the Netherworld Realm together!"</p><p></p><p>The other Blood Lords each entered different parts of the Netherworld. With a rumbling sound, the laws of the Netherworld Realm appeared, attempting to resist the newcomer.</p><p></p><p>That figure slowly approached the Netherworld Realm and spoke: "Don't resist in vain. Surrender!"</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are a Lord of Heaven and Earth, it's not easy to invade a realm. Surrender means death, but fighting gives us a chance to live. If you think you can trick us into surrendering and easily occupy our realm, you're dreaming!" Blood Lord Ming said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Why be so stubborn? As long as you surrender, I, Blood Prison, guarantee your lives!"</p><p></p><p>"If you want to fight, then fight! Why waste words?" Blood Lord Yu's attitude was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Blood Prison fell silent for a moment, then slowly raised his hand. With a thunderous boom, a giant blood-colored palm reached in from outside the Immutable Land, striking towards the Netherworld Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As the Netherworld Realm shook, its laws appeared, condensing into a powerful defense, attempting to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld has already been broken to this extent. There's no need for it to exist anymore!" Blood Prison sighed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>To the shock of Blood Lord Ming and the others, the power of the Netherworld's laws actually rippled open, unable to resist this strike.</p><p></p><p>Bang! A corner of the realm shattered, and countless beings in the entire Netherworld Realm died instantly.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible?!" The Blood Lords were all shocked. Why did the laws of the Netherworld Realm ripple open?</p><p></p><p>Boom! Blood Prison struck down with another palm, his figure walking step by step towards the Netherworld Realm.</p><p></p><p>The realm shattered a bit more.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Lords roared in anger, erupting with all their power. They joined forces to activate the laws and launched a fierce attack.</p><p></p><p>However, with just a stroke from the opponent, the laws of the realm became gentle, losing their attacking power. The remaining attacks from the five Blood Lords were easily neutralized by the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The gap between minor realm lords and a Lord of Heaven and Earth was ultimately too great.</p><p></p><p>Blood Prison walked step by step towards the realm, entering the Netherworld Realm. No matter how the Blood Lords activated the laws of the Netherworld Realm or launched attacks, they could not stop his footsteps.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, it's you, isn't it? Are you going to destroy the Netherworld?" Suddenly, Blood Lords Ming and Yu stopped with bitter smiles. The other three Blood Lords fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Mingyu, the creator of the Netherworld Realm, no one else could smooth out the laws of the Netherworld Realm and not be attacked by them!</p><p></p><p>"Mingyu is dead. There is only Blood Prison, the guardian of the Immutable Divine Palace!" Blood Prison's figure paused as he spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, you actually joined the Immutable Divine Palace!" Blood Lords Ming and Yu couldn't accept the reality before them for a moment. How proud and unyielding their lord had been back then.</p><p></p><p>No one could have imagined that he would submit to the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>"There's no such thing as joining or not joining. It's just mutual benefit. I'm giving you a chance to return under my command." Blood Prison's gaze fell on Blood Lords Ming and Yu as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>The two Blood Lords fell silent, raising their heads to look at the Netherworld Realm, filled with anxiety and the wailing of Netherworld warriors, Blood Kings, Blood Spirits, Blood Sons and others who had followed them.</p><p></p><p>"What about them? Your Excellency, you created the Netherworld Realm. All the beings in this realm exist because of you. Surely..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Prison spoke coldly: "Since I created this realm, and they exist because of my realm, their life and death are at my discretion. Out of consideration for our past relationship, I'll give you twelve spots. Choose your followers yourself."</p><p></p><p>Blood Lord Ming wanted to say something more, but Blood Prison coldly said: "Mingyu is dead, so naturally the Netherworld Realm should not exist. I am now Blood Prison, guardian of the Immutable Divine Palace. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>All five Blood Lords fell silent, struggling internally. Resistance would only lead to pointless death.</p><p></p><p>"We... are willing to follow Your Excellency!" </p><p></p><p>In the end, all five Blood Lords lowered their heads. This realm was created by Mingyu, and if even he had given up on it, what was the point in persisting?</p><p></p><p>"Very good..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you go and contend with Witch Demon, Taicang and the others. I will devour this world."</p><p></p><p>Blood Prison's tone softened.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Eminence!"</p><p></p><p>The five Blood Lords chose their trusted followers to continue accompanying them, while the rest would naturally perish along with the world.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Surging blood energy rolled off Blood Prison's body, transforming into a blood path that resonated with the laws of heaven and earth. The broken world burst forth with a blood-red radiance, as if about to explode.</p><p></p><p>Streams of power from the laws of heaven and earth converged, and strands of laws entered Blood Prison's body. All living beings in the world wailed as they transformed into surging fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>The masked Blood Prison's expression couldn't be seen, but his eyes slowly closed. This world that originally belonged to him, he was now destroying with his own hands.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing everything in the world to strengthen himself - this was the method he had rediscovered to empower himself, which also came from the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Turning the world he created into power to strengthen himself was like gathering scattered power and returning it to himself.</p><p></p><p>This process required time and could not be accomplished in just a day or two.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Taicang world, Tianshe, Meiwu and the others faced off against the five Blood Lords, their auras intertwining in the immutable land.</p><p></p><p>By this point, whether it was the Taicang world or the Witch Demon world, they all understood that the world lord currently devouring the Netherworld was none other than Netherworld himself! They could never have imagined that someone as arrogant as Netherworld would actually surrender to the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Netherworld had always been known for his unyielding and defiant nature. Everyone acknowledged him as someone who would rather die than submit.</p><p></p><p>Back when he was suppressed by Taicang for a period, even though he was in the wrong, he stubbornly refused to admit his mistake.</p><p></p><p>However, such a person had actually surrendered to the Immutable Divine Palace. What they found even more incomprehensible was why the Immutable Divine Palace would accept Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>This was vastly different from what they knew about the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when did Netherworld surrender? Was it after being defeated in battle, or at the beginning of the great war, or even before the war started?</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened during that battle between the world lords? How could Taicang, such a powerful being, have fallen!</p><p></p><p>This was something all the minor world lords found unacceptable. At that moment, everyone's beliefs collapsed. Many minor world lords were killed by the experts of the Immutable Divine Palace who seized the opportunity when they were dazed and confused.</p><p></p><p>When the great battle began, Taicang displayed an invincible aura, killing a world lord level expert from the Immutable Divine Palace with his first move.</p><p></p><p>He demonstrated strength far surpassing other world lords, yet in the end he was defeated! At this moment, Ao Lie, Meiwu and the others couldn't help but wonder if Taicang's defeat and fall was somehow related to Netherworld!</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, the three sides faced off against each other, but no one made a move.</p><p></p><p>"So it was Netherworld."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan observed the standoff outside the world and the changes in the Netherworld, guessing the identity of the one who had acted.</p><p></p><p>"Netherworld surrendered to the Immutable Divine Palace. Could Taicang's death be related to this?"</p><p></p><p>It's possible that during the battle, Netherworld backstabbed Taicang, leading to Taicang's fall.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just speculation.</p><p></p><p>It's also possible that after Taicang's defeat, Netherworld felt despair and surrendered.</p><p></p><p>"What connection is there between Blood Demon and Netherworld?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but be curious.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was not one of Netherworld's Blood Lords, but his true form's strength was comparable to a world lord, and Netherworld's martial way was called the Netherworld Blood Demon Way.</p><p></p><p>"For now, there's no threat to the Taicang world. There's still time to increase our strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a breath.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon, who had originally infiltrated the Taicang world to carry out his plans, was now being fooled and tormented by Tianzi, believing he had obtained a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>There should be some connection between Blood Soul and Blood Demon's true form, so Blood Demon was probably pondering how to increase his strength, shifting his attention away from the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>This also bought more time for the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is about to break through. When my five martial ways all reach the Establishing the Way realm, my strength will greatly increase again, giving me even more confidence than Taicang had back then!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards where Meng Chong was in seclusion. He was not far from breaking through.</p><p></p><p>In the Wilderness, Tianzi was deceiving and tormenting Blood Demon, making him believe this was a test for him, to improve his aptitude. No matter how great the suffering, he would endure it firmly!</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, the standoff continued. Tianshe's original plan targeting Old Man Xiao had to be postponed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was in a treasure land somewhere in the Dao Realm, closely perceiving the primordial essence of heaven and earth, both cultivating and trying to comprehend the Creation realm.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings of the Divine Realm all had their own tasks, but not one dared to set foot in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains Realm, the beast race was growing stronger. Red Cat, the great beast king, was becoming increasingly powerful, and the name of the beast race gained full recognition.</p><p></p><p>Time passed swiftly.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue finally discovered that she could cultivate her great beast technique. Her strength was increasing, and she was close to cultivating the true dragon divine ability. She was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Her relationship with Cai Linger was now extremely good. Whenever she saw Cai Linger, she affectionately called her "sister".</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had already reached great completion in the Heaven Unity realm and comprehended the laws of heaven and earth. He had begun to comprehend the principles of heaven and earth. The heavenly fortune on his body played no small role in assisting his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was comprehending the qi of the Heavenly Way, feeling he had gained much. He had taken another step forward in finding his path.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>On this day, the divine bridge connecting the Spirit Realm to the Divine Realm was slowly opened, and the barrier between the two realms began to weaken continuously, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>The vast spiritual seas of the Spirit Realm were now no less abundant in spiritual energy than the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Way began to spread towards the Divine Realm. Tianzi was also accelerating the operation of the Heavenly Way, in order to run it throughout the entire world as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Meng Chong broke through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the third level of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body. Your Supreme Heavenly Indestructible Body has reached small completion."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao arrived.</p><p></p><p>"I've become stronger again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted. His physical martial way had also reached small completion in the Establishing the Way realm.</p><p></p><p>At the Establishing the Way realm, breaking through even a small level resulted in a huge increase in strength. With two martial ways breaking through to small completion in the Establishing the Way realm, Li Xuan felt even more confident.</p><p></p><p>In the closed cultivation room, great suns and stars revolved around Meng Chong's body. Each acupoint seemed to have transformed into a star, with stars densely packed and great suns in operation.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Heaven and Earth realm of the physical martial way!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong opened his eyes. He felt the power of his physical body, even feeling as if his body had become like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I could easily destroy a Divine Venerable realm martial artist with one punch!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued cultivating, stabilizing himself while also improving his divine abilities and cultivating more divine abilities. At the same time, he organized his martial way in preparation for the Supreme Heavenly Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme Heavenly Indestructible Body had reached the Establishing the Way realm, establishing the way of the physical body.</p><p></p><p>"I should go adventure in the Dao Realm too. Now there shouldn't be any force or expert in the Divine Realm who dares to provoke me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now that his strength had greatly increased, it was time to go make a name for himself in the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

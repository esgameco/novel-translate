            <p>以下是该中文小说片段的英文翻译:</p><p></p><p>第56章 无尽大山之说 (求追读)</p><p></p><p>京城沸腾,群臣震惊,齐皇在宫里,躲在密室中,咬牙切齿地骂骂咧咧。</p><p></p><p>而齐王府,则是一片欢欣喜悦的气氛。</p><p></p><p>昨天才搬进了齐王府,今日许炎就来了,郭荣山一颗悬着的心,终于放了下来。</p><p></p><p>整个人都轻松了。</p><p></p><p>不是齐皇神志失常了,是自己外孙太强了。</p><p></p><p>许炎此时觉得齐皇,还是可以的,与自己外公结拜,封齐王,大阁老,太子上师,整个齐国,齐皇只是名义上的第一人。</p><p></p><p>他外公,才是真正的第一人!</p><p></p><p>郭荣山越看自己的外孙,越是欢喜不已,自己没有白疼他!</p><p></p><p>自从许炎手擎巨龙,凌空掠来的那一幕,一掌在皇宫广场上,轰出一条龙形沟壑开始,群臣的世界观已经崩塌得没法恢复了。</p><p></p><p>整个齐国京城百姓的世界观,同样崩塌了。</p><p></p><p>这一日,京城书铺里的那些话本、传说之类的书籍,已经全部卖光了,价格也是在不断的暴涨中。</p><p></p><p>有落魄书生,看到了商机,把自己珍藏的几本,描述神人男女二三事的话本,以千两高价卖了出去。</p><p></p><p>一日暴富啊!</p><p></p><p>这一日,纨绔子弟们不逛勾栏,不欺男霸女了,全都被家里督促着,去寻访高人!</p><p></p><p>而在这一事件中,受到伤害最大的大皇子,更是准备亲自寻访高人拜师了。</p><p></p><p>齐国京城,掀起了寻访高人的热潮。</p><p></p><p>三皇子提着重礼来到齐王府,拜见自己的师父郭荣山。</p><p></p><p>诸多大臣,几乎把齐王的门槛都踏破了。</p><p></p><p>最后,郭荣山以家宴,招待外孙,不见外客为由,才把拜访的群臣阻挡在外。</p><p></p><p>齐王府,书房里。</p><p></p><p>"爹,陛下难道不怕我郭家造反?"</p><p></p><p>郭云开问出了心中的疑惑。</p><p></p><p>又是结拜封齐王,又是大阁老,群臣之首,又是太子上师……难道齐皇,就不怕他郭家造反?</p><p></p><p>镇国之军神威军,如今更是他在统领。</p><p></p><p>以郭家如今的实力,想要造反,轻而易举啊。</p><p></p><p>仅凭许炎一人就足以了。</p><p></p><p>郭荣山神色平静,道:"正是因为怕我们造反,才给予无上之地位。"</p><p></p><p>"为何?"</p><p></p><p>郭云开不明白了。</p><p></p><p>郭荣山吐出一口气,道:"为父在外的清誉是什么?外间都在传,陛下礼贤下士,屈尊降贵,与我结拜为兄弟。</p><p></p><p>"更是让三皇子拜师,一日为师终身为父啊。</p><p></p><p>"外间都在传,我郭荣山忠君爱国,一心为民,品德高尚,圣贤大德之士。</p><p></p><p>"你觉得,为父若是造反,百姓如何看待?为父的声誉,又会如何?"</p><p></p><p>郭荣山轻笑一声,道:"我若造反,必然落一个忘恩负义,虚伪阴险,大奸大恶……等等臭名。</p><p></p><p>"我们的陛下啊,就是以这清誉名声,束缚住我郭家。</p><p></p><p>"不反,则流芳百世,成为圣贤大德,反了则名声臭了。</p><p></p><p>"陛下果决啊!在炎儿之事,尚未传来之前,就已经部署完毕了,堂堂帝皇,能做到这一步,能有如此果决之心,不简单啊!"</p><p></p><p>郭云开这才恍然,原来这一连串的嘉奖,外间的传闻,都是齐皇的手笔,逼得郭家二选一。</p><p></p><p>要么造反,得齐国天下,但名声臭了。</p><p></p><p>要么做一个至高无上的权臣,但齐国江山可保,而郭荣山则名传青史,成为圣贤大德之士。</p><p></p><p>如今,传闻已深入民间,想要逆转,也来不及了。</p><p></p><p>"那爹,你的想法是</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>"What?" Guo Yunkai's breathing had become a bit heavier.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan smiled slightly and said, "Great Virtuous Sage, that's good! The Emperor is currently looking for a powerful person. Once they are found, if they can subdue Yan'er, the Emperor will surely take action with thunderous force.</p><p></p><p>"If the strength is not too different, then we'll maintain a balance.</p><p></p><p>"The Emperor also told me that if the royal house finds a powerful person, they won't assassinate him because of my reputation as a Great Virtuous Sage, so as not to sully the face of the imperial house."</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunkai understood this and worriedly said, "But what if the Emperor really does find a powerful person..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan laughed and said, "How easy is that? Our Yan'er has taken the first step, so we'll keep taking steps ahead. To suppress him, it's not that simple.</p><p></p><p>"Yunkai, don't have such a shallow vision. The worldly dynasties are nothing.</p><p></p><p>"Go ask Yan'er what he needs for his cultivation, and use the power of our Qi Wang Mansion to find it for him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, father, I understand!" Guo Yunkai's eyes lit up with excitement.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan brought Meng Chong back to the residence and let him choose a guest room to stay in.</p><p></p><p>"Get familiar with the environment first. Can you cook? Can you make chicken soup? You can, then go cook."</p><p></p><p>The first thing Meng Chong had to do after becoming a disciple was to cook!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I've brought the things."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully came over.</p><p></p><p>"Put them down." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er placed five boxes on the table. Without Li Xuan moving, the five boxes opened by themselves as his vital energy surged.</p><p></p><p>This scene left Shi Er greatly startled, and he bent his waist even lower.</p><p></p><p>There were two nine-leaf spirit herbs and three thousand-year-old mountain ginseng.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quite surprised. "The Heavenly Mother Sect is quite wealthy. Nine-leaf spirit herbs and thousand-year-old mountain ginseng are rare treasures, yet your Heavenly Mother Sect actually has such precious collections. That's quite remarkable."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Xu Yan became his disciple precisely because of the nine-leaf spirit herbs and thousand-year-old mountain ginseng, which deeply impressed him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, although the nine-leaf spirit herbs and thousand-year-old mountain ginseng are rare, we can still find some in the boundless mountains. Our Heavenly Mother Sect has been forced to hide in the boundless mountains many times, and that's how we obtained these precious collections."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully explained.</p><p></p><p>"Boundless mountains?" Li Xuan's heart stirred.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the boundless mountains are just two hundred miles away from here. They are called 'boundless' because no one can traverse these mountains - no one has been able to reach the end."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er raised his hand, pointing outside Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, "The small village I came to is right next to the boundless mountains. The evil forest seems to extend to the boundless mountains. Could it be that the fire-maned wolves came from the boundless mountains?"</p><p></p><p>He had some guesses, but whether it was true or not, he couldn't be certain yet.</p><p></p><p>"Continue."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan picked up a nine-leaf spirit herb, gesturing for Shi Er to go on.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, the boundless mountains are called 'boundless' because they are endless. The deepest exploration was done by a few supreme martial artists, who went a thousand miles into the boundless mountains but still couldn't find the end.</p><p></p><p>"Due to the deadly miasma, they had to stop the exploration. Those who entered the boundless mountains and returned didn't go beyond a thousand miles, and those who never came back, no one knows what happened to them - they must have died in the mountains."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully explained, wondering if this great person might actually be from the boundless mountains.</p><p></p><p>After hearing this, Li Xuan's guess about the boundless mountains grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>The fire-maned wolves were clearly not ordinary wild beasts, and based on this, the martial prowess in this world should not be so low.</p><p></p><p>The truth might be on the other side of the boundless mountains?</p><p></p><p>Of course, these were just guesses. Whether it was true or not remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

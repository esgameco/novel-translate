        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everyone looked towards Xie Tianheng, the Sword Saint of Cliff Sword Sect. At this moment, his aura was surging, as if he was about to engage in a great battle.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, many powerful experts of the Fatian Alliance had been slain effortlessly by him.</p><p></p><p>"Does he dare to make a move again?" Xie Lingfeng's face turned green, and cold sweat broke out. What was wrong with his father? After coming out of seclusion, he had become so unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Just now, the senior had easily defeated the peak Grandmasters and Half-Step Celestials of the Fatian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And he still wanted to challenge them?</p><p></p><p>"Father, let me explain..." Xie Lingfeng was almost in tears.</p><p></p><p>"Go away, child." Xie Tianheng casually threw the panicked Xie Lingfeng away.</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglan Island, the powerful experts of the Cliff Sword Sect caught Xie Lingfeng and retreated far away.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, don't get too close. If you get caught in the backlash, it would be disastrous!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Sword Master seems to have gone mad. You can't get hurt, the position of Sword Master is waiting for you to inherit."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng almost vomited blood.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still sitting in the chair, looking at Xie Tianheng with a strange expression. This Xie Lingfeng's father was truly formidable!</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng drew his sword, his gaze resolute and solemn: "I, Xie Tianheng, have pursued the ultimate in the Dao of the Sword all my life. I believe that a true sword cultivator must dare to draw their sword against the strong, and dare to break through their limits!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded inwardly. Xie Tianheng was a man with an unyielding spirit, and he also had remarkable talent in the Dao of the Sword. He was an arrogant and proud person.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he would not have so casually disregarded the powerful experts of the Fatian Alliance.</p><p></p><p>His courage was admirable. "During this seclusion, I have had a breakthrough. I believe I have walked a path that no sword cultivator in history has ever walked before. I, Xie Tianheng, am the first sword cultivator to open a new path in the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"I do not consider myself a match for the senior, but I need to temper my sword Dao. The only way is to draw my sword against the strong. Today, I dare to ask the senior for guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng spoke with an arrogant air.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became curious. What had Xie Tianheng comprehended in the Dao of the Sword that could be even stronger than the Sword Dao he had created? How could he claim to be the first in history to open a new path in the Dao of the Sword?</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall see how you can claim to be the first in history in the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"I will not disappoint you!" Xie Tianheng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Then begin." Li Xuan remained seated, not even bothering to stand up.</p><p></p><p>Courage was admirable, to display his sword Dao before him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As Xie Tianheng raised his sword, a fierce sword intent burst forth from him. </p><p></p><p>The sword intent grew stronger and stronger, shaking heaven and earth, converging on the long sword. In this moment, Xie Tianheng was like a towering sword standing between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The ruthless and murderous sword intent gathered, like a raging sword storm!</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglan Island, the anxious Xie Lingfeng and the worried experts of the Cliff Sword Sect were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword Dao was this? A sword intent seemed to stand tall between heaven and earth, fierce and unyielding. Even Half-Step Celestials could not budge it in the slightest!</p><p></p><p>"What powerful sword Dao has the Sword Master comprehended?"</p><p>"Open a new path in the Dao of the Sword? No wonder the Sword Master has become so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Cliff Sword Sect were all dazed.</p><p></p><p>"What has my father comprehended? It feels so powerful!" Xie Lingfeng was also greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xie Tianheng with some surprise. This Sword Master of the Cliff Sword Sect truly had remarkable talent in the Dao of the Sword, surpassing even Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Xu Yan, Xie Tianheng had the greatest talent in the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>And Xie Tianheng was not just a Half-Step Celestial, but a peak Grandmaster. </p><p></p><p>With this fierce and powerful sword intent, he could easily disregard the pressure of a Half-Step Celestial.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xie Tianheng had become so arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xie Tianheng, have comprehended the sword intent. Using intent as the sword, and the sword as the intent. This is a path in the Dao of the Sword that has never been seen before in history. I, Xie Tianheng, am the first to open a new path in the Dao of the Sword. Today, I dare to ask the senior for guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng spoke with an arrogant air, as if he was the unrivaled master under the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled. Xie Tianheng had not comprehended sword will or sword heart, but he had comprehended sword intent. This sword intent was vast and fierce.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xie Tianheng was like a towering sword intent standing between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. If he had not appeared and created an even stronger Sword Dao, and if Xu Yan had not comprehended sword will, Xie Tianheng would truly be the first to open a new path in the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>At least, the first in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, although the sword intent was powerful, in Li Xuan's eyes, it was still too dispersed and weak. It had intent but lacked will. It was ultimately just a powerful sword technique, not true mastery of the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had comprehended sword will, and thus naturally understood sword intent. He just felt it was too weak, and thus directly cultivated an even stronger sword will.</p><p></p><p>Sword intent was not truly part of the Dao of the Sword in Li Xuan's view, but a powerful sword art.</p><p></p><p>"Although your sword intent is vast, it is still too ethereal." Li Xuan shook his head and waved his hand, condensing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into a sword.</p><p></p><p>"In my eyes, you have not yet entered the Dao of the Sword, but you are indeed talented, surpassing many sword cultivators. </p><p></p><p>"This is the sword will. Only one who has comprehended sword will and sword heart can truly enter the Dao of the Sword and comprehend sword will.</p><p></p><p>"Try this sword and see how much you can comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said, waving his hand to send the sword of sword will towards Xie Tianheng.</p><p></p><p>The vast sword will of the Heavenly Sword burst forth.</p><p></p><p>"Sword will?" Xie Tianheng's brow furrowed. He struck down with his sword, and his powerful sword intent condensed into a giant sword, seemingly able to cleave anything.</p><p></p><p>However, as it came into contact with the sword will, it was like oil hitting a burning iron, easily broken through with a sizzling sound.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Xie Tianheng was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Strike!" In that instant, Xie Tianheng's sword intent became even more violent, unleashing the myriad river sword techniques, his sword intent surging like a vast river.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it was utterly powerless against that sword.</p><p></p><p>He had been so confident that his sword intent could defy past and present, yet it now seemed so weak and incapable.</p><p></p><p>"Sword will?!" In this moment, Xie Tianheng was somewhat lost.</p><p></p><p>The more he struck, the more he felt the power and profundity of sword will. His sword intent seemed to be controlled by the sword will, having no offensive power at all.</p><p></p><p>It was as if one who had mastered sword will could easily subdue those sword cultivators without comprehending sword will.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was unwilling. The sword intent he had painstakingly cultivated through seclusion was so powerless? He struck with all his might, his sword intent growing more and more terrifying, its aura surpassing even that of a Half-Step Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"Although your sword intent is powerful, it is still just like a gust of wind. A strong wind can topple a tree or blow away a house, but it cannot move a huge boulder.</p><p></p><p>"Sword will, however, can make that boulder crumble to dust.</p><p></p><p>"You have been able to comprehend sword intent, which is already remarkable. If you can condense intent into will, and comprehend sword will, then..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So you have truly entered the path of the sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled lightly as he spoke and instructed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tian's face was tense, his mentality a bit unstable. After coming out of seclusion, he felt that he had walked a path of the sword that no one had ever walked before, pioneering a new way of the sword.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he did not take the people of the world seriously. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>As a result, his sword technique was so poor?</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the sword, what a mysterious path was that? He had never even heard of it, and in the eyes of this powerful expert, he had not even stepped into the door of the sword Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the guidance, junior will take his leave!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tian's mentality was about to collapse, he sheathed his sword, bowed stiffly and said.</p><p></p><p>After that, he turned and left quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng hurriedly called out.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Master!"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts from Sword Venerable Cliff followed closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>Only Xie Lingfeng was left alone in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Embarrassed, he returned to Canglang Island and said, "Forgive me, my father..."</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he didn't know what to say.</p><p></p><p>"Your father has great talent in the Dao of the Sword. If he can overcome this setback, given time, he will surely be able to enter the door of the Sword Dao and comprehend the Dao of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was a bit surprised, the senior had such a high evaluation of his father?</p><p></p><p>"You still lack a bit to enter the Sword Dao. To comprehend the Dao of the Sword, you can either take the time to ponder it slowly, which will take a long time. Or you can wait for an opportunity, a flash of insight, and then you can comprehend the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"But you can first comprehend the sword technique, and then use the sword technique to refine the Dao of the Sword, this is a more proper path for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke and instructed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's talent was naturally not bad, he was not far from stepping into the door of the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Sword is too difficult to comprehend, not everyone is as monstrous as Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tian's appearance made Li Xuan realize that the threshold for entering the Sword Dao should be lowered.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Sword Dao can take cultivating the sword technique as the foundation, and then use it to comprehend the Dao of the Sword. Even if they ultimately fail to comprehend the Dao of the Sword, as long as they cultivate the sword technique, their strength will also increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you senior for guiding me out of the mist!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>Without staying long on Canglang Island, Xie Lingfeng hurriedly left to comfort his father and learn the sword technique.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Tian, quite interesting!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The matter of the Fa Tian League's rebellion against the Martial Dao Celestials had already spread throughout the inner domain martial world, and all martial artists were paying attention to the result.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom, the atmosphere was tense, the Great Yue Emperor and the great families were all waiting for the news to arrive.</p><p></p><p>The Yan Kingdom, the Purple Cloud Kingdom, and the many powerful forces stationed there, were all the same.</p><p></p><p>This rebellion against the Celestials had brought out many powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>Like the Blue-Faced Man, one of the three great mysterious dark forces, he had lost one Half-Step Celestial, but he still had two Half-Step Celestial experts, the Red Robe and the Purple Robe! </p><p></p><p>This made many top forces feel a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>And the Demon Sect, although it had declined, this time it also revealed its powerful foundation.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Demon Venerable masters almost all appeared.</p><p></p><p>And the infamous Demon Child of the past also made a move, his strength was the strongest among all the Half-Step Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Such a lineup, gathering the might of all the grand masters in the world, the Martial Dao Celestials must have been resentful, right? A few figures from the Great Yue Kingdom returned in a sorry state and entered the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"How is it, did you kill the Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the other powerful experts hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>Those grand master martial artists had extremely pale faces, their bodies slightly trembling, standing on the ground, their legs seeming to have gone soft! "They're dead! They're all dead!"</p><p></p><p>One of them said with a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others had a sinking feeling in their hearts, the state of these few people was not right.</p><p></p><p>An ominous premonition arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Who? The Celestials? Xu Yan, Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor had a glimmer of hope in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"All the Half-Step Celestials, the peak grand masters, are dead!"</p><p></p><p>The grand master said, his voice still trembling.</p><p></p><p>The rest of them also softened their legs and sat on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Dominating the world with ease, unrivaled, and moreover..."</p><p></p><p>The one speaking also collapsed onto the ground.</p><p></p><p>"And moreover what?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's voice also started to tremble.</p><p></p><p>The Half-Step Celestials of the Great Yue Kingdom, one died last time, and this time even the strongest foundation had died! </p><p></p><p>The strength had plummeted in an instant, the only consolation was that the other forces had also suffered heavy losses, so the Great Yue Kingdom was still the strongest nation.</p><p></p><p>"And moreover, that senior expert, with the Martial Dao Profound Realm, fought against everyone, he did not use his realm to suppress others... The Martial Dao of the Great Wilderness is too strong."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others had expressions of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Not using his realm to suppress others, descending his realm to fight on the same level, one person sweeping and killing the Fa Tian League?</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao of the Great Wilderness, at the Profound Realm, was already so powerful? The grand master who spoke continued, "We managed to survive because the senior's virtue was lofty, and he spared us. This battle was not the Fa Tian League rebelling against the Martial Dao Celestials, but the Fa Tian League's rebels, disrupting the inner domain martial world and disturbing the world's living beings.</p><p></p><p>"They acted against the natural order, rebelled against their superiors, oppressed the martial artists, and stirred up turmoil in the martial world, causing great suffering.</p><p></p><p>"They were even insane, colluding with the Demon Sect, and carrying out the evil act of blood sacrifice of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, the senior Martial Dao Celestial stepped in to stem the tide, and killed the rebels of the Fa Tian League.</p><p></p><p>"Restoring the clear and bright inner domain, restoring the righteous order of the martial world..."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>This was defining the nature of this battle, directly labeling the Fa Tian League as an evil force that was disrupting the inner domain and the world, and it was the senior Martial Dao Celestial who had suppressed the evil!</p><p></p><p>The senior Martial Dao Celestial was of great virtue and wisdom, magnificent and towering...</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others had a bitter smile on their faces, they knew very well that this was the senior Celestial not holding a grudge against the various forces! The Fa Tian League must be evil, the senior Martial Dao Celestial was the savior of the inner domain's living beings, a wise and magnificent figure!</p><p></p><p>The truth and facts, whatever they were, had to be determined by what the senior Martial Dao Celestial said!</p><p></p><p>"Issue an edict, condemn the Fa Tian League rebels, disturbing the living beings, blood sacrificing martial artists, distorting black and white, colluding with the Demon Sect..."</p><p></p><p>Piling all kinds of heinous crimes on the Fa Tian League.</p><p></p><p>"...Grateful for the lofty virtue, magnificent and wise senior Martial Dao Celestial, for killing the evil leaders of the Fa Tian League and restoring the clear and bright inner domain, restoring the righteous order of the martial world..."</p><p></p><p>Similar scenes occurred in the Yan Kingdom and the Purple Cloud Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>And the remaining senior experts of the various major forces also issued orders to their disciples, extolling the magnificent merits of the Martial Dao Celestial in saving the inner domain's living beings.</p><p></p><p>As for the Gate of the Spirit Realm, it was just an excuse for the Fa Tian League to cause trouble!</p><p></p><p>For the martial artists below the Grandmaster level who had not truly experienced this event, overnight, the matter of rebelling against the Martial Dao Celestials had undergone a major reversal, they were all bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Was this the truth?</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, it was almost on the verge of great suffering, but fortunately the senior Martial Dao Celestial killed the evil leaders of the Fa Tian League and saved the living beings of the inner domain? But the three major kingdoms and the top forces all spread it this way, and they all expressed gratitude to the senior Martial Dao Celestial, how could this be false? Suddenly, the middle and lower level martial artists were all in tears, so it turned out that the senior Martial Dao Celestial had single-handedly saved the living beings of the inner domain, and saved the lives of countless martial artists.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

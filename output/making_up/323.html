        <h1>Chapter 323</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Great River State, Meng Chong traveled to the Spiritual Realm and arrived at the Great Zhou Kingdom of Sheng State, thinking of his old friend from the Inner Realm, Zi Yun, and wanting to visit her.</p><p></p><p>"Although I have a Jade Token to enter, the Great Zhou Imperial House is just like the Spiritual Sect, so I'm afraid I might be ostracized?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself. As for Zi Yun, he had a fairly deep relationship with her, so if he couldn't stay, he would go to the Qingqing Pavilion instead. He was also familiar with his shijie (sworn sister) there, and their relationship was quite good.</p><p></p><p>Working as a menial laborer at the Qingqing Pavilion would be better than being ostracized in the Great Zhou Imperial House, he thought.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Meng Chong quickened his pace, but still only strode forward without directly taking to the air and flying towards the Great Zhou capital.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a fierce battle erupted not far to his left rear, and the combatants' strength was not weak, nearly comparable to cultivators who had refined a wisp of Heaven and Earth's spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! Who are you?" a furious roar came, followed by the aura of a cultivator who had just refined a wisp of Heaven and Earth's spiritual essence.</p><p></p><p>The battle instantly intensified, and then another powerful aura burst forth, belonging to the attacker.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Are these assassins?" Meng Chong was surprised, for this aura contained a hint of death, similar to the old fellows from the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"This is getting interesting. Are they trying to kill that spiritual essence cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head, not in the mood to watch. Such assassinations and vendettas were constantly unfolding in the Spiritual Realm, and he had encountered several before.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the first time he had encountered such a powerful assassination attempt.</p><p></p><p>"No good!" The cultivator who had refined Heaven and Earth's spiritual essence spoke in a grave tone, his aura exploding to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"Princess Zi Yun, you must flee!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the cultivator unleashed a violent strike, breaking through the encirclement and pushing one person out of the killing circle, then fully engaging the attackers to buy more time for the protected person to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Manager Aqiu!" A cry rang out, and then a graceful purple figure rapidly fled.</p><p></p><p>"You won't escape. The people the Myriad Ages Alliance wants to kill, how can I let you get away?" A cold voice sounded, and an old man's figure appeared, blocking the purple figure's path.</p><p></p><p>"You..." Zi Yun's face changed drastically. She never imagined that on her way to the Qingqing Pavilion, she would encounter an ambush.</p><p></p><p>The other party had obviously planned this in advance!</p><p></p><p>Even someone as strong as Manager Aqiu was likely doomed.</p><p></p><p>Even knowing she was no match, Zi Yun was unwilling to submit to her fate and prepared to fight to the death, when suddenly a massive fist struck from below.</p><p></p><p>"Who!" The old man blocking Zi Yun's path was alarmed, his aura erupting, about to flee, but that punch was too powerful, too fast, leaving him no time to dodge or retaliate.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He was instantly shattered and turned to dust.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was dumbfounded, such a fierce and powerful punch reminded her of someone.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong!" She looked towards the source of the strike, her expression one of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>That burly, muscular figure, that bald head, all told her that it was Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong originally didn't want to get involved, but when he heard Zi Yun's name, he couldn't help but be moved, thinking it couldn't be a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>It turned out that Zi Yun was indeed being pursued. He immediately took action and killed that old man.</p><p></p><p>And the other party had even impersonated a Myriad Ages Alliance cultivator, trying to frame and implicate him.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not part of the Myriad Ages Alliance, his shidi (sworn brother) Fang Hao was the junior alliance master, the future alliance master. He had a deep connection with the Myriad Ages Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was excited and overjoyed, rushing over and clinging to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Wah, Meng Chong, it really is you. I almost thought I'd never see you again!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a helpless expression on his face, wondering why she was hanging on him again. "Meng Chong, quickly, go save Manager Aqiu."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun hurriedly looked up and said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took to the air, and in an instant, he was on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the one called Manager Aqiu was heavily injured and barely hanging on.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong punched out, wind and thunder surging, the massive fist like condensed wind and thunder, with the might of a single punch completely annihilating the attackers.</p><p></p><p>Manager Aqiu was stunned, turning back to see Zi Yun clinging to a burly man, and he couldn't help but be surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Princess Zi Yun!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine!" Zi Yun breathed a sigh of relief, but seeing Manager Aqiu's severe injuries, if not treated promptly, it might even lead to the collapse of his foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, do you have any medicinal pills?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun asked.</p><p></p><p>"Here." Meng Chong handed her a bottle of pills, helplessly saying, "Can you not cling to me like this?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun smiled happily, getting off Meng Chong, pouring out a pill and giving it to Manager Aqiu. "Manager Aqiu, quickly take this to heal your injuries."</p><p></p><p>"This is?" Manager Aqiu hesitated, but considering his own injuries, he hurriedly swallowed the pill, looking at Meng Chong and asking, "Princess Zi Yun, who is this?"</p><p></p><p>"A friend of mine!" Zi Yun's flushed face was filled with excitement. After giving the pill to Manager Aqiu, she said, "Manager Aqiu, you should go back to the imperial capital. Report this to my father the King, and he will escort me to the Qingqing Pavilion, so there won't be any more accidents."</p><p></p><p>Manager Aqiu hesitated, but Zi Yun urged, "Hurry back, he is much stronger than you."</p><p></p><p>Manager Aqiu didn't insist further.</p><p></p><p>After Manager Aqiu left, with no one else around, Zi Yun excitedly jumped up and hugged Meng Chong, asking, "Meng Chong, did you come to find me?"</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so." Meng Chong smacked his lips, "You're living quite well."</p><p></p><p>"It's alright, I'm now part of the Azure King lineage in Great Zhou. My foster father is the Azure King, but the rest of the Great Zhou imperial clan actually look down on me, thinking I'm from a lowly place in the Inner Realm and have disgraced them.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, once I become powerful, I'll slap their faces one by one and see if they still dare to look down on me."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"This time, I'm lucky to have met you, Meng Chong, otherwise I would have been in danger. That Myriad Ages Alliance is so vicious, thinking the Azure King Mansion is easy to bully, so they targeted me."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of the recent crisis, Zi Yun gritted her teeth in anger.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with the Myriad Ages Alliance. Those assassins' methods are more like they come from a top-tier Spiritual Sect, or even a Transcendent Spiritual Sect."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going?"</p><p></p><p>He asked Zi Yun.</p><p></p><p>"To the Qingqing Pavilion, of course. I've missed you, and Lingshou... and the elders."</p><p></p><p>Since Meng Chong said it had nothing to do with the Myriad Ages Alliance, Zi Yun didn't dwell on that issue.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's go together. I'm also going back to the Qingqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two left the battlefield and headed towards the current location of the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're so amazing. Even in Great Zhou, I've heard of your reputation."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun looked at him with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"It's just so-so, I'm only second-best."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled.</p><p></p><p>In the Azure King Mansion in the Great Zhou capital...</p><p></p><p>"What was the attacker's attire?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xing Qing looked at A Qiu with a gloomy expression and said, "The leaked identity information came from the Wanshi Alliance..."</p><p></p><p>A Qiu detailed the assassination attempt and described it thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xing Qing's eyes flashed with a cold light as he said, "The Wanshi Alliance? If the Wanshi Alliance wants to target the Great Zhou, why would they target Zi Yun? My goddaughter, no matter her origins, it's not up to others to interfere."</p><p></p><p>"Does the Prince think I have no temper?"</p><p></p><p>"What does the Prince mean?" A Qiu was startled.</p><p></p><p>Xing Qing took a deep breath and asked in a deep voice, "The one who came to the rescue, what did he look like? Do you know his identity?"</p><p></p><p>A Qiu pondered for a moment and said, "Your Highness, there is someone I can think of, but it's hard to believe."</p><p></p><p>"Who?"</p><p></p><p>"Dao Zun Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Tall and burly, with a bald head - it was clearly the renowned Second Genius of the Lingyu Domain, Meng Chong! </p><p></p><p>Yet, A Qiu found it hard to believe. Meng Chong's strength was so powerful? That punch could have easily shattered A Qiu, a cultivator who had refined a thread of Heaven and Earth's spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong!" Xing Qing paused, as if he had realized something, and was secretly astonished. Zi Yun and Meng Chong were old acquaintances, which could only mean one thing - Meng Chong came from the Inner Domain!</p><p></p><p>The Inner Domain had actually produced such a prodigy! "The matter of Meng Chong's rescue must not be leaked. Tell others that it was a random cultivator who came to the rescue."</p><p></p><p>Xing Qing pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness!" A Qiu respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yuzhou, a city once ruled by the Su family, Tang Jinyan looked at the person she was looking for, her heart filled with excitement and nervousness.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor was kneeling on the ground, respectfully and carefully, not daring to look up at the noble person above him.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the Lingyu Domain, he had thought that with the Jade Token, he could cultivate an even stronger martial dao and become a powerful figure. But the reality was vastly different from his expectations.</p><p></p><p>He had directly fallen to the lowest level of a servant! The former emperor of a great nation had become a servant - how could he accept this? After suffering several beatings, he finally recognized the situation. He deeply regretted entering the Lingyu Domain. If he had surrendered to the Great Wilderness in the Inner Domain, he could have at least gained respect and a prominent position.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to obtain the Heavenly Human Techniques, but as a lowly servant, how could he be qualified to acquire them? Fortunately, the Su family was soon destroyed. As a servant-turned-cultivator, his situation improved somewhat.</p><p></p><p>He even finally obtained the Heavenly Human Martial Dao, breaking through to the Small Heavenly Human Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the Small Heavenly Human Realm, which was considered extraordinary in the Inner Domain, was only a middle-level cultivator in the Lingyu Domain. Above the Small Heavenly Human were the Great Heavenly Humans, and above them were the lofty Refining Spirit Heavenly Humans.</p><p></p><p>Later, even more powerful Supremes were rumored to exist.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor even wanted to return to the Inner Domain and rule there with his Small Heavenly Human strength, but he had no way to open the gate to the Lingyu Domain.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, he had blended in with the other cultivators, gradually adapting to the identity of a cultivator and deliberately hiding his origins from the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>However, today, he was unexpectedly targeted by a powerful Lingxong expert, and he dared not even breathe.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan looked at the Purple Cloud Emperor indifferently and coldly said, "Do you know the Qingqing Pavilion? Do you know Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, I don't know!" The Purple Cloud Emperor shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who had swept through the Inner Domain unrivaled, had already besieged the gates of the Superb Lingxong Sect in the Lingyu Domain in a short time - what a prodigy! </p><p></p><p>No matter what, he couldn't offend Xu Yan. Perhaps if they were to meet, he could even gain some opportunities by virtue of being a fellow from the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"You're from the Inner Domain, how can you not know?" Tang Jinyan sneered, her gaze indifferent as she said, "I'll give you a chance. Tell the truth, and you can join the Lingxong Sect and become a Lingxong cultivator. Your treatment will be vastly different.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that just because you have the Wanshi Alliance, you cultivators can become the masters. You'd better think it through carefully."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, a trace of killing intent appeared, causing the Purple Cloud Emperor to tremble all over.</p><p></p><p>"I really don't know! I'm just a lowly person from the Inner Domain. How could I know the prodigy Xu Yan?" The Purple Cloud Emperor trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Without evidence, why would I come after you? I've even sent people into the Inner Domain before!" Tang Jinyan sneered.</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor's heart skipped a beat. He suddenly felt a force gathering on his head, as if it was about to strike down at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what is the identity of the Qingqing Pavilion's Pavilion Master in the Inner Domain? What is Xu Yan's identity in the Inner Domain?" Tang Jinyan spoke coldly, the killing intent chilling.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you, I'll tell you!" The Purple Cloud Emperor cowered, knowing that if he continued to be stubborn, he would definitely die.</p><p></p><p>"The Qingqing Pavilion was founded by the Inner Domain's Medical King's granddaughter, Su Zhen. Xu Yan and her are fellow disciples, and they have a mysterious senior master behind them..."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor trembled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan's expression remained unchanged, but she was inwardly shocked. Xu Yan and Suli Xiu were fellow disciples, then what about Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>"What about Meng Chong?" She asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is Xu Yan's junior disciple, they are all from the same sect."</p><p></p><p>The Purple Cloud Emperor told her everything he knew, especially about the mysterious senior master.</p><p></p><p>"What about Fang Hao?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan asked again. These people had suddenly risen to prominence in the Lingyu Domain, being extraordinary prodigies. Fang Hao's methods were extremely profound and mysterious, especially that communication item that had broken the communication format of the Lingyu Domain.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I really don't know about Fang Hao!" The Purple Cloud Emperor hurriedly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan murmured to herself, "Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Suli Xiu, they all have a master behind them, and they are all from the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"From the lowly lands of the Inner Domain, how can there be such prodigies?</p><p></p><p>"Who is their master? The Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, she thought of a possibility, and her heart was thrown into a tumultuous storm.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon didn't die? And he had returned in a more hidden way, cultivating prodigious disciples, stirring up the winds and waves in the Lingyu Domain. What he was plotting must be immense.</p><p></p><p>"This noble person, I've told you all I know. Can I leave now?" The Purple Cloud Emperor asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you. You're still useful." Tang Jinyan waved her hand, and the Purple Cloud Emperor's eyes went dark as he fainted.</p><p></p><p>"Take him to the Thousand Martial Hall!" Tang Jinyan gritted her teeth as she said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss!" The maidservant took out a bag and stuffed the Purple Cloud Emperor into it, then carried him on her shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The master and servant duo quietly left Yuzhou and headed towards the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan and Meng Chong's backer was indeed the Blood Demon, this would be a earth-shattering event in the Lingyu Domain. Tang Jinyan had made a meritorious contribution, and the Water Star Palace would also rise along with the Superb Lingxong Sect.</p><p></p><p>She could also use the Superb Lingxong Sect's hand to eliminate the hidden danger of the Qingqing Pavilion, and kill that bastard! The Superb Lingxong Sect would surely exert its full force to act, as the Qingqing Pavilion's medicinal arts and medical techniques were coveted by countless people.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see how you will resist the entire Lingxong Sect family!"</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan's backer was indeed the Blood Demon, the Superb Lingxong Sect would certainly join forces to assassinate him. The rules of genius confrontation would all be ignored.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon must die, this was the bottom line principle of the Superb Lingxong Sect! (Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 408</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the horizon outside the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom, a figure approached silently and slowly, as if merging into the clouds. Even the Great Yue Emperor had not detected the arrival.</p><p></p><p>Because Immortal Celestial Lords were in harmony with heaven and earth and had the ability to control a domain, it was very difficult for them to conceal themselves from other Immortal Celestial Lords. </p><p></p><p>Let alone enter the domain controlled by another Immortal Celestial Lord silently and without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Yet at this moment, someone had actually accomplished this!</p><p></p><p>"Interesting," Li Xuan thought with some surprise. The power behind these Heavenly Fiends was indeed controlled by someone above the Immortal Celestial Lord level.</p><p></p><p>The person in the clouds was an Immortal Celestial Lord, not as powerful as the Great Yue Emperor, but somewhat stronger than Sui Hongwu. </p><p></p><p>Among Immortal Celestial Lords, he was not top-tier, but also not the weakest.</p><p></p><p>He wore a mask of dark clouds on his face, engraved with seven leaves.</p><p></p><p>"Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend? No, that's not right. The little toad said the Heavenly Fiends wore fierce demon masks, not cloud masks."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze fell on the black robe the figure was wearing. This garment had a trace of the Dao's rhythm swirling around it.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that it separated the wearer from the power of heaven and earth, preventing detection by the Immortal Celestial Lord who controlled this domain.</p><p></p><p>"This robe cannot be made by an Immortal Celestial Lord. It requires condensing a trace of the Dao's rhythm to surround it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could be certain that this robe must have been made by the powerful figure behind the Heavenly Fiends, bestowed upon them for carrying out missions. </p><p></p><p>Besides the robe, this Immortal Celestial Lord was also extremely skilled in stealth.</p><p></p><p>This assassin, like a patch of dark clouds, hid within the cloud layer and floated above the capital of Great Yue. After scouting for a while, his gaze locked onto the Qimen Institute and the Medicine Institute.</p><p></p><p>He did not make a move, but waited silently, as if biding his time.</p><p></p><p>"If he gets close to the Great Yue imperial palace, even with the robe's concealment, he won't be able to escape the Great Yue Emperor's detection. But from this distance, if no Immortal Celestial Lord intervenes, he could kill everyone in the Medicine Institute and Qimen Institute in one strike."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan observed with interest.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked up at the sky and muttered, "The mastermind behind this is likely not in the Divine Realm. I wonder how their strength compares to mine now?"</p><p></p><p>He sneered, "Although I'm only at the Void-Breaking Realm, even if I can't kill those above Immortal with one slap, they may not necessarily be my match."</p><p></p><p>Daring to target his disciples - once his strength increased, he would let them know the consequences of provoking a master!</p><p></p><p>"Oh? These Heavenly Fiends are quite insidious."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly raised an eyebrow. </p><p></p><p>An Immortal Celestial Lord had come to visit the Great Yue Emperor from the Nine Mountains Realm, seemingly with important business.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan raised an eyebrow in surprise, "What is Ping Qiu from Broken Sunset Mountain doing here? Has something happened?"</p><p></p><p>Broken Sunset Mountain was one of the nine mountains of the Nine Mountains Realm, and Ping Qiu was an Immortal Celestial Lord from there.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go see?" Feng Yan was curious.</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't leave!" He took a deep breath, suppressing his curiosity, and continued to stand guard.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Ping Qiu, what brings you here?" The Great Yue Emperor received Ping Qiu.</p><p></p><p>"Great Yue Emperor, something major has happened," Ping Qiu said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor asked curiously, "What major event? Is the Heavenly Abyss in the Nine Mountains Realm unstable and in need of support?"</p><p></p><p>"It's not about the Heavenly Abyss." Ping Qiu took a deep breath and said with an extremely solemn expression, "Great Yue Emperor, have you heard of the Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor looked puzzled, "Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows? I've never heard of them!"</p><p></p><p>"My Broken Sunset Mountain has received intelligence that this Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows organization intends to incite conflict between the Nine Mountains Realm. They even have a sinister plan for the Qinghua Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Ping Qiu told the Great Yue Emperor about the Heavenly Fiends' plans in detail. It matched closely with the information Little Ha had brought back, and even included some details Little Ha hadn't known.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was shocked, "Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely true!"</p><p></p><p>Ping Qiu's expression was grave as he then revealed information that even shocked the Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Fiends seem to have reached a secret agreement with the Heavenly Abyss. The Abysses in the Nine Mountains Realm are no longer unstable, and some of the enemies from beyond have even withdrawn from the Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Heavenly Fiends will soon create major turmoil in the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Now the Great Yue Emperor was truly unsettled.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Fiends colluding with the Heavenly Abyss - were they planning to cooperate from within and without, using outside forces to achieve the unification of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Ping Qiu's arrival and the information he brought shocked many Immortal Celestial Lords. After informing the Great Yue Emperor, Ping Qiu hurriedly left for the Heavenly Martial Gate and the Myriad Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>"These Heavenly Fiends don't care if their plans are known. They have only one goal - as long as the Divine Realm falls into chaos."</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's mutual slaughter or uniting to suppress the Heavenly Fiends..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. The Heavenly Fiends were all fanatics.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of so-called unification of heaven and earth, for the sake of restoring the glory of heaven and earth, they had become somewhat insane.</p><p></p><p>"The time still hasn't come? What opportunity are they waiting for to strike?" Li Xuan looked towards the assassin in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Ping Qiu came again, this time from the Myriad Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>This series of actions dispelled the Great Yue Emperor and others' suspicions about him, making them believe he had truly come to give advance warning.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed quite clever," Li Xuan nodded, curious about how these two would make their move next.</p><p></p><p>Two Immortal Celestial Lords, one deeply hidden, one overt and one covert - were they coming for him, planning to assassinate him?</p><p></p><p>"They're not really coming for me, are they?" Li Xuan muttered, suddenly intrigued.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how you make your move."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to act as if he hadn't noticed anything, silently waiting.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Ping Qiu came with the Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>This was at Ping Qiu's request. After learning of the miraculous effects of the formations and pills, he had earnestly asked the Great Yue Emperor to let him personally meet Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu to purchase formation disks and pills.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was naturally to strengthen Broken Sunset Mountain's defenses and guard against attacks from the Heavenly Fiends.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor pondered for a moment. He didn't want to refuse Ping Qiu outright, as he was an Immortal Celestial Lord after all, representing Broken Sunset Mountain and coming with good intentions.</p><p></p><p>So he could only personally bring Ping Qiu here.</p><p></p><p>"Ping Qiu, what are you doing here?" Feng Yan asked with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Feng Yan? Since you're here too, that's even better. Please put in a good word for me. I've come to purchase formation disks and pills, and to visit Brother Fang Hao and Miss Su Lingxiu." Ping Qiu was slightly surprised, then said happily.</p><p></p><p>He wanted Feng Yan to speak up for him, given their shared status as Immortal Celestial Lords of the Nine Mountains Realm, to help him successfully buy the formation disks and pills.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, as long as you can afford the treasures," Feng Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Whether he put in a good word or not didn't matter. As long as Ping Qiu could afford the treasures, he would naturally be able to purchase what he needed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu only looked at the treasures offered when selling formation disks and pills.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Neither Great Yue Emperor nor Feng Yan doubted Ping Qiu, as they had confirmed over the past few days that Ping Qiu was not a problem. If he was the assassin, why would he have fully revealed the plans of Tianshadiying?</p><p></p><p>"It's time to make a move," Li Xuan glanced up. At this moment, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable in the clouds had moved slightly closer, maintaining a very clever distance - not close enough to be detected by Great Yue Emperor, yet able to launch a devastating attack in an instant. One look and you could tell this was an experienced old assassin.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu walked out. Ping Qiu was taking out treasures, discussing buying formation disks and pills with the two of them, and learning how to use the formation disks and pills. </p><p></p><p>He showed no intention of making a move. Even at such close range, he had no thought of taking action. After all, with Great Yue Emperor and Feng Yan nearby, even if he suddenly attacked, he might not necessarily be able to kill anyone with his strength. Moreover, there was still an unknown mysterious expert present.</p><p></p><p>"This set of warning formations is most suitable for what you need. It covers a wide area, and once an outsider infiltrates, it will sound an alarm and activate the power of the formation..." Fang Hao took out a set of formation disks and explained to Ping Qiu.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a terrifying aura descended, extremely swift. As soon as the aura appeared, a powerful attack had already landed.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Ping Qiu's expression changed drastically. Energy surged from his body as he launched a fierce counterattack, as if trying to block the incoming assault.</p><p></p><p>Great Yue Emperor's expression changed, and his great halberd instantly struck out, thunderously attacking the Immortal Heavenly Venerable who had suddenly descended from the clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshadiying?!" Great Yue Emperor was furious. An Immortal Heavenly Venerable had sneaked in, and he hadn't noticed at all. How did they manage that?</p><p></p><p>Terrifying power of heaven and earth poured down at this moment. The opponent's first move was a savage strike, aimed not at him or Feng Yan, but at Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>This attack's power covered an extremely wide area, and concealed a true killing intent. If it couldn't be completely blocked, even a bit of residual energy spreading out would be enough to annihilate any cultivator below the True King Heavenly Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" Feng Yan was enraged. A layer of rock-like power emerged from his body. With a rumbling sound, the rock-like defense expanded outward, protecting Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao inside.</p><p></p><p>Puff! A cold light suddenly stabbed at his defense, piercing a hole in the rock with a puff.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's expression changed. As energy surged through his body, he threw out a punch. A powerful force of destruction rose to the sky, attacking the assailant.</p><p></p><p>This destructive force shocked even Great Yue Emperor. How could Feng Yan possess such powerful martial arts? In terms of pure domineering force, this punch from Feng Yan was far more savage than his great halberd.</p><p></p><p>This was the minor divine ability that Feng Yan had painstakingly cultivated - the Great Destruction Fist.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" A cold aura surged from the attacking Immortal Heavenly Venerable's body. Their aura became savage, as they instantly employed a secret technique at no small cost.</p><p></p><p>"Let's join forces to stop him!" Ping Qiu roared, his aura erupting as his eyes turned red, seemingly furious at the attacker.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He made his move, launching a powerful attack towards the sky. His figure moved as if about to soar upwards to intercept the attacker.</p><p></p><p>However, in that split second, Ping Qiu suddenly changed direction. Taking advantage of the moment when Feng Yan's defense was pierced, he tore through that rock-like defense and raised his hand to strike at Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu!</p><p></p><p>This sudden turn of events was completely unexpected for Great Yue Emperor and Feng Yan.</p><p></p><p>Ping Qiu had long since gained their trust.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had just been exerting himself to resist the attack.</p><p></p><p>They never imagined that he would turn out to be the real assassin!</p><p></p><p>"Ping Qiu!" Great Yue Emperor was furious beyond words, but at this moment he couldn't turn back to save them.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's face turned red as he let out an angry roar. He allowed the attack from above to pour down on him, his body covered in rock-like armor, using the fastest speed of his life to try and use his own body to block the attack for Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"They won't die! As long as they don't die, it's worth it!" Feng Yan thought to himself, gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched. This old fellow Feng Yan was truly giving his all to prove himself, but in front of a high-level expert like himself, did his disciple really need someone to use their body as a shield? Where would that leave his face as the expert? He had been watching all along, wanting to see how Ping Qiu would coordinate with that other person, and also waiting to see if they would come to assassinate him. However, when the one in the sky made their move, Li Xuan was certain - their target wasn't him.</p><p></p><p>It was Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"By killing my disciple, they would surely enrage me, leading me to take action and cause an uproar in the Divine Realm? Interesting!" Li Xuan instantly understood the enemy's intentions.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could almost be certain that Tianshadiying had infiltrated many major forces in the Divine Realm, including some highly respected Immortal Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>To eliminate Immortal Heavenly Venerables would, to some extent, inevitably make enemies of various major forces.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Li Xuan let out a light snort, but it was like a thunderclap, shaking the Immortal Heavenly Venerable's mind.</p><p></p><p>Before Ping Qiu's attack could reach Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu, before Feng Yan could use the attack from above to boost his own speed and block the attack for Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu, a giant Vajra palm wrapped in angry thunder, unparalleled and domineering, suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>As this giant Vajra palm appeared, all attacks seemed to dissipate like clouds and smoke. Rolling thunder seemed capable of destroying the world.</p><p></p><p>The giant Vajra hand grabbed Ping Qiu directly, rendering all his struggles and frantic attacks futile.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the raging thunder and overwhelming Vajra power, as the five fingers closed, Ping Qiu's screams didn't even have a chance to escape before he was reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The giant Vajra hand reached towards the sky, grabbing the attacking Immortal Heavenly Venerable. Their expression was one of utter terror. Even exerting all their strength and using some secret techniques, they couldn't escape at all.</p><p></p><p>"Mere ants dare to play tricks before me?" A supremely majestic voice rang out. With a grasp of the Vajra thunder, the attacker was annihilated into ashes.</p><p></p><p>All attacks, all the savage power of the Immortal Heavenly Venerable, were smoothed out at this moment.</p><p></p><p>From the start of the attack to Ping Qiu's betrayal, it all happened in an instant. Yue Changming and the others didn't even have time to react before everything was calmed under the giant Vajra hand wrapped in rolling thunder.</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks of the Immortal Heavenly Venerable's battle didn't even have time to spread out before they were smoothed away.</p><p></p><p>It was as if nothing had happened, as if that Immortal Heavenly Venerable's attack was just an illusion!</p><p></p><p>Only Great Yue Emperor and Feng Yan were deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>The senior expert was truly unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"In front of the expert, Ping Qiu's sneak attack was nothing but a joke. The expert had already seen through everything and was just watching the show," Great Yue Emperor sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan, however, was full of regret: "I'm so slow-witted! I didn't even notice Ping Qiu was the real assassin. I should have at least blocked his attack with my body. Such a chance to prove myself, wasted!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

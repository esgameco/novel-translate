        <h1>Chapter 456</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Realm was as calm as usual, without any disturbances. The many Immortal Heavenly Venerables on Cloud Sky Island gradually relaxed their previously tense hearts.</p><p></p><p>That prodigy who single-handedly killed twenty Immortal Heavenly Venerables was likely just visiting the Azure Sea Realm for sightseeing, not to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sky Fiend Earth Shadow, for the time being, there was no movement from them. </p><p></p><p>They neither sent powerful experts to investigate, nor declared any revenge. It was as if the ones who died were not their people.</p><p></p><p>This made all the Immortal Heavenly Venerables on Cloud Sky Island wonder - had the Sky Fiend Earth Shadow become cowardly? </p><p></p><p>Did they realize that person was unbeatable? After learning more these past few days, the Immortal Heavenly Venerables also found out who killed the Sky Fiend Earth Shadow's experts!</p><p></p><p>The Sword God Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>It could be no one else.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Fiend Earth Shadow had been targeting him all along, while Xu Yan had also been attacking and killing Sky Fiend Earth Shadow's people, destroying many of their branch locations and slaying numerous Immortal Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Divine Realm, only one other person could match him - the Celestial God Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Of course, in terms of battle achievements, Xu Yan was clearly stronger and more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the vast ocean of the Azure Sea Realm, a huge blood-red shadow flashed by and stopped outside an island. A pair of faint crimson eyes stared at the people on the island.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the blood-colored eyes looked towards another area of the sea.</p><p></p><p>There was a Heavenly Rift located there.</p><p></p><p>"If I devour the martial artists on this island and then enter the Heavenly Rift, would I be able to escape?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I can't ruin the big plan because of momentary greed. Continue hiding for now, it's not far from when we'll make our move."</p><p></p><p>The massive blood-colored shadow dove into the deep sea, heading towards a certain location.</p><p></p><p>That place was where the Great Heavenly Rift of the Azure Sea Realm was located.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we occupy this Heavenly Rift, we'll have a foothold in the Azure Sea Realm. Everything after that will be much easier."</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored shadow lurked at the bottom of the sea outside that enormous Heavenly Rift, concealing its form and quietly waiting for the right moment to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, two sea spirits patrolled by but did not discover the powerful being hidden beneath the seabed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Earth Cloud Realm, the huge Heavenly Rift had expanded further.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Pink light flashed inside the Heavenly Rift, and Mei Wu's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it agreed that you'd lure Xu Yan there?"</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert outside the Heavenly Rift replied helplessly: "According to Sky Seventeen's message, that Xu Yan fellow didn't take the bait. He seems to have become more cautious. For the sake of your plan, our Sky Fiend Earth Shadow took the initiative to attack and try to capture him, but we failed."</p><p></p><p>"We lost over twenty Immortal Realm experts. We're just one step away from the plan. Please be patient a little longer, Senior. We can't cause a disturbance now."</p><p></p><p>The Sky Fiend Earth Shadow expert was very helpless.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know what had provoked Mei Wu, but she was insistent on capturing that Xu Yan person.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Cloud Heavenly Rift had been continuously expanding. They were not far from the final step. If Mei Wu caused a commotion now and powerful experts noticed, all their efforts would be wasted.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu snorted coldly before finally leaving.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Fiend Earth Shadow expert breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Mountain Realm was named for its mountains that resembled dragons.</p><p></p><p>There were also legends that at the highest peak of the Dragon Mountain Realm, those with the right destiny could sense the presence of true dragon qi.</p><p></p><p>Other tales said a true dragon had once fallen here, and it was the influence of the true dragon qi that caused the mountains to take on dragon-like shapes.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors of the existence of true dragon blood.</p><p></p><p>The many legends of the Dragon Mountain Realm all involved true dragons. Undoubtedly, the Dragon Mountain Realm was the strongest realm for spirit beasts in the Divine Realm. Powerful spirit beasts always liked to search for true dragon treasures in the Dragon Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Abyss was located on True Dragon Peak in the Dragon Mountain Realm. Its shape resembled a true dragon, and legend said it was where the true dragon had fallen. The current master of Dragon Abyss was an azure flood dragon.</p><p></p><p>The azure flood dragon was extremely powerful, one of the Twelve Spirit Beast Kings of the Divine Realm. It had long resided in Dragon Abyss, seeking to find the destiny of the true dragon and obtain the opportunity to transform into a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>A man and a tiger were heading towards True Dragon Peak.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Seventeen, you're not asking this king to fight that long worm, are you? That long worm is quite strong, it would be very tiring to fight it. It could exhaust a tiger to death! You must compensate me, otherwise this job isn't worth doing!" </p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger complained loudly.</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen's face darkened beneath his mask. This wind spirit tiger was too much. Not only had it been dragging its feet the whole way, it kept finding excuses to demand treasures. It even refused to continue if not given what it wanted!</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how many treasures he'd been extorted out of on this journey.</p><p></p><p>But for the sake of the greater plan, Sky Seventeen could only endure it.</p><p></p><p>"When you die, I'll keep your tiger skin and drape it over my chair!" </p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen thought maliciously to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm not asking you to fight the azure flood dragon. Besides, the azure flood dragon has already left this place," </p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"The long worm left? How is that possible? Wasn't it supposed to be here seeking the destiny of the true dragon?" </p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>"If there really was a true dragon's destiny here, it would have been found long ago. The azure flood dragon left because it was attracted by another treasure."</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen spoke in a flat tone.</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger glanced at Sky Seventeen, understanding in its heart that the azure flood dragon had been lured away by Sky Fiend Earth Shadow's people.</p><p></p><p>"Then why did you bring me here?" </p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"To activate your bloodline. Using your bloodline as a catalyst to summon an object to appear."</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen stopped in midair above Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"It's related to my bloodline?"</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"There's some connection."</p><p></p><p>At this point, to gain the wind spirit tiger's trust and proceed according to his plan, he had to reveal some information.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these weren't the whole truth, but they were true facts.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger suddenly became interested.</p><p></p><p>For spirit beasts, the strength of their abilities depended on the limits of their bloodline.</p><p></p><p>Each time they enhanced their bloodline, it was an increase in strength. Once the bloodline reached its limit, their strength could no longer improve.</p><p></p><p>Human martial artists could continuously improve themselves through martial arts cultivation. Theoretically, there was no upper limit, it all depended on talent and insight.</p><p></p><p>But spirit beasts were different. The upper limit of their bloodline was their ancestral bloodline.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the level of their ancestors, that was the limit. Breaking through further was impossible.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the strength and rank of spirit beasts was related to the rank of their spirit beast ancestors. The stronger the ancestor, the higher the rank naturally.</p><p></p><p>The ancestors of spirit beasts all originated from Otherworldly True Spirits, and even Otherworldly True Spirits were divided into strong and weak.</p><p></p><p>The earliest spirit beasts were called True Spirits, without the "Otherworldly" prefix, to distinguish them from Otherworldly True Spirits. True Spirits had intelligence and understood how to cultivate attack and defense techniques or possessed innate abilities.</p><p></p><p>Otherworldly True Spirits, on the other hand, had no intelligence and were no different from wild beasts, fighting and defending purely on instinct, unable to flexibly use their own abilities.</p><p></p><p>The ultimate wish of all spirit beasts was to become a True Spirit!</p><p></p><p>When the wind spirit tiger heard it was related to its bloodline, it naturally became interested.</p><p></p><p>"Wind spirit tiger, you possess the bloodline of the True Spirit Celestial Tiger, although it's extremely diluted. But that tiny bit of bloodline still exists. All tiger-type spirit beasts in the world originated from the Celestial Tiger."</p><p></p><p>"You are the number one tiger of the Divine Realm, even more..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Any tiger's bloodline would be purer. Coming here is to awaken that trace of celestial tiger bloodline within you, in order to summon a certain treasure."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger didn't notice the change in Tian Seventeen's tone. Instead, its eyes widened as it nodded vigorously, saying excitedly: "I've always suspected I might have the legendary celestial tiger bloodline. So it's true after all."</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's true. After awakening your bloodline, it will benefit you as well. It will break through your bloodline limitations, allowing you to advance further. So this cooperation is beneficial for both of us..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen glanced at Wind Spirit Tiger, secretly nodding. Since Wind Spirit Tiger hadn't noticed any issues, there was no need to use force. As long as it cooperated obediently, that would be enough.</p><p></p><p>By the time it realized there was a problem, it would be too late to escape.</p><p></p><p>Standing on Dragon Abyss, Tian Seventeen explained to Wind Spirit Tiger, half truthfully and half falsely, about this plan and how they should cooperate going forward. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, he looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself: "Whether a true dragon fell in Dragon Mountain Realm in the past is unknown, but soon, a true dragon will indeed fall."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, immersed in his martial arts pursuits, looked up at the sky and then towards the four directions of the divine realm, muttering: "Undercurrents are surging. Something big is about to happen."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, not bothering to intervene or interfere.</p><p></p><p>As several of his disciples had breakthroughs in strength, he had reaped great benefits as well, further improving his own abilities. Especially Meng Chong and Xu Yan - one of them slaughtering many Immortal Venerable Lords who had surrounded him brought considerable feedback.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when Xu Yan will be able to comprehend the Realm of Establishing the Way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation. </p><p></p><p>Once entering that realm, he would truly have confidence.</p><p></p><p>With his innate Great Dao physique and various divine abilities, even the former Lord of Taicang Heaven and Earth might not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Establishing the Way is still not safe enough. Above that realm, I would feel even more confident."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued his martial arts pursuits.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Qinghua Sect was changing with each passing day. With the successful arrangement and continuous strengthening of the Qinghua Grand Formation, cultivation speed greatly increased while difficulty decreased.</p><p></p><p>More and more martial artists were breaking through to the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were many martial artists who had accumulated experience over a long time and polished themselves at the peak of Tempering Truth realm. Now with more active spiritual energy in heaven and earth, along with pills to assist in breaking through bottlenecks, Immortal realm martial artists were appearing almost every few days.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, Immortal realm experts will be everywhere in Qinghua Sect."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. In a short time, the strength of Qinghua realm had far surpassed what it was in the past.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that most of them are in the early stage of the Immortal realm. It still takes time to accumulate strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally wouldn't worry about these things.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the title of Qinghua Dao Ancestor, he didn't pay much attention to Qinghua Sect's affairs. These were things that Fang Hao, as the sect leader, should handle.</p><p></p><p>There were also more and more martial artists specializing in formations, restrictions, artifact refining, and pill refining. Qinghua Sect's martial arts system was gradually beginning to change.</p><p></p><p>Newly recruited talented seedlings were all being taught the martial arts of the Great Wilderness, rather than those of Taicang.</p><p></p><p>It was said that this was the method passed down by the Qinghua Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a long time since I went to see Tian Zi. That guy must be getting impatient waiting. Next time I go see him, I must trick out of him all the things I need to know."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly pleased. With the added aura of a Dao Ancestor, it would be much easier to fool Tian Zi.</p><p></p><p>"The number of Immortal Venerable Lords has increased. I should find time to give another lecture on the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Giving another lecture should bring some gains, such as making his Dao Ancestor aura even more impressive.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Jiang Buping killed an Immortal Venerable Lord with one spear strike. Your Extreme Soul Martial Arts experience has improved."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had also started killing Immortal Venerable Lords.</p><p></p><p>"The discarded piece is about to rise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked in a certain direction, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was starting to show his edge. The divine realm was about to have one more fierce character.</p><p></p><p>And this one was a discarded piece of Taikun.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, half a month later, Cai Linger excitedly told him news from the divine realm, which included Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>By now, the news of Taikun's discarded son Jiang Buping had spread throughout the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Once a generational talent, he had unexpectedly become crippled and was expelled from his family. Now he was rising powerfully, naturally becoming the hottest topic in the martial arts world of the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists were waiting for the reaction of the Jiang clan of Taikun, and the reaction of Cloud Top Sect.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was showing his edge, and various signs indicated that his becoming crippled back then was due to sabotage. Now that he had risen, he would surely demand an explanation from the Jiang clan of Taikun.</p><p></p><p>In the following period, news about Xu Yan greatly decreased. Xu Yan gradually faded from view, with no more reports of him killing Immortal Venerable Lords.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong in Great Flame Realm also had no major movements. After all, the Treasure Alliance was no longer pursuing him, or perhaps they were preparing a big move. During this time, news of Meng Chong killing powerful experts naturally decreased significantly as well.</p><p></p><p>The attention of the divine realm's martial arts world focused on Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>News kept updating, such as Cloud Top Sect sending out three Immortal Venerable Lords to assassinate Jiang Buping, but all of them were killed!</p><p></p><p>For instance, the Jiang clan sent an elder to approach Jiang Buping, claiming that the clan was willing to accept him back and elevate his status within the clan, offering him a seat among the elders, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping directly refused.</p><p></p><p>In fact, towards the end, that Jiang clan elder was killed by Jiang Buping with one spear strike, only his corpse sent back to the Jiang clan of Taikun.</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened during the negotiation process, outsiders did not know.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's actions were undoubtedly a provocation against the Jiang clan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, by now, many powerful experts had realized that Jiang Buping had cultivated an extremely powerful soul technique.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a piece of news spread throughout the divine realm, instantly shocking everyone! When Jiang Buping became crippled back then, it was because his soul was tainted by unmelting qi. Now not only had he not lost his intelligence, but he had become even stronger, cultivating a powerful soul technique.</p><p></p><p>This must contain secrets of heaven and earth, perhaps even fortuitous encounters!</p><p></p><p>As is well known, once tainted by unmelting qi, one would inevitably lose their intelligence. Even those stronger than Immortal Venerable Lords could not avoid this, let alone Immortal Venerable Lords themselves.</p><p></p><p>As for what level of strength was needed to be unafraid of the erosion of unmelting qi, that was beyond their understanding.</p><p></p><p>Yet Jiang Buping had broken this age-old common sense, which shocked many powerful experts and also aroused their greed. If they could obtain such a secret, wouldn't it be a great opportunity?</p><p></p><p>A hunt targeting Jiang Buping was quietly unfolding, with many powerful experts participating.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul Martial Arts is inherently a path of killing, a path of extremes. The soul techniques of Taicang martial artists are too weak. Mere Immortal Venerable Lords wanting to surround and kill Jiang Buping - it's far too difficult."</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan learned of this news, he shook his head and smiled. Extreme Soul Martial Arts was a complete mismatch for Taicang martial artists. Their soul defenses were like paper.</p><p></p><p>As long as they couldn't defend against soul attacks, no matter how many people there were, it would be difficult to hunt down Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Jiang Buping had already cultivated an unmelting soul. Those at the Immortal realm had no ability to erase an unmelting soul. If Jiang Buping wanted to escape, no one could stop him.</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul Martial Arts was about to show its might this time.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

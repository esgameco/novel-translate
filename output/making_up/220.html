        <h1>Chapter 220</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong walked over and respectfully paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "You want to go to the Spirit Realm, don't you?"</p><p></p><p>He could see that Xu Yan wanted to enter the Spirit Realm's gate, to accumulate his own foundation there and strive to break through the Divine Consciousness Realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped his tea, not speaking, but rather deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm, the upper limit of the Martial Dao, is not something the Inner Realm can compare to. Even Cultivating Divine Celestials may not necessarily be the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had thoroughly mastered the Profound, with huge improvements in his Sword Dao and Sword Intent, especially the Xun Wind Sword Intent, which is a sword intent that can slay divine souls.</p><p></p><p>For Martial Dao Celestials, this is an extremely difficult-to-resist killing move. </p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that even though Xu Yan has only reached the Profound Perfection realm, he has no problem killing Lesser Celestials. Even when facing Greater Celestials, he still has the power to fight.</p><p></p><p>Greater Celestials belong to the Divine Realm stage, their spiritual consciousness is stronger, and they have a certain ability to resist the Xun Wind Sword Intent, but they will still be affected, and their strength cannot be fully unleashed.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan's current realm, to further advance the Xun Wind Sword Intent and possess greater killing power is temporarily impossible.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Xu Yan's current strength can kill Lesser Celestials and even some trash Greater Celestials, but if he encounters powerful Greater Celestials, he may not be able to gain the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>However, if he needs to flee, he will have no problem doing so.</p><p></p><p>But what if he encounters a siege?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan originally thought that after Xu Yan broke through the Divine Consciousness Realm, he could then enter the Spirit Realm, so that he could face more dangers.</p><p></p><p>"Well, the path of the martial artist is not an easy one. Xu Yan's talent, fortune, and strength are not lacking. Going to the Spirit Realm to roam will be beneficial for his faster growth.</p><p></p><p>"Just like when he first entered the Inner Realm, his strength quickly improved."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought it through, Xu Yan spent a lot of time accumulating his foundation in the Inner Realm, it would be better for him to enter the Spirit Realm and roam around, he could quickly accumulate enough to break through the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>"There are many powerful experts in the Spirit Realm, when encountering strong enemies, fleeing is a must. Speed alone is not enough, one must also know how to conceal one's own presence, that is the key.</p><p></p><p>"I almost forgot, the art of concealing one's presence and hiding one's form can evade the detection of powerful experts, so when encountering danger, one can also escape."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly remembered that he had overlooked the art of concealing one's presence and hiding one's form.</p><p></p><p>This is indispensable for roaming the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>It can often turn danger into safety, allowing one to escape with one's life. It is essential for dealing with powerful enemies and strong forces in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm, with your current strength, does pose some dangers. Offending powerful forces is a common occurrence, but every strong expert rises by stepping on one powerful expert and force after another.</p><p></p><p>"Those are all stepping stones, but when facing a powerful force, one careless move can lead to ruin."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put down his teacup and spoke in a serious tone.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, you should have gained some experience in roaming the martial dao world. Talented geniuses do not strive for momentary victory or defeat, they retreat when they should retreat, avoid when they should avoid, act according to the situation, and grasp their own advantages.</p><p></p><p>"I have taught you the martial dao techniques and killing arts, but I have not yet taught you how to conceal your presence and avoid strong enemies. Today, I will pass on to you the art of concealing one's presence and hiding one's form."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Ling Xiu were overjoyed to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Before this, Li Xuan had not prepared the art of concealing one's presence and hiding one's form, he could only improvise it on the spot. At this moment, several incantations had already appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully, whether it's concealing one's presence and hiding one's form or hiding one's own body, it's all within this art. Carefully ponder and comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>The three disciples respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Blend with the light, merge with the dust, mingle with things, fuse with the void; dwell in heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth know me not!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Blend with the light, merge with the dust..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled, muttering a sentence, feeling that the brief words contained profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu also fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Go and comprehend it. When you have grasped the basics of concealing your presence and hiding your form, you can then go to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The three disciples bowed and left.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the mountain peak, Xu Yan murmured, "Blend with the light, merge with the dust, mingle with things, fuse with the void; dwell in heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth know me not?"</p><p></p><p>The more he pondered, the more profound it seemed.</p><p></p><p>Dwelling in heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know of one's existence. </p><p></p><p>What an extraordinary art of concealment this is! Li Xuan let out a breath, after passing on the art of concealing one's presence and hiding one's form to Xu Yan and the others, he opened the Great Dao Golden Book and wrote the incantation into it.</p><p></p><p>Obtaining feedback on the Great Dao Golden Book:</p><p></p><p>The incantation is a bit profound, but with Xu Yan's prodigious talent, there is no need to worry about him not being able to comprehend anything.</p><p></p><p>Once Xu Yan comprehends it, Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu can also cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>He does not demand that Xu Yan reach the realm where he is completely undetectable by the laws of heaven and earth in one step.</p><p></p><p>As long as he can conceal his presence and avoid the detection of powerful experts, that is enough.</p><p></p><p>If he were to reach the level where even the laws of heaven and earth cannot perceive him, this art of concealment would be too terrifying. With Xu Yan's current strength, he is unable to comprehend such a realm.</p><p></p><p>Art of Concealing One's Presence and Hiding One's Form:</p><p>Perfection of the technique: High.</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: High.</p><p>Comprehension difficulty: Extremely High!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book, Li Xuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The perfection of the technique is actually high?</p><p></p><p>"Blend with the light, merge with the dust..." Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>And the cultivation difficulty is also high.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension difficulty has directly reached the highest evaluation, Extremely High!</p><p></p><p>This did not surprise Li Xuan, as it was indeed too profound. The comprehension difficulty would naturally be extremely high.</p><p></p><p>But he had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I'll create another art of concealment as well, Xu Yan and the others won't be able to use it, but Shi Er and the others can. After all, even if Xu Yan comprehends the art of concealing one's presence and hiding one's form, the cultivation difficulty is still very high.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er and the others' talents may not be able to cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan began to rack his brains to create an art of concealment.</p><p></p><p>Creating an art of concealment is not too difficult for the current Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the art of concealment he creates will not be too advanced, but for Shi Er and the others, it will be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>With his perfect control of his qi and blood, and his perfect control of his innate true qi, how to conceal his aura and how to create an easy technique, he already has a foundation for it.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit inferior, at least it can conceal one's presence. Even if they cannot cultivate the art of concealment that Xu Yan comprehends, cultivating this art of concealment will be enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Art of Concealment:</p><p>Perfection of the technique: High.</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: Low.</p><p>Comprehension difficulty: Medium.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction, temporarily keeping the technique and not transmitting it immediately.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan still hasn't comprehended it for a long time, he can then pass on this art of concealment. With Xu Yan's talent, he would be able to grasp it with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>"The Occult Martial Dao has been temporarily created, now I need to find a suitable person to give it to."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Qimen martial arts he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>Qimen Martial Arts:</p><p>Perfection of the cultivation method: Medium-high.</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: High.</p><p>Comprehension difficulty: High.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book showed that the perfection of the cultivation method was only medium-high, while the cultivation difficulty and comprehension difficulty were both quite high.</p><p></p><p>This was within Li Xuan's expectations. After all, Qimen Martial Arts involved the forging of weapons, formations, restrictions, and other aspects, encompassing a wide range of knowledge. The talent requirements for cultivators were naturally quite high as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the focus of one's talent was extremely important. This also meant that Qimen Martial Arts could not be widely disseminated like pure martial arts or physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The talent for cultivating Qimen Martial Arts was relatively niche. Of course, if the entire Qimen Martial Arts system were to be broken down, the talent requirement for cultivating just one aspect would be lower, but the overall strength would also be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the prerequisite for cultivating a single aspect was that someone had already comprehended the Qimen Martial Arts and could extract the forging of weapons or formations for separate cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would all be just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>"Finding disciples is quite difficult. Even if there are those with the right talent, it's not guaranteed that I'll encounter them. So I'll have to come up with a way to conduct preliminary screening."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Since he had already compiled the Qimen Martial Arts, he naturally had to find disciples to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"One of the core aspects of Qimen Martial Arts is formations and restrictions. If there are those with the talent for it, they would naturally have the conditions to comprehend it. In the inner domain, there are no formations present.</p><p></p><p>"In the Qingbei region, there is a natural formation formed by the leakage of the laws of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>"So if someone can comprehend the formation diagram, it means they have the talent to cultivate Qimen Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He selected one of the simpler formation diagrams from the ones he had compiled, one with a relatively low difficulty of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"I'll send out this formation diagram. Whoever can comprehend it will have an opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>He didn't necessarily need to personally seek out disciples.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those with extraordinary talent might not be easily encountered.</p><p></p><p>It would be better to disseminate the formation diagram. If someone could comprehend it, it would mean they possess the talent. After testing them, he could then accept them as disciples and pass on the Qimen Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"The complete formation diagram would ultimately be too difficult to comprehend, so I'll just draw one-third of it. If they can't even comprehend one-third, they won't be able to derive anything from the complete diagram."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>He found a piece of paper and drew one-third of the simplest formation diagram.</p><p></p><p>The formation diagram appeared to be a peculiar terrain, containing some profound principles, like a trap but not quite a trap, complex yet mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er."</p><p></p><p>After finishing the drawing, Li Xuan called out.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, what are your orders?" Shi Er hurriedly came over, excited to finally have a task of his own, as Qingmao would not dare to cause trouble during this time.</p><p></p><p>"Have this diagram duplicated and sent to the Great Wilderness and the Great Wilderness Academy of Martial Arts. Whoever can comprehend it will have a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan handed the formation diagram to Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!" Shi Er was taken aback. Whoever comprehends it will have an opportunity?</p><p></p><p>He looked closely at the diagram, carefully examining every line.</p><p></p><p>After a while, he lifted his head with a confused expression.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he found it profoundly mysterious. Upon further inspection, the diagram seemed a bit messy and disorderly. After looking at it for a while, he couldn't even remember the pattern.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er felt ashamed: "My talent is too poor. I can't understand it at all!"</p><p></p><p>He took the diagram to have it duplicated and sent to the Great Wilderness and the Great Wilderness Academy of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Qingmao came over.</p><p></p><p>"Qingmao, can you understand it? If you can, the lord will give you a great opportunity. I've put a lot of thought into this, so I hope you can grasp it."</p><p></p><p>Qingmao looked at Shi Er suspiciously. Was this guy really being so kind-hearted? He remembered how Shi Er had beaten him with a whip, saying it was for his own good.</p><p></p><p>Turning his gaze to the formation diagram in Shi Er's hand, Qingmao became confused.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Very profound, right? This is a great opportunity. If you can comprehend it, it'll be amazing!" Shi Er urged Qingmao to remember the diagram and spend time pondering it.</p><p></p><p>As long as Qingmao's mind was occupied with trying to comprehend the diagram, he wouldn't have the time to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>After the diagram was duplicated, Shi Er instructed someone to send it to the Great Wilderness and the Great Wilderness Academy of Martial Arts. This was a great opportunity, after all.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't reveal that the diagram was sent by the senior from Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>He only told them that whoever could comprehend it would gain a great opportunity, a chance to ascend.</p><p></p><p>If someone could comprehend it, they could send a message back.</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan had the diagram sent out for people to comprehend, he could only wait for news.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending this one-third of the formation diagram was just the first step. There would be further tests afterward. Only by passing them could someone become his fourth disciple.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there are any in the inner domain who have the talent for cultivating Qimen Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't find anyone in the inner domain, he could only hope for the best in the Spiritual Domain.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Yan, who was cultivating the Concealment Technique, Li Xuan hoped that Xu Yan would be able to comprehend and master it.</p><p></p><p>Time passed day by day.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan observed that the number of Spiritual Shadows was constantly increasing, indicating that the martial artists in the Great Wilderness were growing in number.</p><p></p><p>The speed of increase for the Thousand Martial Spiritual Shadows was getting faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>"The goal of a Myriad Martial Spiritual Shadows is not far away."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Water Star Palace, Tang Jinyan's face flushed red with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Ming has been gone for a long time and hasn't returned. Ping'er has been gone for so long as well, and she hasn't come back. What are they doing in that lowly place?"</p><p></p><p>She couldn't help but be angry. They were completely disregarding the task she had assigned.</p><p></p><p>The maid hesitated and said, "Miss, Jiao Ming is usually quite efficient in his work. This time, his delayed return may mean there is something in the inner domain that has caught his attention. Or perhaps he has encountered danger?"</p><p></p><p>"Danger? In that lowly place, what martial artist could possibly threaten him, a minor Celestial Being?" Tang Jinyan sneered. "And what about Ping'er? Why hasn't she returned either?"</p><p></p><p>The maid said helplessly, "I didn't finish speaking. Ping'er just left, going to the inner domain, not even knowing who she's supposed to capture. Maybe she hasn't found Jiao Ming yet?"</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps that flighty girl has been distracted by some handsome men in the inner domain, which is why she hasn't come back."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Miss's anger, the maid softly suggested, "Miss, should we send Elder Jing to the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>Elder Jing was a powerful Transcendent Being cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan took a deep breath, calming her anger, then shook her head. "Elder Jing going would be too eye-catching. Let's wait for now. When Jiao Ming and Ping'er return, they must be severely punished. Do they not see me anymore?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss," the maid nodded.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

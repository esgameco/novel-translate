        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 97 As Long as You Bury the Person, They Won't Do Evil Again</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Body, opening thirty-six golden body acupoints, with eighteen acupoints in one small cycle, is the cultivation of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>After the eighteen acupoints are opened and nourished to form a cycle, although one cannot transform into a three-zhang golden body, once it is set in motion, it can also make the physical body grow larger by one circle.</p><p></p><p>When the thirty-six acupoints form a cycle and the Heavenly Talisman Profundity is opened, one can transform into a three-zhang golden body.</p><p></p><p>This already belongs to the realm beyond the Innate, which only the most powerful can possess.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan finished explaining the Great Sun Golden Body, then went on to a familiar topic, further deepening his disciple's awareness, saying, "What I teach you is the Dao. Even if it is a martial arts cultivation method, it is the foundation of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"So you must re-awaken, not focus on the form, but comprehend the true meaning of the cultivation method. Only then can you succeed in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method he compiled is like a basket, with not much inside it, requiring the disciple to comprehend and fill the basket.</p><p></p><p>Only then will it be complete.</p><p></p><p>He has only given the disciple a basket, and when the disciple fills it, he will obtain the full harvest.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after passing on the cultivation method to the disciple, he must make the disciple understand that he must fill the basket.</p><p></p><p>"The profundity of the Great Sun Golden Body lies in opening the acupoints, in nourishing the acupoints. Each person's nourished acupoints are not exactly the same. One person's nourished acupoint may have the profound power of rapid injury recovery, while another person's nourished acupoint may have a different profundity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to supplement the possible loopholes in the golden body acupoints he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>For example, he said that this acupoint, after being nourished, can make the physical body's injuries recover quickly.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong opens and nourishes it, but the acupoint's profundity is not as such, wouldn't it damage the image of this senior master?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan would not leave such loopholes, so he told the disciple that the profundity of the opened and nourished acupoints of each person is different, and some profundities may not be nourished by certain people.</p><p></p><p>In this way, no matter what profundity Meng Chong opens and nourishes, or even if he fails to nourish any profundity, it will not be considered a mistake in the master's teachings.</p><p></p><p>After all, he has already said that the profundity of the opened and nourished acupoints of each person is different, and some may even fail to nourish any profundity.</p><p></p><p>Not every acupoint can be nourished to have profundity.</p><p></p><p>"The human body does not only have thirty-six acupoints. If you discover other acupoints during your cultivation, do not be surprised. If you can open them and complete the cycle, you can also open them.</p><p></p><p>"However, the thirty-six acupoints are the great acupoints of the golden body, the foundation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the acupoints are not just thirty-six, and if Meng Chong discovers acupoints outside the thirty-six during his cultivation, and his master did not mention them, it may damage the image of the all-knowing master.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was now in an excited state.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Body is truly immensely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"You must ponder and cultivate diligently, do not be negligent in your own cultivation. Temper the sword with patience, be calm and composed, and you will naturally have insights."</p><p></p><p>After explaining the Great Sun Golden Body, Li Xuan spoke in a stern teacher's tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao is boundless, step by step, cultivate steadfastly. The Great Sun Golden Body is just the starting point on the path of Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disciple like a chicken with its blood stirred up, still in an excited state.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was startled, hurriedly calming his excited mood, respectfully saying, "Yes, Master, I understand. I will cultivate steadfastly without haste or rashness!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, continue your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, then his figure disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a few deep breaths to calm himself down.</p><p></p><p>"In my eyes, the Great Sun Golden Body is already very powerful, but the Master said it is just the starting point on the path of Martial Dao. I cannot be complacent or hasty!</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao is boundless, beyond the Great Sun Golden Body, there are even stronger things waiting for me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's gaze was determined, and he sat down again to begin his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>While cultivating, he also tempered the sword and began to ponder the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Great Sun Golden Body is to open the acupoints. How to open the acupoints, I need to ponder carefully..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he had previously pondered the Great Sun Golden Armor, Meng Chong began to ponder the Great Sun Golden Body. Now he is only at the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, still some distance from the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>So he was not impatient.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the Great Sun Golden Armor while tempering the sword, and also took time to ponder the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>First, he familiarized himself with the thirty-six acupoints. The cultivation of the Great Sun Golden Body also starts from opening the Heavenly Bridge and establishing the Dantian and Sea of Qi, but the subsequent cultivation is different from the orthodox martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation focuses on the golden body acupoints. It needs to be determined which acupoint to open first.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was pondering the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he returned to the courtyard and finally heaved a sigh of relief, handing the basket of the Great Sun Golden Body to Meng Chong, waiting for him to comprehend and fill it.</p><p></p><p>"It should be fine, right? Meng Chong's insight is also good, comprehending it should not be a problem, just a matter of time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered carefully.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Meng Chong should be able to comprehend the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I will pass on the cultivation method beyond the Innate Realm to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he is now a true martial artist, and with the reference of the inner domain martial arts cultivation methods, he has great confidence in the cultivation method he has compiled.</p><p></p><p>Rather than saying he has confidence in his own compiled cultivation method, it is better to say he has confidence in Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan should be able to comprehend the cultivation method. The cultivation method beyond the Innate Realm should not be a problem for him. My martial arts undertaking depends on him to open up."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he just casually compiled it, but Xu Yan was able to comprehend and cultivate it successfully.</p><p></p><p>Now the cultivation method he has compiled is more complete, the theory is more solid, the levels are clearer, with reason and evidence. With Xu Yan's prodigy talent, cultivating it should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Although it is said that the higher the realm, the more difficult the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation method is more complete now.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan returns, I will pass on the cultivation method beyond the Innate Realm to him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan went to the capital of Qi State to guide those people under his maternal grandfather.</p><p></p><p>"About a few more days, he should be able to break through to the small success of the Innate Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan estimated that Xu Yan would break through to the small success of the Innate Realm in a few more days.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the arduously cultivating Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>His Impure Refinement was about to be perfected.</p><p></p><p>"The difference in talent is truly huge."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Even after Shi Er's Impure Refinement is perfected, to break through the Qi and Blood Realm and succeed in the martial arts, it will still take some time for him to overcome the bottleneck of the Impure Refinement.</p><p></p><p>"This is like the bottleneck from the Fourth Grade to the Third Grade in the inner domain martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to do, he took out the ancient leather book and opened the first page, as usual, carefully studying it.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that if I can understand some clues, I will surely gain something.</p><p></p><p>"This Taisui, is it a cultivation method?</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't seem like a cultivation method, sometimes it looks like a map, like a terrain, or like a ghost talisman..."</p><p></p><p>The ancient leather book is obviously not simple, but he has not been able to understand its secrets.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not in a hurry. Since he was free anyway, he would study it over and over every day, and sooner or later he would figure something out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wu State, Nanhe County.</p><p></p><p>Nanhe County was a border county city, neighboring the Qi State, belonging to a place where the sky was high and the emperor was far away.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai was a local tyrant in Nanhe County, committing countless evil deeds, forcibly seizing young girls and occupying good farmland... Half a month ago, he even went to the widow's house at midnight to force himself on her.</p><p></p><p>After being resisted, he even threw the widow's son to death.</p><p></p><p>This incident caused great public outrage, but even the county magistrate of Nanhe had to look at Zheng Yuanwai's face when acting. The angry commoners not only failed to get justice, but were also severely beaten by the tyrant's henchmen.</p><p></p><p>And on this day, Zheng Yuanwai's mansion encountered trouble.</p><p></p><p>A young lady dressed in pure white clothes, elegant and transcendent, with a stunningly beautiful appearance, came to persuade him not to do evil, to apologize to the people, and to beg the people for forgiveness.</p><p></p><p>How would Zheng Yuanwai listen to persuasion?</p><p></p><p>However, upon hearing that the young lady was the current successor of the Heavenly Mother Sect, he became a little uneasy.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother Sect has many powerful experts, if they come to kill him, how can he escape?</p><p></p><p>So he pretended to agree, and immediately ordered the steward to take out money and property to compensate the people he had harmed, in order to apologize.</p><p></p><p>And he ordered a grand banquet to be held to entertain the Heavenly Mother.</p><p></p><p>He said he wanted to listen to the teachings of the Heavenly Mother Sect, but in his heart he was thinking of some evil schemes, looking at the stunning appearance of the Heavenly Mother, which he had never seen in his life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in his eyes, she was just a little girl, and once she fell into his hands, he had ways to make this little girl submit. Once the little girl submitted, not only could he resolve the crisis, but he could also secretly control part of the power of the Heavenly Mother Sect.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more excited he became, but his face remained sincere, expressing that he was truly repentant and willing to exhaust his family fortune to atone for his lifetime of sins!</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mother, have mercy, may the Heavenly Mother forgive my sins, this is my atonement, may the Heavenly Mother, in view of my sincerity, drink this cup of tea and forgive my sins."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai knelt on the ground with sincerity and reverence, offering the fragrant tea with both hands.</p><p></p><p>The young lady in white, with clear eyes and a face that seemed to radiate compassion, took the tea in her slender jade hands, her clear and charming voice saying, "Since you have truly repented, you will be forgiven. In the future, do more good deeds to atone for your sins!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Heavenly Mother!" </p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai prostrated himself on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The young lady in white raised her hand and drank the tea in her hand.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai was overjoyed, jumping up and ordering the maidservants standing by, "Quick, help the Heavenly Mother go to my bedroom to rest!"</p><p></p><p>Mission accomplished!</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Mother is too naive.</p><p></p><p>"You?" </p><p></p><p>The young lady in white was furious, raising her finger to point at him, but suddenly felt dizzy and collapsed on the table.</p><p></p><p>Two maidservants came forward and supported the young lady as she left.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai's face was filled with excitement as he walked out of the hall and ordered the steward, "Tell Wang the Instructor to guard it tightly, absolutely do not let the experts of the Heavenly Mother Sect discover it.</p><p></p><p>"This little beauty, I'm going to treat her well, bring me that medicine, and those things, get them all ready."</p><p></p><p>The steward nodded, "Master, you can enjoy yourself, the medicine has been brought to you, and those things are all in the secret room."</p><p></p><p>A medicine bottle was handed to Zheng Yuanwai.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai was extremely excited, directly pouring out a pill and swallowing it. This was a pill he had concocted with tiger sinew, leopard sinew, deer sinew and precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Little beauty, I'm coming, let you, the Heavenly Mother, experience the prowess of this master!"</p><p></p><p>"Ha ha ha, so excited, such a beauty can only be worthy of me."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai excitedly went towards his bedroom.</p><p></p><p>As for the young lady in white, supported by the two maidservants, when they arrived outside Zheng Yuanwai's bedroom and saw that there was no one around, she suddenly became energetic.</p><p></p><p>The two maidservants no longer supported her.</p><p></p><p>"The preparations are ready, Heavenly Mother."</p><p></p><p>The young lady in white clapped her hands and nodded, "Very good!"</p><p></p><p>She then pushed open the door and walked in.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the large room was filled with soil, and a large pit about a zhang deep had been dug in the center of the room.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the pit has been dug."</p><p></p><p>A burly and robust-looking woman jumped out of the pit.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, one would think she was a ruffian.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, you've become more skilled at digging pits, such a large pit was dug so quickly."</p><p></p><p>The young lady in white said playfully.</p><p></p><p>Aunt Zhou had a look of helplessness, but also a touch of doting.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, the more pits I dig, the more skilled I become."</p><p></p><p>Outside the room, Zheng Yuanwai's excited voice was heard.</p><p></p><p>"My beauty, I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai was extremely excited, feeling as if his whole body was burning with heat, and if he didn't get release, he would explode.</p><p></p><p>"My little beauty, keep me company for three days and three nights."</p><p></p><p>He pushed open the door and closed it behind him.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he turned around, he was startled to see the large pit in the center of the room.</p><p></p><p>Before he could react, a kick came from the side, and with a thud, he was kicked into the deep pit.</p><p></p><p>Looking up, he saw the Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect!</p><p></p><p>His heart sank, realizing that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"Help... cough, cough, pu pu..."</p><p></p><p>Just as he opened his mouth to call for help, a handful of soil was thrown in his face, filling his mouth with dirt.</p><p></p><p>Above the pit, the young lady in white had an excited expression on her face, holding an iron shovel in her hand. As soon as Zheng Yuanwai opened his mouth, she shoveled a handful of soil and threw it in his face.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai was terrified, "Help... cough... help..."</p><p></p><p>His head and face were covered in dirt.</p><p></p><p>What frightened him even more was that due to the medicine he had taken, he felt like his whole body was about to catch fire.</p><p></p><p>Hastily turning his back to the ground and his face down, he spat out the dirt in his mouth and started shouting, "Help, help, Wang the Instructor..."</p><p></p><p>"Shout all you want, no one will come to save you!" </p><p></p><p>The young lady continued to fill the pit with soil, laughing as she did so.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai's heart sank, this seemed to be something he had once said to those beauties himself? How could it have turned to him now?</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mother, have mercy, Heavenly Mother, have mercy, I am willing to repent, I am willing to atone, I am willing to exhaust my family fortune to atone... Heavenly Mother, have compassion, I swear, I truly repent, I will never do evil again!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai knelt in the pit, weeping bitterly, swearing to sincerely repent and never do evil again.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really not do evil again?"</p><p></p><p>The young lady seemed to have softened and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I will never do evil again. Please, Heavenly Mother, have mercy!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Yuanwai looked up at the young lady with hopeful eyes.</p><p></p><p>The young lady continued to diligently fill the soil, excited as she said, "Okay, just stay down there, it won't be long before you'll never do evil again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the people buried by this Heavenly Mother have never done evil again, as long as they are buried, they will never do evil!"</p><p></p><p>I think the little miss should make her appearance soon, I hope this character setting can be accepted by the readers.</p><p></p><p>By the way, please give me some monthly votes.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 196</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the changes in Xu Yan and couldn't help but nod inwardly, "My disciple is truly a prodigy."</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet comprehended the cultivation method of the Divine Realm Boundary, Xu Yan had gained new insights from it, further strengthening his abilities.</p><p></p><p>His sword intent had reached a new level.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and River Sword Intent was originally just a illusory mountain and river, with vague outlines of mountains, rivers, and even a faint golden dragon circling. </p><p></p><p>However, it still appeared too illusory, lacking in reality.</p><p></p><p>But now, Xu Yan was muttering, "My will is the will of heaven, my form is the form of heaven." After comprehending the profound cultivation method of the Divine Realm Boundary, he had suddenly awakened to this realization.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and River Sword Intent gradually underwent changes. The originally illusory mountains and rivers still appeared somewhat illusory, but the scenery had changed. </p><p></p><p>At a glance, it was no longer the vague outline of mountains and rivers, but - Canglan Island!</p><p></p><p>At first glance, Xu Yan's sword intent had become a miniaturized version of Canglan Island!</p><p></p><p>"The Mountain and River Sword Intent has taken form!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was deeply shocked. Xu Yan had awakened this from the realization of "my form is the form of heaven."</p><p></p><p>One can imagine that when facing enemies, Xu Yan's sword intent would transform into the environment the enemy is in. The enemy would step into the sword intent without even knowing it. This is an incredibly powerful and terrifying ability!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has mastered the third layer of the Mountain and River Sword Intent. Your third layer of the Mountain and River Sword Intent has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared, the feedback from the Golden Finger had arrived.</p><p></p><p>The third layer of the sword intent! The mountains and rivers have merged with heaven and earth, where I am is the mountains and rivers, is the sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited, once again feeling the joy of a surge in strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to be immersed in his insights, and Li Xuan did not disturb him, turning and floating away.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm Boundary cultivation method had already been passed on to Xu Yan. When he would comprehend it was still unknown, but given Xu Yan's prodigious talent, he should be able to comprehend it around the time he reaches the Transcendent Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My will is the will of heaven, within the divine intent, it cannot be defied. But how to refine the martial dao divine intent, how to refine the will of heaven and earth into my own will, that will depend on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Barring any accidents, once the Nirvana Palace opens, the Spiritual Platform is established, and the divine intent takes form, I should be able to see what the Golden Finger is."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, excitedly thinking.</p><p></p><p>Focusing his consciousness, he saw the faint golden light, that was where the Golden Finger resided. Unexpectedly, once he breaks through the Divine Realm Boundary, he should be able to see the full form of the Golden Finger and even utilize it.</p><p></p><p>He looked forward to what his own Golden Finger would be.</p><p></p><p>"There are more and more Great Wilderness cultivators."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the number of his Hundred Martial Spirits, which was approaching two hundred.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued in his cultivation and comprehension, and through the changes in his own strength, Li Xuan could sense Xu Yan's power constantly increasing. It was clear that he had gained many insights, entering a period of rapid advancement.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what's so special about the place Meng Chong went, based on the timeline, he should be close to breaking through the Transcendent Realm as well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the sleeping Crimson Cat on Canglan Island, it was still napping, and after waking up, it would go for a swim in the Cang River, then go to Suling Xiu's place to act cute and get some pills, before going back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>"This big cat is about to become a great demon, I just don't know how much it has comprehended, and what kind of strength it will have after its transformation into a great demon, what kind of feedback it can bring me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island remained calm and undisturbed, with no more powerful experts attacking it.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had completely switched to cultivating the Great Wilderness Dao, the solidification of the Heaven and Earth Bridge had greatly increased his speed in absorbing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and his strength was also steadily increasing as he accumulated.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan and several other Dao scholars had also successfully switched, becoming Innate Realm cultivators, although not orthodox, they had still embarked on the path of the Great Wilderness Dao.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying had broken through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Zhou Ying's breakthrough, Shi Er also couldn't sit still, feeling left behind again.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had broken through the Innate Realm perfectly, and was now preparing to break through to the Transcendent Realm, although as a spirit body, her breakthrough would not involve any tribulation or transformation.</p><p></p><p>Even so, she was still diligently accumulating her own foundation, continuously researching pills and summarizing the Pill Dao Martial Classics.</p><p></p><p>As Pill Dao cultivators were relatively weaker in combat, Suling Xiu knew she faced many opponents, so she tried her best to enhance her own combat power.</p><p></p><p>She took the time to continue studying the Bagua with her senior brother, aiming to comprehend a unique battle art of her own.</p><p></p><p>The iron shovel had long been replaced.</p><p></p><p>It was forged using top-grade materials into a new iron shovel, this was the weapon she liked, capable of burying people!</p><p></p><p>With Suling Xiu reaching the Innate Realm, Li Xuan's Pill Dao cultivation had also entered the Transcendent Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was preparing to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Junhe's breakthrough, Shi Er became even more depressed, feeling like he was falling behind again.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was also preparing to break through to the Innate Realm, and this time Shi Er couldn't sit still, cultivating day and night, afraid of being surpassed by Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>Finally, three days later, Shi Er also began to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Innate Realm martial spirits in his Hundred Martial Spirits, feeling extremely excited. The stronger the Great Wilderness cultivators, the higher the realm of his martial spirits would also rise.</p><p></p><p>If the entire Inner Domain became a Great Wilderness as Kou Ruozhi and Xu Junhe planned, the foundation of his martial spirits would become incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>After Shi Er broke through to the Innate Realm, the serrated knife that Meng Chong had brought back was given to him.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was overjoyed, sparring with Zhou Ying every day, although he almost never won, his strength kept improving, and he was thoroughly enjoying it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy had opened a Great Wilderness Dao course, and there were many cultivators practicing the Great Wilderness Dao, after all, Xu Yan's strength had deeply impressed everyone.</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard somewhere.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's aura was fluctuating unsteadily, her face flushing red at times and turning pale at others, with occasional beads of sweat on her forehead.</p><p></p><p>After a long time, she opened her eyes, revealing a weary expression.</p><p></p><p>Although she had already broken through to the Patriarch Realm, the problem with her body had never been completely resolved, and occasional issues would still arise.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..."</p><p></p><p>After coughing lightly a few times, an image of a handsome and imposing figure flashed through Du Yuying's mind, and at such times, her heart would always be filled with tenderness.</p><p></p><p>"My body has a certain defect, a bloodline-related issue. To resolve it completely, I can only find that place."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>The sudden death of her mother was also related to this, and if she could not resolve this inherent flaw, one day she too would suddenly die like her mother.</p><p></p><p>She was unwilling to accept this!</p><p></p><p>That place was the ancestral secret ground of her mother's family, passed down through generations. As long as she could find that place, she would be able to resolve her own defect, and even inherit some legacies.</p><p></p><p>When she married into the Du Marquis Mansion, it was also with the intention of using this opportunity to find the location of that place, but she had never gotten any news about it.</p><p></p><p>When her mother passed away, she had entrusted the search for that place to Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>"From my mother until now, so many years have passed, but no one has been able to find that place..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Does this place not exist?" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er hurried in, joyfully saying, "Miss, there's news."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Du Yuying was overjoyed and got up to walk outside, saying, "Cui'er, prepare a generous gift, I'm going to find Young Master Xu."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss." </p><p></p><p>Cui'er nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Arriving in the front hall, a man in gray robes bowed and said, "Miss, that place has been roughly determined, it's within this area, but it's difficult to enter and there are some dangers."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took the map, carefully examining it, and said, "Thank you for the hard work."</p><p></p><p>That day, Du Yuying left the Seven Star Academy and headed to Canglan Island. This time she didn't bring Cui'er or any protectors. That place was of great importance, and bringing Cui'er would only be a burden.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er understood this, and could only blame her own weak abilities. She decided to work hard and cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>An unexpected person came to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>It was someone looking for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, why have you come? What business do you have with me?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Compared to their first meeting, Du Yuying's strength had increased greatly, already at the initial Grandmaster realm. However, she seemed to have a more delicate air about her. The heroic bearing she had before was gone, as if her physical condition was related to this, like a person just recovering from a serious illness, revealing a weak appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, it's been a while."Du Yuying showed a slightly shy expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched from afar with a strange look on his face, Xu Yan's female follower?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but fall into contemplation, his disciple already had a female follower, while he as the master didn't even have a maid, was he a bit of a failure?</p><p></p><p>"It hasn't been that long, has it?" Xu Yan thought about it, and felt that the time since he last parted with Du Yuying wasn't that long.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's smile remained, "For you, Young Master, it may not have been long, but for me it has been very long. This time I've come to..."she coughed.</p><p></p><p>Her jade-like face flushed red as she couldn't help but cough.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, do you have some health issues? Shall I have my junior sister take a look at you?" Xu Yan couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>When he had escorted Du Yuying before, he knew she had some physical problems. He had thought that after returning home, she would have recovered, but unexpectedly even at the Grandmaster realm, her body still had not healed.</p><p></p><p>"No need, this is innate." Du Yuying shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the reason I've come this time is to request that you escort me to a certain place." Du Yuying took out a bag.</p><p></p><p>She noticed that Xu Yan had a toad-shaped pouch hanging at his waist, and couldn't help but feel a pang in her heart, she had been too late to buy a storage pouch to give to Young Master Xu.</p><p></p><p>However, this time she had prepared a hundred million spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan scratched his head apologetically, "Miss Du, your family has many strong cultivators who can escort you, I'm a bit tied up at the moment..."</p><p></p><p>The spirit crystals, he didn't lack those either, so...</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's hand holding the bag paused, and she fell silent, suddenly breaking into violent coughing, her face flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du..." Xu Yan clicked his tongue, this girl's body was really too fragile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fine!" Du Yuying took a few deep breaths and stuffed the bag into Xu Yan's hand, saying, "Young Master Xu, I know you're in a difficult position, it's just that I can't find anyone more suitable to escort me. The people in my family, I'm a bit worried about them. That place is of great importance and is also where the solution to my physical problem lies. Aside from you, I don't know who else to turn to."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immediately at a loss. If it was before, with this hundred million spirit crystals in hand, he would have happily agreed to escort Du Yuying to that place.</p><p></p><p>But now, he didn't need the money anymore, he no longer had to scramble for spirit crystals and spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>And Du Yuying could be considered a friend. The first money he earned when he entered the inner domain was from escorting her, killing several Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Spirit herb after spirit herb, he had earned a lot.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, that place is the Celestial Tomb!" Du Yuying spoke in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned, the Celestial Tomb?</p><p></p><p>Such a secret, such a precious place, and Du Yuying was directly telling him, this was trust.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have a reputation to uphold." After pondering for a moment, Xu Yan said, "Alright, I'll escort you."</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Du Yuying didn't ask the strong cultivators in the Marquis Mansion, the Celestial Tomb could make even those great Grandmasters betray their own family.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was their own blood relatives, they would abandon them.</p><p></p><p>But the cultivation path he practiced was not the inner domain martial dao, the Celestial Tomb's allure to him wasn't that great, he was just curious.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master!"Du Yuying said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Du Yuying's conversation, Li Xuan heard it all. It wasn't that he was eavesdropping, but his cultivation was too strong, the voices automatically entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Tomb? Interesting, this girl, with her physical defect, is a bit like Suli back then." </p><p></p><p>With Li Xuan's current eyesight, he naturally saw that Du Yuying had a special constitution or bloodline, but was limited by her environment, resulting in this defect.</p><p></p><p>Similar to Suli back then, except Suli's mother had nurtured her with spiritual herbs from the time she was in the womb, so although her constitution was not perfect and had some deficiencies, it did not cause her body to develop illnesses.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's mother, obviously did not have such good treatment, and her mother may also have had defects, which caused Du Yuying to develop this illness.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Tomb, this inner domain has some interesting hidden secrets."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>It would be good for Xu Yan to go, perhaps he could gain some harvests, or even enlighten the Shen Yi Realm cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I need to escort Miss Du to a place." Xu Yan came before Li Xuan and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go ahead." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is there anything special about the Celestial Tomb?" Xu Yan thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment, thinking of the Patriarch Wu who had been possessed before. The greatest danger in the Celestial Tomb was the possibility of encountering the remnant souls of Celestial Martial Cultivators who had not completely died, and they might try to possess the intruders.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Xun Wind Sword Intent could both defend and attack, if a Celestial remnant soul tried to possess him, it would be courting death. Not to mention a complete Celestial Martial Cultivator, even if their strength was intact, it would be suicide to try and possess him.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan didn't need to worry, the one who needed to be worried about was Du Yuying being possessed.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Xuan spoke, "When entering the Celestial Tomb, be careful of remnant souls trying to possess you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered and nodded, "Thank you, Master, I understand."</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan went to bid farewell to his parents and junior sister, and Du Yuying respectfully paid her respects to Mr. and Mrs. Xu, making Xu's mother's face full of joy.</p><p></p><p>That day, Xu Yan and Du Yuying left Canglan Island and set out for the Celestial Tomb.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

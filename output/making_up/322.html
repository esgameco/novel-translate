        <h1>Chapter 322</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, and regardless of who would win, the rocks, grass, and trees on this mountain peak would likely disappear, leaving a barren mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was about to turn all things into swords, had no choice but to stop.</p><p></p><p>Two graceful figures descended from the peak.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, these were the real Gu Guniang and Yun Guniang.</p><p></p><p>"You two wait here for a moment, I'll go take a look up there."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not given up the idea of reaching the peak.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, it's best not to. Grandmother doesn't welcome outsiders."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying gently persuaded, fearing to offend Grandmother.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master Xu, it's best not to disturb Grandmother."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao also persuaded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, the relationship between Xin Mengrou and the two women seemed unusual. One was "Grandmother", the other was "Grandmother Master". It seems that Du Yuying was Xin Mengrou's descendant.</p><p></p><p>And Yun Miaomiao's inheritance was also left by Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a visit, a small matter, you don't need to worry. She is one of the two strongest people I've encountered in the Spirit Realm, so of course I want to see her."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, and continued towards the peak.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A graceful figure appeared in front of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao hurriedly paid respects, "Grandmother (Master)!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Xin Mengrou, somewhat surprised. This person seemed to be shrouded in a dreamlike state, giving a sense of unreality, unable to clearly see her features.</p><p></p><p>However, she must be a beauty of unparalleled appearance.</p><p></p><p>His gaze focused, and in that instant, he seemed to have penetrated the layers of illusion and seen her true countenance.</p><p></p><p>After this look, Xu Yan was greatly surprised, and turned to look at Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's appearance had about 50-60% similarity to Xin Mengrou's.</p><p></p><p>It was an ancestral resemblance, no wonder Du Yuying's talent was so strong.</p><p></p><p>"Your cultivation method is quite mysterious, it is the most special and profound martial arts technique I have seen in the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's cultivation technique was very mysterious and special, the most profound martial arts technique he had seen in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You are somewhat extraordinary, to be able to see my true countenance."</p><p></p><p>Compared to Xu Yan's calm, Xin Mengrou was much more shocked in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had actually penetrated her illusion and seen her true face. It must be known that unless she actively revealed her true countenance, even Wu Tiannan could not see it.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that difficult."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou pondered for a moment, then asked, "The other one of the two strongest people you mentioned, is it your master? "</p><p></p><p>"The strength of my master is not something you can compare to. Compared to my master, you are like a tiny ant, insignificant."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow raised as he said, "The other person I mentioned is Wu Tiannan, the Dean of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was momentarily at a loss for words. This Xu Yan was a bit too arrogant, actually claiming that his master was far superior to her. Xin Mengrou didn't know what to say for a moment, Xu Yan's boasting was a bit excessive.</p><p></p><p>"Your vision is limited, it's only natural for you to think your master is the strongest."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou shook her head, not dwelling on this issue, nor did she get angry.</p><p></p><p>"You know Wu Tiannan? How do you think his strength compares to mine?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "I think you may not be his match. The Dean has met my master, and should have received guidance from my master, so his strength must have improved."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou gave a wry smile, after all, he was just boasting about his own master.</p><p></p><p>"It's fate, I should pay a visit to your esteemed master!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou said, then gracefully rose and returned to the peak.</p><p></p><p>Since the person had already appeared, Xu Yan no longer insisted on going up the peak. Xin Mengrou had come down to see him, obviously there were some secrets on the peak that could not be revealed to an outsider like him.</p><p></p><p>In Du Yuying's courtyard, old friends reunited and naturally had a long chat.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was extremely excited, her rosy cheeks flushed, she brewed tea and brought out spiritual cakes she had made herself, attending to them.</p><p></p><p>Wushuang sat beside her disciple, with a look of helplessness on her face. With Xu Yan's arrival, her disciple's heart was completely focused on that young man.</p><p></p><p>After a long chat, Xu Yan asked about the whereabouts of Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"As for the jade token held by Senior Xie and Young Master Xie, I don't know which sect it belongs to. At the time, I didn't dare ask. However, the Azure King of the Great Zhou Kingdom said he would escort Senior Xie and Young Master Xie..."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said somewhat helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly. In that case, he would have to go to the Great Zhou Kingdom to find that Azure King or Ziyun to know the whereabouts of Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Shiaorong Shijie should know, let me go ask Shiaorong Shijie."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao immediately stood up and said, "Please wait a moment, Young Master Xu, I'll be right back."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Miss Yun."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thanked her.</p><p></p><p>"It's no trouble, Young Master Xu, don't be polite."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Du Guniang's strength has progressed very quickly, but to participate in the Genius Confrontation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had already reached the peak of Cultivated Spirit Celestial, stronger than Wushuang.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao was also at the peak of Cultivated Spirit Celestial, a top genius among the Transcendent Sects.</p><p></p><p>"The Genius Confrontation, of course Young Master Xu is the most honored one. Yuying only aspires to participate."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said with a gentle smile.</p><p></p><p>"Du Guniang's strength is already among the top geniuses in the Spirit Realm, you don't need to be so self-deprecating."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out several medicinal pills that could greatly enhance spiritual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Yun Miaomiao returned, and Shiaorong came with her.</p><p></p><p>"You're actually from the Inner Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Shiaorong looked at Xu Yan with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao asked her about Xie Lingfeng's jade token, and she thought of Xu Yan, so she came along.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke indifferently, "Is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>Shiaorong was silent for a while, then sighed, "The Inner Realm, to actually produce a freak like you."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao had an apologetic look, she didn't expect Shiaorong to guess that Xu Yan was from the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't mind, the fact that he was from the Inner Realm would eventually be revealed anyway, since the gates to the Spirit Realm had been sealed by his master, there was no need to worry about anyone entering the Inner Realm to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>"The jade token held by the Xie father and son is the Yuntianjuyu Token, from Yuntianjuyu City."</p><p></p><p>Shiaorong didn't continue to question Xu Yan about his origins from the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yuntianjuyu City?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was slightly surprised. Yuntianjuyu City also belonged to the Transcendent Sects, but unlike the Qianwu Palace, Leiyan Mountain Villa, and Yuling Manor, it was not located in the Spirit Realm's Eighteen States, but in the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was the first and largest island in the Azure Sea, and in a sense, the Sea Spirit Clan also fell under the rule of Yuntianjuyu City, known as the Overseas Sacred Land.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, if you want to find someone, you'll have to go to Yuntianjuyu City."</p><p></p><p>Shiaorong nodded.</p><p></p><p>She then left, not disturbing the group's reunion, but went to the peak to see her master.</p><p></p><p>Since Xie Lingfeng had gone to Yuntianjuyu City, he should go to the Azure Sea next. There were rumors of spiritual treasures in the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"These medicinal pills can be given to the two young ladies."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan divided the pills and pushed them in front of the two women.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young master!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"What about me, young master?"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er blinked her eyes and asked.</p><p></p><p>"This one is for you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a bottle of pills and handed it to her.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young master!"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"Young ladies, it seems you are about to refine the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying nodded and sighed lightly, "Refining the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth is still quite difficult. I hope we can refine them before the final battle of the Heavenly Prodigies."</p><p></p><p>"Although the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth are everywhere and can be sensed, refining them into one's spiritual soul still has some difficulty."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao also sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, refining the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth is not difficult."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and said, "My master has once instructed people on how to refine them. If the young ladies don't mind, I can pass on the refining method to you."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were overjoyed to hear this, and hurriedly nodded, "The senior's method must be extraordinary. Please, young master, instruct us."</p><p></p><p>The two ladies knew that Xu Yan's cultivation of the martial dao was different from the spiritual domain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not need to refine the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth at all. This technique was obviously created by that senior expert, and he was passing it on casually.</p><p></p><p>The realm of that senior must be unimaginably high.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan passed on the method of refining the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth to the two ladies, and then had a long chat, talking about the Evergreen Pavilion and the Myriad World Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, Xu Yan took his leave.</p><p></p><p>The two ladies were reluctant to part, and they might not see each other again until the final battle of the Heavenly Prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan strode down the mountain, and this trip had yielded a lot of gains, including learning the whereabouts of Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back to the Evergreen Pavilion and then head to the Qingtianbixia City."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Where is your master?"</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou! Xu Yan's brow furrowed as he said, "My master is at the Evergreen Pavilion. If you want to see him, you can try, but I can't guarantee he will see you."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou didn't say anything, her figure disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital city of the Great Zhou, at the Qing Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The Qing Wang lineage was one of the nine royal lineages of the Great Zhou, but it had declined. This generation's Qing Wang had extraordinary talent and remarkable abilities, bringing the Qing Wang Mansion back to prosperity.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing had already refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth into his spiritual soul, and had even refined three strands of them, making him one of the strongest in the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not the strongest, he could still support the continuous growth of the Qing Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, Qing Wang Xiang Qing had brought back a young girl from outside and adopted her as his daughter, known as Princess Ziyun.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that this Princess Ziyun had come through the gate of the Spiritual Domain with the previous Qing Wang's jade token, and although her talent was extraordinary, the rumors of her humble origins in the lower realms sometimes made her the target of strange gazes.</p><p></p><p>However, this Princess Ziyun was also hardworking, and had now reached the late stage of the Refined Spirit Celestial realm, being one of the strongest at her level.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing only had one son, who was rumored to have been sent to Qingtianbixia City for arduous cultivation. Now, the younger generation of the Qing Wang Mansion relied solely on Princess Ziyun.</p><p></p><p>As Xiang Qing's adopted daughter in the Qing Wang Mansion, no one dared to be disrespectful to her. However, the scions of the other eight royal lineages often ostracized her, and Ziyun could never truly integrate into their circle.</p><p></p><p>Some of the scions of the Great Zhou's great officials also outwardly showed her respect as the Princess Ziyun, but secretly looked down on her.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun didn't mind this, and only wanted to focus on improving her own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Father."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun hurriedly entered Xiang Qing's study.</p><p></p><p>"Ziyun, have you been bullied again?"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing's brow furrowed slightly. He was quite dissatisfied with the other eight royal lineages, as bullying Ziyun was tantamount to bullying his Qing Wang lineage.</p><p></p><p>However, although he had refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth into his spiritual soul, his strength was still inferior to the strongest of the other eight lineages, and he couldn't stand up to them.</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't care about them at all."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun clutched her clothes and said, "It's like this, the Evergreen Pavilion has come to our Great Zhou, and I heard they will soon arrive in the capital. I want to go and buy some medicinal pills to cultivate."</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pills from the Evergreen Pavilion were renowned throughout the Spiritual Domain, but they were also extremely expensive, and even with money, it was not easy to obtain them, entirely dependent on the Pavilion Master's mood.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, then let Aqiu accompany you."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing nodded.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun had already reached the late stage of the Refined Spirit Celestial realm, and with the help of medicinal pills, she should be able to break through to the peak in a short period of time.</p><p></p><p>"The medicinal pills from the Evergreen Pavilion are difficult to obtain. You may not be able to buy them this time."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Father, don't worry, I'll definitely be able to buy them."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun was confident as she said this. She was already eager to go to the Evergreen Pavilion, "I wonder if Meng Chong is there. I haven't seen him in a long time, I miss him so much. Meng Chong is the best."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun angrily thought to herself, "If he's there, I'll beat up those bastards."</p><p></p><p>"Here are a few spiritual herbs, take them with you to buy the medicinal pills."</p><p></p><p>Xiang Qing took out a storage bag and handed it to her.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Father!"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun took the storage bag and hurriedly left the capital city of the Great Zhou, heading straight for the current location of the Evergreen Pavilion, accompanied by the steward Aqiu from the Qing Wang Mansion.</p><p></p><p>In a certain mansion in the capital city of the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, the one from the Qing Wang Mansion has left the capital."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, she has left the capital? Good, have those people take action. The Qing Wang has fallen, but our Great Zhou imperial lineage cannot be tainted by his affairs.</p><p></p><p>"What qualifications does that woman from the lower realms have to be our Great Zhou Princess?"</p><p></p><p>"But if the Qing Wang finds out..."</p><p></p><p>"Do it cleanly. The Spiritual Domain is not peaceful these days, and the Myriad World Alliance wants to overthrow the Spiritual Sect's rule. Assassinating our Great Zhou Princess would not be unexpected."</p><p></p><p>"I understand. But the Qing Wang Mansion's Aqiu is guarding her, if we take action..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as it doesn't expose that the attack comes from our Great Zhou imperial lineage. If possible, just kill her, and leave no traces!"</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to go to the Evergreen Pavilion and visit that medicinal immortal lady."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master."</p><p></p><p>The news of the Evergreen Pavilion's arrival in the Great Zhou had already spread throughout the land. Many strong cultivators, especially those with old injuries, were preparing to go to the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>And the Great Zhou imperial lineage also had many preparing to visit the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Thousands of miles away from the capital city of the Great Zhou, a burly and bald man was striding forward.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Zhou is truly prosperous. I wonder how Ziyun is doing."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered as he rubbed his bald head.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 377</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Yue Emperor did not agree with the idea of a great master, he still felt relieved in his heart. A powerful expert, possibly not weaker than himself, had intervened and killed Blood Son Chu, thwarting the Netherworld Prison's plot.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it also rescued Great Yue from the current crisis.</p><p></p><p>However, the Great Yue Emperor still had some doubts in his mind. Killing Blood Son Chu and tens of thousands of blood slaves with just one palm strike? Even he couldn't accomplish that.</p><p></p><p>According to previous reports, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu together were no match for Blood Son Chu. Judging by this, Blood Son Chu's strength should not have been much weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he was killed by that mysterious expert with one palm strike?</p><p></p><p>"This palm strike must have been his killing move, using all his strength in one attack, perhaps even paying a small price? Combined with Blood Son Chu's carelessness and underestimation, that's why he was killed with one strike."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was confident his guess was very close to the truth.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu didn't know the real situation, and truly believed that expert had casually killed Blood Son Chu with one strike, which is why they mistakenly thought he was a great master? "We must thank this brother who intervened to help. He probably paid some price to kill Blood Son Chu, so we should prepare some precious materials to thank him properly."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Learning that the crisis in Qiyun Prefecture was resolved, Blood Son Chu was killed, and the Netherworld Prison's plot had failed, he felt completely relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Blood Son Ji with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Ji, all your Netherworld Prison's schemes are doomed to fail. You said a Blood Spirit would be born in the Qinghua Realm - was that relying on Blood Son Chu who snuck in?" He did accomplish the first step, advancing to Blood Son, and his strength was not weak. But alas, our Qinghua Realm has great masters!"</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't really believe the expert who intervened was a great master, it didn't stop him from scaring Blood Son Ji, making the Netherworld Prison wary and even afraid to act rashly, in exchange for a period of peace in the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji frowned. "Great master?"</p><p></p><p>He sneered and said, "I, Blood Son Ji, have also heard a saying from your Divine Realm - there are no great masters in the eyes of the Immortals. Yet you say there are great masters in the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor calmly said, "Even Immortals call them great masters, so you should know how powerful they are."</p><p></p><p>He revealed a pleased smile and continued, "Blood Son Chu is dead! The great master killed him with one slap."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he raised his hand and made a swatting motion, mockingly saying, "Just like this, smack! And he was dead!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji frowned, half believing and half doubting. Blood Son Chu was dead?</p><p></p><p>The purpose of this big operation was to coordinate with Blood Son Chu, allowing him to advance to Blood Son in the Qinghua Realm, and then advance to Blood Spirit.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Son Chu was dead, all their plans would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>But Blood Son Ji suddenly smiled and looked at the Great Yue Emperor, saying, "Great Yue Emperor, since Blood Son Chu successfully advanced to Blood Son, who in your current Qinghua Realm could kill him? You Great Yue Emperor cannot act, and neither can Wan Lei and Tian Wu. Moreover, once he advanced to Blood Son, his strength would not be much weaker than yours.</p><p></p><p>"The more people he blood refines, the stronger he becomes. He might even surpass me soon. Great Yue Emperor, if you're trying to confuse me and trick me into ending this battle, don't waste your effort."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji suddenly realized that the story of a great master killing Blood Son Chu with one palm strike was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was just trying to trick him into withdrawing so he could free up his forces to resolve the Great Yue crisis.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Yue Emperor just chuckled, his face completely relaxed as he said, "Believe it or not, Blood Son Chu is indeed dead. Why would I need to deceive you? This Heavenly Cave will be suppressed soon, and you, Blood Son Ji, will inevitably die."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji frowned. The Great Yue Emperor's expression seemed genuinely relaxed, as if the Great Yue crisis had already been resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Did we fail? Is he really dead? Could there really be another powerful expert in the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Son Chu was truly dead, this was no small matter. Not only would the Netherworld Prison's plot this time fail, but a certain someone would also be greatly angered by this.</p><p></p><p>It would inevitably spark a great war, and once war broke out, it would no longer be limited to the current scale.</p><p></p><p>Even before advancing to Blood Son, Chu had already been given the name Chu, showing his extraordinary background in the Netherworld Prison. He even had the chance to become a true inheritor of the Blood Path.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji frowned as he transmitted this news back to the depths of the Heavenly Cave, and then back to the Netherworld Prison. Whether true or false, this was ultimately news concerning Blood Son Chu.</p><p></p><p>He might as well go with the Great Yue Emperor's words - killed by a great master!</p><p></p><p>The confrontation and battle in the Great Yue Heavenly Cave continued, becoming increasingly fierce, reaching a white-hot stage.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of slaughter echoed throughout the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>And from the depths of the Heavenly Cave, dense blood qi surged out, like streams of blood mist continuously gushing forth.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship streaked through the air like a beam of light. Feng Yan and Cheng Zhan, one an Immortal Venerable and one a True King Venerable, looked like country bumpkins, their faces full of curiosity as they watched Fang Hao modify and upgrade the ship.</p><p></p><p>Ever since putting on the inner armor refined by Fang Hao, Feng Yan had been extremely excited. This inner armor was truly miraculous - it could be absorbed into the body for nurturing, and would automatically protect the body when attacked.</p><p></p><p>If ambushed, this inner armor was enough to save one's life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this inner armor doubled his defense. Feng Yan felt that if he had had this inner armor protecting him before, he wouldn't have been so badly beaten by Blood Son Chu.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Hao modified and upgraded the ship, he marveled inwardly at how the Divine Realm was truly a place where martial arts flourished more. The grade of these divine materials was far beyond comparison with the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Especially the divine materials carried by Immortal Venerables were of even higher quality. Using them to refine divine artifacts would result in even more powerful effects.</p><p></p><p>Once the modifications were complete, this Changqing Pavilion flying ship would be greatly enhanced, far surpassing its pre-modification state in speed, defense, and even stealth capabilities.</p><p></p><p>It would definitely qualify as an extraordinary divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was currently compiling the fifth martial way. The theoretical framework was already complete, and the cultivation method for the martial way was about to be finished.</p><p></p><p>This was a martial way specially compiled for Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>It could perfectly match his unique talent, so there was no worry about being unable to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>The only difficulty was the immutable qi in Jiang Buping's soul.</p><p></p><p>Trying to fully integrate the immutable qi into his soul, making it a part of the soul, was an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>But once successful, it would mean Jiang Buping had completely transformed, truly turning misfortune into blessing, truly perfectly matching the fifth martial way.</p><p></p><p>So now, Li Xuan was focusing most of his energy on how to deal with this strand of immutable qi - how to integrate it into the soul and make it a part of the soul, thereby transforming the entire soul.</p><p></p><p>"The immutable qi is difficult to refine, but Jiang Buping's soul was tainted by the immutable qi without losing its intelligence. This indicates his soul was already somewhat special.</p><p></p><p>"The immutable qi doesn't necessarily have to be refined to be used, such as for cultivating divine abilities... If so, then use the method of divine abilities to fuse with the immutable qi.</p><p></p><p>"As long as it fuses with the immutable qi, after the soul transforms, there won't be any issues affecting intelligence or consciousness. The transformed soul can be called an immutable soul.</p><p></p><p>"With this foundation, Jiang Buping can also slowly absorb immutable qi in the future, to</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've come to cultivate the soul and practice the fifth martial way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found a method to integrate this trace of indestructible qi.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, indestructible qi cannot be used for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>If Jiang Buping succeeded, it would mean that the fifth martial way could absorb some indestructible qi for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Through analogous reasoning, other martial ways might also find methods to utilize indestructible qi to increase power.</p><p></p><p>After a long journey, the flying ship finally arrived at the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"That's where the Great Yue Heavenly Cave is located."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan pointed towards the front, to an area surrounded by four great mountains.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship transformed into a stream of light, flying directly towards the Great Yue Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others immediately perked up, showing excited expressions. They could finally see one of the three great Heavenly Caves of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong even rubbed his hands together eagerly, saying: "Are there really many treasures in the Heavenly Cave? It must be in the midst of a great battle, I'm so looking forward to it."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan had to remind them: "The battles in the Great Yue Heavenly Cave are fierce. Even True Kings and Heavenly Venerables can fall at any time, and there's more than one Blood Son there.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Son Ji who guards the Great Yue Heavenly Cave has strength not inferior to the Great Yue Emperor. You young brothers should be more cautious!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, with a look of regret on his face. His own strength was still too weak after all.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's form moved, heading towards the Great Yue Heavenly Cave, shouting: "Great Yue Emperor, an eminent person has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>His voice rolled like thunder, spreading towards the Great Yue Heavenly Cave, even suppressing the sounds of killing within.</p><p></p><p>This was the might of an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor raised an eyebrow, then his face darkened slightly. What was this old Feng Yan up to?</p><p></p><p>An eminent person?</p><p></p><p>You're an Immortal Venerable yourself, even if you want to elevate the other's status, you don't need to go this far, right?</p><p></p><p>Now the Great Yue Emperor was in an awkward position. How should he receive them?</p><p></p><p>Should he shout "Respectfully welcoming the eminent one's arrival"?</p><p></p><p>Doesn't the Great Yue Emperor need to save face?</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji revealed a mocking smile, "An eminent person? Laughable. I'd like to see just what kind of eminent person this is!"</p><p></p><p>A stream of light arrived at the entrance of the Heavenly Cave, and the massive flying ship began to descend.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor had a look of surprise on his face. What kind of divine artifact was this? On the flying ship, Xu Yan and the others looked at the enormous entrance to the Heavenly Cave and the brutal killing, all shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>It was their first time seeing such a massive battle between martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for resolving the crisis of my Great Yue. Thank you, senior, for coming to our aid!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor finally gritted his teeth and addressed them as "senior".</p><p></p><p>For resolving the Great Yue Kingdom's crisis, addressing them as senior was not too much!</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan responded faintly.</p><p></p><p>Curiosity also showed in his eyes as he stood up and looked down below.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he saw the Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Very strong!</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw Blood Son Ji facing off against the Great Yue Emperor, equally powerful.</p><p></p><p>But to him, neither amounted to much.</p><p></p><p>Those at the Void-Breaking Realm could penetrate space itself, so naturally they could break through an Immortal Venerable's control over a portion of heaven and earth. In some sense, the martial power of the Void-Breaking Realm was more domineering, and even had the ability to counter the power of unity with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the eminent person?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor had a look of curiosity on his face. How did they look so ordinary?</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!"</p><p></p><p>He secretly shuddered. Such a strong expert, the more ordinary they looked, the more it meant he couldn't see through their strength. This implied that their strength was likely far greater than his own.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, so you're the so-called eminent person? The one who killed Blood Son Chu?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji revealed a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>He raised his crimson spear, its sharp point aimed at the flying ship, aimed at Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Did you really kill Blood Son Chu?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked over with an indifferent gaze. It was time for him to make a move again, time to fully display the demeanor of an eminent person.</p><p></p><p>"It's also time to teach my disciples by example once more."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself. The last time he taught by example was in the inner domain, when he swept through enemies of the same realm undefeated.</p><p></p><p>Directly ignoring Blood Son Ji, he looked towards his four disciples Xu Yan and said: "Watch carefully. Today your master will teach you once again how to sweep through enemies, and how to use divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan and the other three heard this, they immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji was enraged at being ignored. His crimson spear radiated a cold, piercing light, with a bloodthirsty intent spreading out. From deep within the Heavenly Cave, a bloody light surged forth and entered Blood Son Ji's body.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's expression became solemn. Blood Son Ji was about to attack with full force.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see just how capable you are!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji roared, his form rising into the air, the bloodthirsty spear light aimed directly at the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Great Yue Emperor was about to make a move, Li Xuan took a step out from the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Noisy!"</p><p></p><p>He struck out with a palm. With a boom, a black hole appeared, as if this palm strike had pierced through the space of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Smack! Under this single palm strike, a look of terror appeared on the attacking Blood Son Ji's face. Without even a hint of resistance, he was smashed into a bloody mist and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Yue Emperor's heart and liver began to tremble, his lips quivering, nearly dropping the spear in his hand.</p><p></p><p>At this time, he didn't know if his heart was trembling from joy, or simply from fear.</p><p></p><p>Ah, Blood Son Ji, an old rival. They had fought countless times, neither able to overcome the other.</p><p></p><p>And the result!</p><p></p><p>With a smack, he was dead! Like a fly, slapped dead by someone's palm.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike that could kill Blood Son Ji could naturally kill him too.</p><p></p><p>An eminent person!</p><p></p><p>This was truly an eminent person!</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's hand holding the spear was trembling slightly as he looked at Li Xuan, who appeared as calm as if he had just swatted an annoying fly. His whole being gave rise to thoughts of worship.</p><p></p><p>What nonsense about there being no eminent ones in the eyes of Immortals, bah! That's just because they hadn't met a true eminent one!</p><p></p><p>In the Great Yue Heavenly Cave, the sounds of killing fell silent. The Immortal Venerables on the Great Yue side were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Ji was dead?! And the Blood Sons on the Netherworld side now had changed expressions, turning to flee deeper into the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Plucking Heaven Hand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself. So the Great Plucking Heaven Hand could be used like this!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Then, mysterious energies surged from Li Xuan's body in an instant. His body became like a great mountain, his hand grasping wind and thunder, with a golden dragon coiling around his body.</p><p></p><p>The formation of Heaven and Earth's Wondrous Gates was deployed in an instant. In a single thought, it was as if he had formed an array with divine abilities, and there was even a divine furnace, seeming to refine all things. With a single step, he descended into the Great Yue Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Physical martial arts divine ability, Wondrous Gates martial arts divine ability, Alchemy martial arts divine ability..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three had shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>It was the first time they had seen their master simultaneously use divine abilities from four martial ways. It was truly unimaginably powerful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, their master's divine abilities came effortlessly, fusing and transforming with each other. They were far from being able to do this themselves.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others were completely shocked.</p><p></p><p>What kind of martial way was this? So powerful, so terrifying, especially that fleeting, unfathomable, inscrutable aura around the eminent one.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true eminent person!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor muttered with quivering lips.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 377</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although the Emperor of Great Yue did not take the talk of a powerful expert seriously, he still felt relieved in his heart. A powerful figure had stepped in and killed Blood Sacrifice, preventing the schemes of the Underworld from succeeding.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it had also resolved the current crisis facing the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>However, the Emperor of Great Yue still had some doubts. How could this mysterious expert kill Blood Sacrifice and tens of thousands of Blood Slave troops with just a single palm strike? Even he himself would not be able to accomplish that.</p><p></p><p>Based on the previous information, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were not Blood Sacrifice's match. Judging from this, Blood Sacrifice's strength should not be much weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was killed by a single palm strike from this mysterious expert?</p><p></p><p>"This palm strike must have been his lethal technique, a full-powered strike that may have even cost him a small price to pay. Combined with Blood Sacrifice's overconfidence and carelessness, that's why he was killed by a single palm strike," the Emperor of Great Yue was confident in his speculation, believing it was very close to the truth.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu did not know the truth and mistakenly thought that the powerful expert had casually struck down Blood Sacrifice with a single blow, leading them to believe he was a senior expert. "We must thank this brother who stepped in to help. He must have paid a price to kill Blood Sacrifice, so we should prepare some heavenly treasures to express our gratitude."</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Yue had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Upon learning that the crisis in Qi Yun Prefecture had been resolved and Blood Sacrifice had been killed, the Emperor felt greatly relieved, as the schemes of the Underworld had failed.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Blood Demon with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon, the schemes of your Underworld have all been in vain. The so-called blood spirit born in the Azure Flower Realm, was it relying on that Blood Sacrifice who infiltrated here? He managed to become a Blood Demon, but his strength is not weak. However, the Azure Flower Realm has a powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>Although he did not truly believe the one who intervened was a powerful expert, it would not hurt to scare Blood Demon, making the Underworld wary and hesitant to act rashly, thus buying some peace for the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon frowned. "A powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>He sneered, "I, Blood Demon, have also heard the saying in your Divine Realm: 'In the eyes of the Immortal, there is no powerful expert.' Yet you claim the Azure Flower Realm has a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Yue calmly replied, "If even the Immortal acknowledges powerful experts, you should know how powerful they are."</p><p></p><p>He then showed a pleasant smile and said, "Blood Sacrifice is dead! The powerful expert killed him with a single palm strike."</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, he made a swatting motion and mocked, "Just like this, *slap*, he's dead!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon furrowed his brows, unsure whether to believe it. Blood Sacrifice was dead?</p><p></p><p>This grand scheme was meant to cooperate with Blood Sacrifice, allowing him to ascend to become a Blood Demon and then a Blood Spirit in the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Sacrifice was dead, then all their plans would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Demon suddenly smiled and looked at the Emperor of Great Yue, "Emperor of Great Yue, since Blood Sacrifice has successfully become a Blood Demon, with the current strength of the Azure Flower Realm, who could have killed him? You, the Great Yue, are unable to act, and neither can Wan Lei nor Tian Wu. Moreover, once he becomes a Blood Demon, his strength will not be much weaker than yours."</p><p></p><p>"The more people he blood refines, the stronger he will become. He may even surpass me soon. Emperor of Great Yue, your attempt to disrupt my plans and ask me to stop this battle is in vain."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon suddenly realized that the story about a powerful expert killing Blood Sacrifice with a single palm strike was simply impossible. The Emperor of Great Yue was just trying to trick him into stopping the battle so he could resolve the crisis in Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Yue chuckled lightly, his expression relaxed. "Believe it or not, Blood Sacrifice is indeed dead. Why would I need to lie to you? The Heavenly Abyss here will soon be suppressed, and you, Blood Demon, will also meet your demise."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon furrowed his brows. The Emperor of Great Yue's demeanor seemed genuinely relaxed, as if the crisis in Great Yue had been resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Failed? He's really dead? Could it be that there is truly another powerful expert in the Azure Flower Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Sacrifice was truly dead, this was a matter of great significance. Not only would the Underworld's current scheme fail, but a certain figure would also be greatly angered by this.</p><p></p><p>It would undoubtedly trigger a great war, one that would be far beyond the current scale.</p><p></p><p>Even before ascending to become a Blood Demon, Blood Sacrifice had already been bestowed the name "Xu," indicating his remarkable background in the Underworld and his potential to become a true inheritor of the Blood Dao.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon frowned and transmitted this news to the depths of the Heavenly Abyss, and then to the Underworld, whether it was true or not, as it involved Blood Sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>He would just go with the explanation that Blood Sacrifice was killed by a powerful expert, as the Emperor of Great Yue had said.</p><p></p><p>The confrontation and battle in the Great Yue Heavenly Abyss continued to intensify, with the sound of fierce fighting echoing throughout.</p><p></p><p>From the depths of the Heavenly Abyss, a thick aura of blood slaughter surged forth like a dense blood mist.</p><p></p><p>The Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship flew like a beam of light. Feng Yan, an Immortal Venerable, and Cheng Zhan, a True King Venerable, watched with curious expressions as Fang Hao reformed and upgraded the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Feng Yan had donned the inner armor forged by Fang Hao, he had been greatly excited. This inner armor was truly remarkable. Once absorbed into the body, it could actively protect him.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered a sneak attack, this inner armor would be enough to save his life.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this inner armor had doubled his defensive capabilities. Feng Yan even felt that if he had possessed this inner armor before, he would not have been beaten so badly by Blood Sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>As Fang Hao reformed and upgraded the flying ship, he marveled at how the martial dao in the Divine Realm was more prosperous, and the divine materials were far beyond what the Spiritual Realm could compare to.</p><p></p><p>Especially the divine materials carried by the Immortal Venerables, with even higher grades, which could be used to refine divine artifacts of greater power.</p><p></p><p>Once the upgrades were complete, this Long Qing Pavilion flying ship would see a significant improvement in speed, defense, and even stealth, truly deserving the title of a remarkable divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was compiling the fifth martial dao, with the theoretical framework already completed and the cultivation method for this martial dao almost finished.</p><p></p><p>This was a martial dao specially designed for Jiang Buping, perfectly matching his unique talent. There would be no problem for him to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>The only difficulty was the Unburning Qi within Jiang Buping's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>To completely integrate the Unburning Qi into the divine soul, making it a part of the divine soul, was an extremely difficult task.</p><p></p><p>But once successful, it would mean that Jiang Buping had truly undergone a transformation, a case of turning misfortune into fortune, perfectly matching the fifth martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Li Xuan was now focusing most of his efforts on how to fuse this strand of Unburning Qi into the divine soul, transforming the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"The Unburning Qi is difficult to refine, but the fact that Jiang Buping's divine soul has not lost its intelligence despite being tainted by the Unburning Qi shows that his divine soul has some uniqueness.</p><p></p><p>"The Unburning Qi may not necessarily need to be refined to be used and wielded. Perhaps it can be used to cultivate divine abilities... Since that's the case, I'll try to use divine ability cultivation methods to integrate the Unburning Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Once the divine soul has undergone transformation and the Unburning Qi is integrated, there will no longer be any issues with affecting mental consciousness. The transformed divine soul can be called the Unburning Divine Soul.</p><p></p><p>"With this foundation, Jiang Buping can also slowly absorb the Unburning Qi in the future, using it to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have come to cultivate the divine soul, to cultivate the fifth martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found the method to fuse this strand of untempered qi.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, untempered qi cannot be used for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>But if Jiang Buping succeeded, it would mean that the fifth martial dao could absorb and cultivate some untempered qi.</p><p></p><p>Even by analogy, the other martial daos could also find ways to utilize untempered qi to enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>After a long journey, the flying ship finally arrived at the capital city of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"That is where the Great Yue Celestial Cave is located."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan pointed to the front, where four great mountains surrounded the area.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship transformed into a beam of light and flew straight towards the Great Yue Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others suddenly felt energized, their faces filled with excitement, finally able to witness the appearance of one of the three Celestial Caves of the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was even rubbing his palms, eager and impatient, saying, "There must be many treasures in the Celestial Cave? It's in the midst of a great battle, how exciting!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan had to remind him, "The Great Yue Celestial Cave, the battle is fierce. Even Immortal Celestial Sovereigns may perish at any moment, and there is more than one Blood Demon Guardian."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Guardian who guards the Great Yue Celestial Cave is extremely powerful, not inferior to the Great Yue Emperor. "You young fellows better be cautious!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, his face filled with regret, knowing that his own strength was still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan moved, heading towards the Great Yue Celestial Cave, shouting, "Great Yue Emperor, a superior person has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>The thunderous voice suppressed even the sounds of the fierce battle within the Celestial Cave. This is the might of an Immortal Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's brow furrowed, his expression turning somewhat gloomy. What's going on with this old Feng Yan?</p><p></p><p>Superior person? You are an Immortal Celestial Sovereign yourself, even if you want to elevate the other party's status, it doesn't have to be to this extent, right?</p><p></p><p>Now the Great Yue Emperor felt a bit embarrassed. How should he welcome him?</p><p></p><p>Respectfully welcome the superior person? But I, the Great Yue Emperor, cannot lose face like that.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Guardian sneered, "Superior person? Ridiculous, I want to see what kind of superior person this is!"</p><p></p><p>A beam of light arrived at the entrance of the Celestial Cave, and the massive flying ship began to descend.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor looked at it with amazement. What kind of divine artifact is this? And on the flying ship, Xu Yan and the others looked at the grand entrance of the Celestial Cave and the brutal battle, all of them deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had seen such a massive battle between cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for resolving the crisis of our Great Yue. Thank you, senior, for coming to our aid!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor finally gritted his teeth and addressed him as "senior".</p><p></p><p>To have resolved the crisis of the Great Yue Kingdom and be addressed as "senior", it was not too much.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan responded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>His eyes also revealed a curious expression as he stood up and looked down below.</p><p></p><p>At first glance, he saw the Great Yue Emperor. His strength was very powerful!</p><p></p><p>Then he saw the Blood Demon Guardian who was confronting the Great Yue Emperor, whose strength was also incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>But to him, they were nothing.</p><p></p><p>Having broken through the Void Realm, he could penetrate the spatial dimensions of heaven and earth. Naturally, he could break through the power wielded by Immortal Celestial Sovereigns over a domain. To a certain extent, the martial dao power of the Void Realm was even more tyrannical, possessing the ability to suppress the power of Heaven and Earth Unification.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the superior person?" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor had a curious expression on his face, wondering how this person looked so ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Very strong!"</p><p></p><p>He inwardly shuddered. The more ordinary this person appeared, the more it meant that he could not fathom their true strength. This implied that their strength was likely far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, are you the so-called superior person? The one who killed Blood Demon Xu?" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Guardian sneered.</p><p></p><p>The crimson long spear rose, its sharp edge pointing towards the flying ship, towards Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Was Blood Demon Xu really killed by you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at him indifferently. It was time for him to act again, time to demonstrate the bearing of a superior person.</p><p></p><p>"It's also time to teach my disciples again through words and deeds."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself, the last time he had taught through words and deeds was in the Inner Realm, displaying an invincible might that surpassed his peers.</p><p></p><p>Ignoring the Blood Demon Guardian, he looked at his four disciples, Xu Yan and the others, saying, "Watch closely, I will teach you once more today how to overwhelm your enemies, how to wield divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others heard this and became greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Guardian, being ignored, was enraged. The crimson long spear radiated a frigid, bloodthirsty aura, and in the depths of the Celestial Cave, a surge of blood light flowed into the Blood Demon Guardian's body.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's expression turned grave. The Blood Demon Guardian was about to unleash his full power.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see what you are capable of!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Guardian roared, his figure soaring into the air, the bloodthirsty spear energy directly targeting the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was about to act, but Li Xuan stepped out from the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Caw!"</p><p></p><p>With a single palm strike, a pitch-black void appeared, as if this palm had pierced through the spatial dimensions of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Slap! Under this palm strike, the attacking Blood Demon Guardian's face revealed a look of terror, but he did not have the slightest resistance, and was instantly reduced to a mist of blood that dissipated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Yue Emperor's heart and liver were trembling, his lips quivering, and he almost dropped the long spear in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He did not know whether the trembling was from excitement or pure fear.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon, an old adversary, they had battled countless times, neither able to overcome the other.</p><p></p><p>But just like that, he was killed! Swatted down like a fly by a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike that could kill the Blood Demon Guardian could naturally also kill him.</p><p></p><p>Superior person!</p><p></p><p>This is what a superior person is!</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's hand holding the spear was trembling slightly as he looked at the calm and indifferent Li Xuan, who had casually slapped down the Blood Demon Guardian as if swatting a noisy fly. A sense of reverence arose within him.</p><p></p><p>What nonsense about there being no superior person in the eyes of the Immortal, hah! That was because they had not seen a true superior person! In the Great Yue Celestial Cave, the sounds of battle fell silent, and all the Immortal Celestial Sovereigns on the Great Yue side were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Guardian is dead?! And the Blood Demons on the Underworld side, their faces now changed drastically as they turned and fled back into the depths of the Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Heavenly Palm!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself. So the Great Heavenly Palm could be wielded in such a manner!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a mysterious aura surged from Li Xuan's body. His figure became as mighty as the Great Yue Mountains, his hands grasping the winds and thunders, and a golden giant dragon coiled around him.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Formations of the Mysterious Heavenly Dao were instantly deployed, and in a single thought, it was as if he had formed a divine furnace to refine all things, stepping into the Great Yue Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>"Fleshly Martial Dao Abilities, Mysterious Heavenly Martial Dao Abilities, Alchemy Martial Dao Abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had seen their master simultaneously manifest the abilities of four different martial daos, so powerful and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>And his divine abilities were wielded with such ease, seamlessly blending and transforming, something they were far from capable of.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What kind of martial dao is this? So powerful, so terrifying, especially the deep, unfathomable aura that briefly flashed from the superior person.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true superior person!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor murmured with trembling lips.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

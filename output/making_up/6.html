            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 6: The Stages of Refining Bones</p><p></p><p>"Refining bones has its own intricacies and is divided into different stages..."</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan's question about refining bones caught Li Xuan by surprise, he was not the least bit flustered.</p><p></p><p>After all, in his previous life, he was a writer of online novels, so his ability to fabricate stories was not bad. These past few days, after drinking the chicken soup cooked with nine-leaf spirit ginseng, his memory had become stronger and his mind sharper. He quickly thought of how he should fabricate the story.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall explain to you in detail the knowledge about refining bones.</p><p></p><p>"Refining bones is an extremely important foundation. One cannot be careless about it, as it is related to the strength of one's martial dao. If the bones are not sturdy, then the body will not be strong..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was racing as he began to fabricate a coherent story.</p><p></p><p>His theoretical explanations were delivered one after another, captivating Xu Yan, who nodded frequently, sometimes with a look of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"So refining bones has so many intricacies. It's a good thing that Master has been constantly teaching me to be calm and patient, and not to be hasty. Otherwise, if I had rushed into refining bones without knowing the intricacies, wouldn't I have ruined my prospects in the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, I must heed Master's teachings, not be hasty, but be steady and contemplative!"</p><p></p><p>The more he listened, the more he felt that the profound nature of the refining bones stage. Once this stage was completed, his strength would surely increase several-fold.</p><p></p><p>"I have already mastered refining skin. Once I complete refining skin, I must settle down and carefully ponder the dao of refining bones before starting on that stage. I cannot be too eager and rush into it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had fabricated a lengthy story, all the while observing Xu Yan's expression. Seeing Xu Yan listen so attentively, he was quite satisfied and nodded approvingly, saying, "My disciple, you must remember that starting cultivation slowly does not mean your future cultivation will also be slow.</p><p></p><p>"Just like building a house, the foundation is extremely important. If the foundation is not solid, the base unstable, it cannot withstand the wind and rain and will easily collapse. Cultivation is the same. Pursuing speed in the initial stages will actually limit your own potential and the future of your martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Throughout history, there have been many geniuses who cultivated at a breakneck pace in the beginning, but later on, with an unstable foundation, their progress stagnated, and they reached their limits."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said these words with the intention of comforting Xu Yan. Although Xu Yan had not yet sensed his qi and blood, in the foundational stage, he need not pursue speed, as a solid foundation is the key.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, however, heard it as an encouragement. He thought, "Master is telling me that even though my cultivation speed may not match the ancient geniuses, as long as I lay a solid foundation, I can still surpass them in the end!"</p><p></p><p>"Master has such high hopes for me. I absolutely cannot let him down!"</p><p></p><p>"I must build a solid foundation and exceed those ancient geniuses!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved. He respectfully said, "Master, rest assured, your disciple will remember your teachings, not be hasty or impatient, and solidify the foundation. I will not disappoint you!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded approvingly and said, "That you can understand the intention behind my teachings brings me joy."</p><p></p><p>He heaved a sigh of relief inwardly: "Finally, I've managed to deceive him again. Even if he doesn't sense his qi and blood for a month or two, he should be able to remain calm, especially after drinking the chicken soup cooked with nine-leaf spirit ginseng. His body should have grown stronger, and he must think it's due to his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"But deceiving him can only work for a while. Especially when it comes to cultivation, and with Xu Yan's not-so-sharp mind, I still need to think of a way to extricate myself. After all, he has a powerful background."</p><p></p><p>Having stabilized Xu Yan's mindset, the rest would be much easier. Just let him continue cultivating. There was still a year to go.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you said refining bones is divided into stages. Are there any intricacies to that?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully asked, "Hmm, that's right, the refinement of bones is divided into different levels."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was momentarily stunned, almost forgetting about the matter of classifying the levels of bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Make the difficulty of bone refinement a bit higher. Xu Yan won't even be able to sense his qi and blood, let alone achieve skin refinement. Hoping for him to succeed in the more difficult bone refinement would be too much of an expectation.</p><p></p><p>"When he keeps failing to cultivate successfully, he will retreat in the face of difficulty, thinking that his natural talent is insufficient, and he will proactively request to leave, feeling ashamed for not living up to the teacher's nurturing...</p><p></p><p>"If I give him another chance, for example, if he has children, he can try to enter the path. Let him see a glimmer of hope. If he himself cannot cultivate successfully, then his children can cultivate instead...</p><p></p><p>"In this way, the possibility of being exposed will be even lower, and I can also obtain a sum of money from his future children's initiation ceremony..."</p><p></p><p>"I've already deceived him once, so I don't care about deceiving him a second time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought, once this matter is resolved, he can escape the small village and hide in the State of Wu. In that case, the chances of seeing Xu Yan again would be minimal.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's initiation ceremony, Li Xuan's small life in the State of Wu would also be a bit better.</p><p></p><p>Composing himself, he said solemnly, "The refinement of bones is divided into four levels: Bone Refined as Iron, Bone Refined as Copper, Bone Refined as Gold, and Bone Refined as Jade..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression became excited as he asked, "Iron Bone, Copper Bone, Gold Bone, Jade Bone, are these the four stages of bone refinement?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and said, "No, these are the four levels of bone refinement, representing the upper limit of the martial dao and the strength of one's own cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Iron Bone, the bone refinement of ordinary martial artists, most are at this level. The qi and blood temper the bones, making them as hard as iron, ordinary blades cannot cut through them. Of course, Iron Bone is only average, the upper limit of the martial dao is not high.</p><p></p><p>"Copper Bone, is stronger than Iron Bone. Its bones are like copper, even after death, they will not decay for a thousand years. Once one refines Copper Bone, their foundation is already profound, and the upper limit of the martial dao is even higher, this can be considered middle-upper class.</p><p></p><p>"Only by refining Gold Bone can one be considered a genius!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said this with a solemn expression, "The geniuses of the past, without exception, have all refined Gold Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened excitedly, his eyes shining, and asked, "Master, how do I refine Gold Bone?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw his excited and shining eyes, feeling somewhat speechless. This fool, does he really think he can refine Gold Bone?</p><p></p><p>This is all just something I made up!</p><p></p><p>So he said in a deep voice, "Calm your mind and spirit, don't be so anxious and hasty!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan hurriedly restrained his excited emotions and sat upright.</p><p></p><p>"Once Gold Bone is refined, even if buried underground for ten thousand years after death, it will still be shining golden. Its durability surpasses even steel, but from ancient times to the present, those who can refine Gold Bone are one in ten thousand."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly, "When I say one in ten thousand, I mean among the many geniuses."</p><p></p><p>"Master, are there also levels among geniuses?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "Just as with beautiful women, even among beauties, there are differences. It is the same with geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood, "I see, just like the top courtesan at the Spring Fragrance Pavilion in the Eastern River Prefecture, she is already a rare beauty, but the Flower Banquet Mistress is even more beautiful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze became strange, and he inwardly gritted his teeth. No wonder he's a rich young master, he must have frequented brothels, right?</p><p></p><p>I also want to go there!</p><p></p><p>"Master, I was just using an analogy, I haven't actually been there!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan noticed Li Xuan's strange gaze and became embarrassed, quickly explaining.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

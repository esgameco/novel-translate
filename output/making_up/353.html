        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ruins of the Sky Cave in Hongzhou are much larger than the Sky Cave in Bingzhou, but they lack the feeling of a true underground cave. It is more like a real underground cave.</p><p></p><p>You can even see the soil, sand, and small hills there.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy Sky Cave also has some light, like the initial whiteness of the horizon, in a hazy state.</p><p></p><p>"At the bottom of the Sky Cave, the unmelting gas no longer surges in, and it has solidified. The gathered power of the Dao has formed a complete barrier between heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"This is precisely why it has become a relic."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the bottom of the Sky Cave and found the answer.</p><p></p><p>The reason it has become a relic is that the Sky Cave has been completely sealed off, with soil and sand appearing, and the unmelting gas no longer surging in.</p><p></p><p>The barrier between heaven and earth is solid, and the aura from outside can no longer seep in.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining unmelting gas is very thin, but it has also affected the Sky Cave, which is the reason for the birth of spiritual beings."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan observed the Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others have started exploring the Sky Cave ruins, and the other geniuses who have entered are also exploring it, feeling very curious about these Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan strolled leisurely in the Sky Cave ruins, equally curious about them. As the former dean of the Wanxing Martial Institute, a peak existence in the Spirit Realm, he was completely unaware of the Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the Sky Cave ruins are the core secret of the Superb Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he was summoned from the Thousand Martial Hall, Wu Tiannan realized that the Superb Spirit Sect has a powerful backer.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Superb Spirit Sect is actually a subordinate sect of certain forces in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>What is the place beyond the Divine Bridge? The Celestial Venerable comes from beyond the Divine Bridge, and the main task of the Superb Spirit Sect is to seek out and cultivate spirit body geniuses.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Spirit Realm, spirit body geniuses are extremely rare. These spirit body geniuses will ultimately be sent to the place beyond the Divine Bridge, to join the forces of their patrons.</p><p></p><p>Only by going to the place beyond the Divine Bridge can one break through the Refined Law Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Wu Tiannan's footsteps paused.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the small mound of earth in front of him with suspicion.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The small hill is not very large, less than twenty feet high and about fifty to sixty feet in diameter. Wu Tiannan discovered some special traces on the mound - traces left by human hands! These traces are not obvious, and only those familiar with them can detect that they were left intentionally. "Has he been to the Sky Cave ruins before? How did he sneak past the Superb Spirit Sect? Is this a message left for me?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>These traces made him think of a certain person - the Blood Demon, Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>Once a genius of the Wanxing Martial Institute, he was also the one Wu Tiannan had once considered as a successor to the deanship.</p><p></p><p>But the vicissitudes of life led the Blood Spirit Child down a path of slaughter. Although he went mad and was unparalleled in killing, the Blood Demon ultimately did not target the Wanxing Martial Institute, nor did he deliberately go after it.</p><p></p><p>This means that he still had some sentiments towards his former dean.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, it was just a favor towards the dean.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's thoughts drifted, as if he had returned to that era, to the unwilling young man, the young man who swore to rise up, the young man who vowed to make the family that abandoned him regret it.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly and raised his hand, following the inconspicuous traces, continuously cutting into the mound.</p><p></p><p>Fine furrows appeared on the mound, delving deeper into it.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Wu Tiannan's brow raised, and he indeed found something.</p><p></p><p>A small box, faintly red as if dyed in fresh blood, with a few thin silkworm threads winding around it, decorating it.</p><p></p><p>If he had not followed the traces to extract the box, but simply dug into the mound, the box would have been instantly shattered, and its contents destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to leave for me?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was very curious.</p><p></p><p>The rise and fall of the Blood Spirit Child was not known to anyone. One of those times, Wu Tiannan had intervened to save him.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two times, how he rose up, Wu Tiannan did not know.</p><p></p><p>Especially the last time, when the Blood Spirit Child transformed into the Blood Demon, a Blood Cultivator who slaughtered countless people, causing the Superb Spirit Sect to join forces to hunt him down.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Blood Spirit Child's strength at the time seemed to have reached the limit of the Spirit Realm, surpassing Wu Tiannan's own!</p><p></p><p>Filled with curiosity, Wu Tiannan opened the box.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the faintly red box was also dark red, as if dyed in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Inside the box was a dark red bead, seemingly refined from pure blood, with a murderous aura and a hint of resentment.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the red bead was a small notebook.</p><p></p><p>The faintly red notebook was made of some kind of leather.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took out the notebook.</p><p></p><p>"Could the techniques recorded here be the Blood Cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan frowned. The Blood Spirit Child's Blood Cultivation methods were extremely sinister, truly demonic techniques unparalleled in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You should know that even if this technique is powerful, I will not cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this technique can break through the limits of the Spirit Realm? Did you think that when I felt stagnant and desperate, I would also cultivate this demonic technique?"</p><p></p><p>Apart from this reason, Wu Tiannan could not think of any other reason why the Blood Spirit Child would believe he would cultivate such a demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>He opened the notebook and looked at the first page of small characters.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The first page contained the words left by the Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the Dean will come here and discover this box... but I think I should leave something behind.</p><p></p><p>"I am no longer myself, the opportunities I have obtained come from beyond the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique is undoubtedly a powerful technique, which can break through the limits of the Spirit Realm and advance to higher realms, but this path is paved with blood..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan became more and more shocked and solemn as he read on.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Child's rise and opportunities were so unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"From beyond the heavens and earth?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought of the Enchantress from the Bingzhou Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Blood Spirit Child had encountered a similar existence to the Enchantress, and thus rose up?</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique, cultivated with pure blood, can ignore the limits of the Spirit Realm and continue to break through.</p><p></p><p>There was also another important piece of information here.</p><p></p><p>"I am no longer myself!"</p><p></p><p>What does this mean? Was the Blood Spirit Child possessed?</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan frowned, recalling the Blood Spirit Child's past deeds. Although he was arrogant and unparalleled in killing, there were no signs of him being possessed.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that cultivating the Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique will lead to a drastic change in one's nature?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to read, the information left by the Blood Spirit Child was not much, just briefly mentioning the opportunities he had encountered, which were purely by chance, when he entered this Sky Cave ruin.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, when he entered the Sky Cave ruin, it was not during the time when the ruin was opened. But at that time, the Sky Cave ruin had undergone some changes.</p><p></p><p>A small black hole appeared, and the Blood Spirit Child was even sucked in by a suction force.</p><p></p><p>According to the Blood Spirit Child's account, he encountered a mysterious remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored remnant soul transformed into a bracelet and was worn on his hand, which became the opportunity for his rise.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was also from the remnant soul that he obtained the Hundred Prisons Blood Refinement Technique. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>This remnant soul claimed to come from beyond the heavens and earth, being an existence that had transcended the limits of the heavens and earth, and this wisp of remnant soul was only a fraction of its power that had entered this world.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Child's second defeat was also related to this remnant soul. The Blood Spirit Child was a ruthless person, and he ultimately trapped and refined this wisp of remnant soul! As for whether he obtained any information after refining the remnant soul, the Blood Spirit Child did not mention much.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan looked at the blood-red pearl, "Infernal Prison Blood Pearl? What is its use?"</p><p></p><p>This pearl was called the Infernal Prison Blood Pearl, but the Blood Spirit Child did not mention its purpose.</p><p></p><p>"If your bones still remain, shall I bury the Infernal Prison Blood Pearl with you as a companion?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Blood Demon's remains still existed in the Inner Realm, only Xin Mengrou would know.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you can be revived again with this?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan shook his head and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You are no longer the same person as before, do you think I will fulfill your last wish?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed.</p><p></p><p>There were some unusual aspects to the information left behind by the Blood Spirit Child. Regardless of his ultimate purpose, Wu Tiannan would not bury the Infernal Prison Blood Pearl with the Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>He turned to the second page of the booklet.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Refining Spirit Celestial is the Refining Law Realm, where one refines the laws of heaven and earth into one's body, known as the Refining Law Sovereign; above the Refining Law is the Refining True Realm, where one's refinement of the laws has not yet become empty, and one refines the laws of heaven and earth into a true form, known as the True King Sovereign; above the Refining True is the Immortal, who merges with heaven and earth, grasping the sovereignty of a realm, and shares the longevity of heaven and earth, hence known as the Immortal Sovereign..."</p><p></p><p>The second page introduced the realms above the Refining Spirit Celestial, which were the Refining Law Sovereign, the True King Sovereign, and the Immortal Sovereign. The subsequent Refining True Realm and Immortal Realm were unfamiliar to Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>However, he had already seen the Refining Law Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>Although that Sovereign had been killed by the Enchantress Witch, the power of the Sovereign was undeniably immense.</p><p></p><p>"So the Sovereign's request for the True King to descend was a request for the Sovereign of the Refining True Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Sovereign, what kind of existence would that be, to share the longevity of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"But even if one is immortal, they have not transcended heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>While the senior, he was an existence that had transcended heaven and earth, and the Immortal Sovereign would be insignificant before him.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan continued reading, and the following was the technique of the Hundred Prisons Blood Refinement. The more he read, the more horrified he became. It was truly a demonic cultivation method, extremely cruel.</p><p></p><p>He only read a third of it before stopping.</p><p></p><p>It was too cruel, too brutal.</p><p></p><p>"Blood refine the living beings of the Spiritual Realm to attain Immortality!"</p><p></p><p>This was the information provided by the Blood Spirit Child. In the past, he had blood refined the living beings, exterminating one cultivator clan after another, blood refining one great city after another.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Spirit Child should have already broken through the Refining Law Realm by then."</p><p></p><p>Based on the deduction, the Blood Spirit Child, after blood refining so many cultivators and great cities, should have broken through the Refining Law Realm, transcending the limits of the Spiritual Realm's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath and placed the booklet and the Infernal Prison Blood Pearl back into the box.</p><p></p><p>"This box, I should hand it over to the senior."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed, this demonic cultivation technique should be entrusted to the senior for safekeeping.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Wu Tiannan went to the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is what I discovered among the remnants left behind by the Blood Spirit Child in the past. There is a demonic cultivation technique on it, I hand it over to you for disposal."</p><p></p><p>He respectfully presented the box.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed slightly. How did this Blood Spirit Child leave something behind in this Heavenly Abyss Relic? He waved his hand, and the box fell into his palm. Without opening it to look, as if he didn't care, he casually put it away.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took his leave and went to inquire Xin Mengrou about the calamity of the Blood Demon, and how the Transcendent Spirit Sect had driven the Blood Spirit Child into the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Abyss Relic, only Li Xuan sat calmly in the Evergreen Pavilion, while the rest were curiously exploring this relic.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He looked at a withered, grayish-black tree, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint voice reached his ears, carrying a hint of temptation.</p><p></p><p>"Young one, your arrival here is also your opportunity. As long as you pass the test, you can obtain the Immortal inheritance."</p><p></p><p>The voice came from the small tree.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was curious.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Young one, you may not know what Immortality is. Let me tell you, above the Refining Law is the Refining True, and above the Refining True is the Immortal.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal merges with heaven and earth, and shares the longevity of heaven and earth... This is the Immortal Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>The voice continued, the temptation growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>If it were other geniuses of the Spiritual Realm, they might have been tempted. But these temptations were useless against Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Only to share the longevity of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The voice paused for a moment, this young man's meaning? "Heaven and earth do not perish, and that is the peak of the Dao. Young man..."</p><p></p><p>The tempting voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"If you haven't even transcended heaven and earth, how can that be the peak of the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan expressed his doubts.</p><p></p><p>The tempting voice suddenly fell silent. This young man's ambitions were too great! "Heaven and earth cannot be transcended. Young man, do not be overly ambitious. To become Immortal is already the peak of the Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, "You're right, I shouldn't be overly ambitious. So, do you have any divine treasures?"</p><p></p><p>The tempting voice fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>This was too practical! Asking for divine treasures right away? "You've stopped talking. Could it be that you're just deceiving me, and you don't actually have any inheritance?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you should leave. Your comprehension is not good enough, you are not suitable for the inheritance."</p><p></p><p>The tempting voice spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently drew his sword and walked up to the small tree, slashing it with one stroke! Crack!</p><p></p><p>The small tree broke, and a faint reddish-colored light burst forth from the tree trunk, forming a ferocious-looking face.</p><p></p><p>But this face looked a bit bewildered when it saw Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"A remnant soul?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his brow and swung his sword down.</p><p></p><p>Xun Mie Sword! "Wait..."</p><p></p><p>The ferocious face changed color, hurriedly speaking.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late! With a single sword strike, the face crumbled and the remnant soul was completely destroyed under the Xun Mie Sword's intent.</p><p></p><p>"Not a Spiritual Realm cultivator's remnant soul."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought, digging out the small tree. At the root of the tree, a blood-red pearl the size of a thumb was hanging.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? It seems to be able to enhance one's flesh and blood power."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan collected the blood-red pearl, then stuck his sword into the ground, unleashing the Xun Mie Sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Centered on the small tree, a wind vortex swept out, covering an area hundreds of meters in radius.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Ten meters away, a blood light surged out, forming a human face. The face had a somewhat bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, how dare you..."</p><p></p><p>Poof! Before the voice could finish, it was completely exterminated under the Xun Mie Sword intent storm.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

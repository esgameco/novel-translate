        <h1>Chapter 353</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sky Cave ruins in Hong State were much larger than those in Ice State, but lacked the feeling of a hole in the sky and earth, resembling more of a true underground cavern.</p><p></p><p>One could even see soil, sand, stones and some small hills.</p><p></p><p>In the seemingly dark Sky Cave, there was also some light, like the first glimmer of dawn, in a hazy gray state.</p><p></p><p>"At the bottom of the Sky Cave, there is no more influx of unchanging qi, and it has solidified. The power of principles has gathered, equivalent to the barrier between heaven and earth being completely sealed off.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of this that it has become ruins," Li Xuan looked towards the bottom of the Sky Cave, finding the answer in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The reason it became ruins was that the Sky Cave had been completely sealed off, with soil and sand appearing, and no more influx of unchanging qi.</p><p></p><p>The barrier between heaven and earth was firm, and the aura from outside could no longer seep in.</p><p></p><p>"The remaining unchanging qi is very thin, but it still affects the Sky Cave. This is also the reason for the birth of divine objects," Li Xuan observed the Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others had already begun exploring the Sky Cave ruins. The other geniuses who had entered were also exploring everywhere, feeling very curious about these Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan walked leisurely through the Sky Cave ruins, equally curious about them.</p><p></p><p>As the former dean of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy and a peak existence in the Spirit Realm, he knew nothing about the Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>This shows that these Sky Cave ruins were a core secret of the Transcendent Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Since the request for an honored guest to descend from the Thousand Martial Palace, Wu Tiannan realized that the Transcendent Spirit Sects all had backers.</p><p></p><p>In other words, the Transcendent Spirit Sects were actually subordinate sects of certain forces in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>What exactly was on the other side of the Divine Bridge? The Celestial Venerable came from the other side of the Divine Bridge, and the main task of the Transcendent Spirit Sects was to find and cultivate spirit body geniuses.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Spirit Realm, spirit body geniuses were very rare.</p><p></p><p>These spirit body geniuses would eventually be sent to where the Divine Bridge was located, entering the backing forces they belonged to.</p><p></p><p>Only by going to the other side of the Divine Bridge could one break through to the Condensed Law Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Wu Tiannan's footsteps halted.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the small mound of earth before him with surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The small hill was not large, no more than two zhang high, with a circumference of no more than five or six zhang. Wu Tiannan discovered something special on the mound.</p><p></p><p>Traces left by humans! These traces were not obvious, and only those familiar with them could discover that they were left by humans!</p><p></p><p>"Has he been to the Sky Cave ruins? How did he sneak past the Transcendent Spirit Sect to get in? Is this a message left for me?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan frowned.</p><p></p><p>These traces reminded him of one person.</p><p></p><p>Blood Spirit Child, known as the Blood Demon!</p><p></p><p>Once a genius of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy, he was also someone Wu Tiannan had once regarded as a potential successor to the dean.</p><p></p><p>However, circumstances changed, and Blood Spirit Child eventually walked down a path of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Even though he went mad and killed indiscriminately, the Blood Demon never laid a hand on the Myriad Stars Martial Academy, nor did he deliberately target it.</p><p></p><p>This all meant that he still cherished old ties in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he remembered the kindness of the dean.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's thoughts drifted, as if returning to that period of time, to that unwilling youth, that youth who vowed to rise up, that youth who swore to make the family that abandoned him regret.</p><p></p><p>Sighing inwardly, he raised his hand and followed those inconspicuous traces, continuously cutting deeper into the mound.</p><p></p><p>Fine grooves appeared on the mound, continuously deepening into it.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Wu Tiannan raised an eyebrow - something had indeed been left behind.</p><p></p><p>A small box was retrieved by him following the traces.</p><p></p><p>The box was light red, as if it had been soaked in fresh blood. Several fine silk threads were wrapped around the box, making some arrangements.</p><p></p><p>If not following the traces to retrieve the box, and instead directly excavating the mound, the box would have instantly shattered and its contents would have been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to leave for me?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was very curious.</p><p></p><p>Blood Spirit Child had fallen and risen three times. No one knew that one of those times, it was Wu Tiannan who had rescued him.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two times, Wu Tiannan also did not know how he had risen up.</p><p></p><p>Especially the last time, when Blood Spirit Child transformed into the Blood Demon, refining martial artists with blood, slaughtering countless people, which led to the Transcendent Spirit Sects joining forces to assassinate him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Blood Spirit Child's strength at that time seemed to have reached the limit of the Spirit Realm, surpassing Wu Tiannan's at the time!</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan opened the box with curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The inside of the light red box was also dark red, as if it had been soaked in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Inside the box was a dark red pearl, seemingly refined from essence blood, with an aura of killing intent and what seemed to be a resentful aura within.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the red pearl was a small booklet.</p><p></p><p>The light red booklet was made of some kind of leather.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took out the small booklet.</p><p></p><p>"Is what's recorded in here the blood refining method?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan frowned. Blood Spirit Child's blood refining method was extremely vicious, truly a demonic technique, the first true demonic technique in the history of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You should know that no matter how powerful this technique is, I won't cultivate it."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan muttered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that this technique can break through the limits of the Spirit Realm? Do you think that when I stagnate and feel desperate, I would cultivate this demonic technique?"</p><p></p><p>Besides this reason, Wu Tiannan really couldn't think of why Blood Spirit Child would think he would cultivate such a demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>He opened the small booklet and looked at the small characters on the first page.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>The first page contained words left by Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know if the dean will be able to come here, if he will be able to find this box... but I think I should leave something behind.</p><p></p><p>"I am no longer myself. The opportunity I obtained came from outside heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Prisons Blood Refining Technique is undoubtedly a powerful technique that can break through the upper limit of martial arts in the Spirit Realm and break through to a higher Spirit Realm, but this path is paved with blood..."</p><p></p><p>The more Wu Tiannan read, the more shocked and solemn he became.</p><p></p><p>Blood Spirit Child's rise and opportunity were so inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>From outside heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought of Charming Witch from the Ice State Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Blood Spirit Child had encountered a being similar to Charming Witch back then, and thus risen up?</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Prisons Blood Refining Technique cultivated with essence blood and could ignore the upper limit of martial arts in the Spirit Realm, continuously breaking through.</p><p></p><p>There was an even more important piece of information here.</p><p></p><p>"I am no longer myself!"</p><p></p><p>What did this mean? Had Blood Spirit Child been parasitized?</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan frowned as he recalled Blood Spirit Child's past deeds. Although arrogant and indiscriminately murderous, there were no signs of parasitism.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that cultivating the Hundred Prisons Blood Refining Technique leads to a great change in temperament?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to read, the message left by Blood Spirit Child wasn't much, only briefly mentioning his opportunity back then, which was also by coincidence that he entered these Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, when he entered these Sky Cave ruins, it wasn't during the time when the Sky Cave ruins were open, but at that time, some anomalies occurred in the Sky Cave ruins.</p><p></p><p>A small black hole appeared, and Blood Spirit Child was sucked in by a force of attraction.</p><p></p><p>According to Blood Spirit Child, he encountered a strange remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored remnant soul transformed into a bracelet and was worn on his wrist. This was the opportunity for his rise.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was also from the remnant soul that he obtained the Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique. This remnant soul claimed to come from beyond heaven and earth, being an existence that transcended the limits of heaven and earth. Moreover, this wisp of remnant soul was just a bit of power that entered this realm from beyond heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Blood Spirit Child's second defeat was also related to this remnant soul. Blood Spirit Child was a ruthless person - he ultimately trapped and refined this wisp of remnant soul! As for whether he obtained any information after refining the remnant soul, Blood Spirit Child did not mention much.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan looked at the blood-red pearl, "The Netherworld Prison Blood Pearl? What use does it have?"</p><p></p><p>This pearl was called the Netherworld Prison Blood Pearl, but Blood Spirit Child did not mention its uses.</p><p></p><p>"If your remains still exist, should I bury the Netherworld Prison Blood Pearl with you?" Wu Tiannan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon died in the inner domain. Only Xin Mengrou would know if his remains still existed.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you could use this to revive again?" Wu Tiannan shook his head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You are no longer the person you once were. Do you think I would fulfill your last wish?" Wu Tiannan sighed.</p><p></p><p>There were some unusual aspects to the information Blood Spirit Child left here. Regardless of what the ultimate purpose was, Wu Tiannan would not bury the Netherworld Prison Blood Pearl with Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>He turned to the second page of the booklet.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Refining Spirit Celestial Human realm is the Condensing Law realm. Condensing the laws of heaven and earth into one's body is called a Condensing Law Celestial Venerable. Above Condensing Law is the Refining Truth realm. When condensing laws into the body is not yet empty, refining the laws of heaven and earth to merge with the body as truth is called a True King Celestial Venerable. Above Refining Truth is Immortality, merging with heaven and earth, mastering the veneration of a realm of heaven and earth, having the same lifespan as heaven and earth, thus called an Immortal Celestial Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>The second page introduced the realms above Refining Spirit Celestial Human, which were Condensing Law Celestial Venerable, True King Celestial Venerable, and Immortal Celestial Venerable. Wu Tiannan had never heard of the later Refining Truth realm and Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he had already seen a Condensing Law Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Although that Celestial Venerable was killed by Charming Witch, it was undeniable that the might of a Celestial Venerable was truly incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"So when the Celestial Venerable spoke of inviting a True King to descend, he meant inviting a Celestial Venerable of the Refining Truth realm."</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was an Immortal Celestial Venerable, with the same lifespan as heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"However, even if immortal, they still have not transcended heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>While the senior was an existence that had transcended heaven and earth, even Immortal Celestial Venerables would not amount to much before the senior.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan continued reading. The later part was the technique for the Hundred Hells Blood Refining. The more Wu Tiannan read, the more shocked and terrified he became. It was truly a demonic technique, extremely cruel.</p><p></p><p>He only read one-third before he stopped.</p><p></p><p>It was too cruel, too brutal.</p><p></p><p>"Blood refine all living beings in the Spirit Realm to enter Immortality!"</p><p></p><p>This was the information Blood Spirit Child provided. Back then, he blood refined all living beings, slaughtered one spirit clan family after another, blood refined one great city after another.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Spirit Child should have broken through to the Condensing Law realm back then."</p><p></p><p>According to reasoning, after blood refining so many martial artists and so many great cities, Blood Spirit Child should have broken through to the Condensing Law realm, transcending the limit of the Spirit Realm's martial way.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath and put the booklet and Netherworld Prison Blood Pearl back in the box.</p><p></p><p>"I should give this box to the senior."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed. It would be better to let the senior keep such a demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Wu Tiannan went to the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is something I found that Blood Spirit Child left behind in the past. It contains a demonic technique. I'm handing it over to you to deal with."</p><p></p><p>He respectfully held up the box and said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm." Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. What was going on with this Blood Spirit Child, actually leaving something behind in this Heavenly Cavern Relic? He waved his hand, and the box fell into his palm. Without opening it to look, as if uninterested, he casually put it away.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took his leave and went to find Xin Mengrou to inquire about how the Transcendent Spirit Clan forced Blood Spirit Child into the inner domain during the Blood Demon Calamity back then.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Cavern Relic, only Li Xuan sat calmly in the Evergreen Pavilion. Everyone else was curiously exploring this relic.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He looked at a grayish-black withered tree, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a faint voice reached his ears, carrying some bewitching intent, as if calling to him.</p><p></p><p>"Young one, being able to come here is also your destiny. You only need to pass the test to obtain the Immortal legacy."</p><p></p><p>The voice came from that small tree.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal legacy?" Xu Yan was very curious.</p><p></p><p>"Yes! Young one, you probably don't know what Immortality is? Let me tell you, above Condensing Law is Refining Truth, and above Refining Truth is Immortality.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal merges with heaven and earth, with a lifespan equal to heaven and earth... This is an Immortal Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>The voice transmitted faintly, the bewitching intent growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>If it were other geniuses from the Spirit Realm, they might have been bewitched, but this bewitchment had no effect on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Only a lifespan equal to heaven and earth?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The voice paused for a moment. What did this young man mean? "Immortality as long as heaven and earth do not perish, this is the peak of the martial way, young man..."</p><p></p><p>The bewitching voice continued.</p><p></p><p>"Not even transcending heaven and earth, and you call it the peak of the martial way?" Xu Yan expressed doubt!</p><p></p><p>The bewitching voice suddenly fell silent. This young man's appetite was a bit too outrageous! "How can heaven and earth be transcended? Young man, don't aim too high. Being able to achieve Immortality is already the peak of the martial way..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "You're right, I shouldn't aim too high. I should be more practical. So, do you have any divine objects?"</p><p></p><p>The bewitching voice fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>This was too practical! Asking for divine objects right off the bat? "Why aren't you saying anything? Could it be that you're lying and don't actually have any legacy?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, you should leave. Your comprehension is poor, unsuitable for the legacy."</p><p></p><p>The bewitching voice spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently drew his sword, walked to the small tree, and swung his sword to slash! Crack!</p><p></p><p>The small tree broke, and a faint blood-colored light surged out from the trunk, transforming into a ferocious face.</p><p></p><p>However, this face looked at Xu Yan in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Drawing his sword without a word? "Remnant soul?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and raised his hand to slash down with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Xun Destruction Sword! "Wait..."</p><p></p><p>The ferocious face's expression changed drastically, hurriedly speaking.</p><p></p><p>But it was too late! With one sword strike, with a puff, the face dissipated. The remnant soul completely scattered under the Xun wind sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Not the remnant soul of a Spirit Realm martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, swinging his sword to dig out the small tree. At the root of the small tree hung a blood-red pearl the size of a fingertip.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? It seems able to enhance flesh and blood power."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put away the blood-red pearl, stabbed his sword into the ground, and unleashed the Xun wind sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With the small tree as the center, it was as if a storm swept out, the Xun wind sword intent sweeping across a radius of several hundred zhang.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Ten zhang away, a blood light surged out, transforming into a human face. The expression on the face was somewhat dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you're going too far. This seat..."</p><p></p><p>Puff! Before it could finish speaking, it was completely destroyed under the Xun wind sword intent storm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

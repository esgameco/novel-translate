        <h1>Chapter 425</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha's gaze turned cold, and in an instant, his sword emitted a chilling light. The power of the laws of heaven and earth poured into it, and layers upon layers of sword light appeared. In just a moment, this area of heaven and earth was transformed into a domain of sword light.</p><p></p><p>"Let me show you what the sword dao of the Immortal Realm truly means."</p><p></p><p>The power of the laws of heaven and earth gathered, and sword light continuously emerged, completely enveloping this area. Each beam of sword light intertwined with the laws of heaven and earth, forming a massive sword net.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was already completely enveloped within the sword net.</p><p></p><p>"With this Sky-Connecting Sword Net technique, I once forcefully slew an Immortal Heavenly Venerate. You mere child, no matter how miraculous your movement techniques or how exquisite your escape arts, you will undoubtedly die under my sword net!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ba Ye Tian Sha's eyes were cold and arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"For a non-Immortal Realm martial artist like you to die under this sword technique of mine is enough for you to be proud!"</p><p></p><p>In Ba Ye Tian Sha's eyes, Xu Yan was certain to die.</p><p></p><p>No matter how exquisite his movement techniques or how swift his escape arts, now that he had fallen into his Sky-Connecting Sword Net technique, no movement technique, no matter how miraculous, no escape art, no matter how fast, could escape from his sword net.</p><p></p><p>But he still didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>The sword light continued to appear, dense and numerous. As far as the eye could see, there was only chilling light. Heaven and earth seemed to have transformed into a sword prison, able to slice a person into countless pieces in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the layers upon layers of sword light, his eyes showing joy rather than fear. Surrounded by the sword light, it was as if these sword lights were not targeting him, but rather something he himself had unleashed.</p><p></p><p>"Frog in a well, you haven't even stepped over the threshold of the sword dao. You're merely relying on your realm and brute force. It may seem vast and endless, it may seem like a fierce sword technique, but in my eyes it's nothing but a joke.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, today I'll let you, this pitiful frog in a well, see what the sword dao truly is. Let me show you why I, Xu Yan, am the Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>As his words fell, sword intent emerged, and mountains and rivers merged into heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Your sword is my sword. The fierce sword light you painstakingly unleashed now belongs to me. It's perfect to use these many sword lights to lay down a sword formation, to let you, this frog in a well, witness it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step forward, and in an instant, all the sword lights suddenly broke free from Ba Ye Tian Sha's control. The fierce killing sword light that was originally targeting Xu Yan suddenly turned around and enveloped Ba Ye Tian Sha instead.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Ba Ye Tian Sha was also within the area enveloped by the sword light, but in an instant, the sword light seemed to have gained intelligence and rebelled, turning its direction around, its killing intent now pointing towards Ba Ye Tian Sha.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each beam of sword light seemed to contain a terrifying sword intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ba Ye Tian Sha's expression changed drastically, his face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>He even discovered that the divine sword in his hand was trembling and struggling. In a moment of carelessness, the sword tip bent backwards and cut the back of his hand!</p><p></p><p>Clang! Startled, Ba Ye Tian Sha hurriedly threw the sword away!</p><p></p><p>Such a shocking scene made his scalp tingle!</p><p></p><p>His own sword had actually betrayed him?</p><p></p><p>How could this be? Those beams of sword light all came from his own sword technique, how could they become the enemy's power in an instant? Such a bizarre thing was unheard of! At this moment, Ba Ye Tian Sha's eyes were filled with shock, he was even breaking out in a cold sweat. It was too bizarre, too shocking!</p><p></p><p>Hum! The sword light was dazzling. What was originally his own sword technique was now completely out of control, turning back to attack him, the one who had unleashed the sword technique.</p><p></p><p>Such an unbelievable thing was happening right in front of him, an Immortal Heavenly Venerate! At this moment, deep in Ba Ye Tian Sha's heart, a trace of fear was lurking!</p><p></p><p>"I am the supreme sword dao under heaven. Even if you are an Immortal Heavenly Venerate, you are not qualified to use a sword in front of me. You are not worthy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Having reached great accomplishment in the Wisdom Sword Realm, even if the opponent was an Immortal Heavenly Venerate, as long as they had cultivated sword techniques, they could not resist his sword dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Swish! Using the power of the opponent's sword technique, he laid down a sword formation.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain River Sword Dao emerged, and in an instant, layers upon layers of sword light appeared. Each beam of sword light seemed to have been given intelligence, each beam of sword light seemed to be using a different sword technique, and these sword techniques combined to form a killing sword formation.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha's heart was alarmed. He raised his hand and unleashed the powerful force of an Immortal Heavenly Venerate, striking out palm after palm to resist the attacking sword light.</p><p></p><p>He who originally had victory in his grasp was now suddenly put on the defensive.</p><p></p><p>"Since sword techniques can be controlled, then I won't use sword techniques. As a dignified Immortal Heavenly Venerate, how could I possibly be injured by a little brat like Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha took a deep breath, calming his trembling heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was an Immortal Heavenly Venerate, and his strength was not weak among Immortal Heavenly Venerates. Even if he couldn't use sword techniques, he still had other martial arts he could employ.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The might of controlling the power of heaven and earth gradually revealed itself as he calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was ultimately the power of his sword technique, it couldn't last long. Now the sword light was already showing signs of dimming.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, I have to admit, you are monstrous, you are terrifying. But ultimately you are too weak. If you were an Immortal Heavenly Venerate, I certainly wouldn't be your match and would be killed by you.</p><p></p><p>"But, as you are now, even though you have the bizarre ability to control my sword technique, it doesn't change anything. I am not purely a sword dao practitioner!"</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha said with a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed the Mountain River Sword Dao, and the divine ability Sword Within Mountains and Rivers also appeared. At this moment, Ba Ye Tian Sha was already within his Sword Within Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and pointed, and the Undissipating Sword Intent surged forth. The originally dimming sword light suddenly burst forth with dazzling cold light once again.</p><p></p><p>The power of the laws of heaven and earth also descended, transforming into the myriad phenomena of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha swung both fists, his aura surging like a rainbow. With each wave of his hand, the power of heaven and earth poured forth, collapsing one beam of sword light after another, even tearing open a gap in the Sword Within Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, he could seize an opportunity to launch an attack towards Xu Yan, but these were all easily neutralized by the Yin-Yang Sword Wheel. The power of these attacks instead returned to the sword light, enhancing its might.</p><p></p><p>"This person's strength is truly formidable. With my current strength, it's simply impossible to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, having to admit that Ba Ye Tian Sha's strength was very powerful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the opponent also didn't have enough strength to break through the defense of his Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword.</p><p></p><p>"With such strength, it's perfect to temper my sword dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand and began to use this to temper his sword dao, fully unleashing his sword dao insights.</p><p></p><p>The more Ba Ye Tian Sha fought, the more alarmed he became. He was shocked to discover that with his strength, he actually couldn't break through Xu Yan's defense. That bizarre sword wheel was endlessly regenerating. No matter how strong a force he used to bombard it, he couldn't destroy it.</p><p></p><p>And without being able to destroy that bizarre sword wheel, he couldn't harm Xu Yan in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this kid's martial dao so powerful?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ba Ye Tian Sha even felt a bit envious. If he had cultivated such a powerful martial dao, perhaps...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was already invincible in the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword technique is this, why is it so mysterious and unfathomable?"</p><p></p><p>He considered himself a master of the sword, but upon seeing Xu Yan's swordsmanship, he was shocked to discover that he seemed like a complete novice in comparison, not even having touched the threshold of true sword mastery.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he only knew how to wildly swing and hack with a sword, lacking both sharpness and versatility.</p><p></p><p>Like a three-year-old child waving a wooden sword in front of a true grandmaster of swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>"Why does Xu Yan's sword technique have such an unfathomable quality? Why does each strike seem to contain a different killing intent?"</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha was shaken to his core.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he had to face the reality that even if he personally attacked, he would be unable to harm Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In an instant, all the sword light disappeared. All sword intent vanished in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Even the mountains and rivers, the myriad phenomena, disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>But they hadn't truly vanished - rather, they had merged into this realm, becoming identical to it.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, with a thunderous roar, terrifying scenes of battle appeared between heaven and earth. Although these scenes were very blurry, they were still incredibly shocking.</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha's pupils contracted, his body trembling almost unconsciously as he revealed a look of horror, startled by the sudden appearance of these battle scenes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned slightly, "My strength is still lacking somewhat, unable to fully make this my own. Moreover, the simulated battle is not realistic enough!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the battle scenes appearing within the mountains and rivers were what Xu Yan had witnessed while crossing the wilderness, which he had refined into the landscape.</p><p></p><p>"Strike!"</p><p></p><p>The figures in the battle scenes, the powerful warriors in the midst of fighting, seemed to simultaneously raise their hands, gathering all their strength to lift a sword and slash down towards Ba Ye Tian Sha.</p><p></p><p>And with this sword strike, the shadows of all living things appeared.</p><p></p><p>The world changed, as if entering a battlefield. On this battlefield, Ba Ye Tian Sha stood alone, now facing a terrifying attack!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ba Ye Tian Sha was once again shocked to his core, his heart trembling. With a roar, he raised his palm and struck out forcefully.</p><p></p><p>Although he was not a pure sword cultivator, he had still cultivated the sword dao. Now, facing this sword strike, he felt his sword dao heart trembling, even feeling a sense of submission.</p><p></p><p>This was an inconceivable thing.</p><p></p><p>"If I were a cultivator who only practiced the sword dao, how could I defend against this strike?"</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha dared not imagine how a sword-cultivating Immortal Venerable would be able to defend against this strike using sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these four words appeared in his mind!</p><p></p><p>God of the Sword Dao, truly worthy of the title! He had to admit that Xu Yan deserved to be called the Sword God!</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan executed this sword strike, he felt his divine energy being consumed frantically. The wondrous intent of the Wisdom Sword realm was also being consumed, with sword intent continuously surging forth.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, he took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike would not be able to injure Ba Ye Tian Sha.</p><p></p><p>However, besides this sword strike, what he truly wanted to manifest within the mountains and rivers was that majestic, saint-like figure!</p><p></p><p>Just as Ba Ye Tian Sha was about to attack, behind the sword-wielding masses, the area seemed to become chaotic, and a blurry figure suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>This was an incredibly majestic figure. Although it appeared blurry, it still had an aura like that of a martial arts saint, impossible to look at directly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Ba Ye Tian Sha felt his mind roaring, his whole body trembling. The fighting spirit of a martial artist seemed to disappear, and he felt the urge to kneel in worship.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this was a saint of martial arts, before whom all who saw would prostrate themselves!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, what is this!"</p><p></p><p>"I am an Immortal Venerable, how can I be affected, how can my will be shaken?"</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha roared inwardly, continuously circulating methods to refine his soul, trying to awaken from this saint-like state!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Finally, his consciousness returned to clarity, snapping out of that worshipful state. But before his eyes was a bitterly cold flash of light, with a bone-chilling coldness rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>It was even the crisis of death!</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment, with a low growl, his body twisted as he flew backwards diagonally, while exerting all his strength to strike out with his palm towards the cold light!</p><p></p><p>Puff! His palm was in agony!</p><p></p><p>A sword pierced through his palm, but the sword's edge did not stop there. Immediately after, his shoulder was also in excruciating pain.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Blood spurted out, but he had managed to avoid this fatal strike.</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha's body flew backwards, his eyes filled with shock as he saw Xu Yan holding a sword with a look of disappointment. His heart trembled, even feeling a sense of having narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>So close! He had almost been killed by Xu Yan's counterattack!</p><p></p><p>Turning around, he fled frantically, disappearing into the horizon in an instant. An Immortal Venerable, actually fleeing in panic!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed. Ba Ye Tian Sha's strength was a bit too much - he hadn't been able to kill him!</p><p></p><p>When the mountains and rivers manifested, that majestic, saint-like figure appeared, affecting Ba Ye Tian Sha's state of mind. Xu Yan had been waiting for this instant and decisively attacked!</p><p></p><p>However, that figure was ultimately too blurry, with limited influence time. The opponent quickly came to his senses and, in the critical moment, avoided the fatal sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, this sword strike had still wounded the opponent!</p><p></p><p>"My strength is still lacking a bit. If I could fully simulate that figure, even Immortal Venerables who saw it would likely instinctively prostrate themselves."</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly is this person, whose influence on Tai Cang martial artists is far too great."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was curious.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are an Immortal Venerable, let's see if you can resolve my Undying Sword Intent. As long as you can't resolve it, sooner or later I'll be able to know your true identity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Although Ba Ye Tian Sha had escaped, a trace of Undying Sword Intent had also entered his body.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Sha Di Ying, you're like a lingering ghost, aren't you? Sooner or later I'll destroy you all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan inwardly snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"The consumption was quite large. I'll find a place to recover and reflect on the gains from this battle."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered briefly, then decided to find a place to reflect for a while.</p><p></p><p>Going to Deng Wu Tian Ku was not urgent.</p><p></p><p>Ba Ye Tian Sha returned to his own territory. At this moment, he pretended nothing was wrong, but his heart was heavy.</p><p></p><p>The sword wound wasn't a big problem, but that trace of unknown sword power was the reason for his heavy heart. No matter what method he used or what secret techniques he employed, he still couldn't remove or annihilate this trace of sword power.</p><p></p><p>He could only use his Immortal Venerable power to wrap and seal this trace of sword power, and he didn't know if he could keep it sealed forever.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword power is this? This Xu Yan is too terrifying. Which Immortal Venerable could kill him? Was it a mistake to make Xu Yan a target?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt that Tian Shi Qi making Xu Yan a target might have been a mistake!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

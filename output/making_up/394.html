        <h1>Chapter 394</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The masked villain said in a deep voice:</p><p></p><p>"Keep searching, continue looking for him. We must find that person!"</p><p></p><p>The masked villain gritted his teeth and said: "I don't believe it. With Ground Shadow's intelligence network, how can we not find him?"</p><p></p><p>The plan had reached its most crucial stage. If this step succeeded, the overall plan would basically be complete. </p><p></p><p>But now, Xu Yan, who was supposed to be a pawn, couldn't be found!</p><p></p><p>How could this be tolerated? "Which force is concealing Xu Yan's whereabouts?" </p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin asked with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know!"</p><p></p><p>"Use whatever resources we have. We must find him, otherwise how can the Wan family save face?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin said with murderous intent: "Also, investigate those rumors, find out where they originated from. We might find some clues there!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master!"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family also took action, starting to mobilize more forces, all to find Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Besides Heaven's Bane, Ground Shadow and the Wan family, several True King Celestial Lords from another faction also had worried looks on their faces, wondering where on earth Xu Yan had gone.</p><p></p><p>They had almost turned Dacai Mountain upside down but still couldn't find him. Without finding him, how could they lure him into the Demon Shaman's Cave in Thousand-Layered Mountain?</p><p></p><p>What made them even more uncomfortable was that while they couldn't find Xu Yan, the Wan family mistakenly thought they were the force behind Xu Yan, leading to some conflicts.</p><p></p><p>It was extremely unwise to have conflicts with the Wan family on their own territory, so they quickly backed down, explaining that they too were searching for traces of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Both sides agreed to exchange information if they found any clues about Xu Yan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, completely unaware of what was happening outside, was fully focused on cultivating the divine ability of Heaven's Will Mind Fixation.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally succeeded in cultivating it!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, a point of light appearing between his eyebrows, like an eye. Above this eye, a power akin to heaven's will swirled.</p><p></p><p>"The Small Heavenly Dao Eye, combined with Heaven's Will Mind Fixation, increases the success rate and makes it easier to fix the enemy's mind."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>"With this divine ability, I can do quite a few things now."</p><p></p><p>The light between his eyebrows disappeared, and Xu Yan raised his palm, where a vast heavenly will seemed to swirl.</p><p></p><p>It gave a sense of vastness and irresistibility.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to come out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Now that he had finished cultivating the divine ability, it was time to continue gathering the necessary treasures, accumulate resources, and prepare for his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin, are you ready? I'm going to give you a little shock."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Even if Wan Tianlin backed down, he wouldn't easily forgive him. If he dared to send people to assassinate him, he should be prepared to bear the consequences.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the mountains and rivers disappeared, and the formation was withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, erasing all traces and auras, and in one step, vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Dacai Mountain is Wan family territory. I'll find a major Wan family city to learn about their situation and see how Wan Tianlin is doing."</p><p></p><p>"If he's in seclusion studying techniques, I'll have to wait a while before targeting him."</p><p></p><p>As the Wan family's genius, Wan Tianlin's place of seclusion would be heavily guarded, and ordinary Wan family members wouldn't be able to get close.</p><p></p><p>"I'll choose a suitable target and test out Heaven's Will Mind Fixation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan decided to go to one of the Wan family's major cities to select an appropriate target and control them to give Wan Tianlin a shock.</p><p></p><p>Walking on Dacai Mountain, Xu Yan headed in one direction towards one of the Wan family's major cities.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui was a member of Ground Shadow within Heaven's Bane, infiltrated into the Wan family, and was among the warriors close to their core guard.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had received orders from Ground Shadow to find and assassinate Xu Yan, firmly establishing the Wan family's role in Xu Yan's assassination.</p><p></p><p>Although assassinating Xu Yan was a very dangerous task, as he was only at the early stage of Refining Truth Realm, just entering the ranks of True King Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>But as a member of Ground Shadow, dedicating everything to the organization was an honor.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui was excited, finally able to contribute to Ground Shadow. If he was lucky enough to survive, his status in Ground Shadow would be elevated.</p><p></p><p>In the Wan family, he would also have a chance to enter the ranks of the core guard.</p><p></p><p>He might even be granted the Wan surname, truly becoming a core member of the Wan family, or even becoming a Wan family death soldier.</p><p></p><p>So, Shen Kui was very diligent in searching for Xu Yan, firstly for the glory of Ground Shadow, and secondly to show his worth to the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Even if he ultimately couldn't find Xu Yan, he might still gain entry into the core guard due to his performance in this task.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui didn't know if there were other Ground Shadow members in the Wan family besides himself. No Ground Shadow member could know each other's true identities.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even know each other's appearances.</p><p></p><p>Ground Shadow was responsible for infiltration, biding time for action, stirring up conflicts, etc., while Heaven's Bane led all of this and was the true strongest fighting force.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui didn't know how many members were in Heaven's Bane or Ground Shadow. After all, although he wasn't at the bottom of Ground Shadow, he wasn't considered high-ranking either.</p><p></p><p>"Is that... Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shen Kui spotted a young man ahead who looked just like the Xu Yan they had been desperately searching for. He became instantly excited.</p><p></p><p>"My chance has come!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui moved, his aura becoming faint. His form seemed to be covered by a layer of shadow, hiding his entire being in the nearby shadows.</p><p></p><p>This was a technique of Ground Shadow, for concealment and ambush.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was very powerful. None of the people who had tried to assassinate him before had returned.</p><p></p><p>And Shen Kui was only at the early stage of True King Celestial Lord. In a direct confrontation, he was no match for Xu Yan. His only option was to ambush.</p><p></p><p>"If I can wound Xu Yan, and manage to escape successfully..."</p><p></p><p>The more Shen Kui thought about it, the more excited he became.</p><p></p><p>As Ground Shadow members excelled at infiltration, they naturally also excelled at ambush and escape. This gave him some confidence that he could successfully ambush Xu Yan and then escape with his life.</p><p></p><p>"Here we go!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui felt a bit nervous.</p><p></p><p>Even with his concealment skills, facing a strong opponent like Xu Yan, he would inevitably be discovered once he got too close.</p><p></p><p>He had to master the right distance, launching his attack suddenly before being discovered, yet close enough for the attack to reach instantly, giving the opponent no time to react.</p><p></p><p>So, this distance had to be controlled precisely.</p><p></p><p>This was a skill every Ground Shadow member needed to master, and it was the most important experience to acquire.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui believed his experience was quite seasoned.</p><p></p><p>Besides his Ground Shadow training, he had also received training from the Wan family. When carrying out tasks for the Wan family, he had used these techniques, giving him rich experience.</p><p></p><p>"When I'm three more steps closer, I'll strike!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui was excited but also nervous.</p><p></p><p>"This Wan family member does have some skill. His concealment technique is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had long ago detected Shen Kui's presence.</p><p></p><p>In terms of concealment and infiltration, Xu Yan believed few could match him. Shen Kui, a mere early-stage True King Celestial Lord, with his self-proclaimed marvelous concealment technique, was nothing in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention that Xu Yan had already successfully cultivated the Small Heavenly Dao Eye. No concealment or hiding could escape his gaze.</p><p></p><p>Even without the Small Heavenly Dao Eye, Ground Shadow's infiltration techniques were not impressive enough.</p><p></p><p>"This is perfect to test out Heaven's Will Mind Fixation and give Wan Tianlin a shock."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan secretly became excited.</p><p></p><p>This person must have been sent by the Wan family...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since they sent someone to assassinate him, he would use the person sent by the Wan family to kill them in return.</p><p></p><p>"Won't the Wan family suspect there's a traitor?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step forward, leaving behind an elemental clone to deceive Shen Kui, while his true body silently appeared behind Shen Kui.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Shen Kui felt his scalp tingle as his martial artist's sense of crisis suddenly emerged. </p><p></p><p>Danger!</p><p></p><p>He didn't think the danger came from Xu Yan, but assumed it was another powerful expert preparing to attack him!</p><p></p><p>"You're quite alert," Xu Yan said unsurprised. After all, as a True King Celestial Venerable, if Shen Kui hadn't noticed even after Xu Yan had approached behind him and started using his power, he would be too incompetent.</p><p></p><p>But even though he noticed, it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>Boom! An invisible landscape had already enveloped Shen Kui, instantly restraining him.</p><p></p><p>A palm surrounded by a faint glow, like the vast will of heaven, pressed against his head.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In that moment, Shen Kui felt his soul, consciousness, and intelligence all become fixed in place.</p><p></p><p>He was unable to offer any resistance.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was the sense of facing the vast will of heaven, as if everything was inviolable!</p><p></p><p>His consciousness seemed both clear and hazy. He didn't even quite understand what state he was in.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and assassinate the person who ordered you to assassinate me!"</p><p></p><p>A will descended into his soul, like the inviolable will of heaven that could not be resisted or defied.</p><p></p><p>It was like a chain of heavenly authority, firmly locking him in place.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and kill the person who ordered me!"</p><p></p><p>In Shen Kui's mind, there was only this vast and inviolable will.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Shen Kui nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand with an expectant look.</p><p></p><p>This was his first time using the Divine Technique of Fixing the Mind with Heavenly Will. To prevent Shen Kui from breaking free, Xu Yan used it at full power, assisted by the Eye of the Minor Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Go now." </p><p></p><p>To avoid the possibility of Shen Kui breaking free of the technique halfway, Xu Yan waved his hand and ordered:</p><p></p><p>"Use your own methods to gain their trust, get close to them, and assassinate them!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I will definitely accomplish it!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui had become respectful, not even daring to raise his head, as if he dared not look directly at the will of heaven.</p><p></p><p>His form flickered and he instantly departed, rushing back frantically.</p><p></p><p>"Kill Tianshai. It was Tianshai who ordered me to assassinate Xu Yan, so kill Tianshai."</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui quickly determined his target.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wan family had also given him orders, he was a member of Diying. The orders he truly accepted came from the Tianshai Diying organization.</p><p></p><p>Since he was to assassinate the one who ordered him, the target was naturally Tianshai from the Tianshai Diying organization who had issued the order.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin, this is just the beginning."</p><p></p><p>Watching Shen Kui leave, Xu Yan's eyes flashed coldly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui was the first, but he wouldn't be the last.</p><p></p><p>"As my master said, a true martial artist is not a brute. How could I, Xu Yan, act like a brute? I'm also very skilled in these methods. The Wan family is very strong, right? Let me show you my techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued towards the great city, continuing his actions.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Shen Kui didn't dare delay on his journey, rushing frantically towards one of Tianshai Diying's secret bases.</p><p></p><p>"Have I gone mad? I'm actually going to kill Tianshai?"</p><p></p><p>Deep in Shen Kui's heart and consciousness, he was somewhat clear-headed and knew that what he was doing was wrong.</p><p></p><p>However, he was unable to change that mysterious will, and could only watch himself painfully as he rushed wildly towards the base.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the base, Shen Kui put on his mask.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was a True King Celestial Venerable, he was somewhat out of breath after rushing all this way.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Lord Tianshai?" Shen Kui asked urgently as soon as he entered the base, as if he had some urgent matter to report.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Tianshai is not here. What urgent business do you have?" the base leader asked sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, notify Lord Tianshai to come here. I have a secret matter to report," Shen Kui said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, wait a moment!"</p><p></p><p>The base leader was startled. What secret matter required reporting directly to Lord Tianshai?</p><p></p><p>In the Tianshai Diying organization, there were strict rules. If it was a secret that could only be reported to Tianshai, others were not allowed to inquire about it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was a strict classification for the levels of secrets.</p><p></p><p>Every Diying member knew this clearly and would not report carelessly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui appeared very anxious as he waited for Tianshai to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later.</p><p></p><p>A man in a fierce mask appeared at the base and looked at Shen Kui, saying in a deep voice, "You have a secret matter to report?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!" Shen Kui nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he moved closer to the fierce-masked man. His gaze was extremely serious as his lips moved, looking towards the base leader on the side, as if preparing to transmit a sound message to report.</p><p></p><p>The fierce-masked man didn't suspect anything and instead moved closer. "Is it about the Wan family..."</p><p></p><p>Poof! At that moment, a flash of cold light pierced into his chest.</p><p></p><p>The fierce-masked man was stunned. The base leader, who was preparing to leave to avoid eavesdropping, was also stunned.</p><p></p><p>Boom! This attack was Shen Kui's life's work, what he considered the strongest attack of his life.</p><p></p><p>The target, this Tianshai, was completely unprepared, and the distance was so close. Moreover, there had never been a traitor in the Tianshai Diying organization before.</p><p></p><p>Such an act of subordinates attacking superiors had never happened before.</p><p></p><p>Every Diying member was absolutely loyal. For the goals of Tianshai Diying, they would go to their deaths without blinking an eye.</p><p></p><p>In such an organization, no one would have imagined that someone would sneak attack their superior!</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>The fierce-masked man was furious, but Shen Kui had succeeded with his first strike. His aura erupted with full force as all his power was instantly unleashed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A hole exploded in the fierce-masked man's chest. Even though he was at the peak of True King Celestial Venerable, just one step away from Immortal Venerable, he was still gravely wounded under this attack, nearly perishing!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, in a mix of shock and fury, the fierce-masked man struck out violently with his palm, sending Shen Kui flying.</p><p></p><p>The base leader also attacked at this point.</p><p></p><p>"You dare betray our Tianshai Diying?"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked and furious. The first traitor in Diying had appeared! Moreover, it was a Diying member infiltrating the Wan family. Had he defected to the Wan family? If so, had Tianshai Diying's plans been leaked to the Wan family?</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The fierce-masked man ordered in rage as he covered his wound and took out spirit medicine to consume.</p><p></p><p>Shen Kui's heart was trembling at this moment. Deep in his consciousness, he was clear-headed and utterly despairing.</p><p></p><p>He had betrayed Tianshai Diying!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The battle ended in a short time. Shen Kui had exhausted his power in sneak attacking the fierce-masked man and hadn't had time to recover. The base leader was originally stronger than him, so Shen Kui couldn't resist for long before directly taking his own life, perishing on the spot!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

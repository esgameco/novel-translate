        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No one knew that beneath the azure sea and the abyss, there was a celestial cavern, where a sea of blood surged, and figures stood silently, gazing out towards the world beyond.</p><p></p><p>Looking out at the vast azure sea, it was as if they were waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>A man with blood-red hair stood holding a blade, the aura of bloodshed swirling around him. The crimson long sword emanated a faint glow, as if gathering strength, ready to unleash a powerful strike at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"The time has come, the Spiritual Realm shall be mine, the hunting ground of my Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciples. Blood slaves, are you prepared?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciple spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we are ready. Let the blood light illuminate the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The figures cried out, their eyes gleaming with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! After years of planning, the long wait is finally over, and it is time to reap the rewards."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciple smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Once I seize control of the Spiritual Realm, and perform the blood sacrifice, I, the Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciple, shall ascend to become a Blood Child!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciple's eyes shone with longing.</p><p></p><p>The position of a Blood Child in the Nether Hell was revered, granting them access to the true lineage. Any Blood Child would possess immense strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge spans across the abyss, connecting the Divine Realm. Once it collapses, it will not be easily repaired or reopened.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Divine Realm is about to face a great battle, especially the Qinghua Realm where the Divine Bridge is located. Turmoil is about to begin.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the Spiritual Realm shall be the Blood Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciple's eyes burned with excitement, staring intently at the celestial cavern above, at the azure sea and the abyss, waiting for the Divine Bridge to open.</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Bridge appears, that will be his moment to strike, collapsing the bridge and severing the connection between the Spiritual Realm and the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without the aid of the Divine Realm's experts, the Spiritual Realm would be nothing more than his hunting ground.</p><p></p><p>From that moment on, the Spiritual Realm would become the Blood Realm. By the time the Divine Realm's experts arrive, he would have already retreated into the celestial cavern, and the Spiritual Realm would be difficult to restore. This world would have a great weakness.</p><p></p><p>He, the Seven Sixty-Two Blood Disciple, would accomplish a great feat, ascending to the position of a Blood Child, and gaining an even stronger lineage, greatly enhancing his power. His future would be filled with glory and honor.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The turbulent azure sea had calmed, and Fang Hao had completed his breakthrough, refining five Spiritual Talisman Seals.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was greatly excited. In an instant, he had set up the Mysterious Heavenly Formation, calming the sea, yet an undercurrent still lurked, and at any moment, a massive vortex could appear, capable of devouring and annihilating everything. The Spiritual Talisman Seals shone with radiant light, imbuing the Mysterious Heavenly Formation with the power of Spiritual Talismans.</p><p></p><p>"This can be called Mysterious Heavenly Spiritual Talismans!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand, and everything returned to tranquility. He then moved, returning to Hongzhou, waiting for the Divine Bridge to open.</p><p></p><p>Yue Chang Ming witnessed this scene and couldn't help but sigh. From now on, Fang Hao no longer needed his protection, and if he were to encounter a powerful enemy, it would be Fang Hao who would need to look after him.</p><p></p><p>In truth, Fang Hao's strength had long surpassed his own.</p><p></p><p>It was just that after this breakthrough, the gap between their abilities seemed to have become as vast as the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Only by breaking through to the Condensed Dao Sovereign can I narrow the gap in strength."</p><p></p><p>Yue Chang Ming thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Reaching the Condensed Dao Sovereign was not too far-fetched for him. Once they crossed the Divine Bridge, he might be able to start his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But Yue Chang Ming knew that even if he did break through to the Condensed Dao Sovereign, he would still not be a match for Fang Hao. The most he could hope for was that the gap between their strengths would not be so great.</p><p></p><p>In Hongzhou, the experts and geniuses gathered, all secretly excited, especially the young talents, who were filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>What kind of cultivation holy land awaited them on the other side of the Divine Bridge? But they all waited for the appearance of that flying ship.</p><p></p><p>In Yuzhou, the Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship appeared, not stopping, but heading towards Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has refined Spiritual Talisman Seals, and you have obtained the Primordial Spiritual Talisman Seals."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had broken through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. The Primordial Spiritual Talisman Seals were akin to the Dao Diagram Patterns.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation direction of the Mysterious Heavenly Dao has been determined. The next breakthrough will be to continue refining the Seals, and the Seals will gradually evolve towards the Dao Diagram Patterns."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Five Spiritual Talisman Seals, capable of wielding five Mysterious Heavenly Spiritual Talismans.</p><p></p><p>The boundaries beyond the Void Destruction Realm, he had already mapped out and was further perfecting.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a beam of light, heading towards Hongzhou, as Xu Yan and the others continued to contemplate their own martial arts, never resting.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was the same.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan appeared calm and carefree, but he was actually racking his brain for the great martial dao. He was quite busy as well.</p><p></p><p>There were three days until the Divine Bridge opened, when a beam of light descended from the sky, and the Long Qing Pavilion had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao came to the flying ship to pay respects to his master, and reunite with his senior brothers and sisters. Of course, Xie Tian Heng and his wife also came, and the Long Qing Pavilion was filled with warmth and joy.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan and Xin Meng Ruo also came to pay their respects to the elders.</p><p></p><p>Even Fu Tian Hai, taking advantage of his daughter's relationship, came to the Long Qing Pavilion to greet the elders and mingle with Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>During this time, they naturally discussed the other side of the Divine Bridge. Xu Yan and the others were quite curious about what awaited them there.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is boundless, said to be divided into thirty-six Realms, each no smaller than the Spiritual Realm. The Divine Bridge connects to the Qinghua Realm..."</p><p></p><p>As the lord of the Cloud Heaven Azure Sea City, Fu Tian Hai had a deeper understanding of the Divine Realm, possessing the true secrets of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Since they were discussing the Divine Realm, and the Divine Bridge was about to open, with Xu Yan and the others also planning to go to the Divine Realm, there was no need to hide or conceal these so-called secrets. In fact, revealing them could help deepen the relationship with Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his grandson Xie Ling Feng and Xu Yan already had a deep bond, providing a foundation for this.</p><p></p><p>As Fu Tian Hai explained, Xu Yan and the others finally understood, gaining a general grasp of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was divided into thirty-six Realms, each no smaller than the Spiritual Realm, and with varying levels of strength. The Divine Bridge connected to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall, the Thunder Cloud Mountain Sect, and the Imperial Spirit Pavilion were all subordinate powers of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall belonged to the Qinghua Realm's Heavenly Martial Gate.</p><p>The Thunder Cloud Mountain Sect belonged to the Qinghua Realm's Myriad Thunder Sect.</p><p>The Imperial Spirit Pavilion belonged to the Qinghua Realm's Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Our Cloud Heaven Azure Sea City belongs to the Azure Sea Realm's Cloud Heaven Island, where the Sea Spirit Tribe also resides. Our overlord is the Great Zhou Kingdom, which seems to dominate an entire Realm in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Zhou Kingdom's overlord is stronger and holds a higher position than the overlords of the Thousand Martial Hall and the others.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Eternal Dao Sect, it is also called the Eternal Dao in the Divine Realm, and is extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The details I know are only a rough outline. The true state of the Divine Realm can only be known by personally experiencing it."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tian Hai sighed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been listening silently the entire time.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is not the core of the Great Primordial. It seems that we won't encounter true experts there."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about the mysterious stone room, pondering the mysterious voice that the Emperor Wu had mentioned. What kind of existence was it? It must know why the Great Primordial was divided into several regions.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Cavern seeping in from outside the heavens and earth, perhaps that is the threat to the Great Primordial?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>To understand the secrets of the vast heavens and earth, the clues were in the mysterious stone hut.</p><p></p><p>"Once I have mastered the Dao principles of the vast heavens and earth, or if my strength breakthroughs again, I will go back and explore, to see if I can discover the source of that mysterious voice." Li Xuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>The time had come for the opening of the Divine Bridge. Everyone was excitedly waiting.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a rainbow appeared, spanning across the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>Rainbows began to surge between heaven and earth. Unlike the previous opening of the illusory bridge at the Thousand Martial Palace, this rainbow light was continuously solidifying, and the shadow of a bridge was emerging.</p><p></p><p>This rainbow bridge seemed to be suspended in the sky, spanning across the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up, the rainbow light was the condensation of the laws of heaven and earth, a heavenly law manifesting with faint rainbow colors.</p><p></p><p>This heavenly law had transformed into a descending bridge.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed, the Divine Bridge was a convergence of the laws of heaven and earth, but what surprised him was that this particular heavenly law was very special, seemingly created specifically for the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge law was like a chain, connecting the Spirit Realm and the Divine Realm, forming a bridge.</p><p></p><p>Apart from connecting the Spirit Realm and the Divine Realm, this law had no other function, it did not even possess any offensive or binding power.</p><p></p><p>"This heavenly law is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was confident, looking at the vast heavens and earth, no one understood the laws of the vast heavens and earth better than him.</p><p></p><p>He saw through the essence of the Divine Bridge law at a glance, it was born when the vast heavens and earth separated the spatial realms and divided the territories, solely for the purpose of connecting the Spirit Realm and the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge began to solidify, a rainbow bridge spanning the azure sea, one end descending onto Rainbow State, the other end descending onto the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>From the illusory bridge shadow, it gradually transformed into a solid bridge.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge was a hundred zhang wide, its length unknown, stretching as far as the eye could see, with rainbow light circling it. At a certain moment, the Divine Bridge descended.</p><p></p><p>Boom! One end of the Divine Bridge landed on Rainbow State, the other end also landed on the Azure Flower Realm of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge has opened!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan even wished he could immediately step onto the Divine Bridge and head to the Divine Realm to find his Dao mentor.</p><p></p><p>"Welcome the Celestial Lord's arrival!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai, the Great Zhou Emperor, and others bowed and said.</p><p></p><p>Last time, the Thousand Martial Palace had invited a Condensed Dao Celestial Lord to descend, but he was slain by the Seductive Witch.</p><p></p><p>This time the Divine Bridge opened, would the Heavenly Martial Gate under the Thousand Martial Palace send an even stronger Celestial Lord? Or did they think the previous Celestial Lord was just delayed by some matter and did not know he had perished?</p><p></p><p>If so, they might not send a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was looking at the Divine Bridge, waiting for the Celestial Lord to arrive.</p><p></p><p>On the Long Green Tower airship, Li Xuan was also quietly observing, Xu Yan and the others were also not in a hurry to enter the Divine Realm, waiting for the Celestial Lord of the Divine Realm to arrive as well.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, as the Millennium Alliance Patriarch, had left for an unknown time, so his position as the Millennium Alliance Patriarch had been handed over to others.</p><p></p><p>Whether the arrival of the Divine Realm Celestial Lord would impact the current situation in the Spirit Realm remained to be seen, but Fang Hao was not afraid at all, with his master guarding him.</p><p></p><p>In the martial dao world, it was ultimately the strong who had the final say.</p><p></p><p>Under the Abyss of the Azure Sea, the Seven Two Six Blood Disciple stood with a knife, floating up to the entrance of the Celestial Abyss, excitedly looking at the Divine Bridge above, waiting for the opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>The other blood slaves also floated up to the Celestial Abyss entrance, holding blood knives, waiting for the order to surge forth, slash the Divine Bridge, and invade the Spirit Realm, turning it into a Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, I can feel it!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Two Six Blood Disciple's eyes gleamed with excitement and bloodlust.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! The Divine Bridge slightly trembled, a powerful figure came from the Divine Realm, stepping lightly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Two Six Blood Disciple's brow suddenly furrowed, a look of surprise on his face. "Could it be that the Divine Realm has detected the existence of my Celestial Abyss?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I've hidden it for so long without exposing it, and the Azure Flower Realm is in great turmoil now.</p><p></p><p>"Normally, it would just be a Condensed Dao Realm expert, but this time a Refined Reality Realm True King Celestial Lord has come?"</p><p></p><p>The one walking on the Divine Bridge was a Refined Reality Realm True King Celestial Lord! "Blood power, converge on me, we must strike and kill him in one blow."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Two Six Blood Disciple commanded the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The blood slaves respectfully obeyed.</p><p></p><p>Blood light converged, all of it entering the Seven Two Six Blood Disciple's body, gathering on his blood knife.</p><p></p><p>"Here he comes!"</p><p></p><p>In Rainbow State, the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the figure reflected on the Divine Bridge, the Celestial Lord had arrived! "Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed, so this was the True King Celestial Lord?</p><p></p><p>"Has he detected the fall of the previous Celestial Lord? No, it seems he has just experienced a great battle."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The arriving True King Celestial Lord seemed to have just gone through a great battle and was not at his peak strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this True King Celestial Lord did not belong to the Heavenly Martial Gate of the Thousand Martial Palace, but seemed to be from the Myriad Thunder Sect of the Thunder Cloud Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was focused on the Divine Bridge, watching the Celestial Lord approach, suddenly a blood light surged up from the Azure Sea, slashing towards the Celestial Lord on the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were stunned, before they could react, a rumbling sound was heard, the Divine Bridge crumbled and collapsed!</p><p></p><p>The scene reflected on the Divine Bridge was the Celestial Lord's furious expression and the terrifying blood sword light.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was so familiar! "Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"No, even more terrifying than the Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a furious roar came from the collapsing Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>"How can the Infernal Abyss Blood Disciple appear in the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Azure Sea churned with towering waves, even from the distant view, they could see the horrifying blood light shooting up to the sky, and the powerful Celestial Lord being slashed into a mist of blood under the blood light!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge collapsed, the Celestial Lord perished! The sudden turn of events shocked all the powerful experts, everyone felt a chill down their spine, unable to utter a single word.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge had collapsed! The Celestial Lord had fallen! What calamity had occurred?</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, a great disaster was about to befall the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>"It's from the Abyss of the Azure Sea!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, my Sea Spirit Clan is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan Chief said with a pale face.</p><p></p><p>The collapsed Divine Bridge was disappearing into illusion, as if the chain connecting the Spirit Realm and the Divine Realm had been severed by a single strike. Blood-colored light surged from the depths of the Azure Sea, like a rolling tide of blood, vaguely revealing blood-colored figures, each one comparable to a Condensed Dao Celestial Lord in strength.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the hearts of all the powerful experts in the Spirit Realm were trembling, a single Condensed Dao Celestial Lord was already enough to sweep across the Spirit Realm, let alone these hundreds of figures comparable to Condensed Dao Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, we have powerful experts in the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were forcibly calming themselves, their faces pale but filled with hope as they looked towards the direction of the Long Green Tower.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

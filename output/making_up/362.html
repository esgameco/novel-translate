        <h1>Chapter 362</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>No one knew that beneath the azure sea abyss was a celestial cave. Inside the cave with rolling waves of blood, rows of figures stood silently, gazing outside the cave.</p><p></p><p>They looked towards the vast blue sea, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>A man with blood-red hair stood holding a sword. A bloody aura swirled around him, and faint sword light flickered on his crimson blade, as if gathering power, ready to unleash a mighty strike at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"The time has come. The Spirit Realm should belong to our Netherworld now. Are the blood slaves ready for our hunting grounds?" The Blood Disciple 762 spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we are prepared. Let blood light shine upon the Spirit Realm!" Those figures shouted with fanatical looks in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent! After long years of planning and waiting, it's finally time to reap the rewards." Blood Disciple 762 smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Once I occupy the Spirit Realm and perform blood sacrifices there, I, Blood Disciple 762, will surely advance to become a Blood Son!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 762's eyes revealed a look of longing. </p><p></p><p>The Blood Sons of the Netherworld held exalted status and could receive true teachings. Any Blood Son possessed extremely powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge spans across the abyss, connecting to the God Realm. It is the bridge to the God Realm. Once destroyed, it cannot be repaired or reopened in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the God Realm will soon face a great war, especially in the Qinghua Realm where the Divine Bridge is located. Chaos is about to begin.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, the Spirit Realm will become the Blood Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 762's eyes were excited as he stared intently at the top of the celestial cave and the azure sea abyss above, waiting for the Divine Bridge to open.</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Bridge appeared, it would be time for him to strike - to destroy the bridge in one move and sever the connection between the Spirit Realm and God Realm!</p><p></p><p>Without reinforcements from the God Realm, wouldn't the mere Spirit Realm become his hunting ground?</p><p></p><p>From now on, the Spirit Realm would become the Blood Realm. By the time reinforcements arrived from the God Realm, he would have long retreated into the celestial cave. The Spirit Realm would be difficult to restore, and a huge weak point would appear in this world.</p><p></p><p>He, Blood Disciple 762, would achieve great merit, advance to the position of Blood Son in one step, obtain stronger inheritance, and greatly increase his power! A bright future lay ahead! Blood Disciple 762 was excited internally, looking forward to the glory and honor of becoming a Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The turbulent azure sea had calmed. Fang Hao had completed his breakthrough, condensing five divine ability runes.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely excited. With a thought, he laid out the cosmic wonder formation. The azure sea waves were calm on the surface, but undercurrents lurked beneath. At a certain moment, a huge vortex appeared, seemingly able to devour and obliterate everything in an instant! The divine ability runes shone with radiance, imbuing this cosmic wonder formation with the power of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"This can be called a cosmic wonder divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand and everything returned to calm. He moved and returned to Hong Province, waiting for the Divine Bridge to open.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Yue Changming couldn't help but sigh. From now on, Fang Hao no longer needed his protection. If they encountered powerful enemies, it would be he who needed Fang Hao's care instead.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Fang Hao's strength had long surpassed his own.</p><p></p><p>But after this breakthrough, the gap in their powers seemed as vast as heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Only by breaking through to Condensed Law Celestial Venerable can I narrow the power gap," Yue Changming thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Condensed Law Celestial Venerable wasn't too far off for him. After reaching the other side of the Divine Bridge, he might be able to start working on the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>But Yue Changming knew that even if he broke through to Condensed Law Celestial Venerable, he would be no match for Fang Hao. The gap in their powers would simply be not as large.</p><p></p><p>In Hong Province, powerful experts and geniuses gathered. Everyone was secretly excited, especially the various geniuses who were full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sacred cultivation ground lay on the other side of the Divine Bridge? However, the powerful experts were all waiting for the appearance of that flying ship.</p><p></p><p>In Jade Province, the flying ship of Changqing Pavilion appeared and headed towards Hong Province without stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has condensed divine ability runes, and you have obtained innate divine ability runes."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had broken through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. The innate divine ability runes existed like patterns of the Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation direction of the cosmic wonder martial way has been determined. The next realm breakthrough will be to continue condensing runes, and the runes will gradually transform towards Dao principle runes," Li Xuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Five divine ability runes could be used to perform five cosmic wonder divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>He had already devised the realms above the Void-breaking Realm and was further refining them.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a stream of light, flying towards Hong Province. Xu Yan and the others were all comprehending their own martial ways without pause.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was the same.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan appeared calm and at ease, but was actually racking his brains for the great cause of martial arts. He was also very busy.</p><p></p><p>Three days remained until the Divine Bridge opened. A beam of light descended from the sky - Changqing Pavilion had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao came to the ship to pay respects to his master and reunite with his senior brothers and sisters. Mr. and Mrs. Xie Tianheng naturally came as well. Changqing Pavilion was filled with joy.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou both came to pay respects to the elders.</p><p></p><p>Even Fu Tianhai, using his daughter's connection, came to Changqing Pavilion to pay respects to the elders and socialize with Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>They naturally also discussed the other side of the Divine Bridge. Xu Yan and the others were very curious about it.</p><p></p><p>"The God Realm is vast and boundless. It is said to be divided into thirty-six realms, each no smaller than the Spirit Realm. The Divine Bridge connects to the Qinghua Realm..."</p><p></p><p>As the city lord of Yuntian Bihai City, Fu Tianhai naturally had a better understanding of the God Realm than Fu Yun, and possessed the true secrets of the transcendent spirit sects.</p><p></p><p>Since they were discussing the God Realm, and the Divine Bridge was about to open, and Xu Yan and the others would be going to the God Realm, there was no need to hide these so-called secrets. Revealing them now would instead help improve relations with Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his grandson Xie Lingfeng already had a deep friendship with Xu Yan, so there was already that connection.</p><p></p><p>As Fu Tianhai explained, Xu Yan and the others came to understand, finally gaining a general understanding of the God Realm.</p><p></p><p>The God Realm had thirty-six realms, each no smaller than the Spirit Realm, and each with different levels of power. The Qinghua Realm, one of the thirty-six realms, was connected to the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>The superior God Realm forces of the Thousand Martial Palace, Thundercloud Manor, and Imperial Spirit Mansion all came from the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace belonged to the Heavenly Martial Gate of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Manor belonged to the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Mansion belonged to the Great Yue Nation of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Our Yuntian Bihai City's superior sect is not in the Qinghua Realm, but on Cloud Sky Island in the Azure Sea Realm, where there are also sea spirit clans... The Great Zhou Dynasty's superior force seems to be a dynasty that solely controls one realm in the God Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The superior force of the Great Zhou Dynasty is somewhat stronger in power and status than the superior sects of the Thousand Martial Palace and others.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Tai Miao Sect, their sect in the God Realm is also called Tai Miao, and is incredibly powerful...</p><p></p><p>"What I know is actually just a general outline. The specific situation in the God Realm can only be understood by going there in person," Fu Tianhai said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been listening silently.</p><p></p><p>"The God Realm is not the core of Taicang either. It seems we won't encounter truly powerful experts in the God Realm," Li Xuan thought of that mysterious stone house and pondered. What kind of being was that mysterious voice Emperor Wu spoke of? They must know why the Taicang world was divided into several regions.</p><p></p><p>"The celestial caves seeping in from outside the world, perhaps that is the threat to the Taicang world?" </p><p></p><p>Li</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xuan pondered silently.</p><p></p><p>To uncover the secrets of the Taicang world, the clues were in the mysterious small stone house.</p><p></p><p>"Once I've memorized the laws of the Taicang world, or after my strength breaks through again, I'll go back to explore and see if I can discover the source of that mysterious voice," Li Xuan decided inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The day of the Divine Bridge's opening arrived, and everyone waited excitedly. </p><p></p><p>In the sky, a rainbow appeared, spanning across the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>Rainbow light began to surge between heaven and earth. Unlike the previous opening of the virtual bridge at the Thousand Martial Palace, this time the rainbow light continuously solidified, and the shadow of a bridge was emerging.</p><p></p><p>This rainbow bridge seemed to be above the sky dome, spanning across the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up and saw that the rainbow light was formed by the condensation of the laws of heaven and earth. A strand of the world's laws appeared, emanating a faint seven-colored rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>This strand of the world's laws seemed to have transformed into a bridge descending from above.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. The Divine Bridge was formed by the convergence of a law of heaven and earth. What surprised him was that this particular law was very special, seemingly born specifically for the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge law was like a chain, connecting the Spirit Realm and the Divine Realm, forming a bridge.</p><p></p><p>Apart from connecting the Spirit Realm and Divine Realm, this law had no other function. It didn't even possess offensive power or binding ability.</p><p></p><p>"This law of heaven and earth is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was confident that no one in the Taicang world understood its laws better than him.</p><p></p><p>At a glance, he saw through the essence of the Divine Bridge law. It came into being when the Taicang world separated the spaces of heaven and earth and divided the territories, solely to connect the Spirit Realm and Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge began to transform from virtual to real. A rainbow bridge spanning the azure sea, with one end descending to Hong Province and the other to the Divine Realm, was continuously condensing.</p><p></p><p>From a virtual bridge shadow, it gradually became a solid bridge.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge was a hundred zhang wide and countless thousands of li long, its end not visible to the eye. Rainbow light surrounded it, and at a certain moment, the Divine Bridge descended.</p><p></p><p>Boom! One end of the Divine Bridge landed in Hong Province, while the other end landed in the Qinghua Border of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge has opened!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan even wished he could immediately ascend the Divine Bridge and go to the Divine Realm to find his martial arts guide.</p><p></p><p>"We welcome the descent of the Celestial Venerable!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai, the Emperor of Great Zhou, and others bowed and said in front of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Last time, when the Thousand Martial Palace invited a Celestial Venerable to descend, a Law Condensation Celestial Venerable came but was killed by Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>This time with the Divine Bridge opening, would the Tianwu Gate, the superior sect of the Thousand Martial Palace, send a stronger Celestial Venerable? Or did they still not know that the previous Celestial Venerable had perished, thinking they were just delayed and unable to return in time?</p><p></p><p>If so, they might not send a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was looking at the Divine Bridge, waiting for the Celestial Venerable to descend.</p><p></p><p>On the Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship, Li Xuan was also silently observing. Xu Yan and others were not in a hurry to enter the Divine Realm, also waiting for the Divine Realm's Celestial Venerable to descend.</p><p></p><p>As the leader of the Eternal Alliance, Fang Hao didn't know when he would return to the Spirit Realm this time, so he had already handed over the position of alliance leader to someone else.</p><p></p><p>Whether the descent of the Divine Realm's Celestial Venerable would impact the existing structure of the Spirit Realm remained to be seen, but Fang Hao was not afraid at all, with his master presiding.</p><p></p><p>In the martial world, the strong ultimately had the final say.</p><p></p><p>Below the Azure Sea Abyss, Blood Disciple 726 stood holding a knife, floating up to the mouth of the heavenly cave, excitedly watching the Divine Bridge above, waiting for the opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>Other blood slaves also floated up to the mouth of the heavenly cave, holding blood knives, just waiting for the order to surge out, strike at the Divine Bridge, attack the Spirit Realm, and turn it into a Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Soon, I can feel it!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726's eyes were excited and bloodthirsty.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge trembled slightly, and a powerful figure walked over from the Divine Realm with quick steps.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726 suddenly frowned, showing a surprised expression. "Could it be that the Divine Realm has detected the existence of this heavenly cave?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, I've hidden for such a long time without ever being exposed, and the Qinghua Border should be in great chaos right now.</p><p></p><p>"Usually, only a Law Condensation realm would come, why has a True Essence realm come this time?"</p><p></p><p>The one walking on the Divine Bridge was a True King Celestial Venerable of the True Essence realm!</p><p></p><p>"Gather the blood power to me, we must kill them in one strike," Blood Disciple 726 ordered the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>The blood slaves respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Blood light gathered, all entering Blood Disciple 726's body, converging on his blood knife.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>In Hong Province, the Spirit Realm powerhouses were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the figure reflected from the Divine Bridge, the Celestial Venerable had arrived!</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. So this was a True King Celestial Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"Did they sense the fall of the previous Celestial Venerable? No, they seem to have just been through a great battle."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very surprised.</p><p></p><p>This True King Celestial Venerable who had come seemed to have just been through a great battle and was not at peak strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this True King Celestial Venerable was not from the Tianwu Gate of the Thousand Martial Palace, but seemed to be from the Wanlei Sect of the Thundercloud Manor?</p><p></p><p>Just as everyone was staring at the Divine Bridge, watching the Celestial Venerable approach, suddenly, a blood light surged up from the Azure Sea, striking towards the Divine Bridge and the Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>All the Spirit Realm powerhouses were stunned, not yet reacting to what had happened, when they heard a loud boom, and the Divine Bridge broke in half and collapsed!</p><p></p><p>The scene reflected from the Divine Bridge was the Celestial Venerable's angry and shocked expression, as well as that terrifying blood-colored blade light.</p><p></p><p>This strike was so familiar!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"No, even more terrifying than the Blood Demon!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, from the collapsed Divine Bridge came an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>"Netherworld Blood Disciple, how could they appear in the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Azure Sea raised huge waves, and even from a great distance, they could see the terrifying blood light soaring to the sky. That powerful Celestial Venerable was turned into a mist of blood under the blood light!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge collapsed, the Celestial Venerable perished! The sudden turn of events stunned all the powerhouses. Everyone felt a chill run down their spine, cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads, unable to make a sound.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge had collapsed! The Celestial Venerable had fallen! What on earth had happened? Without a doubt, something major was about to happen in the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>"It's the Azure Sea Abyss!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai said in shock.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad, my Sea Spirit Tribe is in danger!" </p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Tribe leader said with a pale face.</p><p></p><p>The collapsed Divine Bridge was fading into a virtual image and disappearing, as if the chain connecting the Spirit Realm and Divine Realm had been cut with one strike!</p><p></p><p>Blood-colored light surged from the end of the Azure Sea, like rolling waves of blood, sweeping towards Hong Province. Faintly visible were numerous blood-colored figures, each nearly comparable to the might of a Law Condensation Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the hearts of all Spirit Realm powerhouses were trembling. A single Law Condensation Celestial Venerable was enough to sweep across the Spirit Realm, let alone over a hundred figures comparable to Law Condensation Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, we have a great expert in our Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all Spirit Realm powerhouses were forcing themselves to stay calm, their faces pale, looking towards the Evergreen Pavilion with full of hope.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Should we report the suspicion that the Blood Demon has returned?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the left asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Whether he is the Blood Demon or not is just our speculation. Moreover, even if he is the Blood Demon, he may no longer have the cultivation of the Killing Art. After all, the one from Mount Taimiao entered the Inner Realm back then.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years ago, the dashing son of the Wood family also entered the Inner Realm. If the Blood Demon is truly alive, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the right spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Whew!" </p><p></p><p>The guardian on the left widened his eyes, revealing a surprised expression, and said, "Are you saying that if the Blood Demon is truly alive and no longer cultivating the Killing Art, then behind this..."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more alarmed he became. There was a deep well of water here!</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the right continued, "Even if it's not like that, if we let the Blood Demon return, although the fault is not ours, do you think those high and mighty Refining Spirit Celestials will forgive us?</p><p></p><p>"We will surely die!" Just like us, even if we know those master cultivators may not have made mistakes, in our frustration, we might still casually kill them.</p><p></p><p>"And we, in the eyes of the Refining Spirit Celestials, are no different, are we?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the left's expression tightened. They were of average background, belonging to the inner guard of the Zheng Kingdom, responsible for guarding the gate of the Spiritual Realm, compared to those Spiritual Sect Celestials, the gap in status was too great.</p><p></p><p>The shadow the Blood Demon left on the many powerful cultivators of the Spiritual Realm was quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>"To speak is to die, not to speak may also be to die, but now that we've spoken, we won't live for long. But if we keep it a secret until it's exposed, we might live a little longer.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, the longer we delay, the more variables there might be, after all, the two from the Water Star Palace have entered the Inner Realm and have not yet returned."</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the right continued.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, let's keep it a secret!"</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the left took a deep breath and nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"What about Dai Yingying's death?"</p><p></p><p>He frowned and asked again.</p><p></p><p>"We've seen her. She came here, found the lower-class people in the Inner Realm too trash, unworthy of being guides, so she left again. As for where she died, how would we know? Wasn't there a wandering Celestial who claimed he would destroy her? Let's just say it was the other party who did it."</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the right said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying and her Dao Protector Celestial had both died, leaving no ashes behind.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the two of them, and the murderer, no one else knew about it.</p><p></p><p>"Then let it be so."</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the left nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The two continued their cultivation, acting as if nothing had happened, and the gate of the Spiritual Realm had never been opened.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the two of them had already formed an tacit understanding. In the future, if anyone from the Inner Realm came in, they must not rashly beat or abuse them, lest they meet the same fate as Dai Yingying. At the same time, they secretly cursed Jiao Ming and Ping'er for going to the Inner Realm and not returning for a long time. If they were not Spiritual Sect cultivators, they would have closed the gate of the Spiritual Realm and let them stay in the Inner Realm forever!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan entered the Spiritual Realm, Li Xuan's group returned to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they left the Cangbei region, Li Xuan saw the Great Dao Golden Book open, and a golden light gushed out.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has extinguished a minor Celestial with a single palm strike, your combat experience has increased!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>They had just entered the Spiritual Realm, and he had already killed a minor Celestial? Wouldn't this cause some trouble?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recalled how Xu Yan had started killing Patriarchs soon after entering the Inner Realm, and the similarity between the two situations was quite striking.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he will keep killing minor Celestials every now and then, just like when he entered the Inner Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly felt a bit numb.</p><p></p><p>"With the cultivation of the Merge with the Mundane Dao Art, even if we encounter Refining Spirit Celestials hunting us, we can still evade them. It's not a big problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was no longer a newcomer to the martial dao world, his experience in roaming the martial dao was more abundant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan was not a single-minded person, if he couldn't win, he would immediately retreat.</p><p></p><p>The group returned to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Ling Xiu continued to cultivate diligently, striving to enter the Spiritual Realm again next time.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu's mother, this time she also worked hard, diligently cultivating again.</p><p></p><p>So as not to become a burden to her precious son.</p><p></p><p>Now, she had broken through and cultivated for two hours a day, which was unprecedented for her. Shi Er and Zhou Ying were also working hard in their cultivation, having respectively broken through to the Early Transcendent and Late Transcendent realms.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's strength had also risen to the Late Transcendent realm. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also took the time to guide him a bit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Realm, in Yuzhou, in the Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The biggest event in the entire Zheng Kingdom was naturally the discovery of the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families had all sent their younger generations to enter the Qingtianjiao Tomb and obtain the treasures within.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingtianjiao Tomb, aside from the Qingtianjiao Tree and the Dragon's Eye Fruit, there must be other treasures, and there was even a possibility that the lifetime's accumulation of the Qingtianjiao was there.</p><p></p><p>As a formidable Spiritual Beast Clan, the Qingtianjiao had once dominated the Eighteen Provinces, and had even devoured Refining Spirit Celestials.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that it had wanted to molt and transform into the legendary True Dragon, but had failed, and its ultimate fate was unknown.</p><p></p><p>In the martial dao world of the Spiritual Realm, there were occasional rumors that the Qingtianjiao had built a grand tomb for itself before its demise.</p><p></p><p>But it had never been confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Qingtianjiao Tomb had been discovered, it immediately caught the attention of the major Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families in the Yuzhou region. Even the number one Spiritual Sect in Yuzhou, the Yushen Sect, had sent their geniuses to participate.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that the Spiritual Beast Clan also had intentions to participate, but Yuzhou was not within the sphere of influence of the Spiritual Beasts, and if they were to participate, it would be dangerous for the Spiritual Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Beasts were treasures to the human cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Storage Pouch was made from the Swallow Toad, which belonged to the Spiritual Beast category, although most of them were not of high rank and reproduced quickly, they were domesticated by the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families.</p><p></p><p>This could supply the huge demand for Storage Pouches.</p><p></p><p>In Zheng Kingdom, in front of the Black Cloud Swamp, a group of Spiritual Sect and Aristocratic Family geniuses had arrived one after another, occupying advantageous positions, waiting to enter the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who could come here were all geniuses under the age of thirty.</p><p></p><p>Except for a few teenagers, the rest were all at the early stage of the Minor Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Before the age of thirty, breaking through to the Gathering Spirit Realm of the Celestial Cultivator, was considered a genius in the Spiritual Realm, and they would most likely become Great Celestial Cultivators in the future, barring any accidents.</p><p></p><p>As for the Refining Spirit Celestials, not all geniuses could reach that level.</p><p></p><p>Above the Black Cloud Swamp, there was a fine black poisonous grass, and when the wind blew, it swayed like black clouds. The entire swamp was shrouded in black mist, and one could only vaguely see a towering mountain in the center of the swamp.</p><p></p><p>That was the Black Rock Mountain, entirely black in color, containing potent toxins.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that it had been soaked in the poisonous miasma for years, turning it black.</p><p></p><p>The Qingtianjiao Tomb was located within the Black Rock Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The poisonous miasma permeated the Black Cloud Swamp, and even Great Celestial Cultivators could not linger for long, as the miasma would corrode the cultivators' power. For the cultivators entering, they were constantly consuming their strength.</p><p></p><p>The poisonous miasma had already started to thin out. According to the records, the poisonous miasma in the Black Cloud Swamp would thin and disappear for ten days every year, and then it would reappear.</p><p></p><p>These ten days were the opportunity to enter the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>With the discovery of the Qingtianjiao Tomb, the formation of the Black Cloud Swamp was mostly suspected to be the arrangement left behind by the Qingtianjiao.</p><p></p><p>According to the records, the Qingtianjiao was extremely powerful, and its body...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>It contained a poisonous pouch, which was a powerful poison technique he had cultivated. Even cultivators at the Divine Celestial realm could be killed by it! It was extremely terrifying! Several figures descended from the sky, landing in a certain place in the Black Cloud Marsh. This was a protruding hillock, relatively close to the Black Cloud Marsh, and the poisonous miasma would not spread to this location. It was a favorable position.</p><p></p><p>"Those are people from the Dai family."</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists whispered upon seeing the descending figures.</p><p></p><p>"The Dai family, they are about to rise up. They may have the opportunity to become a top-tier family in Yuzhou."</p><p></p><p>Someone sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family was only a second-tier family in Yuzhou, but this generation's younger members had produced Dai Yingying, a prodigy. Moreover, they had established a connection with the royal family of the Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Dai family had a slim chance of ascending to the supreme Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>The royal family of the Zheng Kingdom, due to their task of guarding the gate of the Spiritual Realm, directly answered to a few supreme Spiritual Sects. Although they were not the strongest in Yuzhou, no force dared to offend them.</p><p></p><p>Many second or third-tier families and Spiritual Sects desired to marry into the royal family of the Zheng Kingdom, but the royal family's standards were too high, and they rarely married into other forces.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying was born with a blessed body, envied by countless prodigies, and the royal family of the Zheng Kingdom also favored this young lady, so the Dai family successfully married into the royal family.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't Yingying arrived yet?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun looked around and frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The young miss said she went to the lower realms to capture some people to scout the way."</p><p></p><p>A servant beside him spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The martial artists in the lower realms are weak in strength. What's the use of capturing them?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Has the one who boasted about killing Yingying been found?"</p><p></p><p>"His trail has been discovered, and he is being hunted down. He won't live much longer."</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun nodded upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>His gaze swept towards the Black Cloud Marsh, and through the lingering poisonous miasma, he could vaguely see that towering mountain.</p><p></p><p>In front of the Black Cloud Marsh, there was a huge boulder, closest to the marsh, but the poisonous miasma did not spread to the boulder. This location was one of the best positions on the edge of the Black Cloud Marsh.</p><p></p><p>Among the Spiritual Sects and families present, no one occupied this huge boulder, as if they had tacitly agreed that this position belonged to a certain force.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Realm, the hierarchy was strict. Whenever there was a grand event, once it was determined that a top-tier Spiritual Sect or family was participating, the rest of the second or third-tier forces would consciously leave the position that belonged to the top-tier force.</p><p></p><p>They absolutely would not occupy such a position just because they arrived earlier. Otherwise, they would invite trouble upon themselves, and this had already become an unwritten rule in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that this huge boulder, despite its excellent and flat location, had not been occupied by any other force.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had learned from Dai Yingying about the Blue Sky Flood Dragon Tomb. He immediately decided to participate in the exploration of the Blue Sky Flood Dragon Tomb. This treasure trove was absolutely not to be missed.</p><p></p><p>If successful, he would be able to accumulate enough foundation to break through to the Divine Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is truly wealthy!" </p><p></p><p>After checking Dai Yingying's storage bag, Xu Yan couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>The lowest-grade spiritual herbs in it were sixth-grade, and there were several stalks of fourth-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>As for those bottles and jars, they were medicinal pills made from spiritual herbs, which in Xu Yan's eyes were a waste, even though the grade of the spiritual herbs used was not low.</p><p></p><p>But their effects were far inferior to the medicinal pills he carried.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm also seemed to have something similar to spirit tickets, but they were not issued by a single force, but by several forces. Xu Yan found three different types of spirit tickets in Dai Yingying's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The number of spirit tickets was not many, and there were more spiritual crystals.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual crystals in the Spiritual Realm are much better than those in the Inner Realm, containing more spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clicked his tongue in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Each of these spiritual crystals was worth the spiritual energy of five or six spiritual crystals in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Carrying tens of thousands of spiritual crystals, she is truly a little rich lady. It's a pity she has a way to die. If she were as generous as Miss Du, she wouldn't have died."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Cloud Marsh is just ahead."</p><p></p><p>From afar, he could see a dark, hazy area, which should be the Black Cloud Marsh that Dai Yingying had mentioned, the location of the Blue Sky Flood Dragon Tomb.</p><p></p><p>"This poisonous miasma is quite formidable."</p><p></p><p>Upon reaching the edge of the Black Cloud Marsh, Xu Yan couldn't help but exclaim. Even with his current strength, if he stayed inside for a day and a night, his true essence would be consumed by half.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the martial artists of the Spiritual Realm were all waiting for the poisonous miasma to dissipate before entering the Blue Sky Flood Dragon Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around, and apart from a few young men and women, the rest were nearly thirty years old, with the weakest being at the early Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The strongest was a young man in a blue robe, at the late Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was occupying a favorable position alone.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw the unoccupied huge boulder and immediately landed on it.</p><p></p><p>This place, he would take.</p><p></p><p>As for any rules, Xu Yan didn't know about them. His understanding of the Spiritual Realm was not extensive, and although Dai Yingying had briefly introduced it, it was too superficial. Moreover, Dai Yingying would not tell him everything.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's arrival immediately drew the attention of the martial artists present, and upon seeing him occupy the huge boulder, they were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is he a prodigy from a top-tier Spiritual Sect or family?"</p><p></p><p>"Looking at his attire, there is no such family or Spiritual Sect in our Yuzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Could he be a wandering cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, how would a wandering cultivator dare to occupy that position?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were all puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The families and Spiritual Sects in the Spiritual Realm's martial arts world all had their own distinctive attire and emblems, allowing people to easily recognize which force they belonged to.</p><p></p><p>For the forces of Yuzhou, they were all familiar with each other's attire and emblems.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan, although his attire was not ordinary, had no emblems of any Spiritual Sect or family.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he was just a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In such a grand event, no prodigy from a force would not wear the attire of their own faction. As for wandering cultivators daring to impersonate families and Spiritual Sects, although it had happened before, the perpetrators had all been reduced to ashes, and there were only a few wandering cultivators in Yuzhou bold enough to attempt such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Could he be from a force outside of Yuzhou?"</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists wondered.</p><p></p><p>"But he doesn't have any emblems of families or Spiritual Sects, he really looks like a wandering cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that he just didn't wear his family's attire?"</p><p></p><p>"In such a grand event with many forces gathered, how could he not wear it? Firstly, to intimidate the smaller forces, and secondly, even if he dies, at least people would know which force he belongs to, so their strong members can avenge him..."</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists found this reasoning plausible.</p><p></p><p>So, was this person truly a wandering cultivator? When did Yuzhou produce such an arrogant wandering cultivator?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the prodigies of the major forces all revealed expressions of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>That huge boulder was tacitly acknowledged as the position of the top-tier Shen family.</p><p></p><p>A wandering cultivator daring to occupy a top-tier family's position, he must be tired of living.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this young man's cultivation, it seemed to be only at the Grand Master Realm? With such a cultivation, he also dared to participate in the exploration of the Blue Sky Flood Dragon Tomb. He was just coming here to die.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

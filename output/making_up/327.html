        <h1>Chapter 327</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea, apart from the Abyss, has other perilous areas, but none as dangerous as the Abyss, and the possibility of finding divine treasures is greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from the Azure Sea Abyss, there is another place that also has divine treasures, but it is extremely difficult to find. It is rumored that the Azure Sea Divine Pearl exists there."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér thought for a moment and said, "The Azure Sea Black Pool is a unique place in the Azure Sea. While it is dangerous, it's because if you delve too deep, there is a chance of losing your bearings.</p><p></p><p>"Especially for the human race, the danger is even greater, and you may even get trapped inside."</p><p></p><p>According to Cai Lingér, the Azure Sea Black Pool is not actually a deep pool, but rather a region of the Azure Sea that is as dark as ink, resembling a black pool.</p><p></p><p>Once you enter, not only is your vision obstructed and you can't see far, but even your spiritual power's range of exploration is greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>"It is precisely because of the Black Pool's uniqueness that even if there are divine treasures, they are not easily found, relying solely on luck and chance. You must be careful not to venture too deep, or you risk becoming lost.</p><p></p><p>"You may think you are rising up from the sea, but in reality, you are sinking down or drifting to another side.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it is rumored that there are some special things in the Black Pool that will attack those who enter. Although most are not powerful, there may be formidable entities in the depths of the Black Pool."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér spoke seriously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and made a note of these places, intending to explore them one by one after arriving at the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>"I once heard an elder of the Sea Spirit Tribe say that the Black Pool may be the remnants of an ancient battlefield, which is why it is so unique."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér added at the end.</p><p></p><p>Then, she took out a crystal-clear small seashell and a small shell with patterns engraved on it, with the words "Cai Ling" in the center.</p><p></p><p>"This is my token. If you need assistance, you can use my token to seek help from the Sea Spirit Tribe. If you get lost or want to inquire about your location, you can blow this seashell. </p><p></p><p>"If there are any Sea Spirits nearby, they will come to your aid and guide you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the seashell and shell, cupping his hands and saying, "Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>"You're welcome!" Cai Lingér replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>These items are nothing compared to the opportunities bestowed by the elders.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan set out on his journey through the Spiritual Realm once again, this time heading to the Azure Sea to search for Xie Lingfeng and also to seek the Azure Sea divine treasures.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, "Once I've explored the other states, I'll also go to the Azure Sea for a visit."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also moved, and she decided that the next destination of the Qingqing Pavilion would be the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Pavilion's flying ship took off and headed towards the Great Zhou capital.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou imperial court showed no signs of retaliation, obviously knowing they were in the wrong and had no plans to seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was sitting in the pavilion, with only Meng Chong present at the moment.</p><p></p><p>It was time to pass on the cultivation method for the Unextinguishable Golden Body after the Great Sun Indestructible Technique.</p><p></p><p>He had also compiled the subsequent cultivation of the physical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Meng Chong respectfully greeted.</p><p></p><p>"You have already comprehended the Great Sun Indestructible Technique. Do you have any insights regarding the subsequent cultivation of the physical martial dao?" Li Xuan nodded and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I am dull-witted and have no insights regarding the cultivation after the Great Sun Indestructible Technique," Meng Chong said, scratching his bald head.</p><p></p><p>"Then today, I shall pass on to you the cultivation method above the Great Sun Indestructible Technique," Li Xuan nodded, not surprised, for if Meng Chong had insights into the subsequent physical martial dao cultivation, he would not need Li Xuan to compile the techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Indestructible Technique was already incredibly powerful, fully demonstrating the might of the physical martial dao. Even if he stood still, cultivators who had refined the spiritual energy of heaven and earth would be unable to harm him at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if they used divine artifacts, cultivators who had refined the spiritual energy of heaven and earth would likely only be able to inflict minor injuries on him. Meng Chong even suspected that the invincibility of his physical body was approaching the level of the spiritual sect's divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression was solemn as he slowly said, "Above the Great Sun Indestructible Technique is the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body. Each aperture is a star, and the stars orbit the Great Sun in an orderly manner. The first layer of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body is the Stellar Physique, where the body is like the Great Sun, and the stars orbit..."</p><p></p><p>The subsequent martial dao technique for the Great Sun Indestructible Technique was the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body. After repeated contemplation, Li Xuan had finally determined the details.</p><p></p><p>This was to lay the foundation for the future physical cultivation path. Each golden body aperture would be a star, and each star would contain profound mysteries or even divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Just like the Great Sun Indestructible Technique, the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body also had three layers, with the first layer corresponding to the Spiritual Appearance Realm, where the body is like the Great Sun, and the stars orbit, and the orbiting stars are the aperture stars, connected to the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In order to maintain the overwhelming power of the physical martial dao and to achieve a certain realm in the physical martial dao, Li Xuan had put a lot of thought into this.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he had only compiled the first two layers of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body, and the third layer was still not perfected, requiring further refinement.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was filled with excitement. Just from his master's description, he was already in awe of the might and dominance of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body. In a moment of thought, his golden body would be like the Great Sun, with stars orbiting, exuding an awe-inspiring aura. Each star would be a profound mystery, a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"I will teach you the first layer. You must remember it well..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to impart the first layer of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body to Meng Chong. This first layer technique was also incorporated into the diagrams of the laws of heaven and earth, to facilitate the comprehension of how to manipulate the laws of heaven and earth and cultivate the aperture stars.</p><p></p><p>While imparting the technique to Meng Chong, Li Xuan looked at the information provided by the Great Dao Scripture.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Star Indestructible Body (First Layer):</p><p>Technique Completion Degree: Medium-High</p><p>Realm Connection Degree: High</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: High</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High</p><p></p><p>He maintained the Technique Completion Degree at medium-high.</p><p>The Realm Connection Degree had also been significantly improved.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the first layer of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body twice, ensuring that Meng Chong could thoroughly remember and comprehend it without omitting a single detail.</p><p></p><p>Once Meng Chong had completely digested the first layer, Li Xuan began to teach him the second layer.</p><p></p><p>Great Sun Star Indestructible Body (Second Layer):</p><p>Technique Completion Degree: Medium-High</p><p>Realm Connection Degree: Medium-High</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: High</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High</p><p></p><p>The Realm Connection Degree between the first and second layers of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body had taken Li Xuan a lot of time to improve to the medium-high level.</p><p></p><p>But that was sufficient. As long as Meng Chong could comprehend the first layer of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body, he would naturally be able to comprehend the second layer as well. The medium-high Realm Connection Degree would only require him to spend a bit more time on the comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, Li Xuan explained the second layer twice and emphasized the key points in detail, allowing Meng Chong to thoroughly remember and digest it.</p><p></p><p>"I shall impart the second layer of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body to you. As for the third layer, I will teach it to you after you have comprehended the first layer, lest you be unable to remember it."</p><p></p><p>After imparting the second layer, Li Xuan waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Meng Chong respectfully bowed and took his leave, intending to find a place to settle down and carefully ponder and remember the technique, ensuring he did not miss anything.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Flying Boat of the Evergreen Pavilion had descended upon an open space outside the imperial capital of the Great Zhou. A small manor had suddenly appeared, with the pavilion of the Evergreen Pavilion particularly eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"The Evergreen Pavilion has arrived."</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Great Zhou, countless martial artists were waiting for the movements of the imperial house of the Great Zhou.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion had directly come to the outskirts of the capital. Not long ago, at the Small Star Lake, they had killed a powerful expert of the Great Zhou imperial house. Now they had descended upon the outskirts of the capital, which seemed to have a provocative meaning.</p><p></p><p>Although it was well known that the Evergreen Pavilion wandered in all directions, and perhaps this was just the next planned destination, but after the recent conflict at the Small Star Lake, their sudden arrival at the capital inevitably made people suspect whether they were deliberately coming to provoke.</p><p></p><p>This also led to the fact that although the Evergreen Pavilion had descended, no martial artists came to seek medical treatment, making it rather cold and quiet, as they were all waiting to see the attitude of the Great Zhou imperial house.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with the people in the Great Zhou capital? Are there no injured martial artists? Or are they not interested in the elixirs?" Stone Er said puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"They are all waiting for the Great Zhou imperial house to make a move, aren't they?" Meng Shushu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Ziyun, is there anything fun in the Great Zhou capital?" Suling Xiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"There should be, right?" Ziyun said, sounding a bit uncertain, and then continued, "I'm not familiar with those people in the imperial house, and I'm too lazy to curry favor with them. Most of the time, I'm just cultivating. However, my foster father has been very good to me. As for my royal brother, he went to the Cloud Sky City, but I don't know why my foster father sent him there."</p><p></p><p>"I see." Suling Xiu pondered for a moment and said, "Let's go to the capital tomorrow and take a look. After all, it's the only dynasty in the Spiritual Realm that is not under the control of the Spiritual Sect. I also want to see how prosperous the Great Zhou capital is."</p><p></p><p>"Miss, won't we run into trouble if we enter the Great Zhou capital?" Zhou Ying said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"What trouble could there be? I'm not afraid of trouble either. If the Xiang family of the Great Zhou wants to court death, then let them die. With my master here, there's nothing to worry about."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying thought about it and realized that she had a point. The Evergreen Pavilion was not afraid of trouble at all.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Great Zhou capital, the number one royal city in the Spiritual Realm. Since we've come, we should go take a look around."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Great Zhou capital and also had the idea of going to explore it.</p><p></p><p>"The Purple King of the Great Zhou, accompanied by his rebellious son, has come to apologize to the Elixir Immortal Miss!"</p><p></p><p>As Suling Xiu and the others were discussing going to the Great Zhou capital, a voice suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>"Purple King?" Suling Xiu was surprised. The Great Zhou imperial house was admitting defeat? The Purple King was coming to apologize?</p><p></p><p>"That Xiang Mingmao is the son of the Purple King," Ziyun said.</p><p></p><p>"I see." Suling Xiu nodded, and the formation opened a portal, "Come in."</p><p></p><p>The Purple King in a purple robe, with the young man Xiang Mingmao following him with his head lowered, walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Purple King!" Ziyun greeted with a salute.</p><p></p><p>As she was now a member of the Great Zhou imperial house, she naturally had to salute the Purple King, unlike Suling Xiu and the others who were indifferent.</p><p></p><p>The Purple King nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Miss Su!" The Purple King cupped his hands with an apologetic expression, "A while ago, my son was arrogant and offended Miss Su. Due to pressing matters, I did not have the chance to apologize to Miss Su in time. I hope you will not take offense.</p><p></p><p>"Today, hearing that Miss Su has come to the capital, I have brought my son to apologize to Miss Su!"</p><p></p><p>He then glared at Xiang Mingmao.</p><p></p><p>"A while ago, I was reckless and offended the Evergreen Pavilion, offended Miss Su. I apologize and beg for Miss Su's forgiveness!" Xiang Mingmao said, his heart full of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>However, this was the decision of the Great Zhou Emperor, and no matter how unwilling he was, he could only follow the order, or else he might even lose his position as the Crown Prince.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ziyun standing beside Suling Xiu, he was both jealous and resentful, but he hid it all in his heart, not daring to show it at all.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao was apologizing and begging for forgiveness while holding a box high above his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter, no need for the apology." Suling Xiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"A small token of apology, I hope Miss Su will not disdain it," the Purple King said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, thank you!" Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying stepped forward and took the box.</p><p></p><p>"My Great Zhou Majesty wishes to host a banquet to entertain Miss Su. I wonder if Miss Su would have the time to accept the invitation?" the Purple King asked again.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu directly shook her head, "No time, I don't like to attend banquets!"</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Zhou imperial house had a humble attitude, Suling Xiu still refused.</p><p></p><p>"Since that is the case, then we shall take our leave!" The Purple King nodded and left with Xiang Mingmao.</p><p></p><p>"The Purple King is so easy to talk to? I've heard he's quite tyrannical." Ziyun was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"He's only tyrannical towards the weak. When facing the strong, he naturally won't be so tyrannical," Meng Chong said as he walked over.</p><p></p><p>The Purple King was indeed strong. However, Meng Chong didn't really care, as with his current strength, he would not be weaker than the Purple King at all. If they really fought, the one who would be defeated would undoubtedly be the Purple King.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Ziyun led Meng Chong, Suling Xiu, Yue'er, and Cailingr to the capital. Stone Er, Meng Shushu, and Zhou Ying stayed on the flying boat, as they felt their strength was too weak and might become a burden if any unexpected events occurred.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was already strolling in the Great Zhou Palace, sighing in admiration: "No wonder it's comparable to the Spiritual Sect in its foundations, the strength is not bad. The strength of the Great Zhou Emperor is also quite strong."</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Great Zhou Emperor was indeed weaker than Xin Menglu and Wu Tian'nan, but from what Wu Tian'nan had said, it was stronger than the Thousand Martial Hall Master, the Thunder Cloud Manor Master, and the Imperial Spirit Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the openly displayed strength of the Great Zhou Emperor was about the same as the Thousand Martial Hall Master and the others. Truly worthy of being an emperor, they were all old foxes who liked to hide their true abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor did not conceal his own strength with cultivation techniques, but with a divine artifact he carried, which concealed his true strength.</p><p></p><p>In Yuzhou, the two elders of the Thousand Martial Hall had quietly arrived and directly found the King of Zheng, bringing the King of Zheng to the hall where the gate to the Spiritual Realm was opened.</p><p></p><p>"Opening the gate to the Spiritual Realm, this matter must not be leaked out. If even a hint is revealed, you will be killed without mercy!" the Thousand Martial Hall elder said sternly to the King of Zheng and the two guards guarding the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior of the Spiritual Sect!" The foreheads of the King of Zheng and the two guards were almost dripping with sweat.</p><p></p><p>These were the elders of the Supreme Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"You two, wait here for a moment!" The two guards hurriedly opened the gate to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Just open a crack is enough," one of the elders said.</p><p></p><p>They had to keep the disturbance small to avoid being detected by others. The two of them had thoroughly checked the surroundings to ensure there were no other martial artists present who might discover the opening of the gate to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's done, Senior," one of the guards said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." The Thousand Martial Hall elder walked through the hall towards the gate to the Spiritual Realm, full of excitement. But as soon as he stepped out, he froze.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spiritual Realm was gone? The place where the gate to the Spiritual Realm had been was now empty, nothing was there!</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spiritual Realm had disappeared?!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 541</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I have a plan to collect materials from the Unchanging Realm to forge a flying ship suitable for flying in the Unchanging Realm, with abilities like concealment, defense, and detection," Fang Hao said excitedly about his plan.</p><p></p><p>"Good, that's a great idea!" Canghai Turtle immediately expressed his approval. </p><p></p><p>After all, once the flying ship was forged, he wouldn't have to carry them anymore. They could just use the flying ship for transportation in the future.</p><p></p><p>"The Unchanging Realm lacks nothing, far beyond what the mortal realms can compare to. It has all kinds of rare and exotic things," Canghai Turtle excitedly explained to Fang Hao about the various rare materials hidden in the Unchanging Realm.</p><p></p><p>For the rest of the journey, Canghai Turtle actively looked for mountains along the way and places where treasures might exist, with the goal of helping Fang Hao collect all the materials needed to forge the flying ship as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A howl came from ahead. It was a group of Unchanging True Spirits, and they seemed to have detected the aura of the four people and one turtle, actually charging towards them.</p><p></p><p>"The aura on our bodies is very different from that of the Unchanging True Spirits. It's precisely because the difference is so great that some True Spirits will actively harass us, even treating us as some kind of delicious food," Canghai Turtle explained.</p><p></p><p>The group of charging True Spirits were not very powerful. Even the leader didn't have the strength of a Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>"In the Unchanging Realm, the weakest True Spirits are the most numerous, and these True Spirits are usually food for the powerful True Spirits," Canghai Turtle ignored the charging group of True Spirits, not dodging or avoiding them, but instead heading straight towards them.</p><p></p><p>"The flesh and souls of these True Spirits have been eroded by the Unchanging Qi. Be careful when eating them, don't let the Unchanging Qi contaminate your soul, otherwise it will be uncomfortable and take time to remove the Unchanging Qi," Canghai Turtle warned.</p><p></p><p>For those with strength above the Supreme Realm, even if they can't refine the Unchanging Qi, accidentally being contaminated by it won't make them muddleheaded. It will just affect them and they'll need to remove the Unchanging Qi. Of course, if suddenly eroded by a large amount of Unchanging Qi, even Supreme Realm martial artists can't avoid becoming muddleheaded, but such a situation is unlikely to happen.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan and the other three, the Unchanging Qi was no longer a threat at all. It could be integrated into their sword intent, and even used to cultivate certain divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if True Spirit meat tastes good," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"My big cauldron will come in handy," Fang Hao took out a large cauldron and placed it on the turtle's back.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brothers, you don't need to make a move. Let your junior brother handle this. I guarantee the True Spirits' bodies will be intact," Jiang Buping said with a smile as he stood up, forcefully throwing his Extreme Soul Divine Spear towards the group of True Spirits.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Extreme Soul intent instantly surged. In an instant, the charging True Spirits fell to the ground with a thud, their auras completely gone.</p><p></p><p>The True Spirits behind immediately let out frightened roars, stopping in their tracks before scattering and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle swallowed and looked at that long spear, secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>One throw of the spear, and its might instantly annihilated the souls and consciousness of the True Spirits. Incredibly frightening.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping waved his hand, and the soul spear returned. The dozen or so True Spirits whose souls and consciousness had been destroyed were also pulled over.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother's Extreme Soul martial arts have terrifying killing power!" Fang Hao exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong also nodded. In terms of soul-killing power, Jiang Buping was number one.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan's soul-attacking sword intent and divine abilities were not as sharp and extreme as Jiang Buping's, after all, the Extreme Soul martial way was the ultimate in soul killing.</p><p></p><p>It was the ultimate path of the soul.</p><p></p><p>"These True Spirits all have quite some use. Let's save a portion for senior sister, and we'll eat the rest," Fang Hao said with a smile, putting away two True Spirit bodies to give to Su Lingxiu when they return to the Great Wilderness in the future.</p><p></p><p>Then, Xu Yan raised his hand and pointed. In an instant, he gutted the True Spirits, cut them into pieces, and threw them all into Fang Hao's big cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Try my cooking skills. I'll use forging methods to brew up something delicious," Fang Hao said excitedly. Flames rose under the big cauldron as he started brewing. As for seasoning, he selected some spirit herbs to throw into the cauldron, and even took out a bottle of pills and poured them in too.</p><p></p><p>"These pills refined by junior sister taste excellent and are suitable for blending with True Spirit meat. They also enhance the fragrance!"</p><p></p><p>Soon, a fragrant aroma wafted out.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle swallowed and looked back at his shell. Steam was rising from the big cauldron, and a rich fragrance was drifting out.</p><p></p><p>"Here, old turtle, this True Spirit meat really tastes good!" Xu Yan waved his hand to take out a large piece of True Spirit meat from the cauldron and handed it to Canghai Turtle.</p><p></p><p>"This is the first time in my life I've eaten such delicious True Spirit meat!" Canghai Turtle exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>The four people and one turtle continued on their journey to find the Hongze Realm while feasting.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Realm was vast and chaotic. Walking in the Unchanging Realm, one didn't even know how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was no day or night in the Unchanging Realm. Looking around, everything was a chaotic mix. One could only judge the passage of time based on their own feelings.</p><p></p><p>In a certain mountain, Fang Hao was collecting materials. Xu Yan and the other two circled around this mountain, marveling at the strength of the True Spirit that had lived here when it was alive.</p><p></p><p>According to the experience passed on by Canghai Turtle, they could determine that this was a Realm Lord level True Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"The Unchanging Realm doesn't lack Realm Lord level powerful True Spirits," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Then, he asked somewhat puzzled: "Why are there only seven Realm Lords in the Seven Great Realms?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven of Taicang were very strong and had hunted many True Spirits, including some comparable to Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>But apart from the Seven of Taicang, including Tianhu, none had reached the Realm Lord level, even though they all had intelligence and cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord level True Spirits are not so common in the Unchanging Realm. This True Spirit was probably killed here by one of the Seven of Taicang. Although we have developed intelligence and cultivation methods, compared to these powerful True Spirits, we are actually still very young.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, we obtained the purple light of creation and opened small realms, which belongs to transforming our own living being characteristics. We need time to break through our shackles. What we lack is precisely time, not that we cannot break through to the Realm Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"When a realm is opened, everything needs time to grow. We are the same. Moreover, Realm Lord is a strength level defined after opening a realm. Even among Realm Lords, there can be quite large differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Those who have truly opened realms are the real Realm Lords. Their strength is considerably greater than True Spirits who are also at the Realm Lord level," Canghai Turtle sighed and explained.</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Canghai Turtle added: "Actually, before we developed intelligence, our strength seemed comparable to Realm Lord level True Spirits. But after developing intelligence, there were some changes. After all, we are not savage beasts without intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"To us, it feels like the moment we developed intelligence was when we were truly born, as if newborns."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Like infants, everything needs to grow. Perhaps this is the price that must be paid for the birth of wisdom."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in surprise: "So you're saying that after gaining wisdom, your strength actually weakened and needs to be enhanced through cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle shook its head and said: "Maybe, maybe not. I don't know for sure. After all, our memories from before gaining wisdom are very fuzzy. We can't know the specifics, it's just a feeling that we used to be very, very strong before. That's all.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, whether this is an illusion is also unknown. Perhaps Tai Cang would know, since some beings were already with Tai Cang before gaining wisdom. Only Tai Cang would know if there were changes in their strength before and after."</p><p></p><p>After exploring this great mountain, the four people and one turtle continued on their journey, moving further away from the Great Wilderness and deeper into the Unchanging Lands. The probability of encountering true spirits also increased.</p><p></p><p>Due to the distinct difference between the aura of the group and that of the Unchanging true spirits, they particularly attracted the attention of these true spirits. Therefore, every encounter with true spirits inevitably led to a hunt.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his three companions took advantage of this to hone their martial arts and practice their divine abilities. </p><p></p><p>There was even one time when they encountered a group of true spirits led by several Realm Lord level true spirits. They could only engage in a running battle before shaking off the group and fleeing.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, how far are we from the Hongze World?" Meng Chong asked, gazing at the vast expanse of chaos and scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"We're almost at where the Hongze World used to be," the Ancient Sea Turtle said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Xu Yan and his three companions noticed that the Unchanging Lands ahead seemed to be darker, and the spiritual energy more violent.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle slowed down, let out a breath to suppress the fear rising in its heart, and said gravely: "The Hongze World was originally right there!"</p><p></p><p>Looking around now, forget about a huge world, there wasn't even a small hill to be seen. Clearly, the Hongze World had shifted away from this location.</p><p></p><p>"Let's continue forward. We should be able to find the Hongze World. There's some regularity to the direction of world drift. By my calculations, the Hongze World should continue along the direction it was originally drifting."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle increased its speed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his three companions had looks of anticipation on their faces. They were about to see one of the Seven Great Worlds, the Hongze World. Although it was a dead world, it was still a complete world.</p><p></p><p>Even a dead world is a supreme treasure. For them, at the World Realm level, it held very important significance for comprehension. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps they could gain some insights from this dead world, or even be inspired to quickly break through in strength.</p><p></p><p>Another day later, as far as the eye could see, there was still only vast chaos, with no sign of the world.</p><p></p><p>Even the Ancient Sea Turtle was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't right. The Hongze World is already dead and has lost control. Its drifting speed shouldn't be fast."</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that the Hongze World was taken away by the Unchanging Divine Palace?" Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"That's unlikely," the Ancient Sea Turtle shook its head. "The Unchanging Divine Palace has no interest in dead worlds. They don't care about them."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, it said: "Perhaps something unexpected happened that caused the Hongze World to drift faster, or it deviated from its original direction."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle looked in all directions and slightly adjusted its course. "By my calculations, even if the Hongze World has deviated, it shouldn't be by too much. It's just a matter of spending a bit more time searching."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. They had entered the Unchanging Lands for exploration and tempering. Finding the Hongze World was not their only purpose.</p><p></p><p>The four people and one turtle continued searching for the Hongze World. Another day passed.</p><p></p><p>"That mountain doesn't look right. There seems to be a fire burning inside it," Xu Yan suddenly said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the other two also looked in that direction. In the far distance to the left front, a huge mountain stood, as if some beast was crouching there.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the scale of the mountain, it was clearly a true spirit comparable to a World Lord level, and a powerful one at that level.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!" The Ancient Sea Turtle immediately headed towards that mountain. As they got closer, Xu Yan was increasingly surprised. Under his Small Heavenly Eye, he saw what looked like a sunset-like glow inside the mountain, and the closer they got, the more he felt a sense of scorching heat.</p><p></p><p>"How can it be hot here? Could this true spirit have fire abilities, and even after death, the power source in its body hasn't completely dissipated?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle looked puzzled. "But judging from this mountain, this true spirit died a long time ago, and it seems to have been killed. How could there still be remnants of its power source?"</p><p></p><p>"We'll know once we go in and explore," Xu Yan said, his form flickering as he instantly descended onto the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the other two followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"There seems to be some kind of flame inside the mountain. It should be a treasure. This fire might be helpful for forging. Let's see what kind of treasure it is," Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"This scorching feeling is somewhat familiar to me," the Ancient Sea Turtle said, its eyes filled with uncertainty.</p><p></p><p>"Have you encountered it before?" Fang Hao raised an eyebrow and asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I've encountered it before, but this fire's aura..." The Ancient Sea Turtle found an entrance into the mountain's interior and hurriedly entered, wanting to confirm its guess.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, tell us, what's special about this fire's aura?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Entering the mountain's interior, they saw a glow like a red sunset, and the scorching aura became even more intense.</p><p></p><p>As they went deeper, the walls of the passage around them were incredibly smooth, as if they had been burned by fire.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A terrifying wave of heat surged towards them. Even though the four were not weak in strength, they still felt a sense of being scorched.</p><p></p><p>The interior of the huge mountain was a massive cave, with walls as smooth as porcelain, illuminated by a sunset-like glow.</p><p></p><p>The sunset-like glow and scorching air came from a foot-long bone in the center of the cave. Judging from its shape, it seemed to be a finger bone! The red finger bone was stuck in the center of the cave. There were no visible flames, yet it emitted a scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>The cave inside this huge mountain seemed to have been burned out by this finger bone.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked back at the entrance and judged from its position that it seemed to be at the mouth of the fallen true spirit.</p><p></p><p>The finger bone had either shot into the true spirit's mouth or had been bitten off and swallowed by the true spirit.</p><p></p><p>But the powerful fire force contained in the finger bone directly incinerated the true spirit's internal organs, which was also the cause of the true spirit's demise.</p><p></p><p>A broken finger had actually killed a World Lord level true spirit. The owner of this finger must have been terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his three senior and junior brothers exchanged glances, all coming to the same guess in their hearts. They couldn't help but be shocked at what kind of fierce battle must have taken place here.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that the battle didn't happen here, but that this true spirit had been severely injured, fled from the battlefield, and finally collapsed here!

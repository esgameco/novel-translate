        <h1>Chapter 446</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Apart from his disciples, only a few people possessed the life-saving jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>And these few people all had relatively close relationships and some connections with him.</p><p></p><p>Since giving out the life-saving jade talismans until now, no one had fallen into crisis and activated the talisman. This was the first time.</p><p></p><p>"It's not Xu Yan, nor Meng Chong, and not Jiang Buping either."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat surprised. His three disciples were all adventuring in the Divine Realm, facing powerful forces, and were more likely to encounter danger.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the first to trigger the life-saving jade talisman was actually not a disciple.</p><p></p><p>But rather, Du Yuying!</p><p></p><p>"She's the future daughter-in-law disciple. What crisis could she have encountered? She's a disciple of the Tai Miao Divine Sect, and Tai Miao Divine Sect is located in the Tai Miao Realm, controlling an entire realm, one of the great realms of the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit astonished.</p><p></p><p>Looking up towards the direction where the life-saving jade talisman was activated, his Heavenly Dao Eye perceived his own power emanating from the activated talisman.</p><p></p><p>With a slight gesture of his hand, he manipulated the Heavenly Dao rules for a moment. Instantly, a force of Heavenly Dao rules descended, empowering the talisman's power, raising it to the level of the Heavenly Realm in an instant.</p><p></p><p>With his understanding of the Cang Heavenly Realm and his mastery of the Heavenly Dao rules, even across vast distances, he could easily mobilize the power of the Heavenly Dao rules to empower it.</p><p></p><p>After all, that was his talisman, containing his power, and it was in the Divine Realm. With his current strength, mobilizing the Heavenly Dao rules to empower it was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"Even if surrounded and attacked by a group of Immortal Venerable, it could easily kill them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>The power of the talisman began to recede, returning to Du Yuying's body, apparently having resolved the crisis.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Divine Realm, an unkempt old man was lying on a large rock.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he jumped up.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, his brows furrowed tightly, with a look of surprise and uncertainty on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Who is mobilizing the power of Heaven and Earth? Who has such ability?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Who has secretly come to the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed tightly as familiar figures flashed through his mind, but none of them were related to the mobilization of the power of Heaven and Earth just now.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. To mobilize the power of Heaven and Earth so stealthily, unless it was me, others probably couldn't detect it. And those who could do this can be counted on one hand, but they..."</p><p></p><p>The old man frowned in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that someone survived?"</p><p></p><p>He was utterly perplexed, but those who could do this and prevent him from tracing the source of the mobilized power of Heaven and Earth were only a handful of people, and no one else.</p><p></p><p>And those few people had disappeared for a very, very long time.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be him?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if remembering something, he shook his head again: "Impossible. If it were him, he definitely wouldn't be so low-key, and he couldn't get out anyway."</p><p></p><p>Unable to figure it out, the old man's expression became somewhat solemn. An unknown existence was hidden in the world, and it was unclear whether it was good or bad.</p><p></p><p>"Those two bastards Tian Sha and Di Ying are quite capable of stirring up trouble. Let's see what they can stir up, hopefully they don't end up harming themselves."</p><p></p><p>Then, thinking of something, he sneered.</p><p></p><p>Lying back on the rock, "Forget it, if the sky is going to fall, then let it fall. Better not to worry about it."</p><p></p><p>Exhaling, he continued to sleep soundly.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, Tai Miao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Great-grandmother, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying supported Xin Mengrou, whose face was pale and who was badly injured.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, I'm fine."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou took a deep breath, looking towards where the enemies had disappeared, her heart once again filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"Great-grandmother, what should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Although at the critical moment, she had activated the life-saving talisman given by the senior, easily killing the enemies, the subsequent troubles would definitely not be small.</p><p></p><p>Among the enemies, one was an elder of the Tai Miao Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Return to the sect. If anyone asks, just say we were saved by a mysterious senior. Don't mention your life-saving talisman."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou said, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>What had just happened was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>That figure was like the supreme being of Heaven and Earth. With a wave of his hand, the might of Heaven and Earth was in his grasp. Immortal Venerables were like ants, wiped out with a wave of his hand, turned to ashes without leaving a trace.</p><p></p><p>Even top Immortal Venerables were the same.</p><p></p><p>"Great-grandmother, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying nodded.</p><p></p><p>But there was still worry in her eyes. The internal strife of the Tai Miao Sect had gradually become apparent.</p><p></p><p>And great-grandmother cultivated the Tai Miao Dream Fantasy Dao, and had even developed some of her own insights and understanding from this Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was all thanks to the senior's guidance back then.</p><p></p><p>As a result, this matter had leaked out, and the powerful figures from another faction within the Tai Miao Sect intended to suppress the Tai Miao Dream Fantasy Dao, which led to this attack.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for her wanting to go down the mountain this time to inquire about news of Xu Yan, accompanying her great-grandmother out, her great-grandmother would likely have been assassinated.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, a bunch of old bitches, afraid that I'll become the master of the Tai Miao Dream Fantasy Dao. Just you wait!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou sneered.</p><p></p><p>Having survived this great danger, it also destined her rise.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was about to turn dreams into reality, to make the illusory real. Once she broke through, she would have an overwhelming advantage within the same realm.</p><p></p><p>And besides her, Yun Miaomiao was also cultivating the Tai Miao Dream Fantasy Dao, though it was another kind of dream fantasy dao. If she could truly succeed, her strength would also be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Great-grandmother, should we find an opportunity to pay our respects to the senior?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying asked expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou looked at her, her face full of helplessness: "That kid Xu Yan isn't by the senior's side, you won't be able to see him if you go."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's jade face turned red, "Great-grandmother, what are you saying? I meant that you could go seek guidance from the senior, you would definitely be able to break through faster."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I know what you and Miaomiao are thinking. You two, ah, your strength is too weak. If you don't work hard to cultivate, you'll only hold Xu Yan back.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, no matter how you cultivate, you're destined to hold Xu Yan back. That kid is simply terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's fame had already spread throughout the Divine Realm. He had single-handedly killed many Immortal Venerables and was now fighting against the powerful force of Tian Sha and Di Ying.</p><p></p><p>There was also Meng Chong, who was also incredibly fierce. Despite being wanted and pursued by the Myriad Treasures Alliance, he was still carefree and even occasionally raided branches of the Myriad Treasures Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Worthy of being the senior's disciples, they were all unbelievably strong.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is likely to see major changes. You should improve your strength as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou and Du Yuying concealed their auras and hurried back to the Tai Miao Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>Half an hour after they left, a figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer wore a green long dress, her figure as if from a dream. After investigating the surroundings, she revealed a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Not a single survivor!"</p><p></p><p>Three Immortal Venerables, one of whom was even a top Immortal Venerable, had all failed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they had been killed in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who is secretly protecting Xin Mengruo? Someone above the Immortal realm? Could it be that Xin Mengruo's Dream Path has already attracted attention?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in the green dress muttered to herself, full of doubt.</p><p></p><p>Her figure moved and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In a secret location within Taimiao Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Failed?"</p><p></p><p>The person sitting with their back to the green-dressed woman looked as if they weren't real, like a shadow. But this shadow gave off a sense of reality.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they all died," the green-dressed woman nodded.</p><p></p><p>"News of the assassination attempt on Xin Mengruo will spread quickly, and one of them was even a sect elder. </p><p></p><p>"Take this opportunity to clean up the Ground Shadows within the sect. Their reach has grown too long.</p><p></p><p>"Since Xin Mengruo escaped this calamity, her rise is now inevitable. Hand over the mastermind behind this to those elders of Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The two great techniques of Taimiao come from the same source. Whoever attacks each other again will face the consequences."</p><p></p><p>The green-dressed woman nodded, "Yes, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Then she asked with confusion: "If you knew someone wanted to kill Xin Mengruo, why didn't you actively intervene to save her?"</p><p></p><p>"Every supreme expert of Taimiao has their own destiny. If their destiny is insufficient and they perish because of this, then naturally they cannot become a supreme expert. This is a test.</p><p></p><p>"Whether the one who saved Xin Mengruo was a powerful figure who had long been watching her, or someone else, it means she has enough destiny to become a supreme expert."</p><p></p><p>The green-dressed woman didn't quite understand why there needed to be such a test. If someone died, wouldn't the sect lose a genius? But she didn't continue asking and left with a bow.</p><p></p><p>As the green-dressed woman departed, the shadow-like figure trembled slightly, and a muttering voice arose.</p><p></p><p>"Who was that? It was just a token, yet it possessed such terrifying power. What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>The figure thought of that silhouette in their mind.</p><p></p><p>Like a supreme being of heaven and earth. Even though her technique was powerful and well-hidden, that silhouette still discovered her.</p><p></p><p>If she had even a hint of malice, she would have been killed with one palm strike!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of background does Xin Mengruo's descendant have, to have such a terrifying existence protecting her?"</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Taimiao Realm was thrown into turmoil, erupting in a great battle to eliminate traitors.</p><p></p><p>As one of the great realms of the Divine Domain, the strength of the Taimiao Realm was undoubtedly extremely powerful. As the experts made their move, in a short time, Immortal Venerable experts fell, slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time Taimiao Divine Sect used a supreme treasure, directly killing a top Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>They even spread the news: Taimiao Divine Sect was purging spies from the Heaven Killers and Ground Shadows! If even Taimiao Divine Sect had been so deeply infiltrated by the Heaven Killers and Ground Shadows, the other great realm forces didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the Divine Domain became even more turbulent, with unrest beginning to appear in the great realms. The chaotic situation grew increasingly messy.</p><p></p><p>And the Heaven Killers and Ground Shadows were also stirring up trouble everywhere, igniting fires of war in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Ground Cloud Realm.</p><p></p><p>It got its name because clouds and mist often lingered on the ground without dispersing.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Ground Cloud Realm, where the clouds and mist were thick, a huge celestial cave appeared and disappeared within the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Four men wearing Heaven Killer masks sat in the four directions of the celestial cave, continuously pouring powerful energy into a pillar in front of them.</p><p></p><p>The pillar was surrounded by the rhythm of the Dao, inserted into the edge of the celestial cave. As the energy from the four masked men poured in, the pillar rippled with waves, slowly expanding the mouth of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>A figure suddenly arrived.</p><p></p><p>"How long will it take to complete?" Heaven Seventeen asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the matters here. When the time is right, we will naturally inform you!" one of the men said sternly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, there was a tremor beneath the celestial cave, and a pink figure flickered in and out of view.</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>One of them said helplessly: "It's Charming Witch's avatar. She insists on entering the Divine Domain from here, saying she wants to find someone called Xu Yan to seek revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen was surprised. How did Xu Yan offend Charming Witch?</p><p></p><p>"You four useless fools, after all this time, you've only expanded the celestial cave a tiny bit?" Charming Witch's angry voice came through.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Charming Witch, we've already done our best. Please bear with us a little longer. If you come in from here now, it will only ruin the grand plan."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, then bring Xu Yan here, otherwise I can't wait any longer."</p><p></p><p>"How could Xu Yan possibly come here? Besides, this place can't be exposed."</p><p></p><p>The four Heaven Killer masked men frowned, continuously trying to persuade her.</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen had an idea and said in a deep voice: "Senior Charming Witch, Xu Yan can't come here, but we can have him go to another celestial cave!"</p><p></p><p>Charming Witch said coldly: "Ordinary celestial caves are limited to the Immortal realm. How can mere Immortal realm power deal with Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen pondered for a while, then spoke: "I've heard that Senior Charming Witch has a secret technique that can cultivate a kind of treasure that can make living beings lose their way. I have a plan, and to ensure its success, I'd like to request one of these treasures from you.</p><p></p><p>"In exchange, I know of a celestial cave that can accommodate beings above the Immortal realm, even those in the Heaven Unity realm. I'll find a way to lure Xu Yan there. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>Charming Witch was tempted. "Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, how dare I deceive you? It's just that luring Xu Yan will require some things..."</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen hinted.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about that. You just need to lure Xu Yan there. As for the treasure you want, I can give it to you. Come back here in three days.</p><p></p><p>"Also, if you dare to deceive me, this old lady will go straight to that bastard Heaven Killer to settle accounts!"</p><p></p><p>With that, Charming Witch's pink figure disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen clicked his tongue. From what he knew of Charming Witch, this powerful witch demon, she had always been smiling, with a soft and seductive voice, enchanting all living beings.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was referring to herself as "this old lady" - it was clear that Xu Yan had angered her greatly.</p><p></p><p>"What did this Xu Yan do to make Charming Witch lose her composure like this?"</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen was very puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, it was fortunate, as he could obtain that treasure from Charming Witch. With it, the next plan could be carried out with absolute certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Seventeen, who is this Xu Yan?" one of the Heaven Killer masked men asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"A prodigy, with powerful backers."</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen didn't want to say more and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>The celestial cave in this part of the Ground Cloud Realm continued to expand slowly, while the aura inside the cave was suppressed, not leaking out.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, I must capture you!" </p><p></p><p>Charming Witch was filled with resentment.</p><p></p><p>That sword in her body seemed weak, but it was very tricky and strange. It seemed to have intelligence, or as if someone was controlling it.</p><p></p><p>No matter what methods she tried, she couldn't erase it or expel it from her body.</p><p></p><p>Although this sword couldn't pose a major threat to her for now, having a sword inside one's body would make anyone uneasy. It had to be removed for peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>Especially if she were to fight an enemy, if this sword suddenly started moving erratically, it would inevitably affect her power, putting her in a dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>The only solution now was to capture Xu Yan and use him as leverage to force his master to remove this sword from her body.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

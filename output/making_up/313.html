        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Caili'er, who was serving tea to Li Xuan, stood by in shock as she suddenly condensed a wisp of the power of the laws of heaven and earth. This was the power of the laws of heaven and earth! She looked at Yue Changming with admiration. To encounter a superior person must mean there is an opportunity. Was her own opportunity too thin? But she could only admire, not dare to seek it for herself! Li Xuan was in a good mood, picked up the teacup and took a sip, only then remembering that he had not yet bestowed an opportunity on Caili'er.</p><p></p><p>As a superior person, in such a good mood, how could he overlook granting an opportunity? Moreover, Caili'er had been diligently serving him recently.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a wisp of the power of the laws of heaven and earth appeared. Looking at Caili'er, he shook his head and said, "You are still too weak."</p><p></p><p>With that, he loosened his grip, and the power of the laws of heaven and earth became extremely weak. He then handed it to Caili'er.</p><p></p><p>This tiny wisp of the power of the laws of heaven and earth was all that Caili'er could bear, otherwise, at her level where she had not yet condensed the aura of the laws of heaven and earth, she would be unable to withstand that strand of lawful power.</p><p></p><p>Caili'er was extremely excited, bowing and saying, "Thank you, senior, for bestowing the law!" </p><p></p><p>She was disappointed in her heart, thinking that she was too weak and could not even bear the great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, ponder it well," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Caili'er absorbed that wisp of lawful power into her spirit, immediately feeling a stinging sensation, her vision blurring, her spirit almost unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly found a place to sit cross-legged, and took out the spirit-nourishing elixir she had obtained from Su Lingxiu, only then beginning to ponder and refine that strand of lawful power.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a good mood, even wanting to hum a little tune, but in order to maintain his image as a superior person, he held it back and did not let it out.</p><p></p><p>"Who else is coming to see me, this superior person? To encounter a superior person, one must have deep blessings!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was in a good mood, if someone came to see him, there would surely be an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>As for those seeking medical treatment, they did not count! Fang Hao suddenly walked over and said, "Master, there is someone who wants to come and pay their respects to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled, who would come to pay their respects to him? In the Spirit Realm, he had no acquaintances, and even in the inner domain, as a superior person, not just anyone could come and pay their respects.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng? He first thought of Xie Tianheng, who had entered the Spirit Realm, but immediately denied it, as Xie Tianheng was his disciple of the Sword Dao sect, and if he came, he would just come directly to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Who wants to pay their respects to the master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked calmly while sipping his tea.</p><p></p><p>"Yu Gao has relayed a message, saying that someone claiming to be Wu Tiannan, the Dean of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, guided by the senior disciple, has found the Yuzhou Alliance and wants to come and pay their respects to the master."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao raised the transmission talisman in his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>The Dean of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy? Since he was guided by the senior disciple, then let him come. Coincidentally, I have just broken through, and I am in a good mood. The other party also seems to be a person of good fortune.</p><p></p><p>At this time, to come and pay their respects to me, it must mean there is a blessing.</p><p></p><p>"Then let him come."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll relay the message to Yu Gao and let him inform the other party."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded and left to refine the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"The Dean of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, and Yue Changming was once the Wanxing Genius, so they are old acquaintances, aren't they?"</p><p></p><p>The Wanxing Martial Arts Academy has been shattered, yet the other party is still alive, which shows that his strength is not weak.</p><p></p><p>When Wu Tiannan learned of where Master Xu'an was, the Longqing Pavilion in Luozhou, he was greatly surprised. The widely circulated Elixir Immortal Miss, could it be Master Xu'an? </p><p></p><p>To be able to restore the foundation of a martial artist, such a skill is truly divine. He hurriedly went to the Longqing Pavilion, but the journey was long and would take some time.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" </p><p></p><p>In the Longqing Pavilion, Li Xuan asked Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"The junior has almost completely refined this wisp of the power of the laws of heaven and earth, but it will still take some time to thoroughly refine it," Yue Changming respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Your ability to control this wisp of the power of the laws of heaven and earth in such a short time is also considered a good talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After all, Yue Changming was a spirit body, and although he had been shattered and collapsed, he had recovered, with a kind of rebirth from the ashes.</p><p></p><p>The talent of a spirit body, truly extraordinary, the affinity with the laws of heaven and earth is far higher than ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Caili'er's talent was naturally not weak, possessing the royal bloodline of the Sea Spirit Clan, but she had not yet activated it, and her realm and strength were not as good as Yue Changming, so refining that wisp of the power of the laws of heaven and earth required more time for her.</p><p></p><p>"It is all thanks to the opportunity bestowed by the senior that I could achieve this."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"The Dean of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, Wu Tiannan, will be coming to pay his respects soon. He is considered an old acquaintance of yours, so you will be responsible for receiving him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was stunned, "The Dean is still alive?"</p><p></p><p>"Do you think he is dead?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming spoke in a deep voice, "Back then, when there was a traitor in the academy, it was rumored that the Dean was struck by a deadly poison, and then ambushed and attacked by the former Pavilion Master of the Qianwu Pavilion, sustaining heavy injuries, and after that, there was no news of him, and it was rumored that he had perished."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan inwardly marveled, this Wu Tiannan is not simple, he actually didn't die, and has now returned, and can even come to pay his respects to me, which shows that his fortune is not bad.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming curiously asked, "Does the senior know the Dean?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I don't know him!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head and said, "Xu'an guided him to come and pay his respects to me, and since I have nothing to do these days, I'll just meet him."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming suddenly understood, the senior is a being that transcends heaven and earth, how could he possibly know the Dean? He had overestimated the Dean.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Longqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan finally arrived at the Longqing Pavilion, looking at the martial artists lining up to enter the Longqing Pavilion for treatment, all of whom were severely injured, or had their foundations damaged, or had unhealed old wounds.</p><p></p><p>After all, the treatment fees of the Longqing Pavilion were not cheap, and there was no need to come for just a minor injury.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath and stepped towards the Longqing Pavilion. He was a little nervous, what kind of powerful figure was Xu'an's master? Transcending heaven and earth? </p><p></p><p>He couldn't even imagine it! "Impossible, absolutely impossible, I've never heard of anyone transcending heaven and earth in this world."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan kept telling himself this.</p><p></p><p>However, in his heart, there was also a glimmer of hope, hoping that what Xu'an said was true. If so, his trip this time would surely be fruitful.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan seeks an audience... with the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath and addressed the other party as "senior".</p><p></p><p>"Come in."</p><p></p><p>A calm voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan stepped into the Longqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Dean, is it really you!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an excited voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan looked up, surprised, "You are... Yue Changming?"</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he exclaimed in astonishment, recognizing the figure in front of him as the former genius of the Wanxing Academy, Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" </p><p></p><p>Yue Changming had tears of joy in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You've actually... reached this level." </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He immediately felt that it was only natural. "As expected, you are the top genius of our Martial Arts Academy. Your spiritual body is indeed extraordinary. After such a long time of cultivation, reaching this level is not surprising at all!"</p><p></p><p>However, Yue Changming felt ashamed. "The Dean does not know, Changming has been barely scraping by all this time. It is only in recent days that I was granted an opportunity by an elder, which led to this achievement."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was greatly shocked upon hearing this. His gaze briefly swept over Yue Changming and landed on the young man sitting leisurely on a chair in the courtyard, reading a book.</p><p></p><p>The moment he laid eyes on him, he was immediately overwhelmed with a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>Mysterious, majestic, as if sitting amidst the ages, yet also seeming to be beyond the heavens and earth - the more he looked, the more profound and unfathomable the young man appeared.</p><p></p><p>A supreme expert!</p><p>An unparalleled supreme expert!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly began to believe what Xu Yan had said - his master was a being that had transcended the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Forgetting about catching up with Yue Changming, he approached Li Xuan and respectfully paid his respects. "I am Wu Tiannan, paying my respects to the esteemed elder!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, have a seat, no need to be so formal," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, esteemed elder!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan carefully sat down on the chair, only occupying half of it, his manner somewhat constrained, not daring to look directly at the supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan withdrew his aura of mystery, and at that moment, he appeared quite ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Sighing inwardly, he thought, "This aura of mystery is truly useful!" Yue Changming came over and poured Wu Tiannan a cup of spiritual tea, then began to catch up with Wu Tiannan, inquiring about the academy's experiences over the past years.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan also gradually recounted some of the past events and his experiences in recent years, gradually easing his constrained mindset, while also taking the opportunity to inform the supreme expert of his own experiences.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan, you have some remarkable abilities!" </p><p></p><p>The moment Wu Tiannan entered, Li Xuan had already discerned his cultivation level. The fact that the Myriad Stars Alliance could stand firm and not be crushed by the Transcendent Spirit Sect was likely greatly due to Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Even though Yue Changming had refined that strand of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles, he would not be a match for Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Within Wu Tiannan's body, he had refined nine strands of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles. If it were just that, the Heavenly and Earthly Principles power he had condensed with those nine strands would only be equivalent to the single strand that Yue Changming had refined.</p><p></p><p>However, each of Wu Tiannan's nine strands of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles contained hidden Principles power. Although the Principles power within a single strand was weaker than the one Li Xuan had granted to Yue Changming, Wu Tiannan possessed nine strands of Principles power.</p><p></p><p>"He's quite good at concealing it," Li Xuan mused inwardly. Wu Tiannan was also a crafty old fox.</p><p></p><p>By hiding the Principles power without revealing it, it was likely that he had suffered a major setback in the past, and thus tried to conceal his true strength as much as possible to prevent his enemies from underestimating him.</p><p></p><p>"He has reached the peak of the Spiritual Realm!" Li Xuan sighed. Wu Tiannan's cultivation had already reached the limit of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The next realm would be to have all nine strands of the Principles power fully refined and fused into a single Heavenly and Earthly Principles. </p><p></p><p>Clearly, this could not be achieved within the Spiritual Realm. The reason being that the Spiritual Realm's Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms were insufficient to support the warrior's true comprehension and refinement of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was also describing his experiences - after the collapse of the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, the remaining forces retreated to the distant Azure Sea, and ultimately established a new martial arts academy in the Azure Sky Azure Sea City.</p><p></p><p>The city lord of Azure Sky Azure Sea City had a good relationship with Wu Tiannan, and although the city belonged to the Transcendent Spirit Sect, since it only governed the Azure Sea and coexisted with the Azure Spirit Tribe, it did not have the strict hierarchical system of the Eighteen Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>"My current cultivation has reached the limit of the Spiritual Realm, refining the Spiritual Body and condensing the Spiritual Soul. After condensing the Spiritual Soul, the next step would be to refine the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms into the Spiritual Soul..."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan began to explain his martial dao insights, seemingly for Yue Changming's benefit, but in reality, he was taking the opportunity to express his own doubts about his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After refining the Spiritual Body, the next step in cultivation is to refine the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms into the Spiritual Soul. Typically, refining nine strands of the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms would be the limit, and then to fuse those nine strands into a single Heavenly and Earthly Principles Qi.</p><p></p><p>After condensing the nine strands of Heavenly and Earthly Principles Qi, the next step would be to condense the Heavenly and Earthly Principles power. However, usually, once one has condensed the nine strands of Heavenly and Earthly Principles Qi, that would be the peak, as it would be difficult to break through further, because the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms would be insufficient to support the condensation of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles power.</p><p></p><p>"In the ruins I encountered in the Azure Sea region, I was able to sense more active Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms, and thus after condensing the nine strands of Heavenly and Earthly Principles Qi, I was able to condense nine strands of Heavenly and Earthly Principles, which I have hidden within the Heavenly and Earthly Principles Qi.</p><p></p><p>"But I am unable to fuse them into one, and it is no longer sufficient to support me in continuing to advance," Wu Tiannan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming also sighed deeply, understanding that each stage of cultivation was extremely arduous, requiring not only the refinement techniques, but also sufficient innate talent.</p><p></p><p>The power of a spiritual body genius lies in their ability to closely connect with the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Qi and Spiritual Mechanisms, making it easier for them to comprehend and condense the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanisms, and to comprehend the Heavenly and Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming also realized that the purpose of Wu Tiannan's visit to seek out the esteemed elder was to find a path forward.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Dean is unable to break through further, let alone other warriors," Yue Changming sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The secrets of the Transcendent Spirit Sect must have a path related to the Divine Bridge. Likely, the breakthrough lies there," Wu Tiannan then shared what he knew about the secrets, such as the existence of the Divine Bridge, and that ascending the Divine Bridge may hold the key to a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>However, the specific secrets of the Divine Bridge, he did not know, as this was the core hidden knowledge of the Transcendent Spirit Sect. Even though he had a good relationship with the Azure Sky Azure Sea City Lord, the other party was unwilling to discuss this secret.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge? A passage to another realm of the Great Empyrean?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Both the Inner Realm and the Spiritual Realm belonged to the Great Empyrean, but the Great Empyrean clearly had more than just these two realms.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there these separated domains within the Great Empyrean? There must be some hidden secrets here," Li Xuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these secrets did not hold much allure for him, as the martial dao he had created was his own, not bound by the limitations of the Great Empyrean's Spiritual Mechanisms.</p><p></p><p>"The Genius Confrontation must be related to this. I forced the Thousand Weapons Palace, the Thunder Cloud Mountain Villa, and the Imperial Spirit Manor to accept the rules, and I await the opening of the Divine Bridge to ascend it.</p><p></p><p>"One, it is to break through my own limits; two, it is also to search for someone."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was startled, and asked, "Dean, who are you searching for?"</p><p></p><p>"My martial dao guide."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's expression was filled with nostalgia as he said, "I, Wu Tiannan, have come from the barren villages of the Inner Realm, step by step ascending to the peak of the Spiritual Realm. All of this is because of the guidance of my elder sister."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback, "Wu Tiannan is from the Inner Realm? The Patriarch of the Seven Star Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"Dean, you are from the Inner Realm?" Yue Changming was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Wu Tiannan nodded, then began to recount his experiences growing up in the Inner Realm and his rise.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had been quietly listening the entire time, but now she couldn't help but come over and sit down next to Li Xuan, staring at Wu Tiannan with wide eyes, looking him up and down.</p><p></p><p>A fellow Inner Realm native!</p><p>And furthermore, the founding Patriarch of the Seven Star Academy, a legendary figure!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

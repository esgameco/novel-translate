        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping did not know how long or how far he had walked, until his consciousness became muddled and a sense of fatigue overcame him. He then leaned against a large tree and collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The powerful spiritual force still permeated his body, healing the grievous wounds on his physical form, preventing it from completely collapsing.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness had become unclear, entering a state akin to deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he felt as if his body was floating, as if he heard voices, but in his subconscious, these were merely hallucinations of his disoriented mind.</p><p></p><p>On the Changqing Pavilion's flying ship, everyone's attention was focused on Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also surprised. This person's spiritual force was stronger than his physical body, maintaining it with the power of his spirit alone.</p><p></p><p>This alone would not have surprised Li Xuan. What truly shocked him was that a trace of the Untempered Qi had attached itself to this person's spiritual force! Even a mere trace of the Untempered Qi would be a great calamity for a martial artist, causing a loss of clarity and intelligence, rendering them muddled and confused.</p><p></p><p>Yet this young man, around the same age as Xu Yan and the others, had not lost his clarity of mind, nor had he become muddled and confused. He was merely listless, as if perpetually drowsy and lacking in spirit.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from his grievous wounds, he had just experienced a great battle, his injuries extremely severe, yet he was able to maintain his consciousness through the sheer power of his spirit.</p><p></p><p>"His spiritual force surpasses his physical body, surpasses his cultivation level, and is tainted by the Untempered Qi, yet he can still maintain his consciousness - he is a prodigy indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"His spiritual force also seems to be somewhat special, as if it was not cultivated, but innate. His cultivation has merely served to strengthen it further."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Li Xuan felt that his Fifth Martial Dao could find its direction.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was busy treating Jiang Buping, her jade-like face revealing a look of astonishment. "His injuries are so severe, his physical body nearly collapsing, yet he is maintaining it through the power of his spirit."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I sense something unusual about his spiritual force."</p><p></p><p>Treating the physical injuries was easy for Su Lingxiu, but the unusual nature of his spiritual force was not so easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Do not let your spiritual force touch his, lest you become tainted by the Untempered Qi," Li Xuan reminded.</p><p></p><p>"The Untempered Qi!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were also stunned. Jiang Buping's spiritual force was tainted by the Untempered Qi? Cheng Zhan stared at Jiang Buping for a long while, vaguely recalling a person, with a somewhat disbelieving expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Untempered Qi? Is that the aura from the Untempered Celestial Abyss?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan shook his head. "I've only heard of it in passing. It is said that in the Divine Realm, there is an extremely powerful Celestial Abyss known as the Untempered Celestial Abyss, and the aura within is called the Untempered Qi. The specifics, I am not too familiar with, as the Qinghua Realm and the neighboring Jiushan Realm do not have the Untempered Celestial Abyss."</p><p></p><p>The others nodded in understanding and did not ask further, instead gathering around Jiang Buping in awe.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's physical injuries were not too serious and were quickly healed, no longer in danger of collapsing. But the main problem was his spiritual force.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Lingxiu was somewhat at a loss. Unless the Untempered Qi could be removed from his spiritual force, Jiang Buping would be unable to truly recover. But the difficulty in doing so was not small, and Su Lingxiu did not have a good solution at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"His spiritual force is extremely powerful, seemingly stronger than his physical body, as if his physical body can barely contain it," Su Lingxiu said with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"Strengthening his physical body should work. I'll teach him the Heaven Hammer Hundred Refinements Technique, and supplement it with medicinal cultivation. That should be able to enhance his physical body," Meng Chong said.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Buping's injuries, it seemed he had fought against the Blood Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, I don't think that can solve the problem. Even if his physical body becomes stronger, his spiritual force will also grow stronger. The root of the issue lies in his spiritual force...</p><p></p><p>"It's likely due to the peculiarity of his spiritual force that he has not lost his clarity of mind, even after being tainted by the Untempered Qi," Su Lingxiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for him to wake up first," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had experienced a brutal battle and was now in a state of slumber due to the influence of the Untempered Qi.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing else we can do for now," Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>She had no solution at the moment, unless their master was willing to intervene. Everything would depend on this person's fate.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan kept staring at Jiang Buping, becoming increasingly surprised. A name was emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Cheng Elder, do you know him?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I think I know who he is," Cheng Zhan pondered for a moment. "In the Taikun Realm of the Divine Realm, there was once a prodigy hailed as the youngest True King Venerable. It was rumored that his spiritual force was exceptionally powerful, but he was later mocked as a 'discarded prodigy'...</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, he should be Taikun's discarded son, Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others became intrigued, urging Cheng Zhan to tell them more about the story of the discarded prodigy, Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, upon seeing Jiang Buping, had immediately found the direction for his Fifth Martial Dao, and began to excitedly prepare an elaborate theory.</p><p></p><p>"The Untempered Qi, though difficult to refine, if he has been tainted by it yet retained his clarity of mind, and his spiritual force is innate, this is an opportunity. Not necessarily to refine the Untempered Qi, but to completely integrate it into his spiritual force, granting it the properties of the Untempered Qi.</p><p></p><p>"This is both a great calamity and a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. He had found his fifth disciple, and began refining and adding more esoteric theories to his Fifth Martial Dao, while also paying attention to Cheng Zhan's narration.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard son, prodigy, discarded, exiled, abandoned... This is the fate of a Chosen One! And to have encountered me, a great master, this is destiny!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart was filled with excitement. Jiang Buping, who had experienced so much, was the perfect candidate for his Fifth Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Untempered Qi in his spiritual force, he must have been ambushed, right?" Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping embodied so many of the tropes of a protagonist, the only thing missing was a betrayal by his beloved or fiancée.</p><p></p><p>If he had that as well, he would be the perfect main character.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan couldn't help but ask, "Does he have a fiancée?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was taken aback for a moment, then quickly nodded. "Yes, there are rumors that he had a fiancée, but after he was exiled, she severed ties with him and found another lover!"</p><p></p><p>Perfect!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction, saying no more.</p><p></p><p>The more he looked at Jiang Buping, the more he liked him. This youth was destined for greatness!</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Martial Dao would have to rely on him to flourish.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan seemed lost in thought as he asked, "Does the senior mean that he may have been ambushed by his fiancée?" Li Xuan neither confirmed nor denied it.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping continued to sleep soundly, unaware of when he would wake up.</p><p></p><p>The attention of the crowd shifted from Jiang Buping to Xue Zitu, and to the crisis that Qinghua Realm was currently facing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a burst of blood-red light erupted from the front, where several Blood Disciples were attacking a major city, the third largest in Qiyu Prefecture, which had a True King Celestial guarding it.</p><p></p><p>However, it was now in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" Cheng Zhan roared furiously, his figure instantly rushing towards the battle.</p><p></p><p>The other warriors who had accompanied Cheng Zhan on the way to Qiyu Prefecture had already departed to support various locations.</p><p></p><p>Currently, only Cheng Zhan remained on the Changqing Pavilion airship.</p><p></p><p>The airship transformed into a beam of light and swiftly arrived at the scene.</p><p></p><p>The battling Blood Disciples and the Qiyu Prefecture True King Celestial were both startled by the arrival of the massive airship. "Rebel, you shall be executed!" they exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's roar echoed as he wielded a giant hammer and joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>The three True King Celestials, who had been struggling to hold their ground, were immediately invigorated by the arrival of the reinforcements and joined the fight with furious roars.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sighed, "The great cities in the Divine Realm lack protective formations, making them too fragile. If they had powerful defensive formations and strong guardians, they would not be so easily breached."</p><p></p><p>The people on the airship all nodded in agreement, having witnessed the intricacies of formations.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of his finger, Li Xuan instantly slew the Blood Disciples, and the airship continued its flight towards Qiyu Prefecture City without stopping.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Cheng Zhan and the two True King Celestials came to express their gratitude to the senior for the timely assistance.</p><p></p><p>The two True King Celestials were overjoyed to learn of the presence of an Immortal, feeling that Qiyu Prefecture had been saved and that there was now a powerful figure who could contain Xue Zitu.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, merely containing Xue Zitu would be enough, for Xue Zitu was no ordinary Immortal Celestial, and his strength was immense. Even the Great Yue Emperor, the Wanlei Sect Master, or the Tianwu Sect Master might find it difficult to slay Xue Zitu.</p><p></p><p>The battle in Qiyu Prefecture City continued to rage, and at that moment, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu had consumed the eighth Underworld Blood Pearl, seemingly reaching their limit and unable to further replenish their consumed blood essence.</p><p></p><p>It was then that Feng Yan, whose body had been trembling, suddenly unleashed a powerful punch, as if channeling the power of the entire realm into it.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu also hurled a massive spear, as if throwing an entire world, and the powerful strike shattered a massive opening in the blood blades surrounding Xue Zitu.</p><p></p><p>The impact of their combined attacks caused the surrounding space in Qiyu Prefecture to shake and tremble, as if the very laws of heaven and earth were weakening.</p><p></p><p>The stolen power of heaven and earth had been concentrated into their devastating strike.</p><p></p><p>"Run!" The two figures seized the opportunity and swiftly fled, their auras in disarray and their appearances disheveled, with Sui Hongwu even losing his divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can escape?" Xue Zitu calmly stepped forward, giving chase.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were panting heavily, their faces grim, as they had narrowly avoided becoming Xue Zitu's sustenance. Fortunately, they had managed to confuse Xue Zitu and seize the chance to flee.</p><p></p><p>If they had been caught by Xue Zitu, the consequences would have been unimaginable, not only resulting in their own demise, but also further empowering Xue Zitu, to the point where no one in the Qinghua Realm could stand against him.</p><p></p><p>If Xue Zitu were left unchecked, his chances of ascending to the Blood Immortal realm would increase significantly.</p><p></p><p>"Where will you run? Even if you escape, what then?" Xue Zitu pursued them, and behind him, a vast army of Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves had gathered, summoned from the Underworld Celestial Cavern in Qiyu Prefecture, which Xue Zitu had already annihilated.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, let the blood sacrifice to the Great Yue begin," Xue Zitu's cold voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's faces turned ashen, their fists clenched, but they remained silent, focusing on their desperate flight towards the Wanlei Sect, hoping to lure Xue Zitu there and have the Wanlei Sect Master contain him.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was no longer available, and the Tianwu Gate was too far away, leaving the Wanlei Sect as their only choice.</p><p></p><p>They feared that Xue Zitu might not fall for their ploy and instead choose to sacrifice the cities of the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>"Since I have consumed so many Underworld Blood Pearls and purified my blood essence, my blood is now extremely precious to Xue Zitu. He will not easily give up on us," Feng Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you are right!" Sui Hongwu gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The two had no choice but to gamble on Xue Zitu's desire for their blood, as they dared not flee completely, fearing that Xue Zitu would abandon them and instead go on a rampage of blood sacrifice across the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>Nor could they stay too close to Xue Zitu, for the consequences would be dire if they were caught.</p><p></p><p>Fleeing desperately, the two Immortal Celestials, despite their lofty status, were now exhausted from the intense battle, especially after breaking through Xue Zitu's enclosure.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, half the sky was a sea of blood-red, the blood aura sweeping towards them like a violent storm.</p><p></p><p>"Avoid the major cities, do not pass through them at all costs!" Sui Hongwu gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>The two began to steer clear of the routes leading to the major cities, while the smiling Xue Zitu behind them seemed unaware of their intentions, continuing to pursue them with his vast army of Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>"The warriors of the Wanlei Sect, their blood must be even more delicious. I shall sacrifice a few Wanlei Sect cities, refine some True Kings, and if I can join forces with the ones from the Underworld Celestial Cavern, I may even be able to refine the Wanlei Sect Master..." Xue Zitu murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>As Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were fleeing, they suddenly spotted a beam of light shooting towards them - an airship, unlike any they had seen before, soaring in the sky.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 373</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping didn't know how long or how far he had walked until his consciousness became hazy and fatigue washed over him. Only then did he collapse against a large tree.</p><p></p><p>His powerful spiritual force still permeated his body, mending his severely wounded physical form and preventing it from completely breaking down.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was no longer clear, entering a state similar to deep sleep. </p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he felt his body seem to float up. He thought he heard human voices, but in his subconscious, this was merely an auditory hallucination of his confused mind.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship of Changqing Pavilion, everyone's attention was focused on Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was the same. He was secretly shocked - this person's spirit was stronger than his physical body, actually using spiritual force to maintain his physical form and prevent it from collapsing.</p><p></p><p>If it was just this, he wouldn't have been so surprised. </p><p></p><p>What truly shocked him was that this person's spirit actually contained a trace of Immutable Qi! Even though it was just a trace, for a martial artist, this was absolutely a huge disaster that would cause loss of intelligence and leave one in a dazed state.</p><p></p><p>Yet this young man, about the same age as Xu Yan and the others, had not lost his intelligence or become dazed. He was just listless, as if in a deep sleep he couldn't wake from, lacking energy all day.</p><p></p><p>It was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from the severe injuries on his body, he had just been through a major battle. His injuries were extremely serious, only sustained by his powerful spirit.</p><p></p><p>"His spirit is stronger than his physical body, stronger than his realm, and he's been contaminated with Immutable Qi, yet he can still maintain consciousness - this is a freak of nature!</p><p></p><p>"His spirit is also somewhat special. It doesn't seem to have been cultivated, but rather he was born with it, and cultivation has only made his spirit stronger."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan felt he could arrange his fifth school of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was busy treating Jiang Buping. A look of surprise appeared on her jade-like face as she said, "His injuries are so severe, his physical body is on the verge of collapse, yet he's maintaining it with spiritual force.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I sense there's something unusual in his spirit."</p><p></p><p>For Su Lingxiu, treating physical injuries was easy, but the abnormality in his spirit was not so simple to resolve.</p><p></p><p>"Don't interfere with his spirit with your Primordial Spirit. Be careful not to be contaminated by the Immutable Qi," Li Xuan warned.</p><p></p><p>"Immutable Qi!" Su Lingxiu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were also surprised. This person's spirit was actually contaminated with Immutable Qi? Cheng Zhan stared at Jiang Buping for a long while, vaguely recalling someone, with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Immutable Qi? Is that the energy from the Immutable Heavenly Cave?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan shook his head and said, "I've heard a little about it. Rumor has it there's an extremely powerful heavenly cave in the Divine Realm called the Immutable Heavenly Cave. The energy inside is called Immutable Qi, but I don't know the specifics."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he added, "The Qinghua Realm and the neighboring Jiushan Realm don't have Immutable Heavenly Caves, so we're not very familiar with it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others nodded in understanding and didn't ask further. Instead, they gathered around Jiang Buping, marveling at him.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's physical injuries were not a big deal and were quickly healed. They would no longer cause his body to collapse. However, his biggest problem was his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Lingxiu was somewhat at a loss.</p><p></p><p>Unless the Immutable Qi could be removed from his spirit, Jiang Buping would not be able to truly recover. But removing Immutable Qi was no small feat, and Su Lingxiu didn't have any good solutions for the time being.</p><p></p><p>After all, Immutable Qi was extremely special. Although she had been studying it for some time and gained more understanding, she still didn't have a way to refine Immutable Qi.</p><p></p><p>"His spirit is very powerful, seemingly stronger than his physical body. It's as if his physical body can barely contain his spirit," Su Lingxiu said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"We just need to strengthen his physical body. I'll pass on the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Refinements technique to him. With the aid of medicinal pills for cultivation, it will surely strengthen his physical body," Meng Chong said.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Jiang Buping's injuries, it seemed he had battled with Blood Disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, I don't think that will solve the problem. If his physical body becomes stronger, his spirit will also become stronger. The root cause lies in his spirit...</p><p></p><p>"It's probably also because of the special nature of his spirit that he didn't lose his intelligence after being contaminated with Immutable Qi," Su Lingxiu shook her head and said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait until he wakes up before deciding," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had been through a brutal battle, and due to the influence of the Immutable Qi, he had now fallen into a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"That's all we can do for now," Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>She had no other options at the moment, unless Master was willing to step in. Everything depended on this person's fate now.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan kept staring at Jiang Buping, growing more and more surprised as he looked. A person came to mind.</p><p></p><p>"Does Brother Cheng know him?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm reminded of someone," Cheng Zhan pondered for a moment before saying, "There was once a prodigy in the Taikun Realm of the Divine Realm, hailed as the youngest True King Celestial Lord. It was said his spirit was exceptionally powerful. But rumor has it he's now ruined, mocked as a fallen prodigy...</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, he should be Jiang Buping, the abandoned son of Taikun!"</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan and the others heard this, they immediately became interested and asked Cheng Zhan to recount the story of Jiang Buping, the abandoned son of Taikun.</p><p></p><p>The moment Li Xuan saw Jiang Buping, he found the direction for his fifth school of martial arts and began excitedly preparing to create it.</p><p></p><p>"Although Immutable Qi is said to be difficult to refine, the fact that he was contaminated with Immutable Qi without losing his intelligence, and was born with a powerful spirit, presents an opportunity. There's a possibility of refining the Immutable Qi.</p><p></p><p>"No, not necessarily refining it, but fully integrating the Immutable Qi into his spirit, giving his spirit the property of immutability.</p><p></p><p>"This is both a great disaster and a great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited. He had found his fifth disciple. While organizing and perfecting his fifth school of martial arts, adding more profound theories, he also paid attention to Cheng Zhan's narration.</p><p></p><p>"Born of a concubine, a prodigy, ruined, expelled, abandoned son... This is the protagonist's fate! And to actually encounter a great master like me, isn't this destiny? He will be my fifth disciple, Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was elated.</p><p></p><p>This Jiang Buping was born of a concubine, a ruined prodigy, and an abandoned son - wasn't this the fate of a protagonist? Moreover, he was ruined because of Immutable Qi, yet didn't become dazed. This was both a great disaster and a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"The Immutable Qi in his spirit, he was probably sabotaged, right?" Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had so many experiences typical of a protagonist. All that was missing was a betraying lover or fiancée.</p><p></p><p>If he had that too, he would be a textbook protagonist.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan couldn't help but ask, "Does he have a fiancée?"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was stunned for a moment, then quickly nodded and said, "Yes, it's said he had a fiancée, but after he was expelled, his fiancée cut ties with him completely. It seems she has another love interest now!"</p><p></p><p>That's it!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said no more.</p><p></p><p>The more he looked at Jiang Buping, the more he liked him. This young man was destined for greatness!</p><p></p><p>The fifth school of martial arts would rely on him to flourish.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan seemed lost in thought and asked, "Does the elder mean that he may have been sabotaged by his fiancée?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not comment either way.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping continued to sleep unconsciously, not knowing when he would wake up. </p><p></p><p>Everyone's attention shifted from Jiang Buping back to Blood Child Tu, and to the crisis now facing the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a blood-red light shot up into the sky ahead. Several blood disciples were jointly attacking a large city - this was the third largest city in Qiyun Prefecture, with a True King Celestial Lord stationed there.</p><p></p><p>However, it was now in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan flew into a rage and charged over in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists who had been with Cheng Zhan on the way to Qiyun Prefecture had already left to provide support in other areas.</p><p></p><p>Currently, only Cheng Zhan remained on the Changqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>The ship turned into a streak of light, arriving in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The blood disciples and the Qiyun Prefecture True King Celestial Lord, who were in the midst of battle, all noticed this giant ship shooting over and were shocked, wondering what kind of divine artifact it was.</p><p></p><p>"Traitors must be executed!" </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan roared as he joined the battle wielding a large hammer.</p><p></p><p>The three True King Celestial Lords who had been struggling to hold on saw reinforcements arrive and immediately felt their spirits lift. They all roared and attacked with renewed vigor.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sighed and said, "The great cities of the Divine Realm have no defensive formations and are too fragile. If they had grand defensive formations and powerful experts stationed there, how could they be so easily breached?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone on the ship nodded in agreement, having witnessed the wonders of formations before.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flicked his finger, instantly killing the blood disciples. The ship did not stop and continued flying towards Qiyun Prefecture City.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, Cheng Zhan and two True King Celestial Lords came to thank the expert for lending a hand.</p><p></p><p>When the two learned there was an Immortal present, they were overjoyed, feeling that Qiyun Prefecture could now be saved. Finally there was a powerful expert who could restrain Blood Child Tu.</p><p></p><p>In their view, restraining was all that could be done. </p><p></p><p>After all, Blood Child Tu was no ordinary Immortal Celestial Lord. His strength was extreme - how could he be easily killed? Even Great Yue Emperor, Sect Master of Ten Thousand Thunders, or Sect Master of Celestial Martial Arts - any one of them would likely find it difficult to kill Blood Child Tu.</p><p></p><p>The battle in Qiyun Prefecture City was still ongoing. At this moment, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu swallowed their eighth Netherworld Blood Pearl, seemingly reaching their limit and unable to continue replenishing their consumed essence blood.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that Feng Yan's body trembled. He, who resembled a stone giant, suddenly threw out a punch that seemed to gather the power of an entire realm into it.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu also hurled his great halberd, as if throwing an entire realm with it. This powerful strike instantly blasted open a huge gap in the blood blades surrounding Blood Child Tu!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this great halberd was struck by Feng Yan's fist imprint. Their two powerful attacks instantly fused together.</p><p></p><p>The halberd shattered at this moment, as if shattering an entire realm.</p><p></p><p>This strike broke through Blood Child Tu's blockade, shattering the encircling blood blades.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth appeared, the essence of heaven and earth surged, and Qiyun Prefecture collapsed into ruins from the aftershocks of this strike.</p><p></p><p>The space in this area of Qiyun Prefecture began to shake and tremble, as if experiencing a momentary weakening of the power of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The power of heaven and earth that had been drawn away all converged into this single strike by Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Two figures seized the opportunity and fled in an instant, though their auras were chaotic and they were in a sorry state. Sui Hongwu had even lost his divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>"Think you can escape?" </p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu stepped out unhurriedly in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu were panting heavily. They looked back, their expressions extremely gloomy. They had nearly become Blood Child Tu's nourishment.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the two had managed to confuse Blood Child Tu and seize the opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Child Tu had truly succeeded, the consequences would have been unthinkable. Not only would the two have perished, but Blood Child Tu's strength would have further increased. At that point, perhaps no one in the entire Qinghua Realm would be his match!</p><p></p><p>Once there was no one who could restrain him, Blood Child Tu's chances of advancing to become a Blood Spirit would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you fleeing to? What's the point of you two escaping?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu pursued and hunted them from behind. Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu fled frantically. Later on, behind them was a sky full of blood-red light and soaring blood qi.</p><p></p><p>At some point, behind Blood Child Tu had gathered an army of blood disciples and blood slaves! Dozens of blood disciples and tens of thousands of blood slaves - these came from the Netherworld Heavenly Abyss in Qiyun Prefecture. The martial artists guarding the abyss had all been killed by Blood Child Tu, and the blood disciples and blood slaves from within the abyss had invaded the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had all gathered under Blood Child Tu's command.</p><p></p><p>"Just watch, who can stop me, Blood Child Tu? The blood sacrifice of Great Yue begins today."</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu's cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You two, either obediently accept death - the essence blood of two Immortal Celestial Lords can save quite a few people - or I'll sacrifice blood all the way there. Do you want to sacrifice yourselves to save tens of millions of lives?"</p><p></p><p>His androgynous, vicious voice pierced their ears.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu's faces turned ashen, their fists clenched tightly. But they said nothing and continued fleeing headlong, heading in the direction of the Ten Thousand Thunders Sect!</p><p></p><p>Their only option was to lure him to the Ten Thousand Thunders Sect and let the Sect Master restrain Blood Child Tu.</p><p></p><p>Great Yue Emperor was already too preoccupied to help, and the Celestial Martial Gate was too far away. The only choice was the Ten Thousand Thunders Sect.</p><p></p><p>What the two feared was that Blood Child Tu wouldn't take the bait, but would abandon chasing them and go sacrifice blood in the cities of Great Yue instead.</p><p></p><p>"We've eaten so many of his Netherworld Blood Pearls, purifying our essence blood. We haven't yet had time to fully refine the Netherworld qi within the pearls."</p><p></p><p>"The essence blood in our bodies is very precious to Blood Child Tu. He won't give up on it," Feng Yan said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Let's hope so!" Sui Hongwu said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>The two had no other choice now. They didn't dare to flee completely, fearing Blood Child Tu would abandon chasing them and turn to sacrifice blood in the cities of Great Yue instead.</p><p></p><p>But they also didn't dare get too close to Blood Child Tu. If they got entangled with him, the consequences would be dire.</p><p></p><p>Now they could only gamble on Blood Child Tu not knowing the location of the Ten Thousand Thunders Sect or being unfamiliar with it, and continuing to pursue them all the way there.</p><p></p><p>The two fled frantically. Even as Immortal Celestial Lords, after experiencing such an intense battle, especially that strike to break through Blood Child Tu's blockade which consumed a huge amount of energy, they now felt out of breath and experienced a long-forgotten sense of fatigue.</p><p></p><p>Looking back, half the sky was blood-red, with rolling blood qi sweeping towards them like a storm.</p><p></p><p>"Avoid the big cities. We absolutely cannot pass through any big cities!" Sui Hongwu said through clenched teeth.</p><p></p><p>The two began to avoid routes passing through big cities. Behind them, Blood Child Tu wore an androgynous smile, seemingly completely unaware of their intentions.</p><p></p><p>He continued to lead his army of blood slaves in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"The essence blood of Ten Thousand Thunders Sect martial artists must be even more delicious, right? Sacrificing blood from a few Ten Thousand Thunders Sect cities, refining some True Kings with blood... If I could join forces with those in the abyss and blood refine the Sect Master of Ten Thousand Thunders..." </p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>As they fled, Feng Yan and Sui Hongwu suddenly saw a streak of light shooting towards them from ahead. It was actually a giant ship flying through the air, unlike any they had ever seen before.</p><p></p><p>(Recommending a friend's book, those interested can check it out)</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

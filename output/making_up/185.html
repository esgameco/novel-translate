        <h1>Chapter 185</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the city of Tieshan, on top of the Tianbaoge.</p><p></p><p>Two half-step Celestial Beings were covered in cold sweat, their hearts and livers trembling.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred grand masters, including dozens of peak grand masters, were all exterminated with just a casual wave of the hand! Yet the mysterious expert did not even unleash his Celestial Being's might! This made it even more terrifying! They asked themselves, even if they unleashed their Celestial Being's might, they could only suppress these grand masters for a short time.</p><p></p><p>After all, the might unleashed by dozens of peak grand masters was not enough for them, mere half-step Celestial Beings, to truly subdue. </p><p></p><p>If they really engaged in combat, they could only retreat, with no chance of withstanding the power of dozens of peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the mysterious expert did not unleash his Celestial Being's might, but had already exterminated all the grand master cultivators. What a terrifying power this was.</p><p></p><p>This was the master of Xu Yan and Meng Chong! </p><p></p><p>Just who was he? Could he truly be a Martial Dao Celestial Being? In the Inner Realm, why would there be the rumored Martial Dao Celestial Being?</p><p></p><p>The two knew that the rise of the Changqing Pavilion was now unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, which force would dare to covet the Changqing Pavilion? If they wanted the medicinal pills, they had to pay to purchase them! Next, they should consider the cooperation between the Tianbaoge and the Changqing Pavilion. The advantage of the Tianbaoge was that it had branches all over the Inner Realm, which could quickly sell the medicinal pills to every corner of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the sky above the Changqing Pavilion, the enemies had all been exterminated, and the atmosphere was calm and peaceful again.</p><p></p><p>However, the scene just now had deeply shocked every member of the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still leisurely and unrestrained, returning to sit on the chair, as if he had just casually crushed a hundred ants, insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, you are too powerful!" Suling's rosy face was flushed with excitement, her eyes full of adoration for her master.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>She diligently brewed tea for her master. "Master, this is the might of the Penetrating Mystery, one person sweeping away hundreds of peers, truly too powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression was calm as he waved his hand and said, "Just a small matter, I haven't even used a tenth of the Penetrating Mystery power.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention hundreds, even if it's thousands or tens of thousands of peer enemies, I can still sweep them away invincibly!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the shocked expression on his disciples' faces, Li Xuan felt comfortable, as he had no shame in boasting in front of his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shocked, "Master means that the 'peers' are not these grand masters, but enemies at the Penetrating Mystery realm, thousands or tens of thousands of them, and Master can sweep them away invincibly.</p><p></p><p>"What a terrifying power! Although I'm confident of being invincible among my peers, I know I can't achieve that. Master is so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>It was hard to imagine just how terrifying Master's power was, able to sweep away tens of thousands of peers single-handedly, what a magnificent figure!</p><p></p><p>"I will take Master as my goal and strive to improve my strength. Even if I can't sweep away thousands or tens of thousands of peers, at the very least I must be able to sweep away hundreds of peers single-handedly!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was resolute, his fighting spirit soaring.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also deeply shocked. He began to assess himself, "My Great Sun Golden Body is extremely sturdy, as long as it can't be broken through, I can't be defeated. But dozens of peers attacking together, I definitely can't withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the peers I face should be those who have also cultivated the Great Sun Golden Body. My goal is to become the strongest martial dao cultivator, one person fighting a hundred without defeat, that will be my goal!"</p><p></p><p>As for being invincible among peers, Meng Chong directly skipped over it, with his elder brother around, being invincible among peers was not something he could dream of.</p><p></p><p>That was exclusive to his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>His goal was simple, to become a martial dao cultivator who could fight a hundred peers without defeat, that would be success!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the fighting spirit in the eyes of his two disciples, feeling very satisfied. Having fighting spirit was good, they would train more diligently and improve their strength faster.</p><p></p><p>When the disciples' strength improved, his own strength would also rise.</p><p></p><p>There was nothing happier than the improvement of one's own strength.</p><p></p><p>The storm at the Changqing Pavilion had passed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to perfect himself, preparing to break through to the Penetrating Mystery realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was preparing to assault the Innate realm to achieve perfection.</p><p></p><p>Suling had drawn the necessary equipment and handed it to Zhou Ying, asking her to find someone to forge them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi were enthusiastically invested in the expansion of the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm's martial dao world, all forces and experts had their eyes focused on Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>The battle at the Changqing Pavilion was like a storm, sweeping across the entire Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao world was shaken! More than a hundred grand masters, including dozens of peak grand masters, this was the first time since the collapse of the dynasty that so many grand masters had gathered for a battle.</p><p></p><p>The result, all the grand masters were exterminated! The news from Xu Yan and Meng Chong about the Changqing Pavilion had also spread throughout the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the mysterious expert in the Changqing Pavilion, single-handedly exterminating more than a hundred grand masters, had shocked the Inner Realm! The forces that participated in the battle at the Changqing Pavilion were now living in constant fear.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of being targeted.</p><p></p><p>The details of the battle had not been spread, after all, all the experts had died. And the two half-step Celestial Beings of the Tianbaoge naturally would not spread this news, so for the outside world, they only knew that more than a hundred grand masters had all perished.</p><p></p><p>They did not know that the more than a hundred grand masters were exterminated with just a casual wave of the hand, otherwise it would be even more shocking.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom! On this day, the ministers were trembling with fear, and many of the great families that had participated in this operation were all trembling with fear, their gazes turning to that Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The commander of the Great Yue Kingdom's Heavenly Robe Guard, the commander of the Heavenlyå¾¡Guard, as well as the grand masters who were dispatched, had all perished!</p><p></p><p>The imperial house of the Great Yue Kingdom had suffered a disastrous loss!</p><p></p><p>But the consequences of this event were far more terrible than this loss! The attack on the Changqing Pavilion and the attempt to seize the Changqing Pavilion's medicinal pills were initiated by the imperial house of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>If the Changqing Pavilion were to retaliate, the first target would be the imperial house of the Great Yue Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, some of the ministers were already considering preparing a backup plan.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's face turned pale, he realized the seriousness of this matter, if not handled properly, the Great Yue Kingdom could be on the verge of collapse!</p><p></p><p>In the secret place of the imperial palace, the high-level officials of the Great Yue Kingdom gathered to discuss how to resolve this matter.</p><p></p><p>More than a hundred grand masters had been killed, even if the Great Yue Kingdom exerted its full strength, it could not overcome the Changqing Pavilion, and the ministers of the Great Yue Kingdom would certainly not work hard to fight the Changqing Pavilion with all their might.</p><p></p><p>In the martial dao world of the Inner Realm, everyone was watching how the Great Yue Kingdom would respond.</p><p></p><p>At the Sword Saint Cliff, Xie Lingfeng's expression was anxious. He had just finished his closed-door cultivation and learned of the Changqing Pavilion's matter, so he hurried to his father's closed-door cultivation place.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Sword Saint Cliff would fully intervene to rescue the Changqing Pavilion could only be decided by the current Sword Master, his father Xie Tiangheng.</p><p></p><p>Before he reached the closed-door cultivation place, Hu Shan hurriedly chased after him and said, "Young Master, they're all gone, all of them are gone!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan exclaimed with a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"What's gone?" Xie Lingfeng was startled in his heart, the Changqing Pavilion was destroyed? Impossible, in this critical moment, the senior would not intervene?</p><p></p><p>"More than a hundred grand masters, they've all been exterminated, but the Changqing Pavilion is unharmed!" Hu Shan said in shock.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng let out a breath and said, "It must have been the senior who intervened!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong, no matter how strong they were, could not have dealt with so many powerful experts! "It must be!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was so shocking, one person annihilating over a hundred grand masters.</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, he felt it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>Mere grand masters, in the eyes of the senior, were nothing more than ants, right? Hu Shan suddenly paused, realizing he himself had not even broken through to the grand master realm, yet he was arrogantly looking down on the grand masters.</p><p></p><p>"It must be the influence of Xu Yan and Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong looked up at the sky, silent for a long time, the shock evident in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although he had expected the various forces of the Great Yue Kingdom to ultimately fail, he never imagined they would be utterly destroyed in such a sweeping manner.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were incapable of such a feat, which meant there must be an even more powerful existence within the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, the old immortal of Yinlou has also gone to the Changqing Pavilion, as well as the Venerable Kuojue Demon Sovereign."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Pavilion Master of Yinlou and the Venerable Kuojue Demon Sovereign, both were experts comparable to the teacher, yet they had disappeared after going to the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The result was obvious.</p><p></p><p>They must have died!</p><p></p><p>Two half-step Heavenly Immortals, dozens of peak grand masters, such a powerful force, yet they had thought that even if the Changqing Pavilion ultimately weathered the crisis, there would still be a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>The battle did occur.</p><p></p><p>But it seemed not so fierce? A group of experts, they went quickly and died quickly!</p><p></p><p>So quickly that the major forces in the martial arts world did not even have time to react before the matter was concluded.</p><p></p><p>All the grand master experts, not a single one left alive.</p><p></p><p>"Has Peng Yuan led the people to Canglang Island?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong asked.</p><p></p><p>"Scholar Peng has already led seven people and set out for Canglang Island," Fu Yuntian replied.</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan was the martial arts Grand Scholar of the Seven Star Academy. He had spent his life researching the martial arts, and the secret techniques circulating among the martial artists below the Dao Monarch realm in the academy were all developed by him.</p><p></p><p>He was also one of the martial arts scholars selected by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>A peak grand master in strength.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong pondered for a while, seemingly contemplating something, then solemnly said, "Prepare a course in the academy, the Great Desolate Martial Dao, and when Xu Yan brings the Great Desolate Martial Dao here, we will recruit suitable disciples to cultivate it!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate Martial Dao! This was the martial art cultivated by Xu Yan, also known as the true martial dao. Fu Yuntian's expression was complex, his mouth opening, but he did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate Martial Dao was superior to the Inner Domain martial arts. Once the Great Desolate Martial Dao spread, these Inner Domain martial arts experts would eventually be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>And they, with their lifespans not yet exhausted, would soon become the eliminated ones. Many powerful experts had become accustomed to their lofty status, and now they discovered they would not last much longer, how would they feel? It was already too late to switch martial arts. Most likely, they would unite to suppress the Great Desolate Martial Dao, suppressing it for as long as possible.</p><p></p><p>The words "Martial Arts Conflict" emerged in Fu Yuntian's mind.</p><p></p><p>Would the Inner Domain martial arts world no longer be peaceful? And the Seven Star Academy, as the premier martial arts institution of the Inner Domain, with the transmission of martial arts as its principle, now transmitting the Great Desolate Martial Dao, would there be great divisions and even internal strife within the academy?</p><p></p><p>"Teacher..." Fu Yuntian opened his mouth, but did not know what to say.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong smiled and said, "Afraid of being eliminated? Throughout history, how many geniuses have been eliminated? Why should we be the exceptions?</p><p></p><p>"If you don't want to be eliminated, then research the martial arts, how to transition from Inner Domain martial arts to the Great Desolate Martial Dao. If you succeed, how can you be eliminated?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy had no shortage of those who delved into the martial arts, those who single-mindedly explored the martial dao. This was the founding principle of the academy, do not be afraid or worried about being eliminated just because a new martial art has appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the Seven Star Academy is the martial arts scholars. They will naturally research and find a balance, how to transition to the Great Desolate Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian bowed and said, "I have received the teacher's instruction."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong continued with a smile, "As for the conflicts, they may not be able to stir up too many waves. Dozens of peak grand masters were annihilated, Xu Yan's strength is evident to all under heaven, who would not want to pursue an even stronger martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>No one can obstruct this tide of the times, those who try to go against it will ultimately be extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"Once the method of transition is revealed, all martial artists in the Inner Domain will surely transition to the Great Desolate Martial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was stunned, the teacher's words made perfect sense.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Domain martial arts world was shaken by the annihilation of over a hundred grand masters in the Changqing Pavilion battle, countless experts were shocked, and at the same time they were eager for medicinal pills! Was the Changqing Pavilion's great strength related to medicinal pills? Meanwhile, rumors began to circulate in the martial arts world that the martial art cultivated by Xu Yan was not from the Inner Domain, but an even more powerful one.</p><p></p><p>Called the Great Desolate Martial Dao! The rumor was that the Great Desolate Martial Dao was the true martial dao, while the Inner Domain martial arts were false martial arts.</p><p></p><p>How could false martial arts compete with the true martial dao?</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, our Inner Domain martial arts, how can they be false martial arts? Passed down for countless generations, just because one Xu Yan appeared, you think our Inner Domain martial arts are false?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, our Inner Domain martial arts have been passed down for a long time, how can they be false martial arts? Xu Yan cultivates the Inner Domain martial arts as well, it's just that his talent is extraordinary, allowing him to surpass others."</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of the Great Desolate Martial Dao, if it existed, how could it only appear now? It must be fabricated, trying to disrupt our martial arts aspirations, truly despicable!"</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists refuted the claim that Inner Domain martial arts were false martial arts, indignant and aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of the Great Desolate Chronicles? The ones given away with the medicinal pills, I didn't pay much attention at first, but yesterday after reading it, I was greatly shocked. It turns out our Inner Domain is actually part of the Great Desolate."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, due to the ancient upheavals, the martial arts lineage was severed, our Inner Domain martial arts are actually derived from the remnants of the true martial dao, the Great Desolate Martial Dao is the orthodox martial dao of the heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>"The orthodox martial dao of the heavens and earth is the Great Desolate! Rumor has it the Great Desolate Chronicles contain the martial arts left behind by the Martial Ancestor, I must study them carefully, I must find a way to transition to the Great Desolate Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>There were also martial artists in the martial arts world who firmly believed that the Great Desolate Martial Dao was the true martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Before it might not have been, but now it must be, because the Great Desolate Martial Dao is stronger!</p><p></p><p>Martial artists all seek strength! The name of the Great Desolate Martial Dao began to spread in the Inner Domain martial arts world, initially on a small scale, but with a growing trend.</p><p></p><p>Especially with the circulation of the Great Desolate Chronicles, some grand master martial artists who had purchased medicinal pills and received the chronicles as a gift, were greatly shocked after reading them, as if they had seen the true revelation of the world.</p><p></p><p>If it had been before the Changqing Pavilion battle, they might have just treated it as a fictional story, but after the Changqing Pavilion battle, they could no longer treat it as just a fictional story.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate Martial Dao was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to corroborate that the accounts in the Great Desolate Chronicles were real.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

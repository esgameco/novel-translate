        <h1>Chapter 390</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged. In an instant, a large tree beside him transformed into a giant sword, emanating a fierce killing intent, slashing down towards the attacker on the left! Countless blades of grass, glinting coldly, seemed to possess intelligence as they shot densely towards the attacker on the right.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Yan's figure moved, slashing a sword towards the front!</p><p></p><p>Absolute Heaven Sword! Swish! A figure appeared, roaring angrily as it threw out a punch, attempting to block Xu Yan's sword strike.</p><p></p><p>"Cowards who hide in the shadows."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly. To the shock of the three attackers, all the plants and trees transformed into sharp killing swords. Even more terrifying, these swords seemed to each possess their own intelligence and sword techniques. </p><p></p><p>In that instant, the three attackers found themselves in a world of swords.</p><p></p><p>"People from the Wan family?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the three masked attackers who were concealing their true appearances, frowning slightly as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the Blood Heart Fruit, and you may be spared death!"</p><p></p><p>One of them said in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>"You think you're capable?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a look of disdain.</p><p></p><p>Three True King Celestial Lord mid-stage martial artists dared to come assassinate him? Were they tired of living?</p><p></p><p>"I must end this quickly. I'm not afraid of three, but if three True King Celestial Lord peak stage experts came, I would have to temporarily retreat."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold as he instantly unleashed his sword dao divine ability. Mountains and rivers appeared within the swords, and the three attackers seemed to enter a world within the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Endless killing intent, endless swords, densely packed, causing the three attackers' expressions to change drastically.</p><p></p><p>The battle ended. At the site of the fight, no plants or trees remained, with only traces of sharp sword intent lingering in the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"Wan family, I, Xu Yan, will remember this!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly.</p><p></p><p>All three attackers were dead. With him exerting nearly full strength and them entering his Mountains and Rivers Within Swords divine ability, mere True King Celestial Lord mid-stage experts had no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan did not find any identity information on the three of them.</p><p></p><p>But besides Wan Tianlin who wanted the Blood Heart Fruit, no one else would come to assassinate him. And with the Wan family's power, training a group of expendable agents to do some shady deeds was a simple matter.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin, you're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure moved, instantly disappearing from the spot. Since Wan Tianlin had made his move, there was no need for him to be polite anymore.</p><p></p><p>Kill Wan Tianlin, and see how the Wan family would respond!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Several figures surrounded and attacked. Each person wore a mask, only revealing cold gazes. They attacked with killing moves, even willing to trade injuries. As long as they could wound their target, they were willing to die!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, quickly leave! This is a trap!"</p><p></p><p>The True King peak stage guard unleashed his power, continuously defending against the attacks.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's gaze was cold, his voice icy: "Good, good, good. They don't take my Wan family seriously at all. What a good scheme, using the Blood Heart Fruit to lure me here."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how capable you are, if you can kill me, Wan Tianlin!"</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, a cold light like a bolt of silk swept out, enveloping one of the attackers.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin had made his move.</p><p></p><p>His weapon was the Spirit Cicada Blade, as thin as a cicada's wing, slender and long, light and soft as silk, with unpredictable attacks.</p><p></p><p>As the current genius of the Wan family, Wan Tianlin's strength was naturally extremely powerful among those of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Slash!</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Spirit Cicada Blade struck out, in the instant the opponent defended, the blade tip flickered, changing unpredictably, and opened a wound on the opponent's chest.</p><p></p><p>Fresh blood gushed out.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, who sent you?"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>The response he got was the attacker's frenzied assault, as if they no longer cared for their lives. One of the attackers even ignored his attack, allowing the Spirit Cicada Blade to pierce through their body just to wound him!</p><p></p><p>"Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Wan Tianlin's shoulder injured, the two guards were greatly alarmed. One of them roared and immediately used a secret technique. In an instant, the formidable power of a True King peak stage expert seemed to explode in this one strike.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The attacker was immediately killed.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, quickly leave! Any delay could be fatal!"</p><p></p><p>The guard who had used the secret technique urgently said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin nodded, taking the opportunity to break out of the encirclement.</p><p></p><p>The other guard closely followed, not leaving his side.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I'll go kill that person with the Blood Heart Fruit and take it from him!"</p><p></p><p>After the last attacker was slain, the guard who had used the secret technique transmitted angrily.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin frowned, about to call the guard back, but the guard had already returned to Jade Bamboo Slope with a face full of anger and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, this matter is no small issue. If the enemy learns that the assassination failed, stronger experts may arrive."</p><p></p><p>The guard closely following Wan Tianlin said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin nodded, instantly fleeing far away, but his eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Great Canopy Mountain was Wan family territory. To dare set up an ambush to assassinate him here was a provocation against the Wan family that absolutely could not be forgiven! In the entire Great Canopy Mountain region, who didn't know that he, Wan Tianlin, wanted to obtain the Blood Heart Fruit to assist in comprehending the Wan family's secret teachings, planning for his future breakthrough to Immortal Celestial Lord?</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heart Fruit's temptation for him was too great. The enemy had precisely grasped this point, using the Blood Heart Fruit to lure him here, wanting to catch him off guard and assassinate him.</p><p></p><p>Before this incident occurred, who could have imagined that someone would be so bold as to assassinate him, the Wan family genius, on Great Canopy Mountain?</p><p></p><p>"They underestimated my strength!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's gaze was gloomy. If not for his powerful strength, that expendable agent's attack just now would not have resulted in just a light injury.</p><p></p><p>Even if he didn't die, he likely would have been severely injured, perhaps even endangering his martial foundation!</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about the danger earlier, the more murderous Wan Tianlin's intent became.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After killing the attackers, Xu Yan returned towards Jade Bamboo Slope, pursuing and hunting in the direction Wan Tianlin had left.</p><p></p><p>Since they dared to assassinate him, they should be prepared to be killed.</p><p></p><p>As for how powerful the Wan family was, Xu Yan didn't care at all. It was no different from when he first entered the Spirit Realm. He would rise up from adversity, then counterattack.</p><p></p><p>"He's here!"</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura appeared, and the newcomer's killing intent was fierce.</p><p></p><p>It was one of Wan Tianlin's two guards, a True King Celestial Lord peak stage martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>He stopped in his tracks. In an instant, with him at the center, he silently laid out the Mountains and Rivers Sword Intent, quietly covering the surroundings with his Mountains and Rivers Within Swords.</p><p></p><p>The plants and trees on the ground were also poised to strike, the killing sword formation ready.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the opponent stepped into the mountains and rivers, he would deliver a devastating blow.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the Blood Heart Fruit and tell me your identity. I'll let you die quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's guard said with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Wan Tianlin? I was just looking for him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's guard attacked directly. He had used a secret technique and could not maintain this state for long.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For a long time, therefore without further words, killing the opponent, if the blood heart fruit was on them, it could naturally be obtained.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful punch, like a giant mountain crashing down, with terrifying momentum.</p><p></p><p>"Swords rise!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers appeared, grass and trees transformed into a torrent of ten thousand swords, flying upwards, and a sword formation emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The guard's gaze focused, his heart startled. What kind of sword technique was this? In that instant, he felt as if he had entered another world, surrounded by a biting chill, with a terrifyingly strong killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this!"</p><p></p><p>The guard was greatly alarmed. This kind of martial art was unprecedented, unheard of.</p><p></p><p>An intense sense of crisis arose in his heart. He was greatly shocked - he was at the peak of True King Celestial Lord after all. Even though he had used secret techniques and was currently in a period of decline, his strength still remained at the peak of True King Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Facing these sword lights, he actually felt a crisis of life and death.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>With a great roar, a layer of blood color surged on his face, then quickly turned pale. At the same time, the aura on his body increased by another 30%.</p><p></p><p>Facing the crisis of life and death, he used secret techniques again, this time a technique that greatly damaged himself but could greatly increase his strength in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Die for me!"</p><p></p><p>The guard's fists continuously struck out. In mid-air, the sound of explosions rang out constantly. One punch imprint after another, like giant mountains, continuously piled up and smashed down.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers shook. The myriad swords were constantly blasted away, but even more swords continuously replenished them.</p><p></p><p>As far as the eye could see, the sword lights seemed endless.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die for me! Challenging my Wan family, you must die!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Using secret techniques? Let's see how long you can maintain it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This True King Celestial Lord's strength was indeed powerful. Even if Xu Yan went all out, it would take some time to kill him.</p><p></p><p>The battle became more and more intense. On the battlefield, only sword lights like torrents and fist imprints like giant mountains could be seen, crashing and colliding, constantly blasting away the torrent of sword lights.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Yan's gaze focused.</p><p></p><p>The opponent's aura began to weaken, and there was a momentary sense of stagnation.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity had come!</p><p></p><p>A sword transformed from a small blade of grass, silently passing through layers of sword lights, like an agile little snake, avoiding layer upon layer of fist imprints.</p><p></p><p>As if possessing intelligence, it drew away the guard's attention, agile and swift, emanating a cold sword light, giving people an extremely dangerous feeling.</p><p></p><p>That True King Celestial Lord immediately focused his attention, not daring to be careless, fully concentrating on this sword. He was also shocked in his heart - why did this sword seem to have intelligence? However, in the instant his attention was diverted, another sword light suddenly became dim, as if merging with the battlefield environment. In the gentle breeze, it had already approached the back of his head!</p><p></p><p>Puff! The sword light, like a spirit snake, entered his head. In an instant, it turned into a violent gale, blowing against his soul!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>That True King Celestial Lord let out a miserable scream, his eyes bulging with blood. The intense pain in his soul made him instinctively cover his head with both hands.</p><p></p><p>And the originally snake-like sword transformed from a small blade of grass, at this moment, swiftly pierced into his chest! Then, layers of sword lights, like surging waves, swept over, completely engulfing him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and a storage bag flew over from among the layers of sword lights.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was at the peak of True King Celestial Lord, and was Wan Tianlin's guard. Being able to be a guard for a genius like Wan Tianlin, his status in the Wan family must not be low.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was currently in a stage of accumulating foundation, so naturally he wouldn't waste the items the opponent was carrying.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin, let's see what you can do!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed coldly, his figure moving, once again pursuing Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>However, this pursuit was fruitless. Wan Tianlin seemed to have already returned to the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>"In three days, let's see if you come to trade!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since guards had already been openly sent to attack and rob the blood heart fruit, Wan Tianlin might not come to trade again in three days, but instead organize people to come attack and rob him.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not certain!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought. If Wan Tianlin came to Jade Bamboo Slope to trade again in three days as if nothing had happened, there would certainly be powerful figures following in secret.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Celestial Lord was impossible. With the status of an Immortal Celestial Lord, no matter how much of a genius Wan Tianlin was, he wouldn't deserve an Immortal Celestial Lord's personal protection.</p><p></p><p>But those who had one foot in the Immortal realm yet could advance no further, powerful figures at this level, were possible.</p><p></p><p>Or, he might bring several more guards.</p><p></p><p>"Then we'll see in three days. If you don't come, I'll change my identity and continue selling blood heart fruit, see if you take the bait!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>He immediately returned to Jade Bamboo Slope, pondered for a moment, and a figure walked out of Xu Yan's body, sitting in the chair he had originally sat in.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Yuan Avatar!</p><p></p><p>To prevent falling into an encirclement, Xu Yan decided to use a Spirit Yuan Avatar to wait for Wan Tianlin here.</p><p></p><p>"Even in the Divine Realm, who would have thought of such a marvelous martial art technique?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Yuan Avatar's aura was exactly the same as his. For martial artists who didn't know about the existence of avatars in the world, it was impossible to distinguish that this was an avatar.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan's Spirit Yuan Avatar had used the Harmony with Dust technique, making its aura ordinary, without a trace of the aura belonging to an avatar appearing.</p><p></p><p>Under such circumstances, even martial artists who knew about the existence of avatars couldn't discover that this was an avatar.</p><p></p><p>After leaving a Spirit Yuan Avatar, Xu Yan immediately left, hiding himself thirty miles away from the avatar.</p><p></p><p>At this distance, the Spirit Yuan Avatar could be controlled by his main consciousness through their connected awareness, without worrying about the problem of the Spirit Yuan Avatar falling asleep.</p><p></p><p>"At worst, I'll only lose this bit of spirit yuan."</p><p></p><p>If the Spirit Yuan Avatar was destroyed, for Xu Yan, it would only mean losing some spirit yuan, which he could easily cultivate back.</p><p></p><p>"Destroying my Spirit Yuan Avatar is the same as killing me. Just wait for me, Xu Yan, to come kill you all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was already calculating that if he raided the Wan family's treasure vault, would he no longer have to worry about lacking treasures to accumulate his foundation?</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin, who had returned to the Wan family, immediately arranged for people to start investigating information about Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he investigated which forces the attackers might have come from.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains Realm, only the other eight families had the strength to confront the Wan family. However, there had never been any major grudges between them, and they would even rescue each other when facing crises from the Sky Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This was all tacit understanding. In the face of threats from the Sky Abyss, other grudges had to be temporarily set aside. This was the consensus of the Divine Realm, a rule followed by all thirty-six realms.</p><p></p><p>But besides the other eight forces, what other forces in the Nine Mountains Realm dared to provoke the Wan family?</p><p></p><p>When the news of Wan Tianlin being attacked reached the ears of the Wan family elders, they immediately became furious. The entire Wan family's forces began to mobilize.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not make it public, but investigated secretly. The outside world knew nothing about this matter.</p><p></p><p>The bounty for the blood heart fruit, however, was doubled! (End of chapter)</p>

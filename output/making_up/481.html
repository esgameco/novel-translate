        <h1>Chapter 481</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Territory was already the domain of the demon race.</p><p></p><p>In the various regions of the Divine Realm, more and more spirit beasts were arriving successively. Among them, the number of Immortal Realm spirit beasts also increased. Of course, there were those with ulterior motives, and naturally there were quite a few who were not submissive.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain-Swallowing Toad, like a small mountain, squatted on the ground, its eyes calmly looking at two Immortal Realm spirit beasts not far away.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha's body was rolling with demonic energy. It directly opened its mouth, and a terrifying suction force instantly appeared.</p><p></p><p>In front of it, a vortex emerged, rippling as if space itself was distorting.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, the two Immortal Realm spirit beasts were subdued by Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Third Demon King!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the two Immortal Realm spirit beasts had no choice but to submit.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Spirit Veneration Mountain, a huge golden palace stood tall. The Red Cat sat on a dazzling golden chair, wearing a large gold chain around its neck, looking majestic and imposing.</p><p></p><p>One tiger paw gripped a large blade as it looked down at the spirit beasts lined up on the left and right below.</p><p></p><p>"From this day forward, any who come to join us and dare to offend this king's authority will be severely punished. For a hundred years, don't even think about obtaining the Great Demon Technique!</p><p></p><p>"You are all great generals of our demon race. Now that there is some unrest in the Heavenly Cavern, from today onwards, patrol the Nine Mountains Territory for me and suppress all disturbances!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Great King!" </p><p></p><p>The demon generals all respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon also sat on a chair. At this moment, it had taken on the form of an azure flood dragon. Although it had not transformed into a true dragon, its aura was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Its flood dragon prestige had a great deterrent effect on the other spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Jade Little Dragon had cultivated the Great Demon Technique, so its demonic aura was even more imposing and intimidating.</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Little Ha's deterrent effect seemed somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>After all, its true form was a Mountain-Swallowing Toad, which was the lowest rank among spirit beasts, used as material for making storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Although Little Ha was no ordinary Mountain-Swallowing Toad, it was still looked down upon by many spirit beasts. Therefore, any spirit beasts that came to the Nine Mountains Territory to join them but harbored dissatisfaction or wanted to cause trouble would target it first.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat looked fierce and imposing, not someone to be trifled with. Jade Little Dragon was an azure flood dragon, also not to be provoked lightly. So naturally they turned their attention to Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>As Little Ha returned and sat on the third chair.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat revealed a sharp claw from its tiger paw, tapped the blade handle, and said in a deep voice: "Third Brother, you've been too soft-hearted. Next time there are challengers, kill them directly. Let those trash know that the authority of you, the Third Demon King, cannot be violated!"</p><p></p><p>Little Ha nodded its head, indicating it understood.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat waved its paw, and the demon generals below dispersed, leading demon soldiers to patrol the Nine Mountains Territory and suppress all disturbances.</p><p></p><p>These demon generals were all at the Immortal Realm, and having been taught the Great Demon Technique, they were also under the Red Cat's control.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Demon Technique improved, the Red Cat's colorful fur became like flames, and its aura grew stronger and stronger. Even Jade Little Dragon, the azure flood dragon, felt the powerful tiger's might.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you wouldn't happen to have Celestial Tiger bloodline, would you?" Jade Little Dragon couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe." The Red Cat was indifferent. Although it sensed that after its power increased, its bloodline had undergone several transformations, even if it was Celestial Tiger bloodline, it was different from pure Celestial Tiger bloodline.</p><p></p><p>"My big brother should be back soon. What position should we give him?" The position of Demon King was out of the question for Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"How about Demon Marshal? His strength is sufficient for the role. After all, he is one of the Twelve Spirit Beast Kings of the Divine Realm. Moreover, he's likely to have gained something from this experience," Jade Little Dragon said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm afraid he won't be content with that."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat smiled calmly and said, "There's nothing to be discontent about. We won't mistreat him. Everything is based on strength. Besides, I saved his life this time."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have it figured out!" Jade Little Dragon didn't say anything more. The Red Cat would handle Wind Spirit Tiger's affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has subdued a dragon. I should have a chance to transform into a true dragon!" Jade Little Dragon said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Azure Sea Territory.</p><p></p><p>The azure sea's waves rolled turbulently, submerging some small islands.</p><p></p><p>News of Xu Yan subduing a dragon had already spread, shocking Cloud Sky Island Lord and the others.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was secretly delighted, proud of his decision. Befriending Xu Yan was the most correct thing he had done in his life.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Territory was relatively peaceful. After all, the Heavenly Cavern had been suppressed once by Xu Yan, so there were no major disturbances now.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Turtle raised its head to look at the sky, then hid itself even deeper.</p><p></p><p>"I hope I won't be exposed before I recover." It sighed inwardly. Once exposed, the consequences would be hard to predict.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has subdued a dragon. This is directly offending the True Dragon Clan to death." The Azure Sea Turtle muttered to itself.</p><p></p><p>"But did that old dragon die? They moved from the True Spirit World to Tai Cang. That old dragon might have died along with Tai Cang. Who's in charge of the True Dragon Clan now?"</p><p></p><p>Several dragons appeared in the Azure Sea Turtle's mind.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't worry about this." The Azure Sea Turtle continued to conceal itself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Green Flower Territory, with the collapse of the Dao Realm's Heavenly Ladder, it was naturally also in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>However, after Fang Hao mobilized the world's great forces, combed through the earth veins, and arranged a great formation, the tremors in the Green Flower Territory subsided and stabilized completely.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that no matter how turbulent the Divine Realm became, it could not affect this place.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what happened in the Divine Realm?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had returned from the Great Wilderness and continued to sit leisurely in his chair, watching the winds and clouds of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Just a realm from the Dao Domain falling into the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I see. So the Divine Realm is going to change greatly." Su Lingxiu then excitedly said, "Big Senior Brother has subdued a dragon. A true dragon! That's a legendary existence. I've never seen one before. When Big Senior Brother returns, I must study this true dragon thoroughly!"</p><p></p><p>"You'd better focus on cultivating. With a realm from the Dao Domain falling, some of those fellows from the Dao Domain will surely descend. With your current strength, you'll have trouble even protecting yourself!" Li Xuan shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"I know, Master. I've almost finished my preparations. I'll soon reach the peak of the Void Realm, then break through to the Heaven and Earth Realm!" Su Lingxiu giggled, "Besides, I have you, Master. Who could bully me!"</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial arts ultimately has to be walked by oneself." Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master." Su Lingxiu nodded her little head.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his head to look at the sky, as if piercing through everything. The Dao Domain had three hundred realms with countless powerful experts. There were also many Realm Lord level experts, but for him now, Realm Lord level experts were completely insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Did all seven World Lords die?" Li Xuan was very curious. Even someone as strong as Tai Cang died, so the other six should have died too, right?</p><p></p><p>The first to perish was the Burning Cloud World Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The experts of the Unchanging Divine Palace are quite formidable." Li Xuan had to admire that the experts of the Unchanging Divine Palace were indeed incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, even though Tai Cang had perished so long ago, the Tai Cang World was still safe and sound, showing that Tai Cang had made some arrangements. Even if unable to resist...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the Immutable Divine Palace wouldn't be much weaker.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, Taicang wouldn't have left behind the Taicang Book, intending to cultivate a new lord of heaven and earth for the Taicang realm.</p><p></p><p>"There must have been a traitor? Otherwise, why was the Taicang Book never discovered?" Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>However, these things weren't very important to him. Although his strength at the Established Dao realm was still not comparable to the powerful figures of the Immutable Divine Palace, if a true crisis came, he would be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>"The immutable land beyond chaos, isn't that just chaos itself, or perhaps somewhat different from chaos? I wonder if this immutable land actually has any boundaries."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan developed a strong curiosity about the immutable land beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"Once Tianzi becomes the Heavenly Dao, my strength will also increase, giving me even more confidence. And once Tianzi is able to operate the entire heaven and earth, this realm will undergo a transformation."</p><p></p><p>The Taicang realm was about to become history. </p><p></p><p>In the future, this would be the Great Wilderness realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the schemes of certain realm lords, Li Xuan couldn't be bothered to care, especially since Tianzi would naturally deal with them.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is also close to breaking through to the Heaven and Earth realm."</p><p></p><p>Great changes in heaven and earth were also an opportunity for rapid rise.</p><p></p><p>After subduing the dragon, Xu Yan was only one step away from perfecting the Void-Breaking realm. Once he perfected Void-Breaking, he could prepare to break through to the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Realm has hidden some characters."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked thoughtfully towards a certain place in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"People from Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow? Those few are probably the ones from Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow responsible for this mission, but as for this one..."</p><p></p><p>With Li Xuan's current strength and thorough understanding of the Taicang realm, how could the powerful figures hidden in the Divine Realm escape his notice?</p><p></p><p>Under the eye of the Heavenly Dao, everything was exposed.</p><p></p><p>"A minor realm lord? Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Hidden within the Divine Realm was actually a minor realm lord, equivalent to a current realm lord level powerhouse, and one whose strength was top-tier even among realm lords.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Heaven's Bane?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky, then dismissed this guess.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I won't bother with him."</p><p></p><p>The other party was hiding in the Divine Realm and didn't take action even when true dragons ran rampant and the Divine Realm was in turmoil, seemingly content to watch from the sidelines. Li Xuan couldn't be bothered to deal with them either.</p><p></p><p>"Tianzi should be about done transforming into the Heavenly Dao, right?"</p><p></p><p>Calculating the time, Tianzi's final step in becoming the Heavenly Dao should be complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan focused his consciousness on the Golden Book of the Dao. Since breaking through to the Established Dao realm, he had more uses for the Golden Book of the Dao, especially after obtaining the Dao of Dragon Subduing. He also gained more understanding of how to use the Golden Book of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Golden Book of the Dao. With my current strength, I'm still not able to use it freely."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, what I'm creating in the Golden Book of the Dao are martial arts techniques. When my strength increases to a certain level and I can make more use of the Golden Book of the Dao, what I'll be creating will be Daos!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Tianzi has transformed into the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao. You have obtained the Heavenly Dao Seal!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Golden Book of the Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>A seal containing vast power and unfathomable mystery flew out from the Golden Book of the Dao and landed in the hand of his primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao Seal!</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Heavenly Dao Seal in his hand, this seal was not made of any material, but was formed from the rules of the Heavenly Dao, possessing great Heavenly Dao power.</p><p></p><p>Wielding this seal, the Heavenly Dao was in his grasp. Moreover, when the Heavenly Dao Seal was deployed, it had the power to create heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the Heavenly Dao Seal would continuously grow stronger as his strength increased, and would also continuously improve as the realm operated by the Heavenly Dao improved. The power of the Heavenly Dao rules would become stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, holding the Heavenly Dao Seal, I have enough power to create a realm in the immutable land."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly Dao Seal in hand, he now possessed the power to create heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"However, it's still not strong enough. The realm I could create wouldn't be as powerful as the Taicang realm. But after all, it would be a newly born Heavenly Dao, with huge potential and unlimited room for improvement!"</p><p></p><p>With the Heavenly Dao Seal in hand, even without using the Great Wilderness Divine Form or the Dao Ancestor Halo, just relying on the power of the Heavenly Dao Seal alone, he could bring realm lords a sense of awe in the face of majestic heavenly authority that could not be defied.</p><p></p><p>"Suppressing realm lords would be effortless. Even those formerly powerful minor realm lords could be easily suppressed!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan discovered that the Heavenly Dao Seal operated the Dao of heaven and earth, while a realm lord's domain was a minor realm, or could even be said to be incomplete and defective, needing to rely on a greater realm to exist.</p><p></p><p>Before the Heavenly Dao Seal, they would be easily suppressed, like a strong and robust father with the strength to lift a thousand pounds effortlessly subduing a weak three-year-old child.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness, Tianzi's body had completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>However, in the sky above, clouds suddenly gathered, forming a human shape.</p><p></p><p>Like a giant in the clouds, looking down upon the earth.</p><p></p><p>"Mama, look, there's a person in the sky!"</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Great Wilderness, a five or six-year-old boy suddenly raised his hand, pointing at the human-shaped cloud in the sky and shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the boy's mother looked up. It was just a human-shaped cloud, but a gentle smile appeared on her face, with a doting expression, she said, "That's a very, very powerful expert. Yun'er can become such an expert in the future too."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm, definitely. I want to be like the Sword Immortal, famous throughout the world!"</p><p></p><p>The little boy nodded his head seriously.</p><p></p><p>Then, he knelt on the ground and kowtowed to the cloud in the sky, "Powerful grandfather, please bless Yun'er so that he can join the holy land of Canglan Island in the future and cultivate the supreme martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>In a trance, the name "Heavenly Dao" suddenly appeared in the little boy's consciousness. He kowtowed and said, "Heavenly Dao grandfather, please bless Yun'er so that he can join the holy land of Canglan Island in the future!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, under his mother's astonished gaze, the little boy's body was suffused with light, his physique was transforming, and spiritual energy was pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>Some hidden ailments were instantly cured at this moment, and his talent was transformed.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The woman knelt on the ground, weeping with joy: "The heavens have opened their eyes and finally taken pity on us mother and son!"</p><p></p><p>For some unknown reason, the words "Old Man in Heaven" came out of her mouth, a term she had never used before.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful! Wonderful! The Heavenly Dao is truly wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The little boy was the first to kneel to him, so naturally he had to bestow the care of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Young talent of the Great Wilderness, you have a place. Work hard in cultivation for me, your Heavenly Dao grandfather."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi, newly become the Heavenly Dao, began his path as the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness has become somewhat weak, the speed of cultivation has slowed, and switching to cultivate the Great Wilderness martial arts is not smooth enough. Since there is now me as the Heavenly Dao, respecting the Heavenly Dao can improve martial arts insights and speed up cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>It was time to enhance the strength of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's gaze fell on Canglan Island, the holy land of the Great Wilderness. This place, which the Dao Ancestor had mentioned, was the core area. A place where the Dao Ancestor had stayed was naturally a holy land.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe vaguely had the concept of the Heavenly Dao, letting the martial artists of the Great Wilderness respect the Heavenly Dao. The path of martial arts would become smoother!</p><p></p><p>"You are...?"</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Junhe was shocked to see a rock transform into a young man.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

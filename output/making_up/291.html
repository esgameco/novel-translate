        <h1>Chapter 291</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong remained calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy expression on the face of the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower. Could it be that Wutu would be defeated?</p><p></p><p>This was a matter of the reputation of the Three Perfections Tower, a matter of the honor and disgrace of the Spiritual Sect. They had just suppressed the arrogance of the Alliance of the Distant State, and now they were to be humiliated by a wandering cultivator? He slightly moved his finger, wanting to intervene secretly, but he saw the smiling face of the Alliance Master of the Distant State, as if waiting for him to intervene.</p><p></p><p>His heart sank, remembering the instructions from the Supreme Martial Palace. He realized that the rules of the Celestial Prodigy Confrontation could not be violated by the Spiritual Sect first, but they could find a way to force the Myriad Worlds Alliance to violate them! As for what concerns there were, he did not know.</p><p></p><p>Since the Supreme Martial Palace had given such an order, it was clear that there were factors in the Myriad Worlds Alliance that even the Supreme Martial Palace had to be cautious about.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower sat down and transmitted a voice message to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, I am the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower. I observe that your martial talent is extraordinary, and your swordsmanship is exquisite, truly a rare genius of the Dao of the Sword. How about coming to my Three Perfections Tower?</p><p></p><p>"As long as you come to my Three Perfections Tower, you will be the number one genius of the Dao of the Sword, and I can recommend you to the Supreme Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Once you enter the Supreme Martial Palace, you will become a transcendent genius of the Spiritual Sect!"</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower, how could a wandering cultivator resist the temptation of becoming a genius of the Spiritual Sect? Especially with the opportunity to become a genius of the Supreme Martial Palace of the Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his eyebrows and looked at the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower outside the arena.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower saw him looking and immediately showed a smile, slightly nodding, eagerly waiting for Meng Chong to join them!</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master of the Distant State was alarmed, thinking that if Meng Chong really joined the Three Perfections Tower, it would not be good for them. Moreover, he knew that for most wandering cultivators, being able to enter the Spiritual Sect and become a warrior of the Spiritual Sect was an opportunity to rise from the bottom and achieve a higher status, and few wandering cultivators could resist such temptation.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to transmit a voice message to persuade Meng Chong, even prepared to offer treasures to stabilize Meng Chong, Meng Chong suddenly let out a cold laugh. The Meng Chong who had been calm and composed suddenly unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>An unparalleled, unstoppable sword strike, slicing through layers of sword qi, slicing through sword beams, and sending Wutu's sword flying.</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, Wutu was reduced to ashes!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower's face immediately turned gloomy, with murderous intent surging, and he abruptly stood up, glaring fiercely at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>On the arena, Meng Chong stood holding his sword, contemplating the gains from this battle.</p><p></p><p>As for the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower's murderous intent, he did not care at all.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master of the Distant State showed a smile and said calmly to the Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower, "The Celestial Prodigy Confrontation has its own rules. Are you going to join the battle?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower sat back down, gloomy.</p><p></p><p>After slaying Wutu, Meng Chong inserted his sword to the side and said coldly, "I've heard that the Three Perfections Tower has three great geniuses, and Wutu was one of them. His Dao of the Sword was mediocre, not outstanding. But I don't know how Bao Sheng's fist techniques are.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Invincible Fist Meng Chong, challenge Bao Sheng of the Three Perfections Tower!"</p><p></p><p>The spectators: ...</p><p></p><p>Just now, he was the Sword Sovereign, and now he has become the Invincible Fist. However, everyone knew that Meng Chong was here to challenge the Three Perfections Tower.</p><p></p><p>They were puzzled, could it be that Meng Chong had a grudge against the Three Perfections Tower?</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>A towering figure emerged from the Three Perfections Tower, landing on the arena.</p><p></p><p>With a burly figure similar to Meng Chong's, wearing a pair of fist guards, his face full of anger.</p><p></p><p>Since Meng Chong had directly issued the challenge, the Three Perfections Tower had no choice but to respond. They could not avoid the battle and lose the face of the top-tier Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's have an exhilarating battle!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not use his sword, but clenched his fists, rushing in with bare hands for a physical confrontation with Bao Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Although Bao Sheng wore spiritual artifact fist guards, Meng Chong's fist techniques were even more powerful, even directly resisting Bao Sheng's fists with his bare flesh.</p><p></p><p>It was a pure, hard-hitting battle on the arena, with the two burly figures engaged in close combat, fist against fist.</p><p></p><p>Although Bao Sheng wore fist guards, in the intense battle, he was frequently evading Meng Chong's attacks, appearing hard-pressed.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Meng Chong directly resisted Bao Sheng's fists with his bare flesh, not even furrowing his brows, his robust physique showing no signs of injury.</p><p></p><p>The spectators were all shocked, what a terrifying physique!</p><p></p><p>The result of the battle was no surprise, Bao Sheng was blown away by a punch and reduced to ashes.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists couldn't help but swallow their saliva, this bald youth didn't look fierce, but his hand was so ruthless, directly scattering the opponent's ashes!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was in the midst of the intense battle, his muscles pulsing and emitting steaming heat. He felt that after this great battle, his Indestructible Golden Body had improved, and the effects of the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Temperings had become more obvious.</p><p></p><p>In the martial path of the flesh, the more fierce the battle, the more it could demonstrate one's robustness, and the more one could gain improvement.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Lu Yi? Dare he come and fight?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong wanted to challenge all three great geniuses of the Three Perfections Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Great Xuan City was in an uproar, the fearsome Wutu and Bao Sheng had both been killed.</p><p></p><p>And Meng Chong was going to challenge Lu Yi next.</p><p></p><p>He was going to take down all three great geniuses of the Three Perfections Tower! The wandering cultivators were even more excited, feeling a sense of pride and their heads held high. When they encountered Spiritual Sect warriors, they were no longer timid, but instead raised their heads defiantly.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Sect warriors all had ugly expressions.</p><p></p><p>They even secretly cursed the Three Perfections Tower for being useless, allowing a wandering cultivator to ride roughshod over them! The powerful experts of the Distant State Alliance all showed smiles, although Meng Chong was not a genius of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, he was a wandering cultivator, and as long as he was not on the side of the Spiritual Sect families, he was the object of their support.</p><p></p><p>"Keep a close eye on the people of the Spiritual Sect, if they dare to make a move, don't be polite, we absolutely cannot let Meng Chong be ambushed!" </p><p></p><p>The Alliance Master of the Distant State said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Distant State Alliance nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Perfections Tower's expression was extremely gloomy, his heart filled with murderous intent, but after glancing at the powerful experts of the Distant State Alliance, he had to suppress the killing intent in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The rules of the Celestial Prodigy Confrontation prohibited the Spiritual Sect from making the first move! This was an order from the Supreme Martial Palace, and in such a public setting, they absolutely could not make a move!</p><p></p><p>As for making a secret move, it must be done without being discovered, without any possibility of exposure.</p><p></p><p>But it was obvious that the Myriad Worlds Alliance would not give them that chance!</p><p></p><p>Lu Yi, holding a spear in his hand, stepped onto the arena.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, his first move was a thunderous attack, the great spear like a dragon, fierce and swift, a raging storm sweeping towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong waved his hand, the sword fell into his hand, and he unleashed a sword strike, unparalleled and tyrannical - the Heavenly Earth Dominating Sword!</p><p></p><p>The outcome was no surprise, Lu Yi died.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Three Perfections Tower all had gloomy expressions, wishing they could skin Meng Chong alive.</p><p></p><p>After defeating the three great geniuses, Meng Chong did not leave the arena, standing with his sword and looking around, loudly declaring, "I, Meng Chong, challenge the genius of the Spiritual Domain, who dares to give me guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Silence. No one responded.</p><p></p><p>After the three great geniuses of the Three Perfections Tower had all been killed, who would dare to rashly take action? Moreover, Meng Chong had defeated the three great geniuses in succession, so...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Not the least bit tired? Still want to continue fighting?" Meng Chong furrowed his brows and then said, "I am the wandering cultivator Meng Chong. May I have the honor of challenging the genius of the Lingzong Clan?"</p><p></p><p>He emphasized the words "wandering cultivator" to provoke the genius of the Lingzong Clan.</p><p></p><p>Being looked down upon by a wandering cultivator, the geniuses of the Lingzong Clan would undoubtedly be extremely uncomfortable. For the sake of their face and the dignity of the Lingzong Clan, they would certainly send their geniuses to battle.</p><p></p><p>Still, no one stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Lingzong Clan very arrogant? Don't they look down on us wandering cultivators? How come, at this moment, they've all become useless?"</p><p></p><p>"The so-called geniuses of the Lingzong Clan are truly worthless. They cultivate the best techniques, obtain the most cultivation resources, and enjoy the highest treatment, yet they are not even a match for a wandering cultivator like me."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they still dare to boast that the Lingzong Clan has geniuses, while we wandering cultivators have none. Their shamelessness is truly astounding. Now, come and fight us, will you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the cowardly useless Lingzong!" Suddenly, cold and mocking voices rang out from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>These were the people of the Wanshi Alliance, and as the cold ridicule echoed, the surrounding wandering cultivators also began to chime in.</p><p></p><p>Such an opportunity to step on the Lingzong Clan was rare, and they couldn't afford to miss it. At this, the faces of the Lingzong warriors turned extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"Can we not fight to the death?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a timid voice asked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked in the direction of the voice and saw a disciple of a certain clan, who seemed to want to step forward and fight, but was afraid of losing and being killed, so he hesitated and didn't dare to go up.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine! I, Meng Chong, am not a bloodthirsty person. The fight to the death was not something I decided, but rather the doing of those from the Sanxie Tower, who were eager for death!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said as he scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>The faces of the Sanxie Tower experts turned even more unsightly.</p><p></p><p>But it was indeed Wupu who had proposed the fight to the death! So, it couldn't be blamed on Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Then I will go fight!" The clan genius said with a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The battle resumed.</p><p></p><p>However, while this clan genius was not weak in strength, he was still no match for the three geniuses of the Sanxie Tower. He was defeated by Meng Chong in just a few moves.</p><p></p><p>After the first one stepped up, more and more Lingzong geniuses came forward, though they seemed to be hoping to wear Meng Chong down through a war of attrition. However, Meng Chong was disappointed, as their strength was too weak to provide him with much tempering and improvement for his Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>His gaze shifted to the elders of the Sanxie Tower.</p><p></p><p>"I know the old fellows of the Sanxie Tower are eager to tear me apart. Now, I'll give you a chance. Elders at the Refined Spirit Celestial Middle Stage or below, who dares to come and fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong actually wanted to challenge the elders of the Sanxie Tower? "Young friend Meng Chong, be careful!" The Leizhou Alliance Master hurriedly spoke up to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>"No need for further words. Those at the Refined Spirit Celestial Middle Stage or below, who dares to fight me? I, Meng Chong, am giving you a chance to take your revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then I shall slay you!" An elder of the Sanxie Tower, at the Refined Spirit Celestial Middle Stage and approaching the Late Stage, stepped onto the stage, holding a spear.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's fight!" Meng Chong's blood boiled as he charged forward with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The news spread from the Great Xuan City, and cultivators kept flocking to the city, while the name of the Sword Venerable Meng Chong gradually became known.</p><p></p><p>Pah! One of the Sanxie Tower elders was slain.</p><p></p><p>"Is there anyone else who wants to come out and fight?" Meng Chong continued to issue challenges.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" Another Sanxie Tower elder stepped forward, wielding a treasured sword and immediately unleashing a hidden secret technique.</p><p></p><p>After consecutively slaying three Sanxie Tower elders, Meng Chong's aura was soaring, shocking the surrounding cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Leizhou Alliance all lowered their heads, dejected.</p><p></p><p>He was too strong! After fighting so many battles, he was still at his peak. Didn't he get tired at all?</p><p></p><p>"I'll give the Sanxie Tower one more chance. Elders at the Refined Spirit Celestial Late Stage, who dares to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised the challenge level.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, so you've set your sights on my Sanxie Tower, huh? Let's see how capable you are!"</p><p></p><p>A Sanxie Tower expert at the Refined Spirit Celestial Late Stage stepped up, holding a spear.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression turned serious. The Refined Spirit Celestial Late Stage cultivator was extremely powerful, and he couldn't afford to be careless, even though his own realm had already reached the peak of the Spirit Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, relying on the might of his Indestructible Golden Body, he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Indestructible Divine Armor covered Meng Chong's entire body, making him appear as if he was wearing a golden suit of armor, exuding an extraordinary aura.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of it before!"</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Lingzong experts had gloomy expressions, glaring intently at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>This battle was extremely fierce. Meng Chong's Indestructible Divine Armor was even pierced through a few times, but his flesh remained unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of physique is this? Why is it so terrifying?"</p><p></p><p>"It's comparable to a Spirit Artifact!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the exclamations, a female voice suddenly rang out, "It's too hard, I want to try it too."</p><p></p><p>The cultivators: ...</p><p></p><p>More and more cultivators gathered in the Great Xuan City, until finally, the Lingzong and the Wanshi Alliance had to maintain order, prohibiting those who had not reached the Great Celestial Realm from gathering at the Arena, in order to reduce the crowd.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's name resounded throughout the Great Xuan City.</p><p></p><p>While Meng Chong was displaying his might in the Great Xuan City, Xu Yan had already defeated Cai Yunhong and comprehended Cai Yunhong's Divine Power Physique, experiencing the terrifying power it possessed when unleashed.</p><p></p><p>This battle did not end in Cai Yunhong's death, as it was not a fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's martial dao momentum had grown even stronger, and he set out towards his next destination.</p><p></p><p>To the east of Luo State, the super-first-class clan, the Wood Clan, where he would challenge the Wood Clan genius, Wood Feiming. The Wood Clan's strength and reputation in Luo State far surpassed that of the Crimson Dark Sect and the Azure Cloud Kingdom, but they were relatively low-key.</p><p></p><p>However, the low-key Wood Clan had a not-so-low-key person.</p><p></p><p>The previous generation had produced an extraordinary genius, and because of this genius, the originally low-key Wood Clan had suddenly skyrocketed in fame throughout the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Wood Clan's playboy had quite a reputation in the Spiritual Realm, flirting and causing trouble everywhere, and his romantic escapades were a hot topic in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this had also brought the Wood Clan a lot of trouble, such as stealing the fiancée of a certain Lingzong young master, or having affairs with the widowed ladies of certain clans.</p><p></p><p>The elders of the Wood Clan were constantly troubled by these romantic antics, as they had to help the playboy clean up the mess, providing one compensation after another.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they married the playboy off to a wife, hoping to restrain him, but just a few days after the marriage, the Wood Clan playboy continued his womanizing ways, and his wife angrily returned to her family home, seeking retribution from the playboy's various lovers.</p><p></p><p>Although the Wood Clan playboy had a knack for causing trouble, and the Wood Clan had to compensate a lot of resources to clean up after him, he was a genius with outstanding talent and formidable strength. He had already reached the peak of the Refined Spirit Celestial Realm, and the Wood Clan elders were both loving and hating him.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 31</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 31: It's Not That They Are Too Fragile, But That I Am Too Strong</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was riding on a horse, looking at the two jianghu (martial arts world) people in front of him. They had long knives hanging on their waists, and their expressions were a mix of joy and a hint of coldness.</p><p></p><p>He fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Am I being targeted? Do they want to kidnap me?</p><p></p><p>"But why has no one targeted me before?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be because I haven't been rejected by the marriage with the General's Mansion, so these jianghu people didn't dare to touch me?"</p><p></p><p>He had been looking for a powerful master for days, and while walking alone in the Donghe Prefecture, no jianghu person had dared to kidnap him, the young master of the Donghe richest family.</p><p></p><p>But now, someone had the audacity to plot against him on the official road!</p><p></p><p>The first thing Xu Yan thought of was that he had been rejected by the General's Mansion, so these jianghu people no longer had any reservations and started targeting him.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm no longer the future son-in-law of the General's Mansion, my maternal grandfather is the Censor-in-Chief! (a high-ranking official)"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly realized that even though he was no longer related to the General's Mansion, he was the grandson of the Censor-in-Chief, a powerful minister of the current dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Little fool, just come with us obediently."</p><p></p><p>One of the jianghu people rose up and tried to grab Xu Yan off the horse.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, although there were no passers-by on the official road, they had to act quickly and capture him as soon as possible, lest something unexpected happen.</p><p></p><p>As long as they had Xu Yan in their hands, the following actions would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and grabbed Xu Yan's shoulder, exerting great force to pull him down, but to his shock, it was as if he was grabbing a huge mountain. Xu Yan didn't budge at all!</p><p></p><p>Not good!</p><p></p><p>He felt a chill in his heart and was about to let go and retreat, but suddenly, he felt a hand grip his neck and lift him up.</p><p></p><p>"Who gave you the audacity to come and grab me?" Xu Yan looked at him.</p><p></p><p>The other man saw this and was greatly startled. He quickly drew his sword, leaped into the air, and slashed towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Let go!" His eyes were filled with murderous intent, flashing with ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xu Yan snorted coldly, and with his other hand, he directly met the long sword. Qi and blood aura surged from his arm, and he grabbed it fiercely!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The long sword shattered into several pieces under the impact of the qi and blood aura.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>A powerful qi and blood aura burst out from Xu Yan's hand and instantly blasted the man in midair.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The man in midair exploded instantly, with blood and flesh flying everywhere, shocking Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood aura immediately enveloped Xu Yan's surroundings.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the man whose neck Xu Yan was holding suddenly lost control due to the impact of the qi and blood aura, and his bones and muscles were crushed. He widened his eyes in horror and died on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood aura swept out, carrying the bloody flesh and body parts to the bushes on both sides of the road.</p><p></p><p>"They are too fragile!" Xu Yan said in amazement as he threw the corpse into the bushes.</p><p></p><p>He had only used a bit of his qi and blood, yet he had directly blasted the person to pieces!</p><p></p><p>"It's because I'm too strong!</p><p></p><p>"I'm already on a different level from them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a breath, feeling invigorated. This was the true essence of the martial arts, and he was only at the qi and blood realm, yet he possessed such terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"I still need to improve my control over my own strength. I'll be more careful next time!"</p><p></p><p>After learning this lesson, Xu Yan continued on his way. There were no people on the official road at the moment, and the process of him killing the two jianghu people was not witnessed by anyone, so he returned home with a clear conscience.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Yan'er, you've returned!" </p><p></p><p>Lady Xu joyfully grabbed her son's hand, looking him up and down. He hadn't lost weight or gotten tanned, in fact he seemed a bit more robust, which put her mind at ease. As long as her precious son hadn't suffered, that was good.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, now that you've returned, don't go wandering around. It's not safe out there these days," Lady Xu cautioned.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, where's Father?" Yan'er asked, puzzled. </p><p></p><p>Normally when he returned, his stern father would immediately appear, ready to scold him. But today he was nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Your father went to deal with some business matters," Lady Xu replied, a trace of worry crossing her face.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, has something happened to our family?" Yan'er quickly sensed that there was a problem.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, his father wouldn't be personally handling things.</p><p></p><p>Sighing, Lady Xu explained, "Bandits have appeared on the Jingan Road in Donghe Prefecture, and they've robbed our goods. </p><p></p><p>"Now your father is arranging to have the goods transported again. If they don't arrive on time, we'll have to pay three times the value. </p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, your father will take care of this. You've just returned, are you hungry?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu instructed the servants to prepare a feast to welcome her beloved son home.</p><p></p><p>Yan'er furrowed his brow, then felt a stirring in his heart. </p><p></p><p>"Although I've only just begun martial arts training, the top masters of the jianghu are weak against me. These bandits dared to target my family's goods - they deserve to die!</p><p></p><p>"This is a good chance to test my abilities. Perhaps I can single-handedly wipe out this band of bandits!"</p><p></p><p>It would be the perfect opportunity to try out his skills, while also resolving his family's troubles. His family had spent a lot of money on him over the years, so this must be a valuable shipment of goods.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, where exactly are these bandits? Why hasn't the authorities gone to eliminate them?" Yan'er asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu, unaware of her son's plan to take on the bandits himself, readily told him, "They're on Black Wind Mountain, about 200 li from Jingan Road."</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Pingshan, under the pretext of guarding against the Tianmu Sect's rebellion, has refused to send troops to suppress the bandits. Hmph, it's obviously because he broke off the engagement with our family, so now he's just standing by and watching," Lady Xu said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yan'er understood the situation. This shipment of goods was likely headed to the capital of Qi, traveling along the Jingan Road. The bandits had targeted his family's goods on that very road. There was probably more to this than met the eye.</p><p></p><p>But Yan'er didn't care about any of that. He just wanted to test his abilities by wiping out this band of bandits!</p><p></p><p>"Mother, I just remembered I have something to take care of. I'm going out for a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, where are you going? Come back!" Lady Xu called out urgently.</p><p></p><p>Yan'er went to the stables, saddled a horse, and rode out of the city.</p><p></p><p>"I should reach Black Wind Mountain by nightfall - perfect timing!" he thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>On Black Wind Mountain, a group of jianghu characters had gathered, discussing how to ambush the Xu family's shipment. </p><p></p><p>The bandit leader, a burly man with a hairy chest, had a large cleaver stuck in the ground beside him. In a deep voice, he said, "This mission must succeed. Xu Junhe is a formidable man. If we lose his goods again, he'll surely be prepared. Everyone must not let their guard down!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Boss Bear. As long as Jiang Pingshan doesn't send troops, even with Xu Junhe's abilities, he won't be able to protect the goods!" </p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure suddenly charged up the mountain, surrounded by an intense aura of power. In a fierce voice, he declared, "If you want my Xu family's goods, let's see what you're capable of!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

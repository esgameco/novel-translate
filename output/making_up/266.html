        <h1>Chapter 266</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the Elders of the Yushen Sect were waiting solemnly. </p><p></p><p>The various attendants and disciples were all lined up to welcome them.</p><p></p><p>Their faces were filled with curiosity and excitement, many hoping that Xu Yan would be killed and their grievances avenged.</p><p></p><p>In midair, two figures stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhu Liang and the others immediately became solemn. Leading the way was a young man with a cold, stern face and eyebrows like golden leaves - he was Lu Xingtian, the Second Elder of the Chimeng Sect, following half a step behind him. In the strict hierarchy of the Spiritual Realm, the Second Elder being half a step behind signified that Lu Xingtian would be established as the next Sect Master of the Chimeng Sect. And with his talent, the Chimeng Sect's strength would surely rise to a new level. "Greetings, True Transmitter Lu!"</p><p></p><p>The Elders of the Yushen Sect all paid their respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Lu Xingtian nodded indifferently, and the group entered the main hall and sat down.</p><p></p><p>"Get straight to the point, tell that Xu Yan to come and accept his death. I'm in a hurry, I'll kill him and then have to go back to prepare for my breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Lu Xingtian spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>"True Transmitter Lu, we will certainly convey this message, so that the cultivators of Yuzhou can also witness the grandeur of the True Transmitter Lu.</p><p></p><p>"Let those wandering cultivators know that the genius they see is nothing but a stray dog!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, do it quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Lu Xingtian nodded.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>That day, the major sects and aristocratic families of the Spiritual Realm all received the news that the True Transmitter of the Chimeng Sect had arrived in Yuzhou, and would initiate a battle of geniuses, challenging Xu Yan to a duel! Instantly, the major sects and families were shocked - the Yushen Sect had actually invited the True Transmitter of the Chimeng Sect!</p><p></p><p>Lu Xingtian, with his Divine Radiance Treasure Body, one of the Ten Treasured Bodies, was a renowned genius. Having reached the Great Celestial Realm, he was known as the future number one powerhouse of Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>He had actually come to Yuzhou to fight Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had also killed Cultivators at the Refining Spirit Realm, in the eyes of the sect and family experts, they mostly believed that Xu Yan had used some special means.</p><p></p><p>And due to their inherent impressions, how could a wandering genius compare to a sect genius?</p><p></p><p>So in their eyes, the outcome of the battle between Xu Yan and Lu Xingtian was already determined - Xu Yan would definitely die!</p><p></p><p>They even suspected that Xu Yan might not even show up for the battle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong had finally returned to Yuzhou, arriving at the headquarters of the Myriad World Alliance, only to be shocked to find that the headquarters had been taken over.</p><p></p><p>After wandering through several secret places, he finally contacted Yu Gao.</p><p></p><p>In the manor, it was as usual.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hurriedly came, his expression somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, this is a big problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his eyebrows and asked, "What big problem has happened, has the Yushen Sect discovered the information you provided?"</p><p></p><p>"No." </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou shook his head, his expression grave. "The Yushen Sect has invited the True Transmitter of the Chimeng Sect of Luozhou to have a life-and-death battle with you!"</p><p></p><p>"The True Transmitter of the Chimeng Sect?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others also gathered around, curious.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou took a deep breath and said solemnly, "The Chimeng Sect is a top-tier sect in Luozhou. Its current True Transmitter, Lu Xingtian, possesses one of the Ten Treasured Bodies, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body. His talent is monstrous.</p><p></p><p>"At the Great Celestial Realm, he has reversed the order and killed Cultivators at the Refining Spirit Realm, his strength surpassing imagination.</p><p></p><p>"He recently killed three Refining Spirit wandering cultivators in Luozhou, fully awakening the potential of his Treasure Body, and is about to break through to the Refining Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Yushen Sect has invited him to Yuzhou to initiate a battle of geniuses against you, Brother Xu."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou detailed Lu Xingtian's feats, especially how he, at the Great Celestial Realm, had reversed the order and killed Refining Spirit Celestials - what a terrifying strength!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened with great interest. "The True Transmitter of the Chimeng Sect, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body? Interesting, where is he planning to challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>After being in the Spiritual Realm for so long, he had finally encountered a true genius of the realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Radiance Treasure Body, one of the Ten Treasured Bodies.</p><p></p><p>"How can a Great Celestial reverse the order and defeat Refining Spirit Celestials? The might of the divine soul cannot be resisted by cultivators below the Refining Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>As is well known, no matter how strong a Great Celestial is, they are absolutely no match for a Refining Spirit Celestial. Even if hundreds of Great Celestials joined forces, they would still find it difficult to contend with a Refining Spirit Celestial, the main reason being the might of the divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The pressure of the divine soul would suppress the cultivators, and those below the Refining Spirit Realm would find it difficult to withstand this pressure. Their speed, agility, and other abilities would all be suppressed. How could they fight under such circumstances?</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xingtian has the Divine Radiance Treasure Body, one of the Ten Treasured Bodies. His divine radiance has the ability to resist divine soul pressure. And as the True Transmitter of the Chimeng Sect, once he enters the Celestial Realm, he will have Refining Spirit Celestials to spar with.</p><p></p><p>"This has enhanced his resistance to divine soul pressure, and these top-tier sects also possess special techniques that can greatly reduce the impact of divine soul pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Having Refining Spirit Celestials to spar with from a young age, and with his Divine Radiance Treasure Body, he is no longer affected by divine soul pressure. </p><p></p><p>"The reason why top-tier sects are so powerful is due to their inheritance and foundations."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others couldn't help but sigh. Those top-tier sects were indeed extraordinary. The notion that Great Celestials could not reverse the order and defeat Refining Spirit Celestials only applied to ordinary sects and families, and to wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For the geniuses of top-tier sects, who had undergone rigorous training, cultivated powerful secret techniques, or possessed powerful Treasure Bodies, the might of the divine soul no longer had a significant impact on them. </p><p></p><p>Whether it was in terms of cultivation methods, cultivation environment, or the weapons they possessed, they were far beyond what wandering cultivators could compare to. This was the fundamental reason why sects and aristocratic families were so powerful and dominated the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>If even top-tier sects were so strong, how formidable would the geniuses of the supreme sects be?</p><p></p><p>"Very good, I was just wishing that Yuzhou had no geniuses, no opponents worthy of a battle. Since he is coming to challenge me, it's a good opportunity for me to experience the strength of a sect's True Transmitter."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, be careful, even though you may not necessarily lose to him, it's too dangerous if you show yourself."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou hurriedly persuaded.</p><p></p><p>"This so-called battle of geniuses, although the rules state that in a battle between geniuses, the elders and protectors of the respective parties cannot intervene regardless of the outcome.</p><p></p><p>"But given the nature of the sects and aristocratic families, if their True Transmitter is in danger, they won't just sit back and watch. </p><p></p><p>"They won't even consider us wandering cultivators as worthy of their attention!"</p><p></p><p>Being from a prominent family himself, Shen Haizhou was naturally well-versed in the character of the sects and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "Rules? If they don't abide by the rules, the one who will suffer will be them. I will definitely accept the challenge."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou still wanted to persuade further, but Suling Xiu hummed and said, "They have protectors, they have powerful figures backing them up, but we also have a master! My master is invincible!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, Xu Yan and the others all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The master is invincible!</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was stunned, and glanced at the mysterious young man leisurely reading books in the courtyard, and no longer tried to persuade further.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, Suling Xiu was right, with their master here, they need not fear the sects and aristocratic families not following the rules. They need not fear them bullying the weak.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go gather more information."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou took a deep breath and said.</p><p></p><p>"Lu Xingtian, the Divine Radiance Treasure Body, I hope you won't disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>After Shen Haizhou left, Xu Yan went to his master.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to go meet the Crimson Darkness True Transmission and see this so-called Divine Radiance Treasure Body, to see if it is truly as formidable as they say," said Xu Yan excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "If you want to go, then go. The rules and regulations are not important. The rules in this world are made by the weak to be followed, while the strong make the rules."</p><p></p><p>With a calm tone, he exuded the aura of a powerful master.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan replied, filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. That Crimson Darkness True Transmission, while it may sound impressive, challenging Xu Yan would be akin to courting death.</p><p></p><p>Divine Radiance Treasure Body? One of the Ten Treasured Bodies? Xu Yan possessed a Divine Bone Spiritual Body, which was far superior.</p><p></p><p>In terms of martial dao and natural talents, he completely outclassed the Crimson Darkness True Transmission.</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Darkness True Transmission was one realm higher, with Xu Yan's monstrous abilities, crossing realms to slay a Treasure Body genius was nothing extraordinary. Not to mention a Treasure Body, even if it was a Spiritual Body, it would still be doomed to die by his hands.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out a communication talisman and glanced at it, surprised to receive a message from Yu Gao regarding the Crimson Darkness True Transmission, as well as a person who wanted to see the Elder Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, there is someone named Wen Yong from the Myriad Generations Alliance who wants to see you," Fang Hao said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised, "Wen Gege is back in Yuzhou? Then let's meet him."</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit Jade Essence was a gift from Wen Yong back then, and he had also taken the blame for killing Dai Yingying.</p><p></p><p>With permission granted, Yu Gao brought Wen Yong to meet them.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the manor, Yu Gao immediately took Wen Yong to pay respects to Fang Hao, the new Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong was puzzled, "Senior Yu, aren't you the Alliance Master?"</p><p></p><p>"I've stepped down, and Fang Hao has been unanimously elected as the new Alliance Master. Wen Yong, you are a genius of the Myriad Generations Alliance in Yuzhou, and you should also take on greater responsibilities," Yu Gao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Alliance Master," Wen Yong said, though he was curious as to why the young Fang Hao had become the new Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>However, since Yu Gao had stepped down and received unanimous support, Fang Hao must possess extraordinary abilities.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at Wen Yong, the Elder Brother's friend. At not even thirty years old, he had already reached the Great Celestial Realm, which was quite rare among the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Wen Gege, it's been a while!" Xu Yan greeted him happily.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Gege!" Wen Yong was overjoyed to see Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After the initial pleasantries, Wen Yong explained the purpose of his visit.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Gege, the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families have no credibility, and this Luo Xingtian of the Crimson Darkness True Transmission is extremely powerful. We cannot fight him!" Wen Yong said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his shoulder and said, "Wen Gege, I appreciate your concern, but I will take on this battle. It's a good opportunity to meet the genius of the Spiritual Sects."</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong became anxious, "In the Genius Confrontation, although there are rules that outsiders cannot interfere and the Protectors cannot intervene, the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families will not abide by their credibility. If Luo Xingtian is defeated, his Protectors will surely intervene, and the Cultivating Deity Sect's powerful Cultivating Deities will also join the fray. Xu Gege, how can you alone withstand so many powerful Cultivating Deities?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled and said, "Since there are rules, we will follow them. If they don't follow the rules, do they really think the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families can do as they please? You can rest assured, if they don't follow the rules, they will be courting their own destruction!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong sighed, "I know Xu Gege must have Protectors as well, but two fists cannot defeat four hands. In the past, the Genius Confrontation of the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy was so powerful, yet it ultimately fell apart. The strength of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families is far beyond what it appears on the surface."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled, as he had heard a familiar name from Wen Yong's words - the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>This was the higher institution of the Inner Domain's Seven Stars Academy, where the geniuses of the Seven Stars Academy could enter the Spiritual Realm and study at the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy? Wen Gege, can you tell me more about it?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong looked at Xu Yan with suspicion. There were rumors that Xu Yan was a genius cultivated by the remnants of the Myriad Stars, and he now wanted to confront the geniuses of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families again.</p><p></p><p>From Xu Yan's expression, it seemed he was not very familiar with the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy was once renowned and powerful, rivaling the top Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families, with the idea of spreading martial dao throughout the world. It recruited martial dao disciples and geniuses from all over, providing opportunities for those of humble origins to cultivate powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"At its peak, even the Imperial Princes of the Great Zhou would go to the Myriad Stars to study. The scattered cultivation geniuses would flock to the Myriad Stars, and it shook the balance of power in the Spiritual Realm and the Aristocratic Families.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy's conflict with the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families eventually escalated, leading to the Genius Confrontation rules being established. Until the calamity of the Blood Demon, the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy was ultimately destroyed, its spirit broken. Since then, the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy has disappeared from the Eighteen Prefectures of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Demonic Monarch came from humble origins, and his first rise was through cultivation at the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, with guidance from the Myriad Stars experts. Even though he later fell into the Demonic Dao, he still spared the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, which is why the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families completely severed ties with the Myriad Stars.</p><p></p><p>"Without the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, there would have been no Blood Demon Calamity, and no powerful scattered cultivators would have emerged. The truth behind the Genius Confrontation is only known to the older generation, and the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families have even erased the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy from history.</p><p></p><p>"Nowadays, there are very few who know about the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, and even the martial arts cultivated there have been distorted, portrayed as gifts from the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families. They want to completely erase the traces of the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy."</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong spoke with a mix of anger, resentment, and nostalgia.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

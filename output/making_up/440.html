        <h1>Chapter 440</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's gaze turned slightly cold as he said indifferently, "If it's not related to family secrets, just speak freely. Yan'er is not an outsider!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Liang Quan suddenly realized that this woman must be Yun Yan'er.</p><p></p><p>He immediately said respectfully and flatteringly, "My apologies, Young Master Jiang. This matter is rather special, but since it's Miss Yun Yan'er, there's no need to avoid discussing it."</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's hand moved slightly. He was prepared to kill Liang Quan if necessary. In his view, Liang Quan was merely a martial artist from a subordinate force, with a status akin to a servant of the Jiang clan. How could he know any confidential matters?</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to Young Master, I recently went to Changyun Border and encountered someone..." Liang Quan paused, then said in a grave voice, "Jiang Buping. I encountered Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming raised an eyebrow, and Yun Yan'er also looked over.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, he's not dead yet?" Yun Yan'er said with a light laugh.</p><p></p><p>"If that's all, it's hardly a secret. You've come to disturb me for this..." Jiang Tianming's gaze gradually turned cold, murderous intent emerging.</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan was almost breaking out in a cold sweat. He hurriedly said, "Young Master, Jiang Buping has recovered! He hasn't lost his mind, and his strength is even greater than before!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" Yun Yan'er suddenly stood up. "Impossible, he had already lost his mental faculties!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's face also darkened as he stood up. "Liang Quan, you should know that Jiang Buping's loss of mental faculties and reduction to a useless person was confirmed by the clan elders."</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, Miss Yun, every word I say is true. When I saw him, I could hardly believe it myself. But the fact is, not only has he not lost his mind, his strength has increased. He seems to have cultivated some powerful soul technique. With one strike he killed an Outer Realm True Spirit Armored Beast..."</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan hurriedly reported the details.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I knew this matter was of great importance, so I rushed back immediately."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming frowned, while Yun Yan'er's expression was grave. She opened her mouth to speak several times but stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Have you reported this to anyone else?" After a long while, Jiang Tianming asked.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I came straight here to report to you first. I haven't told anyone else!" Liang Quan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. I appreciate people like you who know how to act appropriately. Stay here in this courtyard and follow me from now on. You won't be short of rewards." Jiang Tianming said with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Liang Quan had come to pledge allegiance to him, and he was a clever person too.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master!" Liang Quan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>From now on, he would be one of the followers of the Jiang clan's young master. His status would be far higher than even the patriarch of his own clan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may go now." Jiang Tianming nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I take my leave!" Liang Quan retreated respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tianming, how is this possible? Could it be someone who just looks like him? After all, people who look alike do exist in this world." As soon as Liang Quan left, Yun Yan'er couldn't help but speak.</p><p></p><p>"When one's soul is tainted by immutable qi, loss of mental faculties is inevitable. Even immortal realm experts, let alone true kings or heavenly venerables, can't avoid this fate if tainted.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping's soul being tainted by immutable qi was a confirmed fact. The clan elders all verified it at the time. That's why Jiang Buping was abandoned and expelled.</p><p></p><p>"Now he's recovered? This is no ordinary matter!" Jiang Tianming's expression was extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping being sabotaged, leading to his soul being tainted by immutable qi, was no longer a secret. The clan elders all knew about it. But since he had become useless with no value, there was no need to investigate further.</p><p></p><p>As for Yun Yan'er, she would certainly marry into the Jiang family, because she was the "culprit". If the Yunshang Sect Master didn't agree, the Jiang clan would have an excuse to take action.</p><p></p><p>Crippling one of the Jiang clan's peerless geniuses deserved some kind of accountability.</p><p></p><p>Those who knew the inside story naturally understood, and how could Jiang Buping himself not know who had sabotaged him? So once he rose to power, he would surely come to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Tianming, what should we do now?" Yun Yan'er asked with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him, of course!" Jiang Tianming said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, kill him. We were careless before." Yun Yan'er nodded happily.</p><p></p><p>"This is a small matter. Even if he's reached the immortal realm, let alone not having reached it yet, he's sure to die. Don't worry, I'll handle this." Jiang Tianming said with a reassuring smile.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!" Yun Yan'er nodded.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to recover even after being tainted by immutable qi, Jiang Buping, what secrets do you have? If I could obtain them..." Jiang Tianming pondered.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't be tempted by the ability to dispel immutable qi and recover from it? What kind of opportunity or technique was this? In the depths of Yun Yan'er's eyes, there were also some ideas.</p><p></p><p>The Taikun Border remained peaceful. The chaos of the Heavenly Abyss had not erupted for several hundred years, entering a relatively calm period.</p><p></p><p>On this day, two immortal realm experts left a certain courtyard of the Jiang clan.</p><p></p><p>Not long after these two immortal realm experts left, another immortal realm expert departed from the Yunshang Sect, crossing the border.</p><p></p><p>Yuanping Border.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had just finished cultivating, his expression elated. He had finally integrated another trace of immutable qi, strengthening his soul and improving his Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Taikun Border, Jiang family, Yun Yan'er, just you wait. I, Jiang Buping, will definitely wash away all humiliation. Your so-called glory is nothing but a joke in my eyes."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping clenched his fist, his gaze fierce.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hunt down that Outer Realm True Spirit comparable to the immortal realm."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was excited.</p><p></p><p>With one experience under his belt, hunting a second immortal realm Outer Realm True Spirit was naturally not a problem.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As this Outer Realm True Spirit fell, the other weaker Outer Realm True Spirits were startled and hurriedly fled the Heavenly Abyss, returning to the outer realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Jiang Buping knew that before long, more Outer Realm True Spirits would descend.</p><p></p><p>For these Outer Realm True Spirits, the Heavenly Abyss was a treasure trove, far more comfortable than the outer realm. If the Heavenly Abyss wasn't restricted, Outer Realm True Spirits above the immortal realm would likely have entered long ago.</p><p></p><p>The martial world of Yuanping Border was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Someone with strength below the immortal realm had hunted and killed two immortal realm Outer Realm True Spirits. Although it was through sneak attacks, it was still unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>News of Jiang Buping cultivating an extremely powerful soul technique naturally spread throughout Yuanping Border. One who could cultivate such a powerful soul technique must be a peerless genius from a great border.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that even though some immortal realm experts coveted the technique, they didn't dare to make a move.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping continued to train in Yuanping Border. When immortal realm Outer Realm True Spirits appeared in the Heavenly Abyss again, he entered to hunt them, while also spending more time collecting and extracting immutable qi.</p><p></p><p>The name "Spear God" also spread throughout Yuanping Border.</p><p></p><p>Some people wanted to befriend Jiang Buping and find out which great border he came from, but Jiang Buping remained aloof, maintaining an unapproachable demeanor. After a while, no one came to bother him anymore.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>A heart-shaking roar came from the celestial cave. The martial artists watching from afar all turned and fled! Jiang Buping had finally failed!</p><p></p><p>"Why is this creature's soul so strong?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was very frustrated. This was his first failure. This celestial true spirit's instinct for danger was much sharper than the previous celestial king's true spirit. </p><p></p><p>It probably belonged to a higher level of celestial true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Instead of immediately licking the pills, it continued to launch angry attacks. Jiang Buping had no choice but to avoid its sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>However, this celestial true spirit locked onto him tightly, frantically launching attacks and chasing after him. Soon after, another celestial true spirit joined in as well.</p><p></p><p>Eventually, all the celestial true spirits in the entire celestial cave were hunting Jiang Buping, as if a beast tide had erupted.</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly, the Gun God has failed!"</p><p></p><p>"My god, it's the first time I've seen so many enraged celestial true spirits. We can't stay in the celestial cave anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Damn! I just killed a celestial true spirit and didn't have time to take it away!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all the martial artists in the celestial cave frantically fled, moving far away from it.</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>All the celestial true spirits in the entire cave were in a rage, killing anyone they saw and chasing frantically. </p><p></p><p>Usually, they would only attack if someone entered their territory or if they wanted to hunt for food. It had never been like this before.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, the celestial true spirit that Jiang Buping had attacked and killed was of a relatively high rank. Its roar had the effect of a beast king, causing all the celestial true spirits to go berserk.</p><p></p><p>"We can't stay in the celestial cave for now."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping fled in a hurry. It was too scary - all the celestial true spirits in the entire cave had gone mad and were rushing to kill him, their eyes blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He killed a celestial true spirit blocking his path with one shot from his gun, and Jiang Buping rushed out of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the celestial cave, Jiang Buping planned to find a place to seclude himself and cultivate for a while, then re-enter to collect immutable qi after the celestial cave had calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Two figures walked out from the realm gate of Yuanping Realm.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask which realm the two of you are from, and what important business brings you to our Yuanping Realm?" </p><p></p><p>The immortal celestial venerable guarding the realm gate appeared before the two.</p><p></p><p>"Taikun Realm, Jiang Clan, here on orders to capture a criminal," </p><p>one of them said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"So you're from the Taikun Realm."</p><p></p><p>The immortal celestial venerable of Yuanping Realm was alarmed inwardly and became more respectful in demeanor. After speaking, he retreated. Since this was an internal Jiang Clan matter, they naturally couldn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>After the two immortal celestial venerables from the Jiang Clan left, another immortal celestial venerable walked out from the realm gate.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed sir..."</p><p></p><p>"Taikun Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer answered coldly before hurrying away.</p><p></p><p>"People from the Jiang Clan of Taikun Realm? Has something happened in the Jiang Clan?"</p><p></p><p>The immortal celestial venerable of Yuanping Realm wondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, it's best not to get involved in the grudges of such a great clan."</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and stopped paying attention. Although he was already an immortal celestial venerable, he still didn't have much confidence when facing experts from great realms.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was just leaving the celestial cave, communicating with his third senior sister via a transmission talisman in his hand, when suddenly his expression tensed and the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon appeared in his hand instantly.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Celestial Venerable!</p><p></p><p>And the visitors were not friendly!</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, you've indeed recovered!" </p><p>One of them said, somewhat shocked.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping looked at the two with an indifferent gaze, sneered and said, "So what if I've recovered? Who sent you to find me?"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, since you've recovered, come back with us."</p><p></p><p>"To be able to recover after being contaminated by immutable qi, you're truly a peerless prodigy. After returning, the clan will surely cultivate you greatly!"</p><p></p><p>The two immortal celestial venerables spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sneered and said, "Do you really think I don't know anything? If it were two old undying clan elders who came, I might believe they had the intention of bringing me back to the Jiang family. But who are you two? Although you're immortal celestial venerables, you haven't entered the core of the Jiang family. What qualifications do you have to say such things? If I'm not mistaken, the person who sent you is Jiang Tianming, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was also a bit surprised inwardly. He had been in Yuanping Realm all along and had never revealed his name or background, yet Jiang Tianming had obtained the news so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, know your place. Since you're unwilling to come back obediently with us, you can't blame us for using some methods!"</p><p></p><p>One of them spoke as he stepped forward, directly approaching Jiang Buping, with the powerful aura of an immortal celestial venerable pressing down.</p><p></p><p>He was very confident that no matter how much of a prodigy Jiang Buping was, he still hadn't entered the immortal realm and could be easily subdued.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's gaze turned cold. The other party's contempt and carelessness was the perfect opportunity to strike!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A gun thrust out fiercely, cold light flashing, the killing intent fierce.</p><p></p><p>"Ant..."</p><p></p><p>That immortal celestial venerable sneered disdainfully, but in the next moment, his expression became horrified as a chill arose.</p><p></p><p>Crisis, an intense crisis suddenly descended!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at this moment, he was shocked to discover that this gun strike from Jiang Buping seemed to be aimed not at his body, but at his soul. The gun light didn't appear in his vision, but in his soul!</p><p></p><p>Boom! In the moment of crisis, he hurriedly activated a secret technique, instantly condensing his soul power into a shield to block the gun light.</p><p></p><p>As an immortal celestial venerable from the great Jiang Clan realm, he had naturally cultivated soul secret techniques. This soul defense technique had blocked attacks more than once before.</p><p></p><p>Puff! However, this shield condensed from soul power was like paper, pierced through by one gun strike, the long gun stabbing into his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>The intense pain in his soul made him let out a shrill scream involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"You're seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The other immortal celestial venerable's expression changed drastically. His aura erupted as he instantly manifested the power to control the heavens and earth, reaching out to grab Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Having succeeded with one strike, Jiang Buping hurriedly retreated.</p><p></p><p>The other party's soul defense technique was too low-level and trashy for him. And in such a rush, how could it withstand his attack?</p><p></p><p>However, that was the only strike he could make. Now that the opponent was on guard and wielding the power of heaven and earth, it would be impossible to suddenly stab into their soul again.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is still lacking a bit after all!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If he could increase his strength just a bit more, even immortal celestial venerables would be unable to resist the power of his Extreme Soul Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, facing two immortal celestial venerables, although one of them had his soul injured, he could only avoid their sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>"Catch him, his soul secret technique is very powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The injured immortal celestial venerable took out and swallowed some spirit medicine while enduring the intense pain in his soul as he chased after Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and tell Jiang Tianming to wash his neck clean and wait for death!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's figure flickered as he escaped from the area of heaven and earth controlled by the opponent. Just as he was about to flee far away, his expression suddenly changed. He thrust out his gun while simultaneously shifting his body, instantly dodging to another side.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The place where he had originally been was slashed through by a blade of light.</p><p></p><p>Another immortal celestial venerable had appeared.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 412</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As soon as Jiang Buping heard this, he felt it made sense, and immediately nodded: "Alright, Fourth Senior Brother, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>"Just go ahead and attack!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao smiled brightly. In an instant, the Qimen formation appeared, like a vortex resembling an abyss, slowly rotating with Fang Hao at its center.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jiang Buping raised his hand and struck out with a palm, the Extreme Soul power surging forth like a tidal wave, slashing out in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The vortex churned violently, seemingly unable to defend against the Extreme Soul power. A powerful force appeared to lock onto and target the martial dao primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao raised an eyebrow. This force had some similarities to Eldest Senior Brother's Xun Wind Sword Intent, but was even more extreme and violent.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! A beam of light appeared as Fang Hao stepped forward. The power of Qimen martial arts transformed into a restriction, with the Qimen formation surrounding him. In an instant, it became a seal and formation targeting the soul.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Finally, it collided with Jiang Buping's Extreme Soul martial power, successfully defending against it.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, your Extreme Soul martial arts are truly domineering!" Fang Hao couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"However, you're still not a match for me, your Fourth Senior Brother. You only have raw power."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao didn't use his Qimen Arsenal, but instead waved his hand to set up a grand formation using the Qimen of Heaven and Earth. He continuously deployed restrictive techniques to seal and protect his own primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression remained unchanged as he wielded a long spear in his hand, its radiance bursting with Extreme Soul power as he attacked repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The battle didn't last long. After all, Jiang Buping had just entered the sect and hadn't cultivated any divine abilities belonging to the Extreme Soul martial arts, so naturally he was no match for Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fang Hao's current Qimen martial arts were comparable to the Divine Appearance realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was also roughly at the Divine Appearance realm stage, but this was his first time facing Qimen martial arts, so he lacked understanding of them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his own martial arts weren't skilled enough and he lacked Extreme Soul martial techniques, so naturally he was no match for Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Qimen martial arts," Jiang Buping said with a sigh, not feeling discouraged.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, your Extreme Soul martial arts are actually very powerful. In terms of pure killing power, I'm actually somewhat inferior," Fang Hao praised.</p><p></p><p>Qimen martial arts weren't primarily about intense killing power, but rather focused on being "extraordinary", versatile, and having numerous techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Also, Fifth Junior Brother, you lack a divine weapon - a divine weapon for killing souls. When I have time, I'll forge one for you."</p><p></p><p>As long as there were suitable materials, Fang Hao could forge weapons targeting the soul.</p><p></p><p>His Qimen Arsenal contained weapons that could defend the primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was Xu Yan, Meng Chong, or Su Lingxiu, the divine weapons they were nurturing all had the power to defend the primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, let me try too!" Su Lingxiu said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Third Senior Sister, this..." Jiang Buping hesitated. Third Senior Sister was skilled at refining pills and healing injuries and illnesses, but her combat ability seemed ordinary, right?</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu frowned slightly and said with a huff: "Do you really think your Senior Sister has no combat ability? It's just that I don't like fighting, but that doesn't mean the Pill and Medical martial arts lack combat power. Just go ahead and attack."</p><p></p><p>She felt a bit frustrated inside. How had she given people the impression that she only knew how to refine pills and heal people, but didn't know how to fight? She actually had killing divine abilities too.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Jiang Buping struck out with his spear. The Extreme Soul power instantly pierced into Su Lingxiu's body.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister!" Jiang Buping was shocked. How could Senior Sister not even withstand this attack?</p><p></p><p>"No big deal!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu raised her head proudly. A tree not far from the courtyard suddenly cracked open with a snap, instantly losing all signs of life.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Su Lingxiu was completely unharmed, without even a scratch.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, did you really think your Senior Sister would be injured so easily? Your strength is not bad, but still not enough to hurt me."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu looked smug.</p><p></p><p>"Damage transfer!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was astonished. At this moment, he deeply understood that none of his senior brothers and sisters were simple - they all had their own unique martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This brief sparring session made Jiang Buping feel that his Extreme Soul martial arts seemed to be the weakest?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even hurt Third Senior Sister, and might not even be her match. Yet Third Senior Sister was supposed to be the weakest one.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had become the weakest one.</p><p></p><p>"You've just entered the sect. You only have Extreme Soul power but no Extreme Soul martial techniques, so it's normal that you can't fully utilize your strength. Your martial arts mindset is still stuck on Taicang martial arts, which won't work," Li Xuan spoke up at this point.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Jiang Buping looked respectfully at his master. "Master, do you mean that although I've successfully cultivated Extreme Soul martial arts, I don't have the heart of Extreme Soul martial arts and lack Extreme Soul martial techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said solemnly: "Extreme Soul martial arts, the extreme of killing souls, is a martial art of ultimate killing. It has its own martial techniques, divine abilities, and martial weapons.</p><p></p><p>"You still have a long way to go. Next you should condense your own Extreme Soul martial weapon, cultivate Extreme Soul martial divine abilities and techniques.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme Soul martial weapon is a soul-killing weapon, different from ordinary divine weapons. You need to forge it yourself..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained about Extreme Soul divine weapons. Besides needing to find unique and powerful treasured materials, they also required forging and nurturing with Extreme Soul power.</p><p></p><p>"For the forging method, you can ask Fang Hao for guidance. The core principle is forging with Extreme Soul power. You'll have to find the materials for forging the divine weapon yourself.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul divine weapons can be continuously improved. The longer they are nurtured, the stronger they become. They can improve along with your own strength."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping listened with great fascination. He never imagined Extreme Soul divine weapons could be so profound and powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, the treasured materials needed for forging were quite rare, as they were related to the soul and thus relatively scarce.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Extreme Soul Martial Arts Classic. Study it carefully, especially to understand how to forge Extreme Soul divine weapons."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed with his finger, transmitting the Extreme Soul Martial Arts Classic into Jiang Buping's soul.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was excited just from a quick glance at the classic. The Extreme Soul martial techniques and divine abilities were so profound and powerful.</p><p></p><p>Forget about cultivating all of them - just comprehending one or two would greatly increase his strength.</p><p></p><p>Next, Jiang Buping began to ask Fang Hao about basic weapon forging methods. Although Extreme Soul martial arts used Extreme Soul power for forging, the forging methods weren't too different from regular weapon forging. And who could compare to Fang Hao when it came to weapon forging?</p><p></p><p>"Weapon forging is actually very profound. I've only achieved minor accomplishments in the Dao of forging. However, forging your divine weapon requires using Extreme Soul power, so although others can't help you forge it, the forging method still affects the weapon's strength.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of a divine weapon depends on many factors. I'll teach you the most core but also most basic principle. Once you understand this method, you'll know how to continuously forge and improve divine weapons..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"... troops."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao began to teach Jiang Buping the method of refining, adjusting it to incorporate the characteristics of the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon to better suit Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>After teaching Jiang Buping how to forge weapons, Fang Hao selected suitable precious materials for him to craft the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Fang Hao did not lack forging materials. Even the rarest materials were available to him in some quantity. After all, the three major factions of the Qinghua Realm, as well as those Immortal Heavenly Venerable, all sought his services. When asking him to forge divine weapons, they provided no small amount of rare materials.</p><p></p><p>For Jiang Buping's current stage, there was no need to worry about materials. He had enough to forge an Extreme Soul Divine Weapon. As for the subsequent nourishing and upgrading of the divine weapon, that would be up to him.</p><p></p><p>But once the foundation of the divine weapon was laid, the rest would be much simpler.</p><p></p><p>After receiving the materials to forge the divine weapon, Jiang Buping began to seclude himself again, on one hand comprehending the Extreme Soul Martial Arts Classic and cultivating Extreme Soul martial arts techniques, on the other hand studying how to forge his own Extreme Soul Divine Weapon.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also began to busy himself. Since chaos was about to erupt in the Divine Realm, and he was managing the Qinghua Realm, he needed to take more action, while also preparing to enhance his strength.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the Qimen martial arts, which had a rather special cultivation method. His mastery of array techniques had also reached a stage for further improvement.</p><p></p><p>"The transmission range of message talismans is still too small after all. However, with the new message talismans, transmitting messages across the entire world and the entire Divine Realm should not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao first began to refine an upgraded version of the message talisman.</p><p></p><p>How to make the transmission range of message talismans wider?</p><p></p><p>There was only one way - to use the laws of heaven and earth as the foundation for transmission.</p><p></p><p>The next level of message talismans would use the Dao principles as the foundation, but Fang Hao was unable to refine those at his current stage.</p><p></p><p>However, he could now use the laws of heaven and earth as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of heaven and earth govern the world. Even Immortal Heavenly Venerables and stronger beings cannot destroy them. Using these laws of heaven and earth to transmit messages..."</p><p></p><p>The more Fang Hao thought about it, the more feasible it seemed. He selected one of the many laws of heaven and earth, using its essence as the medium, refining it into the message talisman to serve as a bridge for transmission.</p><p></p><p>This way, the transmission range of the message talisman would surely be greatly expanded.</p><p></p><p>After successfully refining the message talisman, Fang Hao began to plan the next stage of his deployment. He already had a plan.</p><p></p><p>To arrange a grand formation that would encompass the entire Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, to use the entire Qinghua Realm as the foundation for the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>"Once the grand formation is set up, will that be when my strength greatly increases, comparable to the Void-breaking Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>However, to set up such a grand formation would require the cooperation of the three major factions and the assistance of Da Yue Emperor and the other two.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning of chaos in the Divine Realm, this formation is necessary to ensure the stability of the Qinghua Realm. Once the formation is complete, the Heavenly Abyss will no longer be a threat."</p><p></p><p>"Enemies from outside will be killed by the formation as soon as they enter the Qinghua Realm. How could a formation based on the entire Qinghua Realm be resisted by warriors at the Immortal Heavenly Venerable level?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao believed that Da Yue Emperor and the others would support his decision. With the assistance of the three major factions, completing the setup of the formation was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>The materials needed to set up the formation were also extremely vast, and this also related to his Heaven and Earth Qimen Array. He wanted to integrate the Heaven and Earth Qimen into the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>Using the Qinghua Realm as the array!</p><p></p><p>The more Fang Hao thought about it, the more excited he became. In his mind, he envisioned the day when the Qinghua Realm would become his Heaven and Earth Qimen Array. Once successful, within the Qinghua Realm, he could control the Heaven and Earth Qimen Array, easily killing Immortal Heavenly Venerables with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Of course, once the formation was complete, he would be able to control the entire Qinghua Realm. The matter of using the Qinghua Realm as his Qimen Array could not be told to Da Yue Emperor and the others. Otherwise, those Immortal Heavenly Venerables, feeling threatened, would not agree to it.</p><p></p><p>Even with his master's deterrence, they would not sincerely assist, and might even deliberately create loopholes.</p><p></p><p>"Each Immortal Heavenly Venerable needs to be given an array disc, especially Da Yue Emperor and the other two. They will surely demand to maintain their advantage in strength. This is not difficult."</p><p></p><p>"How can I make them work harder?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Heavenly Venerables seemed to have reached the peak of cultivation. What realm was beyond the Immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>If there was a chance to break through the Immortal realm after setting up the grand formation, would they work harder?</p><p></p><p>"What's beyond the Immortal realm? How to cultivate it?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was puzzled, so he summoned Feng Yan.</p><p></p><p>"What realm is beyond the Immortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan blinked and scratched his head, saying, "I'm not too sure. Immortals have no worries about lifespan unless killed by someone. As for what's beyond the Immortal realm, I don't understand either."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added, "There's only a vague concept, possibly merging with heaven and earth? True merging with heaven and earth, not just the unity with heaven and earth of the Immortal realm, but actually controlling a part of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"After all, the unity with heaven and earth in the Immortal realm is not truly becoming one with heaven and earth. As for how to merge with heaven and earth, it's still far beyond me. Even Da Yue Emperor can't touch upon it for now."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, whether the spiritual energy of the Divine Realm is sufficient to support a warrior merging with heaven and earth is also an unknown."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao pondered, merging with heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't get a clear answer from Feng Yan, he could only ask his master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally didn't know what realm was beyond the Immortal realm, but how could he, as a supreme expert, not know? Moreover, although he didn't know what realm was beyond the Immortal, based on his understanding of the Taicang martial arts, he had some comprehension of cultivation beyond the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>He had also heard what Feng Yan said earlier. Was the breakthrough beyond the Immortal realm merging with heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal realm unites with heaven and earth, controlling a part of heaven and earth, but this control is ultimately in the form of an external force. Merging with heaven and earth, on the other hand, is truly becoming one with heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Immortal realm, merging with heaven and earth, what was the purpose? Naturally, it was to condense the laws of heaven and earth, to comprehend the laws. This must be the cultivation beyond the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan smiled and said, "Beyond the Immortal realm, it's nothing more than comprehending the laws, gathering the power of the laws. What you need to do is simply use the grand formation to guide the rhythm of the laws of heaven and earth, enhancing the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. This way, under the grand formation, it will be easier for Immortal Heavenly Venerables to cultivate, giving them a chance for breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't explain what realm was beyond the Immortal realm, as he didn't know either. But this didn't prevent him from giving Fang Hao guidance on how to make a group of Immortal Heavenly Venerables work hard.</p><p></p><p>"The rhythm of the laws?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The aura surrounding that robe is a trace of the rhythm of the laws."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed out.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's eyes lit up. He had realized how to guide the rhythm of the laws. Wasn't there already a catalyst?</p><p></p><p>Although he might not be able to do it immediately, by the time the grand formation was fully set up and completed, he would surely be able to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>Finally, there was a goal to make Da Yue Emperor and these Immortal Heavenly Venerables work hard.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 526</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The world of witches and demons disappeared, but it didn't truly vanish completely. Rather, it merged into the Taicang world, just in an unexpected way.</p><p></p><p>The Taicang world was no longer the same world as before. It had transformed into a new world - the Great Wilderness world. </p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was divided into yin and yang, and the part from the witch-demon world became the Yin Realm of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Dao operated and yin and yang cycled, a new order of the world was born.</p><p></p><p>This process was gradual and could not be completed overnight. Time flew by swiftly, and in the blink of an eye, ten years had passed.</p><p></p><p>For powerful beings, ten years was but the snap of a finger.</p><p></p><p>The various realm lords who had been immersed in the world's changes and the division of yin and yang gradually awakened from their contemplation. Their hearts were greatly shaken as they sensed the somewhat unfamiliar world, feeling at a loss for a moment.</p><p></p><p>What alarmed them even more was that there seemed to exist some supreme rules in the world. These were no longer the original laws of the world. Even they could not defy these supreme rules.</p><p></p><p>This meant that from now on, these realm lord level powerhouses could no longer be truly supreme and unrestrained. Above them were inviolable supreme rules.</p><p></p><p>However, these supreme rules also seemed to be supremely fair and would not target them specifically. In fact, comprehending the supreme rules seemed to offer a way to increase one's strength.</p><p></p><p>It was a very contradictory state. On one hand, they were no longer supreme and unconstrained. On the other hand, it seemed a new path had opened up in the martial way, allowing them to continue advancing.</p><p></p><p>"Where did the Three Hundred Realms go?" a realm lord asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"I saw some special places that seem to have been transformed from the Three Hundred Realms."</p><p></p><p>The realm lords who had awakened were exchanging information with each other.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the once familiar Taicang world had become strange. Even more terrifying was that there was an extremely powerful being who could crush a realm lord with one hand, making them not dare to commit any offense.</p><p></p><p>They were afraid that one careless move would offend that mysterious powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Although Realm Lord Wan Tao was not a top powerhouse, he was no weakling either. Yet he was turned to ashes with just a light pinch.</p><p></p><p>This was probably something only the Lord of Heaven and Earth could do.</p><p></p><p>"Where are Tianshai and Diying?" a realm lord asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>All the realm lords began to carefully explore. They saw Ao Lie, Realm Lord Xiaoyao and others who were still in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>But Tianshai, Diying, and even the seven from Meiwu were nowhere to be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Tianshai, Diying and Meiwu's group are all dead?"</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed that a special place seems to have appeared in the world? That seems to be what the witch-demon world transformed into."</p><p></p><p>"Could Tianshai and the others be there?"</p><p></p><p>The realm lords discussed quietly among themselves.</p><p></p><p>At one point, an authoritative voice entered the ears of all the realm lords:</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness world is divided into yin and yang, establishing the cycle of reincarnation. Tianshai and Diying defied the Heavenly Dao and are punished to enter the Yin Realm, responsible for building the Yin Realm to atone for their sins!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>They looked towards the location of the Yin Realm. It was gloomy and dark there, with an eerie aura that made one's heart tremble.</p><p></p><p>The desolate Yin Realm was silent and vast, deep and frightening. Even realm lord level powerhouses would likely not be able to withstand staying there for long periods without their minds being affected.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai and Diying were actually punished to do hard labor in the Yin Realm. This was absolutely a huge torment.</p><p></p><p>They knew that even someone as strong as Tianshai could not resist this punishment.</p><p></p><p>The voice of the Heavenly Dao sounded in their ears again:</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu, Duwu, Liwu, Yanmo, Jumo, Bamo, and Chimo, since you came from the witch-demon world, and the Yin Realm was transformed from the witch-demon world, you seven are hereby punished to enter the Yin Realm from this day forward. Maintain order in the Yin Realm. Those who render meritorious service may atone for their sins and establish a foothold in the Yin Realm."</p><p></p><p>Meiwu's group of seven were also cast into the Yin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"From this day forward, the living beings of the witch-demon world shall enter the Yin Realm to enrich its vital energy and become beings of the Yin Realm."</p><p></p><p>The living beings of the witch-demon world were sentenced to the Yin Realm.</p><p></p><p>The realm lords who had allied with Tianshai now wore nervous expressions.</p><p></p><p>They worried about also being punished and sent to the Yin Realm. That place looked deep and gloomy, clearly not a good place to be.</p><p></p><p>In the Yin Realm, Tianshai wore an expression of unwillingness and dejection. A figure walked out from his body and stood silently as well - it was Diying! They had failed! After all their scheming, they thought victory was in their grasp and that no one but them could be the Lord of Heaven and Earth. But in the end they had failed.</p><p></p><p>The Taicang world had also become a thing of the past as of today.</p><p></p><p>The world now was the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>He raised his head unwillingly, "If not for the Immutable Divine Palace, I, Tianshai, would not have been born in the wrong era. Otherwise, how could I have failed like this!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai was proud.</p><p></p><p>He believed that he was born in the wrong era, missing too many opportunities and the right time to rise up. Moreover, he was not given enough time, which led to such a failure.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai subconsciously believed that the world's transformation and Taicang becoming the past was due to the Immutable Divine Palace's invasion.</p><p></p><p>A figure appeared before Tianshai - a youth wearing purple robes. Although he tried hard to appear dignified, he could not completely conceal his playful and mischievous nature.</p><p></p><p>"What does this have to do with the Immutable Divine Palace? From the moment you schemed to usurp the authority of Heaven and Earth, you were destined to fail," Tianzi said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai was a talented individual. The Great Wilderness needed such talent, especially when facing the threat of the Immutable Divine Palace. Strong individuals like Tianshai could not be killed.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Yin Realm had just been established and needed major construction. This kind of hard labor could be left to Tianshai as punishment for him.</p><p></p><p>The necessary punishment could not be lacking.</p><p></p><p>Let him do hard labor for himself!</p><p></p><p>The more powerful beings in the Great Wilderness, the greater the feedback to the Heavenly Dao. This would allow him to become stronger and have a chance to confront that person from the Immutable Divine Palace. Only then would he have the power to make the Immutable Divine Palace experience the might of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, these powerful beings could not be easily eliminated unless their crimes were unforgivable. After all, these powerful beings were the nutrients that strengthened the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Realm lord level powerhouses were ultimately not far from taking the next step. As long as they comprehended the Heavenly Dao, they could forge a new path.</p><p></p><p>This was the fastest way to enhance the Heavenly Dao in the shortest time possible.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, cultivating new realm lord level powerhouses from scratch would take a considerable amount of time. Tianzi now needed to enhance the Heavenly Dao as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he only punished Tianshai and the others without eliminating them. If they performed well, they could even be rewarded. The Yin Realm needed strong individuals to maintain order.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Tianshai asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt the youth before him was extremely terrifying, emanating a majestic aura as if he were - the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>Tianzi smiled brightly, holding up a purple pearl in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Tianzi Pearl, a toy given to me by Taicang. My name is Tianzi, though of course, you can also call me the Heavenly Dao now!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's pupils constricted. He finally understood why the Tianzi Pearl had gone out of control - because it had been reclaimed by its master.</p><p></p><p>"You were in Taicang all along. How did I not know about you?" Tianshai's face was full of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he had been schemed against by Tianzi from the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"It's perfectly normal that you didn't know about me. Xiaoyao and Yuyao knew about me. If you had known about me, you wouldn't have had the delusion of trying to usurp the authority of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I am Tianzi, born alongside heaven and earth. I am the second master of this world, with Taicang naturally being the first."</p><p></p><p>Speaking of Taicang, Tianzi became emotional for a moment, then continued: "But Taicang is in the past now. Currently it's Dahuang, the Dahuang world is my world, and I am the Heavenly Dao of Dahuang."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a chance to be a laborer in the Underworld. If you do well, perhaps the Underworld will be given to you to manage later, and you'll be granted the status of Ruler of the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Tianshai fell silent. His pride told him he would rather perish than suffer such humiliation doing menial labor. </p><p></p><p>However, reason told him this could perhaps be an opportunity. </p><p></p><p>The Underworld was newly established, and no one knew what its future held. If it was built well, perhaps it could become an influential force in the Dahuang world?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the gloomy and eerie Underworld, it was definitely not a good place, at least not for him currently. If he agreed, he would suffer greatly in the future.</p><p></p><p>But he had no choice. Tianshai even suspected that even if he wanted to die, he probably couldn't, as he was firmly controlled by the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>It was simply a choice between voluntarily accepting punishment and building the Underworld to atone, or being forced to accept punishment and build the Underworld to atone. The treatment and results between the two were vastly different.</p><p></p><p>"It's too dark here," Tianshai sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld will have light too," Tianzi chuckled. "But the Underworld is the Underworld after all, it naturally won't be bright and sunny. There will always be some differences."</p><p></p><p>"I will do my best to build the Underworld, but the threat from the Unmelting Divine Palace will come soon," Tianshai sighed, feeling somewhat unwilling and helpless, yet also a sense of resignation.</p><p></p><p>"I knew you were a sensible person, Tianshai." Tianzi smiled happily. Capable people like Tianshai were rare in the Dahuang world. He appreciated talent and naturally wouldn't recklessly kill talented individuals of the world.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Underworld, Meiwu and six others sat dejectedly, looking at the Underworld. Some places felt familiar, after all it was transformed from the Demon Shaman world.</p><p></p><p>However, they were now punished here. </p><p></p><p>They couldn't even leave the Underworld if they wanted to.</p><p></p><p>Even working together, they couldn't defy the rules of the Heavenly Dao, while the Heavenly Dao rules had the power to erase them.</p><p></p><p>"I've seen you before!" Meiwu said with a complex expression, gritting her teeth when she saw Tianzi appear.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi said cheerfully: "You seductive woman, of course you've seen me before. You even tried to seduce me back then."</p><p></p><p>They were old acquaintances! </p><p></p><p>After all, Meiwu was the ruler of an ancient small world, one of the followers of the Demon Shamans. She had often come to play in the Taicang world in the past, using her seductive powers to manipulate people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>She had once tried to seduce Tianzi too, but Tianzi as the spirit of the world naturally couldn't be seduced by her. The end result was that she failed.</p><p></p><p>"You're actually still alive!" Meiwu glared at Tianzi with an angry and complex gaze.</p><p></p><p>"The world hasn't disappeared, so of course I'm still alive," Tianzi smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"You have a grudge against Xu Yan, but Xu Yan is very magnanimous. Since you used the Green Spirit Jade Bamboo as compensation, he won't hold it against you, so I won't make things difficult for you either."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meiwu jumped up angrily, "Xu Yan..." </p><p></p><p>Then she sat back down dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's master wasn't Xiao Yao, but that terrifying being.</p><p></p><p>And the sword planted in her body was also given by that person, just to teach her a lesson. She should feel lucky she wasn't killed.</p><p></p><p>The Green Spirit Jade Bamboo being taken by Xu Yan was probably a good thing too?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan took so many treasures from me, I've always been at a disadvantage. He should look after me a bit considering how many treasures I've given him!" Meiwu said through gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was stunned for a moment. How could this woman be so thick-skinned?</p><p></p><p>He scratched his head, "I don't care about your grudges with Xu Yan. I'm here to inform you that from now on, the Demon Shamans will be creatures of the Underworld. You will dwell in the Underworld, and the cultivation methods for the Underworld will be gradually provided to you."</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld is vast, with great prospects. You should seize the opportunities. I'm telling you this much because we're old acquaintances."</p><p></p><p>Meiwu frowned and said: "This place is so gloomy and the environment is harsh. I accept that you've relegated us here, but what crime have the creatures of the Demon Shaman world committed?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi thought for a moment and said: "The rules of the Underworld are related to the principles of the Demon Shaman world. They evolved from it and are most suitable for you Demon Shamans. This is actually your treasure land."</p><p></p><p>"I, Tianzi, won't deceive you. This place may seem gloomy, but it's a key part of the cycle of reincarnation. It will be extremely important for the world in the future. In terms of intelligence, Tianshai is smarter than you all. Since you've cooperated with Tianshai before, just continue to work with him."</p><p></p><p>Meiwu wanted to say something more, but Tianshai impatiently waved his hand and said: "I have many things to attend to. That's all for now."</p><p></p><p>At the original location of the Taicang Domain, now the Ancient Continent of Dahuang.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"It really is you!" Taimiao sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the Taicang world has already become history. This is now Dahuang!" Tianzi raised his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"What are you trying to do? Are you trying to erase all traces of Taicang's existence?" Taimiao said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang is dead, Dahuang must be established. This is my world."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Tianzi's expression was solemn, without a trace of his previous mischievous attitude.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I am the master of this world. What I say goes!"</p><p></p><p>"Taicang couldn't resist the Unmelting Divine Palace, only Dahuang can. I will let the Unmelting Divine Palace taste what the power of the Heavenly Dao is like. I will definitely avenge Taicang!"</p><p></p><p>Taimiao opened his mouth, then suddenly fell silent.</p><p></p><p>This world belonged to Tianzi. Only he had the right to inherit the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to inform you, not to seek your opinions. From now on, this is Dahuang. Your realm will be the Dahuang Grotto-heaven. I won't take it back, but I will reclaim any Grotto-heavens without masters."</p><p></p><p>"In the future, only the capable will be able to rule a Grotto-heaven!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Tianzi looked up towards the outside of the world and said with a snort: "Just you all wait. Sooner or later, I'll let you experience what the power of the Heavenly Dao is like."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Taimiao and said: "You've received guidance before, so contemplate it well. Perhaps you can forge a new path. Comprehending the Heavenly Dao is your only way forward now."</p><p></p><p>After finishing, Tianzi disappeared from the spot. As the Heavenly Dao, he was too busy now.</p><p></p><p>A new world, new rules, everything seemed to start anew. He needed to continue perfecting the Heavenly Dao, continue enhancing the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>With the Demon Shaman world merging in, the world was divided into yin and yang, and the power of the Heavenly Dao increased as a result. The entire world was also expanding.</p><p></p><p>Devouring the Unmelting Chaos Realm, turning it into part of the Dahuang world. Although the speed was slow, the world was slowly growing stronger. This was the first time the world had started to expand since the creation of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

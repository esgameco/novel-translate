        <h1>Chapter 474</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Taicang Book, Tianzi sighed with emotion and said, "If my guess is correct, the Taicang Book should be in the borderlands, and not too far from me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "You're quite perceptive. This book is indeed not far from you."</p><p></p><p>"Venerable Ancestor of the Dao, with the Taicang Book in your hands, you are now the master of the Taicang world," Tianzi said as he flipped through the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>"This world..." Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable Ancestor of the Dao surely doesn't care about it, but I wonder if anyone has ever obtained the Taicang Book before," Tianzi asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This book is actually uninteresting. I live in seclusion here, why would I care about these things? It was just a coincidence that I took on disciples, and my second disciple discovered it..." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed to the Dao principles in the Taicang Book and said, "To become the Heavenly Dao, the first thing you need to do is to operate the principles, and integrate all these principles into one..."</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Xuan began to teach Tianzi the methods of the Heavenly Dao based on the principles described in the Taicang Book - how to operate the principles, how to modify them, and how to integrate them.</p><p></p><p>To become the Heavenly Dao, there was another crucial step - Tianzi must transform into principles himself, using himself as the core to integrate and operate the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was the spirit of heaven and earth, so it was not difficult for him to transform into principles without losing his self-awareness. However, he would ultimately have to give up his current physical body.</p><p></p><p>This meant he had to disperse this body, and the process of dispersing the body was inevitably somewhat painful.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao is formless. Once you become the Heavenly Dao, who can find you? You will be omnipresent, operating heaven and earth, strengthening the world with the rules of the Heavenly Dao, continuing to expand the world. As the world grows stronger, you will also become stronger..." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited about his concept of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>If successful, the Daxia world would continuously grow stronger, and even have the opportunity to break through the entire Unformed Realm and turn it all into part of this world.</p><p></p><p>"So I won't have a body anymore?" Tianzi looked a bit depressed.</p><p></p><p>"If you become the Heavenly Dao, why would you care about a body? The world will be your body. You can transform into any living being. Within the world, every blade of grass and tree, all living things can become your body.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, as the Heavenly Dao, you must follow the rules. Otherwise, if you act recklessly, the world will fall into chaos, which is not good for the Heavenly Dao either..." Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Tianzi nodded seriously. "Let those bastards who are watching me never find me again. One day, I will make them taste the mighty power of the glorious Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"I will now remove some of your shackles. Take Daxia as your starting point and embark on the path of the Heavenly Dao." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and removed some of Tianzi's shackles, allowing him to move freely within the Daxia realm.</p><p></p><p>"Once you successfully become the Heavenly Dao of Daxia, extend to the Spirit Realm, Divine Realm, and finally the entire world..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was extremely excited, clenching his fists. "I will definitely succeed. I will become the Heavenly Dao. Taicang is dead. From now on, this is the Daxia world, my world!"</p><p></p><p>"Ahh... it hurts so much! I'll endure it! You guys just wait, all this pain today is because of you. And that terrifying guy, one day I will make you taste my glorious Heavenly Dao power..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi screamed in agony, cursing and swearing as his body gradually dispersed, finally turning into a ball of purple light.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the purple light merged into the world. In a trance, it seemed to have transformed into a principle, but this principle was somewhat different from the others.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the warriors of Daxia all looked up in confusion, not knowing why, but feeling that the sky seemed somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't quite put their finger on how it was different. It was as if there was a heavenly majesty contained within.</p><p></p><p>"Hahaha, I'm finally free, I'm finally carefree..." </p><p></p><p>A voice that no one could hear rang out in the Daxia world. Tianzi looked at every blade of grass and tree in Daxia, at every cultivating person, extremely excited and finding it all very interesting.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, I'm the Heavenly Dao now. I need to have dignity, I need to have rules..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi took a deep breath and began to establish the rules of the Heavenly Dao, taking the first step to becoming the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already taught him how to establish the rules of the Heavenly Dao and what rules to establish, so Tianzi just needed to follow his instructions.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the sky of Daxia with a bright smile, watching as Tianzi was transforming into the Heavenly Dao, and couldn't help but feel anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao ah, Taicang had no Heavenly Dao, but Daxia has a Heavenly Dao. Those who covet Daxia will ultimately have to bear the might of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Although Daxia's strength had progressed rapidly, its foundation was still shallow. The spiritual energy had indeed improved, but due to the short time, there was not enough accumulation, and there was a lack of heavenly and earthly treasures.</p><p></p><p>Now that Tianzi had become the Heavenly Dao of Daxia, his primary task was to quickly increase Daxia's strength, allow heavenly and earthly treasures to appear in Daxia, and even expand Daxia's territory.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had taught Tianzi everything about how the Heavenly Dao strengthens the world, how to establish the rules of the Heavenly Dao, what kind of rules are beneficial to both the Heavenly Dao and promote the strengthening of the world, and how to promote more efficient cultivation for warriors.</p><p></p><p>And now, Tianzi was becoming the newborn Heavenly Dao, in the process of transformation, in the process of establishing the rules of the Heavenly Dao. This required some time and process.</p><p></p><p>But it wouldn't take too long for Tianzi to become the Heavenly Dao of this part of the Daxia world. After he became proficient in operating the rules of the Heavenly Dao and improved Daxia's strength, he would gradually and continuously expand, eventually incorporating the entire world.</p><p></p><p>In the future, there would only be the Daxia world, and no Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>Taicang was dead, Daxia should be established! From the moment Tianzi shouted this sentence, the fate of the Taicang world was determined.</p><p></p><p>"This world, after all, is now related to me," Li Xuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Those guys in the Dao Realm, they think too much. Wanting to fight for the position of the world's master is purely wishful thinking. Just wait to bear the might of the glorious Heavenly Dao in the future."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was gleeful inside.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi had been locked up for so long, while those realm lords had been living comfortably. How could Tianzi tolerate this? He would definitely not spare those realm lords from trouble.</p><p></p><p>Daxia was changing, and this change was silent and imperceptible. The warriors of Daxia couldn't even detect how the changes in Daxia were different from before.</p><p></p><p>After all, since the increase of spiritual energy in Daxia, changes in the world had been constant.</p><p></p><p>"He's about to become the newborn Heavenly Dao," Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The remaining shackles on Tianzi didn't need his help to remove. As Tianzi became the Heavenly Dao, he could slowly remove the shackles himself as the Heavenly Dao expanded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was waiting for feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao. The Heavenly Dao was his creation, and it was also his bestowal of a new concept to this world, so he would surely receive generous feedback.</p><p></p><p>"It should allow my strength to further improve," Li Xuan was secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>Nothing was more satisfying than an increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't be bothered to pay attention to the changes in the Divine Realm anymore. He was in Daxia, guiding Tianzi on how to transform into the Heavenly Dao, how to be a good Heavenly Dao, and how to establish the rules of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>These rules were not only the foundation of the world's operation but also the source of the Heavenly Dao's strength. They also needed to have the fundamental principle of "supreme impartiality". All things in the world...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Spirit, all impartial.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Tianzi, as the Way of Heaven, ultimately has his own preferences. Therefore, the rules of the Way of Heaven will also impose some constraints on himself, rather than acting recklessly.</p><p></p><p>Once the rules are violated, there will be a warning.</p><p></p><p>However, once the rules of the Way of Heaven are established, Tianzi's original consciousness can detach from the rules, allowing them to operate independently. Without the influence of Tianzi's original consciousness, the rules of the Way of Heaven will naturally be fair.</p><p></p><p>But this does not mean that Tianzi has separated from the Way of Heaven or is unable to control its rules. Rather, his original consciousness exists in a state that does not interfere with the rules.</p><p></p><p>When necessary, Tianzi can directly control the rules of the Way of Heaven, such as dealing with great enemies by actively wielding the power of the rules.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructs Tianzi in this way also considering that Tianzi, being youthful in nature, tends to act purely based on his preferences, which would deviate from the proper concept of the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The original consciousness does not interfere with the rules of the Way of Heaven. If Tianzi wants to grant someone an opportunity, he would use his own power of the Way of Heaven, rather than bestowing it under the rules.</p><p></p><p>There is ultimately some difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>This way, it balances the fairness of the rules of the Way of Heaven while giving Tianzi a certain degree of freedom.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Way of Heaven cannot be accomplished overnight. Even though the Great Wilderness is not large and Tianzi is the spirit of heaven and earth, the Way of Heaven is still a new path.</p><p></p><p>However, the hardest part is getting started. Once Tianzi becomes the Way of Heaven of the Great Wilderness, he will have taken an important step. After familiarizing himself with the fundamentals of the Way of Heaven, he can prepare to operate the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Time flies. Li Xuan was delighted to establish the Way of Heaven for the world, looking forward to feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao. As for the situation in the Divine Realm, he couldn't be bothered to pay attention anymore.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Xuan stood in the small village he had crossed over to. The former houses were long covered by vines, and that big tree had grown even more lush.</p><p></p><p>"Fate is truly wondrous!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan hadn't come here seeking a master and successfully cultivated the technique he had made up, he would have either been trapped in the small village, growing old alone, or found a way to leave the village for the small town.</p><p></p><p>Because of Xu Yan's arrival and successful cultivation of the technique he had made up, he finally embarked on the path of a master, striving for the great cause of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, in a sense, this world was already under his control. He was, in a sense, the master of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Within the Cang Heaven, he was invincible!</p><p></p><p>And the Cang Heaven would soon become the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The Way of Heaven of the Great Wilderness was his lineage.</p><p></p><p>"This Dao Ancestor has come to spread the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time the golden light that poured forth seemed to transform into a golden great dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. Had feedback on the Way of Heaven arrived?</p><p></p><p>Then, he became puzzled. Tianzi was still a bit short of becoming the Way of Heaven. Could the Golden Book of the Great Dao provide feedback in advance?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has subdued a true dragon. You have obtained the Dao of Dragon Subduing!"</p><p></p><p>Dragon Subduing!!!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. What had happened in the Divine Realm? It had only been a short time since he last paid attention, how had his senior disciple subdued a dragon? Where did the dragon come from? The Dragon Subduing Palm actually subdued a dragon?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan used this to subdue a true dragon!</p><p></p><p>"My senior disciple is truly capable!" Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden light, like a great dao, instantly coiled around his primordial spirit, gradually disappearing into it.</p><p></p><p>The Dao of Dragon Subduing!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was comprehending the Dao of Dragon Subduing.</p><p></p><p>This was a dao, a dao in the truest sense, closely related to the concept of dragon subduing he had expounded upon earlier.</p><p></p><p>Subduing dragons is also controlling dragons! The great dao of dragons!</p><p></p><p>"Dragon subduing, so that's how it is. Now I'm not just the Demon Ancestor, I'm about to become the Dragon Ancestor too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan came out of his comprehension, his mouth twitching as he couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that he looked up towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>With one look, he discovered that in just a short time, the Divine Realm had been turned upside down, the situation had changed dramatically. A certain realm in the Dao Realm was falling, connecting with the Divine Realm, becoming an area of mutual access between the Divine Realm and the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The unity of heaven and earth of Tianshai and Diying was beginning to be implemented at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is getting more and more interesting. They're vying for the position of master of heaven and earth, wanting to use this to break through the shackles of realm lord and become the master of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, they've taken the wrong path. In other worlds, they might be able to seize the authority of heaven and earth through this, but not in the Cang Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Cang is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh that Cang was truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>It was indeed worthy of being the foremost of the seven masters of heaven and earth, with strength that overshadowed the other six masters of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And as strong as Cang was, it had still fallen.</p><p></p><p>How terrifying must the expert in that divine temple in the Unchanging Land be.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple has subdued a dragon. I wonder what kind of dragon it is."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Yan's current strength, even though the Dragon Subduing Palm was, in a sense, intended for subduing dragons, if the true dragon was too strong, he wouldn't be able to subdue it.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon at the Tianhe realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already made a guess.</p><p></p><p>"This is a young dragon, not yet mature."</p><p></p><p>True dragons were once the top existence among true spirits. Among the seven masters of heaven and earth, one was a true dragon, ruling over all true spirits.</p><p></p><p>"A mature true dragon is no weaker than a God Venerable martial artist. Xu Yan's current strength couldn't subdue a mature true dragon, so he must have subdued a young dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The young dragon ambushed by Tianshai and Diying must have a significant background. This is meant to provoke the dragon realm to act, using the aura of true dragons to impact the Divine Realm, further connecting the Dao Realm and Divine Realm, forming a kind of unity of heaven and earth in a sense.</p><p></p><p>"They might even steal part of the true dragon aura from the dragon realm, introducing it into their own realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instantly understood the purpose behind this.</p><p></p><p>"This is interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. The true dragon realm had moved into the Cang Heaven before the great change in the world. Along with the true dragons, many other true spirits had moved in, now all affiliated with the true dragon realm.</p><p></p><p>The world of the true spirits, including the true dragons, had probably perished in that battle back then. Even if it hadn't perished, it must have fallen into the hands of the Unchanging Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>The master of the true spirit world had probably fallen as well.</p><p></p><p>After all, Tianzi had been locked within the world and didn't know the specific circumstances of the great battle or what had happened to the other worlds.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at Tianzi. In just a few days, he would transform into the Way of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness would truly begin to rise.</p><p></p><p>"Tianzi, this Dao Ancestor is going to watch the show."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand and took a step, instantly disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi naturally sensed the changes in the Divine Realm and Dao Realm. After all, he was the spirit of heaven and earth. Even though he was locked up, he could still perceive some changes in the world.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 74: Consecutive Harvests, the Shocking Xue Wuxin</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin was furious, unwilling, and depressed, but he knew he couldn't continue fighting, otherwise in the end it would be him who would be exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Recover from the injuries, restore full strength, and then come take his life!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin glared menacingly at Xu Yan below.</p><p></p><p>"The consumption is too great, go to the nearby cities and do a blood sacrifice to recover first!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After slashing down, he directly flew away from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Don't go! Continue fighting!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hurriedly chased after him on the ground, he still hadn't had his fill of fighting.</p><p></p><p>The more he fought, the more enlightened he became. He suddenly realized that warriors must fight.</p><p></p><p>A warrior who cannot fight has no future.</p><p></p><p>"That's Yunshan County, what is he going to Yunshan County for? My master is in Yunshan County."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched Xue Wuxin's figure disappear from sight, feeling a bit puzzled. </p><p></p><p>The direction he went was precisely Yunshan County!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Meng Chong's strength, growing stronger day by day, and was extremely satisfied, looking forward to the harvest that his second disciple's entry would bring.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that Meng Chong's talent was indeed strong, especially in the Martial Dao of the physical body. In such a short time, he had already tempered to the Copper Bone level, and was almost at the Gold Bone level.</p><p></p><p>However, from Copper Bone to Gold Bone, there was a bottleneck that needed to be broken through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan believed that the Gold Bone bottleneck would be nothing for Meng Chong, the only difficulty was probably the Diamond Lotus Bone.</p><p></p><p>"I am already at the Innate Realm now, and my second disciple has just entered the Qi and Blood Realm, will his entry be able to contribute to the improvement of my strength?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The Diamond Lotus Bone will definitely have an effect, and the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor should also allow my physical body to further improve."</p><p></p><p>Combining the orthodox Martial Dao and the Martial Dao of the physical body, how strong would his own strength be?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Shi Er had made a small breakthrough in his cultivation, actually starting to refine his skin, and he was originally a top master in the jianghu. The process of refining the skin was not difficult for him, it was just that his cultivation speed was much slower than Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er is not that old, in his thirties, to be able to become a top master in the jianghu at this age, it shows that he still has a certain talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still quite satisfied with this servant.</p><p></p><p>He was efficient in handling matters, and his culinary skills were also excellent. Even though he could live without eating, he still had a desire for delicious cuisine.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er went out to buy chickens.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was diligently cultivating, and Li Xuan was sitting in the chair, leisurely.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has had a sudden enlightenment of the Transposition Technique in the midst of a fierce battle, your Transposition Technique has reached mastery!"</p><p></p><p>Golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Bagua pattern appeared in Li Xuan's mind, and the Transposition Technique had been grasped and cultivated to the level of mastery.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a sudden enlightenment of the Transposition Technique in the midst of a fierce battle?</p><p></p><p>Where was the fierce battle?</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's strength, he should be invincible in Qi State, even if it was against a thousand soldiers and horses, it would not be enough to plunge him into a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>This meant that Xu Yan had encountered a powerful enemy!</p><p></p><p>"Is it a warrior from this world, or a fierce beast like the Fire-Maned Wolf?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned and thought.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xu Yan in danger?"</p><p></p><p>The sudden enlightenment of the Transposition Technique clearly indicated that Xu Yan had fallen into a disadvantage in the battle and encountered danger, and it was in this critical moment that he had the sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>This Transposition Technique was extremely exquisite, based on the Bagua, to instantly change positions, evade attacks and attack the enemy. </p><p></p><p>In combat, it was more advanced than the Light Floating Body Technique.</p><p></p><p>It was essentially a combat body technique, even surpassing the category of body techniques.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivation level increased and the realm became higher, the Transposition Technique would also become more powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has raised the Dragon Subduing Palm to the level of mastery in the fierce battle, your Dragon Subduing Palm is now perfected."</p><p></p><p>The golden finger reported another harvest.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Palm is perfected!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't sit still, Xu Yan must have encountered some powerful enemy, had the sudden enlightenment of the Transposition Technique, and then the Dragon Subduing Palm was also elevated in the fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>"I have to go take a look."</p><p></p><p>He was a little worried about Xu Yan's safety, but also amazed by Xu Yan's talent, actually breaking through one after another in the fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, a warrior must fight!</p><p></p><p>A warrior who cannot fight is not a true warrior.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple's fierce battle with a strong enemy has continuously enhanced his combat experience, your combat experience has greatly improved."</p><p></p><p>The golden finger continued to report.</p><p></p><p>His battle consciousness awakened in his mind, and his combat experience had undergone a huge improvement in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the East River Commandery!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not hesitate, his figure soared into the sky and disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The cultivating Meng Chong was shocked, his master had flown away!</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, his figure was gone.</p><p></p><p>This speed was too fast!</p><p></p><p>"The Innate Realm can ride the qi and fly, traveling hundreds of miles in an instant, is my master an Innate Realm expert?</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right!</p><p></p><p>"My master's realm must be far beyond the Innate Realm, as my senior brother once said, my master is a hidden high-level expert, his realm is probably already close to the Dao, almost a divine existence."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was suddenly excited.</p><p></p><p>"I must strive to enter the door as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>He cultivated even more diligently, the Great Sun Realm appeared, and his whole person seemed to be in the tempering of the Great Sun, and his Copper Bone was gradually approaching perfection.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flew through the sky, this was the first time he had flown after breaking through the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Being a powerful martial artist is truly wonderful, in two lifetimes, this is the first time I've flown!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, flying at full speed, he soon arrived above the East River Commandery.</p><p></p><p>There was no sense of any battle.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his gaze, in the Xu family manor, Xu Yan's parents were all in cultivation, and the guards, some were on duty, some were in cultivation, all was peaceful and safe.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is in the capital city?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The capital city was too far from the East River Commandery, even if he rushed with all his might, by the time he reached the capital city, the battle would have already ended and the outcome decided.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go to the capital city?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was his precious disciple, with his current strength, the powerful enemy Xu Yan was fighting, he could easily destroy with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the capital city was too far away, if Xu Yan was defeated, even if he wanted to go rescue him, he might not make it in time.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through the second layer of the Dragon Subduing Palm in the fierce battle, your Dragon Subduing Palm has reached the second layer of mastery."</p><p></p><p>The golden finger reported again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned, the second layer of the Dragon Subduing Palm?</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed, this disciple was really capable, actually able to forcibly raise the level of the Dragon Subduing Palm, since he had the second layer, was there a third layer, fourth layer, fifth layer...?</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the Dragon Subduing Palm already possessed some of the dragon's might, activating the "anger" in the palm force, greatly increasing the power of the Dragon Subduing Palm!</p><p></p><p>And the dragon-shaped palm force had also become more solid and more dragon-like.</p><p></p><p>"Since Xu Yan was able to have a sudden enlightenment in the fierce battle, it means he was not completely defeated, and now that he has enlightened the second layer of the Dragon Subduing Palm, he should not be in danger, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xu Yan really in the capital city, or did he go somewhere else?</p><p></p><p>"Is the one he is fighting a warrior from this world, or a fierce beast like the Fire-Maned Wolf?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inclined to believe it was the former.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Qi Emperor found a warrior? Or perhaps..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Did the people in the martial arts world come after Xu Yan because he interfered with the mundane world?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuanxin frowned in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"What level of martial artist am I at with my current strength?"</p><p></p><p>"What is the martial arts world like in this world?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently waited below the Xu family manor. </p><p></p><p>So far, the Xu family manor was quiet. </p><p></p><p>This meant that no urgent news had come from the capital.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and have Shi Er utilize the intelligence network of the Tianmu Sect to investigate the situation in the capital."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a plan in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He then turned and returned to Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin flew towards Yunshan County, and over the hundred-mile distance, he felt his inner emptiness deepen, and he even started panting slightly. </p><p></p><p>But he dared not stop.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was chasing after him, and if he slowed down and descended from the air, the danger of being caught up to would be great.</p><p></p><p>His injuries were relapsing.</p><p></p><p>"How hateful! I've come all the way to the remote frontier, yet I'm still in such a sorry state!</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm even more pitiful than when I was in the inner domain."</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin was filled with resentment and frustration, his eyes flashing with a bloodthirsty light.</p><p></p><p>"Once I've made a blood sacrifice of a city, devouring its essence, I will recover my strength and then take your life!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin thought viciously to himself.</p><p></p><p>A small city appeared in his line of sight up ahead.</p><p></p><p>"This city is not large, only around tens of thousands of people. If I make a blood sacrifice here, I should be able to recover eight or nine tenths of my strength."</p><p></p><p>The bloodthirsty light in Blood Wuxin's eyes grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"In this small city, there shouldn't be any experts."</p><p></p><p>He was also a bit puzzled. During his escape from the inner domain, he had encountered that group in the mountains, one of whom was the son of the Minister of War of Qi. </p><p></p><p>Given his identity, he should have had powerful protectors.</p><p></p><p>Yet that group didn't have a single martial artist.</p><p></p><p>And just after leaving the mountains, he had encountered that incredibly powerful individual. Was it a coincidence?</p><p></p><p>Was it that there were no martial artists in the remote frontier, and that person was an exception?</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>But now was not the time to investigate. Recovering his injuries and regaining his strength was the priority.</p><p></p><p>He directly flew to the airspace above Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>His keen senses immediately detected that there were many people in the county city with vibrant life force, not inferior to those he had devoured in the mountains.</p><p></p><p>"Where is that?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Blood Wuxin sensed a particularly vigorous life force.</p><p></p><p>Among the people in this county city, this life force was even more powerful than the entire city's population.</p><p></p><p>It gave him a strong craving.</p><p></p><p>"A martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked.</p><p></p><p>In this small county, there was actually a martial artist!</p><p></p><p>In this remote frontier where the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had dissipated, there shouldn't be any martial artists!</p><p></p><p>He focused his senses, trying to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, but he couldn't sense anything.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy had not recovered and was still in a state of dissipation.</p><p></p><p>"Why is there a martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin thought about the young man he had fought with, whose cultivation method was extremely special and different from the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"No matter, after devouring the essence of this martial artist, I will be able to recover. </p><p></p><p>"Once I've regained my Patriarch realm strength, I won't believe there are any experts in this remote frontier that can match me."</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch realm was the pinnacle of strength in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>In the remote frontier, there definitely couldn't be any Patriarch realm experts.</p><p></p><p>"This martial artist's strength should be far inferior. Dealing with him won't be difficult."</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin was excited.</p><p></p><p>He moved his figure and appeared above the small courtyard, seeing Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong's bald, shiny head and burly, muscular build, Blood Wuxin's eyes revealed a greedy delight.</p><p></p><p>"Such a vibrant life force, although not as strong as that young man, but after devouring his essence, my injuries will certainly recover, and my strength will return to its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go kill that young man and devour his essence. I won't be far from breaking through to the Great Patriarch realm then!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin grew more and more excited.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through to the Great Patriarch realm, not only would he have nothing to fear in this remote frontier, even in the inner domain, he would not fear anyone.</p><p></p><p>The Great Patriarch realm was the pinnacle of martial arts in the inner domain!</p><p></p><p>"Devour his essence!"</p><p></p><p>Unwilling to delay any further, Blood Wuxin immediately struck.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't forgotten that Xu Yan was chasing after him in this direction, so he had to devour this young man before Xu Yan arrived.</p><p></p><p>As long as he refined the young man's essence, after his injuries recovered, he would let that young man experience the might of a Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>He flicked his finger, and a strand of blood-sucking demonic thread shot out, heading straight for Meng Chong's heart.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was in the midst of his cultivation. He had already perfected his Copper Bone.</p><p></p><p>His flesh body had become increasingly powerful, and he was only one step away from the Golden Bone.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong felt that he had reached a bottleneck and could not break through to the Golden Bone for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his heart skipped a beat!</p><p></p><p>A sense of danger!</p><p></p><p>Where was the danger coming from?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hadn't yet discovered the source of the danger when suddenly, something pierced his heart. An extremely cold aura entered his heart.</p><p></p><p>As this cold aura penetrated, his heartbeat suddenly became violent, and his blood qi surged wildly, as if a blood storm had erupted within him.</p><p></p><p>It was like a drop of water falling into hot oil.</p><p></p><p>Under the violent blood qi impact, the stagnant Copper Bone that couldn't continue to be refined actually loosened.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was shocked. What was this cold thread?</p><p></p><p>Following the thread, he saw the figure of Blood Wuxin hovering in the air.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Meng Chong's scalp tingled, and his heart tightened!</p><p></p><p>"A Xiantian realm martial artist? Where did this Xiantian realm martial artist come from? Didn't Qi State have no martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>This mysterious martial artist clearly had malicious intent!</p><p></p><p>The thread in his heart was a deadly attack. It was only because he cultivated the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor that his defense was so strong, otherwise the thread would have pierced his heart.</p><p></p><p>It only managed to break his skin?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong punched out, directly shattering the thread.</p><p></p><p>"Where is my master?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was anxious and sweating profusely.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't even been accepted as a disciple yet, how could he be a match for that person in the air?</p><p></p><p>Where was his master? </p><p></p><p>His master had just left, and hadn't returned yet.</p><p></p><p>Was the other party taking advantage of his master's absence to come kill him?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Emperor of Wu has hired an assassin?"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Meng Chong thought of the Emperor of Wu.</p><p></p><p>He was on the Wu State's most wanted list, with a bounty of 100,000 taels of gold!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Wuxin in the air was currently shocked.</p><p></p><p>That blood-sucking demonic thread, although he hadn't used his full strength, it should have been able to pierce through even stone!</p><p></p><p>Yet the thread failed to penetrate the bald young man's heart below.</p><p></p><p>It only managed to break the skin a little?</p><p></p><p>He felt that this remote frontier was very strange, even a bit terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Randomly encountering someone, and they would be so extraordinarily powerful.</p><p></p><p>This person's physical body and constitution were unbelievably strong!</p><p></p><p>"I must finish this quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin's fingers flicked rapidly, and two more blood-sucking demonic threads shot out.</p>

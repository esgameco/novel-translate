        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited and said respectfully, "Thank you, Master. Your disciple will definitely comprehend it soon!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was profound, as if penetrating all things in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Heaven and Earth, using one's body as heaven and earth, using martial arts and divine abilities as laws. I am heaven and earth, and heaven and earth are me. Disciple, as you walk through this world, do you have any insights about heaven and earth? What similarities and differences do you see between this heaven and earth, and the heaven and earth of martial arts that you have comprehended?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan was stunned and fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Using one's body as heaven and earth, what are the similarities and differences between my martial arts heaven and earth, and the great heaven and earth I exist in?"</p><p></p><p>As he pondered, Xu Yan gained some understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang martial artists don't have the methods of the Realm of Heaven and Earth, but instead refine the laws of the heaven and earth they exist in. My Realm of Heaven and Earth is cultivating my own martial arts heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"I have my own heaven and earth, and will eventually transcend the heaven and earth I exist in, forming my own heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's understanding deepened, his comprehension of the Realm of Heaven and Earth increasing.</p><p></p><p>He then thought of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities are a martial artist's own laws. Since divine abilities are the laws of one's own heaven and earth, does that mean after reaching the Realm of Heaven and Earth, one can cultivate any divine ability at will?</p><p></p><p>If self-generated divine abilities are considered innate martial artist laws, and later cultivated divine abilities are considered acquired martial artist laws, does this mean that the more divine abilities one comprehends, the more laws one's personal heaven and earth has? Or even, by specializing in a single divine ability, one's personal heaven and earth would have only one law, but cultivating this divine ability or personal law to the extreme would also be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this heaven and earth operates according to its own rules, while my Realm of Heaven and Earth ultimately lacks the rules for operating heaven and earth. It is a false heaven and earth, not real enough."</p><p></p><p>"But my heaven and earth has infinite possibilities. It can continuously expand and improve, and may one day become indistinguishable from the real heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with bright eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction. Xu Yan's understanding of the Realm of Heaven and Earth had improved, and thus his strength in this realm had changed somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth have their origin and their laws. This heaven and earth is alive, full of vitality, which is why there are all living things."</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth have their Way, and living beings comprehend it naturally. Those who obtain it transcend the mundane and embark on the path of pursuing the great Way of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"Pursuing the great Way of heaven and earth, comprehending the great Way of heaven and earth, using heaven and earth as the foundation and power source, but also being constrained by heaven and earth, unable to transcend it."</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts I teach you uses heaven and earth as the foundation and aid, ultimately transcending heaven and earth, transcending all things in the world, free from all constraints, roaming freely in the great Way."</p><p></p><p>"The great Way is vast and boundless, without root or trace. Those who sense the great Way have all of heaven, earth and the world in a single thought. Those who obtain the great Way can create all living beings with a thought, and destroy all living beings with a thought..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was profound, with a mysterious aura floating about him, unfathomable. As soon as he spoke, his words were profound and mysterious, explaining the concept of the great Way in an abstruse manner.</p><p></p><p>He was further expanding and elevating the path of martial arts, laying a foundation for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As for what the great Way truly is?</p><p></p><p>It is vast and boundless, omnipresent yet formless and invisible. How to comprehend it depends entirely on Xu Yan himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan believed that with this foundation, when Xu Yan's realm was sufficient, he would naturally be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that his master's words were extremely profound and mysterious. Vaguely, he had a feeling of sudden enlightenment, gaining a hazy concept of all things in heaven and earth and the vast great Way.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that even a tiny bit of understanding would be infinitely beneficial.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan twirled the jade ruyi scepter in his hand, allowing Xu Yan to digest the mysterious words he had just spoken.</p><p></p><p>"...Those who sense the great Way have all of heaven, earth and the world in a single thought. Those who obtain the great Way can create all living beings with a thought, and destroy all living beings with a thought..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was shocked to his core.</p><p></p><p>What an incredible realm this was.</p><p></p><p>"Master's realm is once again beyond my imagination. What realm is this? Has Master already obtained the great Way? Or is he even stronger?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan marveled. No wonder Master said that ants weren't worthy of him remembering their names!</p><p></p><p>Given Master's realm and strength, even that towering figure he saw in the wilderness seemed too small in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not even at the Void-breaking Realm, I'm too weak, not even comparable to an ant!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt ashamed, but immediately became excited again. "My small goal is to transcend heaven and earth, to match or even surpass that powerful being. My next goal is to obtain the great Way!"</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I'll find ways to comprehend that vast and boundless great Way. Even if I can comprehend just a tiny bit, it will be infinitely beneficial and lay a solid foundation for obtaining the great Way!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's blood was boiling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple will definitely cultivate diligently, walk through heaven and earth, comprehend the great Way. One day, your disciple will certainly obtain the great Way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Good, Master believes you can do it."</p><p></p><p>"I will not disappoint Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"Next, Master will teach you the martial arts method beyond the Realm of Heaven and Earth. The Realm of Heaven and Earth has heaven and earth, so how can it not have the Way of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, above the Realm of Heaven and Earth is the Realm of Establishing the Way! Establishing the Way means establishing one's own Way, establishing the Way of heaven and earth...!"</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Establishing the Way! This was the realm Li Xuan had established after repeated deliberation and constant adjustment.</p><p></p><p>It was also the beginning of the subsequent martial arts path, related to the direction of future martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Once the Way was established, the subsequent martial arts path would be formed.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth have their laws, operating eternally. Establishing one's own Way means truly establishing a Way belonging to oneself, establishing the Way of one's own heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"The laws of Taicang's heaven and earth operate eternally, and are also the core of heaven and earth's origin..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to teach Xu Yan the martial arts method of the Realm of Establishing the Way.</p><p></p><p>How does one establish one's own Way in the Realm of Establishing the Way? Li Xuan already had a roughly complete method, though of course the specifics of how to establish it would depend on Xu Yan's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the origin and laws of Taicang's heaven and earth, Li Xuan had a general cultivation method and direction for how to establish the Way.</p><p></p><p>The reason for not copying Taicang's laws directly was naturally to transcend Taicang's heaven and earth, to pursue a broader martial arts path. Otherwise, it would be difficult to break out of the framework of Taicang's heaven and earth laws, and difficult to become stronger than Taicang's heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's goal was not only to transcend heaven and earth, but also to become stronger than the entire power of Taicang's heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Although copying Taicang's heaven and earth laws might not necessarily prevent one from transcending Taicang's heaven and earth or breaking out of its framework, it would ultimately lack originality.</p><p></p><p>What Li Xuan needed was to use Taicang's heaven and earth laws as a reference to create the method for the Realm of Establishing the Way. With Xu Yan's monstrous comprehension ability and imagination, he would certainly be able to understand it.</p><p></p><p>The Realm of Establishing the Way, establishing one's own Way, establishing the Way of one's own heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"...Establish one's own Way, use the Way of one's own heaven and earth to resonate with the vast and boundless great Way..."</p><p></p><p>After explaining the Realm of Establishing the Way in detail, Li Xuan waited a moment, then explained it in detail once again from beginning to end.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was silently memorizing and comprehending.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts method of the Realm of Establishing the Way was profound and abstruse. Even though Xu Yan had already comprehended the martial arts method of the Realm of Heaven and Earth, the profundity of the Realm of Establishing the Way was still</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It was still extremely profound.</p><p></p><p>So, Li Xuan silently waited for Xu Yan to digest it for a while.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan had mostly digested it, Li Xuan spoke again, explaining once more the method of establishing one's own Dao in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He especially emphasized the part about the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, have you memorized it?" Li Xuan asked after explaining three times.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have memorized it!" Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good!" Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction. "The Realm of Establishing Dao, ah, only after establishing one's own Dao does one truly begin to have the ability to create one's own lineage. Below the Realm of Establishing Dao, one is not qualified to pass on one's own lineage."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned. Only at the Realm of Establishing Dao does one begin to have the ability to create one's own lineage?</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!" Xu Yan nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Without entering the Realm of Establishing Dao, one simply has no qualification to create one's own lineage.</p><p></p><p>"So, those major forces in the Divine Realm are just martial arts forces, not true lineages!" Xu Yan suddenly realized.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is in chaos, the changes of heaven and earth have already begun. It's also a good opportunity for prodigies to rise. As for Tianshadiying, you can handle them yourself, disciple," Li Xuan said leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"Those rats like Tianshadiying don't deserve Master's intervention. That would dirty Master's hands," Xu Yan nodded. How could those sneaky rats like Tianshadiying be worthy of Master's action?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if he had to trouble Master for every little thing, wouldn't that bring shame to Master?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction and said, "You have already reached great accomplishment in the Divine Appearance Realm, not far from the Void Breaking Realm. As for your plan to obtain treasures from Meiwu's hands, just be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"As I've said, true martial artists are not reckless. There are many martial arts techniques and divine abilities, naturally there will be ones that can be used.</p><p></p><p>"On the path of martial arts, there will also be conspiracies, calculations and traps..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to impart martial arts experience to his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't really ventured into the martial arts world himself, the various martial arts experiences fed back by his disciples had made him an old hand in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He had no shortage of various experiences and techniques.</p><p></p><p>He was much more knowledgeable than disciples like Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will definitely keep it in mind!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed in admiration. As expected of Master, with just a little guidance, he had gained martial arts techniques he had never thought of before.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, work hard then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, raised his hand and instantly strengthened Xu Yan's life-saving jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Li Xuan raised his hand again and a large tree instantly condensed into a small wooden sword. The sword was engraved with fine patterns, profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Although it was a wooden sword, it was like a holy sword among swords. Even Xu Yan felt that facing this wooden sword, he didn't even have the will to draw his own sword.</p><p></p><p>The wooden sword eventually became ordinary, inconspicuous, as if it was just an ordinary wooden sword. That sense of being the holy sword among swords had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"If you see Meiwu, stab her with this sword," Li Xuan handed the small wooden sword to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Since his disciple was going to trap Meiwu, and they were already mortal enemies - she must hate his master and disciple to death - there was no need to be polite anymore.</p><p></p><p>This sword contained the power of the Heaven and Earth Realm, as well as Li Xuan's sword intent. Its purpose was not to kill Meiwu's avatar, but to let her avatar bring this sword back to Meiwu's main body.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to trap Meiwu and probe her strength at the same time.</p><p></p><p>If Meiwu wasn't strong enough, she would just die.</p><p></p><p>If she was strong enough not to die, once Meiwu entered the Taicang Heaven and Earth, he would be able to detect it instantly.</p><p></p><p>"My holy sword intent is so profound, I don't believe you can remove it," Li Xuan thought secretly.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, after stabbing Meiwu with this sword, let her go. Don't kill her," Li Xuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>In case Xu Yan took advantage of Meiwu being stabbed by the wooden sword and suddenly struck a killing blow, destroying Meiwu's avatar, the plan would fail and he wouldn't be able to trap Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>"Master, why?" Xu Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"What's the point of killing one power avatar? Master wants to teach her a small lesson, let her avatar bring this sword back..." Li Xuan said with a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned for a moment. For some reason, at this moment he suddenly felt that Master seemed a bit treacherous. This was to trap Meiwu!</p><p></p><p>He suddenly understood in his heart. No wonder Master had repeatedly emphasized that true martial artists are not reckless!</p><p></p><p>"Master may have been invincible for too long and is too lonely, so he developed a heart for mischief, just to pass the time," Xu Yan sighed. Master's realm was too high, even strong figures like Meiwu could be toyed with casually.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu was going to be in trouble!</p><p></p><p>"Mm, walk the world and gain more insights," Li Xuan said as he walked away leisurely. Since he had already come out, he had to see Meng Chong too, give him some guidance, and pass on to him the physical martial arts method after the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>He also had to see Jiang Buping, give him some guidance, and strengthen his disciple's life-saving jade talisman.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength and control over the principles of Taicang Heaven and Earth, whoever activates the jade talisman within the Divine Realm, I can directly mobilize the power of Taicang principles to reinforce it," Li Xuan thought. So far, no one had triggered the life-saving jade talisman he had bestowed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited at this moment, "Break through to the peak of Divine Appearance Realm as soon as possible, break through to Void Breaking Realm as soon as possible. Once I enter Void Breaking Realm, I can roam the Divine Realm freely. And now the chaos in the Divine Realm is a good opportunity for tempering.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshadiying is also a good target. Let me show you my skills!"</p><p></p><p>Returning to the place where he met Luo Zhan, Luo Zhan was still waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo Zhan, thank you for this time," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, Luo Zhan was indeed going to take action for him, to resist two Nine-leaf Tiansha.</p><p></p><p>Although even without Master's descent, Luo Zhan wouldn't have needed to take action in the end, his goodwill still needed to be acknowledged.</p><p></p><p>"I wouldn't dare!" Luo Zhan hurriedly waved his hands.</p><p></p><p>That mysterious senior had already left. He felt a bit regretful, but also relieved.</p><p></p><p>The pressure facing that senior was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Luo Zhan, I already know the list of Diying. It won't be long before I find a way to get some information about Tianshadiying's branches from their mouths. At that time, I'll trouble the Hundred Battles Hall to take action," Xu Yan handed a communication talisman to Luo Zhan and said, "This is a communication talisman. It can contact me anywhere in the Divine Realm. I will transmit the information to you."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan looked at the communication talisman in his hand, shocked, "It can be contacted anywhere in the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>But thinking about it, given how powerful that senior was, it was only natural to have such a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Xu Yan nodded, then took out another communication talisman and gave it to Luo Zhan, saying, "This communication talisman is for you, Brother Luo Zhan, to make it convenient for you to contact the Hundred Battles Hall."</p><p></p><p>Then, he explained to Luo Zhan how to use the communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

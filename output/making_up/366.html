        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple unexpectedly retreated without any hesitation, which surprised Xu Yan. After all, the previous strike was extremely powerful, and even though Xu Yan had broken through to the initial stage of the Divine Realm, it was still somewhat difficult for him to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to move to block the 726th Blood Disciple, but the other party seemed to have anticipated this, turning into a beam of blood and fleeing into the Abyss of the Azure Sea in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This 726th Blood Disciple was determined to escape, completely disregarding the lives of the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's heart was heavy. A single Xu Yan was already so terrifying, if there were dozens of Xu Yans in this world, it would be a huge threat.</p><p></p><p>He must report this matter back and devise a plan to eliminate them. Apart from Xu Yan, the other three, including Yi Hu, were not to be underestimated either. Even at the same cultivation level, no one in the Underworld could match them.</p><p></p><p>The fleeing 726th Blood Disciple was difficult for Xu Yan to stop, and after the previous fierce battle, especially withstanding that strike, Xu Yan had also consumed a significant amount of energy. Although his demonic cultivation foundation was rapidly recovering, he had not yet fully regained his peak state, so Xu Yan did not insist on stopping the other party.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he followed closely, wanting to take a look at the Celestial Cave in the Abyss of the Azure Sea and see what it was all about.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's figure had already reached the top of the Abyss of the Azure Sea, about to enter the Celestial Cave, when suddenly the sky darkened, and the space seemed to have solidified.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's figure was instantly frozen, unable to move at all, as if he had been bound by the space.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple was extremely shocked. Could it be that a powerful expert from the Divine Realm had come to aid them?</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge had already been severed, and even if a powerful expert came to help, they would need to restore the Divine Bridge before they could step into the Spiritual Realm in such a short time. However, the Divine Bridge had not been restored. A giant hand reached down, as if it had dug out a piece of the space where the 726th Blood Disciple was.</p><p></p><p>The Great Heavenly Grasping Hand!</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure paused. That was the Great Heavenly Grasping Hand!</p><p></p><p>"Compared to my master, my understanding of the Great Heavenly Grasping Hand is far, far behind."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw that the 726th Blood Disciple did not continue the battle but hastily fled, so he would not let him have his way. He directly took action and captured the 726th Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Celestial Cave of the Ice Province had caused a disaster, and the Celestial Cave of the Abyss of the Azure Sea posed an even greater threat. The 726th Blood Disciple had even severed the Divine Bridge and killed the Celestial Sovereign. To understand the existence of the Celestial Cave, the 726th Blood Disciple was undoubtedly a clue.</p><p></p><p>What was the Underworld? It was precisely because of this that Li Xuan personally took action to capture the 726th Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, capturing the 726th Blood Disciple was effortless.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple was shocked, but in an instant, he found himself in front of a young man. The man was sitting calmly in a chair, with a beautiful woman of the Sea Spirit Tribe standing beside him.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple looked incredulous. There were such powerful experts in the Spiritual Realm? Were they Immortal Celestial Sovereigns? The strength of the Underworld Blood Masters started from the level of Immortal Celestial Sovereigns, and capturing him would be effortless. But the person in front of him seemed far beyond the level of an Immortal Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld?" Li Xuan's gaze looked down on the 726th Blood Disciple, his tone seemingly disdainful of the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>Raising a hand, he directly pressed it on the 726th Blood Disciple's head.</p><p></p><p>Tired of interrogating, he would just directly search his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had just acquired the secret art of soul searching and had not used it yet. As for the damage it might cause to the 726th Blood Disciple, he naturally did not care.</p><p></p><p>This was an intruder, an enemy.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple only felt his consciousness roar, as if he had fallen into a strange state, and his memories and consciousness seemed to be being browsed through. He was shocked and horrified!</p><p></p><p>Realizing the danger, he roared inwardly, trying to resist this terrifying power. However, he was unable to mobilize even a trace of resistance.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent. The 726th Blood Disciple's memories gradually emerged in his soul search, but at a certain moment, a blood light flashed, as if a mysterious power had sealed the hidden secrets deep in the 726th Blood Disciple's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Poof! In an instant, the 726th Blood Disciple turned into blood mist and completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed. The 726th Blood Disciple's consciousness contained some hidden secrets that were sealed by a force similar to a restriction. Once touched, it instantly triggered the collapse of the 726th Blood Disciple's consciousness, causing the 726th Blood Disciple to disintegrate.</p><p></p><p>"His strength is formidable."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was slightly alarmed. To be able to instantly collapse the 726th Blood Disciple's consciousness under his soul search, the strength behind it must be far beyond that of an Immortal Celestial Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Blood Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Although he was unable to search the core hidden secrets of the 726th Blood Disciple's consciousness, he had still obtained a lot of useful information.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld seemed to be a certain world. The 726th Blood Disciple was a servant or disciple of the Underworld Blood Master, and above the Blood Disciples, there were also Blood Masters.</p><p></p><p>As for the Underworld Blood Master, he was mysterious and unfathomable. Li Xuan only saw this name in the 726th Blood Disciple's memories, but the appearance and other details were likely the core hidden secrets that were lost when the 726th Blood Disciple's consciousness collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Cave of the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>For this day, the 726th Blood Disciple had been planning for a long time, but in the end, he still failed.</p><p></p><p>"An enemy from the outside world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Celestial Caves were cracks or holes in the world, formed by the invasion of external forces.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss of the Azure Sea had once experienced a spatial crack, and under the infiltration of the Underworld's power, it had become a Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Enchantress also come from the Underworld?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He had already sealed the Ice Province Celestial Cave, preventing the Enchantress from entering.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Tai Heavens seem to be facing an external threat? The Celestial Caves are the channels for the external enemy to invade, but while the external enemy can infiltrate the Celestial Caves, the cultivators of this world are unable to enter their domain, and can only guard and defend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about the small stone room in the Wu Kingdom Palace, and the existence that was sealed there. Was it the master of the Great Tai Book, or an invading powerful enemy? Logically speaking, if it was sealed within this world, the possibility of it being an invading powerful enemy was greater.</p><p></p><p>Who sealed it? The master of the Great Tai Book? Since it was a sealed powerful enemy, why was there no powerful expert guarding it? Was it because the master of the Great Tai Book sealed the enemy but also perished, and no one knew that a powerful enemy was sealed there? Li Xuan recalled the Wu Emperor's mention of the mysterious voice, saying that he had gone mad, calling it a liar and so on... And since he knew that the Borderlands could not cultivate the Dao, he also seemed quite familiar with the Great Tai Heavens.</p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, it might not be an invading powerful enemy.</p><p></p><p>"The truth will be clear once I find the other party."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle was nearing its end, and Meng Chong was currently unleashing his divine abilities, slaying...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A group of blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu also felt that she had been tempered enough, and began to make her move.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Chicat were the same.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Abyss of the Emerald Sea."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The flying boat turned into a stream of light and headed towards the Abyss of the Emerald Sea.</p><p></p><p>Warriors like Wu Tiannan from the Spirit Realm also heaved a sigh of relief, and hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss of the Emerald Sea revealed a huge black vortex, through which the surging blood waves could be seen below.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." </p><p></p><p>People like Wu Tiannan looked at it with trepidation, not daring to enter rashly.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came to the flying boat and respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and did not immediately enter the abyss below.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The great battle finally subsided, and Meng Chong, Suling Xiu, Fang Hao and Chicat all returned to the Changqing Pavilion's flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"Go in."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat flashed with lightning, the formation was activated, and they entered the abyss below. After arriving at the abyss, they found that this abyss was much larger than the Ice State Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at the bottom of the abyss, the blood waves were surging, and these blood waves seemed to be a kind of blood-killing qi that had eroded the seawater that had entered.</p><p></p><p>Warriors like Wu Tiannan stood on the edge of the abyss, hesitating and not daring to enter.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The blood waves rolled, the blood-killing qi permeated, surging towards them, as if wanting to dye the flying boat blood-red.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and with a thunderous sound, the blood waves began to condense and became clear, and then rolled back, the seawater returning to the Emerald Sea.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, three blood-red pearls appeared in the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Infernal Abyss Blood Pearls! These are precious treasures that can greatly replenish one's spiritual blood!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. The Infernal Abyss Blood Pearls were indeed precious treasures. When used properly, they could enhance one's spiritual blood, restore injuries caused by spiritual blood depletion, and even to a certain extent, enhance the strength of one's physical body. If combined with other spirit medicines and refined into elixirs, the effect would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Abyss Blood Pearls were probably related to the abundant blood qi in the Infernal Abyss, which allowed them to condense into pearls.</p><p></p><p>Whether blood slaves or blood disciples, they all had one innate Blood Pearl, which was also refined from the Infernal Abyss Blood Pearls.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the abyss was a faint red, like a thin membrane covering it, vaguely revealing the scene outside the abyss. However, this membrane was the barrier of heaven and earth. Even Li Xuan, who had reached the Void Transcendence Realm, could not cross it and leave this world.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not truly transcended heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The bottom of the abyss doesn't seem to be very large, this abyss space was probably formed later," Fang Hao said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the abyss was not very large, similar to the Ice State Abyss, but the heavenly and earthly barrier here seemed a bit weaker. Strands of blood qi were constantly surging into the abyss, and after a long period of erosion, this abyss had become so huge.</p><p></p><p>"There is no Unburning Qi here, does this mean the abyss is different?" Xu Yan explored the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"It's very likely, and I feel that these blood qi seem to have a certain auxiliary effect on the cultivation of the martial dao of the physical body, but for my current physical body, they are useless," Meng Chong said as he walked through the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do now? Will there be more Infernal Abyss Blood Disciples coming to the Spirit Realm?" Fang Hao was a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a person of the Spirit Realm, this was his homeland. Although he had abdicated his position as the Wanshi Alliance Master, he was still highly respected in the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Seal it then." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had surveyed the situation outside the abyss bottom, but did not see the specific situation. However, he knew that this abyss was planned by the 726th Blood Disciple in order to advance to become a Blood Child, and he had not told anyone about it.</p><p></p><p>Afraid of others stealing his credit, this Infernal Abyss was temporarily unknown to anyone.</p><p></p><p>As long as it was sealed, unless the other party's strength was too strong, it would not be easily discovered.</p><p></p><p>"Lacking a type of eye-related spiritual technique." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself. He decided to take the time to compile a few eye-related spiritual techniques, such as Heaven's Eye, Golden-Eyed Vajra, and Illusion-Shattering Eye, and let his disciples cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please seal this abyss!" Fang Hao respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, waved his hand, and a stream of Unburning Qi surged forth, instantly forming a huge seal, completely sealing the bottom of the Infernal Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Completely concealing the abyss.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing valuable here, let's go!" </p><p></p><p>The flying boat left the abyss, and then went to the Emerald Sea Black Abyss. Li Xuan took a look at the abyss discovered by Xu Yan, but this abyss was too small, and it was unknown how long it would take to expand it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after being sealed by Fang Hao, the expansion speed was extremely slow, almost impossible to expand.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he sealed this abyss as well.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Li Xuan left and sealed this abyss, a pair of eyes suddenly appeared at the bottom of the originally small abyss, as if wanting to look around.</p><p></p><p>But it saw nothing, the eyes were puzzled, even doubting if there was a problem with its vision. After blinking a few times and straining to look, it still gained nothing, and the eyes finally closed in bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge was broken, the path to the Divine Realm was also cut off.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Abyss of the Emerald Sea made all the powerful cultivators in the Spirit Realm worried, even Fang Hao was the same.</p><p></p><p>"Are there other such dangerous places in the Spirit Realm that may erupt at any time?" Wu Tiannan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I think we should explore the famous dangerous places in the Spirit Realm," Xin Mengrou suggested.</p><p></p><p>While the senior was still in the Spirit Realm, if there were indeed dangers, they could ask him to seal them.</p><p></p><p>So they looked at Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fang Hao was the disciple of the senior, and he was highly respected in the Wanshi Alliance, so he would be very concerned about the potential crises in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to explore the Spirit Realm and find out other potential crises!" Fang Hao said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If there were hidden crises in the Spirit Realm, Fang Hao would worry about them even if he went to the Divine Realm. Rather than that, it's better to explore the Spirit Realm directly and resolve the potential crises.</p><p></p><p>In this way, when Fang Hao went to the Divine Realm, he could be completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, let's split up and try to complete the exploration as soon as possible," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was connected to the Inner Realm, and if the Spirit Realm was in trouble, it might affect the Inner Realm, but the overall strength of the Inner Realm was much weaker than the Spirit Realm at this stage.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao left directly, and Chicat also did the same, returning to the Demon Tribe to arrange many matters and participate in the investigation of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Warriors like Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou also left, directly using the supreme power of the Spirit Sect to search the entire Spirit Realm. No matter how unusual a place was, even if it was just a rumor, they would go and investigate it in person.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 366</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple retreated without hesitation, which was unexpected for Xu Yan. After all, that previous sword strike was extremely powerful - even though he had broken through to the small accomplishment stage of the Divine Sense realm, it was still somewhat difficult for him to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan was about to move to block the 726 Blood Disciple, the opponent seemed to have anticipated this. He transformed into a streak of blood light and instantly fled far away, plunging directly into the Abyss of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was clear he was determined to escape, with no regard for the lives of those blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple felt a heavy weight in his heart. If one Xu Yan was already so terrifying, what if there were a dozen Xu Yans in this world? </p><p></p><p>Once they grew up, they would become an enormous threat.</p><p></p><p>He had to report this back and formulate a plan to nip it in the bud.</p><p></p><p>Besides Xu Yan, the other three people and one tiger were not to be underestimated either. At the same level, perhaps no one in the Netherworld Prison could match them!</p><p></p><p>With the 726 Blood Disciple single-mindedly focused on escaping, it would not be easy for Xu Yan to stop him. Moreover, after that intense battle, especially withstanding that sword strike, Xu Yan's energy was significantly depleted. </p><p></p><p>Even with his prodigious martial foundation allowing rapid recovery, he had not yet returned to peak condition. Therefore, Xu Yan did not insist on stopping the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he closely followed behind, wanting to see what exactly was going on with the heavenly rift in the Abyss of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple's form had already reached above the Abyss of the Azure Sea, just about to enter the heavenly rift, when suddenly the world darkened and space seemed to solidify.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple's form instantly froze, unable to move at all, as if he had been bound in place by space itself.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" </p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple was terrified in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert! Could it be that experts from the Divine Realm had come to assist?</p><p></p><p>The divine bridge had already collapsed. Even if experts came to help, they would need to restore the divine bridge to set foot in the Spirit Realm in such a short time! However, the divine bridge had not been restored!</p><p></p><p>A giant hand reached down, as if scooping out a piece of the space where he was located.</p><p></p><p>The Great Plucking Hand!</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan halted, recognizing it as the Great Plucking Hand technique.</p><p></p><p>"Although it's the same Great Plucking Hand, my understanding of it is far, far inferior compared to Master's!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the 726 Blood Disciple was no longer continuing to fight but hastily fleeing, how could Li Xuan let him have his way? He directly made his move, capturing him.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Ice Province's heavenly rift had created a disaster, and the rift in the Abyss of the Azure Sea posed an even greater threat. The 726 Blood Disciple had even shattered the divine bridge and killed a Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>To understand the existence of the heavenly rifts, the 726 Blood Disciple was undoubtedly a clue.</p><p></p><p>And what exactly was the Netherworld Prison? It was for these reasons that Li Xuan personally took action to capture the 726 Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, capturing the 726 Blood Disciple was merely a thought away, requiring no effort at all.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple was shocked to his core. In just an instant, he found himself appearing before a young man.</p><p></p><p>The man was sitting casually in a chair.</p><p></p><p>Beside him stood a stunningly beautiful woman, seemingly a beauty of the Sea Spirit race.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple had a look of disbelief. How could such a powerful expert exist in the Spirit Realm? An Immortal Heavenly Venerable? The Blood Sons of the Netherworld Prison started at the level of Immortal Heavenly Venerable, and capturing him would also be effortless for them.</p><p></p><p>But the person before him seemed far beyond the level of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Netherworld Prison?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze looked down at the 726 Blood Disciple, his tone seemingly rather disdainful of the Netherworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>He raised a hand and directly pressed it on the 726 Blood Disciple's head.</p><p></p><p>No need for questioning, he would directly search the soul.</p><p></p><p>He had just obtained the soul-searching secret technique and hadn't used it yet. As for what damage it might cause to the 726 Blood Disciple, he naturally didn't care.</p><p></p><p>This was an invader, an enemy.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple felt his consciousness roaring, as if falling into some strange state. It seemed his memories and consciousness were being flipped through. He was terrified!</p><p></p><p>Realizing something was wrong, he roared inwardly, wanting to resist this terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>However, he couldn't muster even a trace of resistance.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent as the 726 Blood Disciple's memories gradually appeared in his soul search. But at a certain moment, a blood-colored light shone, as if some mysterious power had sealed off the secrets deep in the 726's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Poof! In an instant, the 726 Blood Disciple turned into a blood mist and completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. Some of the secret memories in the 726 Blood Disciple's consciousness actually contained a kind of sealing power.</p><p></p><p>Once touched, it instantly activated, directly collapsing the 726 Blood Disciple's consciousness and destroying him.</p><p></p><p>"Very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a slight chill in his heart. To be able to instantly collapse the 726 Blood Disciple's consciousness and destroy him under his soul search showed that the power behind this was far beyond that of an Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord of the Netherworld Prison?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Although he was unable to search the core secrets of the 726 Blood Disciple's consciousness, he had obtained quite a bit of useful information.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Prison seemed to be some kind of world.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple was a servant, or perhaps a disciple, of the Blood Lord of the Netherworld Prison. Above the Blood Disciples were the Blood Sons.</p><p></p><p>As for the Blood Lord of the Netherworld Prison, he was mysterious and unfathomable. Li Xuan had only seen this name in the 726 Blood Disciple's memories. Details like appearance were probably core secrets that were lost with the collapse of the 726's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly rift of the Netherworld Prison?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple had planned for this day for a very long time, but in the end he still failed.</p><p></p><p>"Enemies from beyond the heavens, huh."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly rifts were holes in the world, cracks in this realm that had been eroded by external forces to form a rift.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly rifts varied in size. Small rifts were just tiny holes, like the one Xu Yan discovered in the Black Pool of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Large rifts, on the other hand, were vast in space.</p><p></p><p>The Abyss of the Azure Sea had once experienced a crack in the world, and under the permeation of the power of the Netherworld Prison, it had become a heavenly rift.</p><p></p><p>"Is Meiwu also from the Netherworld Prison?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>He had already sealed the heavenly rift in Ice Province, and Meiwu could no longer enter.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Taisang world facing an external threat? The heavenly rifts are the channels for external enemies to invade. However, while external enemies can infiltrate through the rifts, the martial artists of this world cannot enter the enemy's territory and can only defend their positions."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of the small stone house in the Wu Kingdom's palace and the being sealed there. Was it the owner of the Taisang Book or a powerful invading enemy? Logically speaking, being sealed within this world seemed more likely to be a powerful invading enemy. Who had sealed it? The owner of the Taisang Book? If it was sealing a powerful enemy, why were there no powerful experts guarding it? Was it because the owner of the Taisang Book had sealed the enemy but perished in the process, leaving no one aware that a powerful enemy was sealed there? Li Xuan recalled that when the Wu Emperor spoke of that mysterious voice, he had mentioned the other party once raving madly about "liars" and such... Moreover, since they knew that martial arts couldn't be practiced in the borderlands and seemed quite familiar with the Taisang world, it seemed they might not be an invading enemy from outside after all.</p><p></p><p>"The truth will become clear once we find them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The great battle was nearing its end. At this moment, Meng Chong unleashed his divine ability, slaying...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A group of blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also felt she had been tempered enough, and began to deliver killing blows.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Red Cat did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the Abyss of the Azure Sea," Li Xuan ordered.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The flying ship transformed into a streak of light, heading towards the Abyss of the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and other powerful figures from the Spirit Realm felt relieved, but also hurriedly followed.</p><p></p><p>A huge black vortex appeared in the Abyss of the Azure Sea. Through the black vortex, surging waves of blood could be seen below.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others looked on with trembling hearts, feeling a sense of terror and not daring to enter rashly.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Xu Yan arrived at the flying ship and respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded, not immediately entering the celestial abyss below.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The great battle finally subsided. Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao and Red Cat all returned to the Changqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in," Li Xuan said.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship flashed with lightning as its formation activated, entering the celestial abyss below. After entering, they discovered this celestial abyss was much larger than the one in the Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at the bottom of the celestial abyss, waves of blood rolled. These blood waves seemed to be some kind of blood evil energy that had corroded the seawater that entered.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other powerful figures from the Spirit Realm stood at the edge of the celestial abyss, hesitating to enter.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The blood waves rolled, blood evil energy permeated, surging forth as if wanting to dye the flying ship blood red.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed. With a rumbling sound, the blood waves began to condense and become clear, rolling back up as the seawater returned to the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, three blood-red pearls appeared in the celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>Netherworld Blood Pearls!</p><p></p><p>"These are treasures that greatly nourish one's essence blood!" Su Lingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Netherworld Blood Pearls were indeed treasures. Used properly, they could enhance essence blood, heal injuries from essence blood depletion, and even increase physical strength to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>If combined with other spirit herbs to refine into pills, the effects would be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Blood Pearls were likely related to the abundant blood energy contained in the netherworld, which allowed them to condense into pearls.</p><p></p><p>Whether blood slaves or blood disciples, they all had a natal blood pearl, which was also cultivated from Netherworld Blood Pearls.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the celestial abyss was a pale red color, like a thin membrane covering it. Vaguely, it seemed one could see scenes outside the celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>However, this layer of membrane was a barrier between heaven and earth. Even with Li Xuan's current Void-Breaking Realm cultivation, he could not cross over it to leave this world.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had not truly transcended heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The bottom of the celestial abyss doesn't seem very large. This celestial abyss space must have formed later," Fang Hao said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the celestial abyss was not large, similar to the Ice Province celestial abyss. However, that barrier between heaven and earth seemed somewhat weaker, with threads of blood energy constantly flowing into the celestial abyss. Only after a long period of erosion did this celestial abyss become so huge.</p><p></p><p>"There's no unchanging energy here. Does this mean the celestial abysses are different?" Xu Yan asked as he explored the celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Very likely. And I feel these blood energies seem to have some auxiliary effect on cultivating physical martial arts. However, for my current physical body, they're of no use," Meng Chong said as he walked through the celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>"What do we do now? Will more netherworld blood disciples come to the Spirit Realm?" Fang Hao asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was from the Spirit Realm. This was his homeland.</p><p></p><p>Although he had stepped down as leader of the Eternal Alliance, he was still revered there.</p><p></p><p>"We'll seal it," Li Xuan said after peering at the situation outside the bottom of the celestial abyss. He couldn't see the specific circumstances, but he knew this celestial abyss was planned by Blood Disciple 726 in order to advance to Blood Son, without telling anyone.</p><p></p><p>Fearing others would steal the credit, that's why no one knew about this netherworld celestial abyss for now.</p><p></p><p>They just needed to seal it. Unless the other party was too powerful, it wouldn't be easily discovered.</p><p></p><p>"I'm lacking an eye-type divine ability," Li Xuan muttered to himself. He decided that when he had time, he would create several eye-type divine abilities, like Heavenly Eyes, Fire Eyes, Golden Gaze, Reality-Breaking Eyes, etc. He could create them all.</p><p></p><p>As for whether they could be cultivated, he'd leave that for his disciples to figure out.</p><p></p><p>"Master, please seal this celestial abyss!" Fang Hao said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded. With a wave of his hand, strands of unchanging energy appeared, instantly forming a huge seal that sealed off the bottom of the netherworld celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>Completely concealing the celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing of value here. Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>The flying ship left the celestial abyss, then went to the Black Pool of the Azure Sea. Li Xuan glanced at the celestial abyss Xu Yan had discovered. This celestial abyss was too small, and it would take an unknown amount of time to expand.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after being sealed by Fang Hao, the rate of expansion became even slower, almost unable to expand at all.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand, placing another seal, completely sealing off this celestial abyss.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Li Xuan sealed this celestial abyss and left, an eye suddenly appeared at the originally small bottom of the celestial abyss, as if trying to look over.</p><p></p><p>However, it couldn't see anything. The eye looked confused, even doubting if there was a problem with its vision. After blinking a few times and straining to look harder, it still saw nothing. Finally, the eye closed in incomprehension.</p><p></p><p>The bridge to divinity had collapsed, and the path to the Divine Realm was also cut off.</p><p></p><p>The incident at the Abyss of the Azure Sea left the powerful figures of the Spirit Realm deeply worried, even Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Are there other such places in the Spirit Realm that could erupt in danger at any time?" Wu Tiannan asked gravely.</p><p></p><p>"I think we should explore all the famous dangerous places in the Spirit Realm," Xin Mengrou suggested.</p><p></p><p>While the expert was still in the Spirit Realm, if there really was danger, they could ask him to seal it off.</p><p></p><p>So they looked to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fang Hao was the expert's disciple, and the Eternal Alliance still revered him. Fang Hao should also be concerned about potential crises in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to explore the Spirit Realm to find any other potential crises!" Fang Hao said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go ahead," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>If there were hidden crises in the Spirit Realm, Fang Hao would worry even if he went to the Divine Realm. Rather than that, it was better to directly explore the Spirit Realm once and resolve the potential crises.</p><p></p><p>This way, when Fang Hao went to the Divine Realm, he could be completely at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, let's split up to act. We should try to finish investigating as soon as possible," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm was connected to the Inner Realm. If the Spirit Realm suffered calamity, it would likely affect the Inner Realm. And the overall strength of the Inner Realm at this stage was much weaker than the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao left directly. Red Cat did the same, returning to the beast clan to arrange various matters and also participate in the search of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Xin Mengrou and other powerful figures of the Spirit Realm also departed, directly using the power of transcendent spirit sects to search the entire Spirit Realm. They would personally investigate any place that seemed even slightly unusual, even if it was just a rumor.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 478</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Under the shocked gazes of the martial artists from Tai Miao Sect, Xu Yan struck out palm after palm. In an instant, eighteen giant golden dragons roared forth.</p><p></p><p>They charged towards the attacking Jade Snow True Dragon.</p><p></p><p>The eighteen golden dragons attacked the Jade Snow True Dragon from all directions, immediately entangling it. In just a moment, the jade white true dragon was submerged among the golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the furious roars of the Jade Snow True Dragon rang out, along with an extremely intense and violent dragon might. Terrifying true dragon techniques were also unleashed recklessly.</p><p></p><p>However, the eighteen golden dragons entangled it from above, below, left, right, front and back, intertwining with the Jade Snow True Dragon, rolling and coiling together in mid-air.</p><p></p><p>Boom! When one golden dragon was destroyed, Xu Yan would strike out to summon a new golden dragon to replenish it.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao watched with wide eyes. That Jade Snow True Dragon had been entangled, and this kind of entanglement was somewhat shameful for a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>A total of nineteen giant dragons were intertwined together, eighteen of which were golden dragons, rolling and tumbling about. The jade white true dragon was struggling and roaring madly.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still unable to break free from the entanglement of the eighteen golden dragons. The scene looked as if eighteen giant dragons were assaulting a delicate jade dragon.</p><p></p><p>"What a sin!" Old Man Xiao exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continuously replenished the consumed golden dragons, sweat beading on his forehead. To defeat a stronger opponent with a weaker force and subdue this true dragon was still very pressuring.</p><p></p><p>The consumption was also enormous, but Xu Yan didn't mind this level of consumption.</p><p></p><p>"It won't work to keep entangling like this. This dragon has clearly lost its rationality and become extremely agitated, with anger and hatred filling its mind."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>This true dragon had clearly fallen victim to a scheme. Some people had deliberately lured it into the Divine Realm to create trouble and chaos.</p><p></p><p>"It must be the Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow."</p><p></p><p>Besides Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, there was no other force capable of this.</p><p></p><p>To dare scheme against even a true dragon, the power behind Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow must be very strong to dare offend a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"If I kill the true dragon, it may cause some trouble, and it would play right into Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow's hands. I refuse to let Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow have their way."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan pondered how to awaken this true dragon that had lost its rationality.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's expression changed slightly. The true dragon that had been entangled into a ball and was struggling in mid-air suddenly opened its mouth.</p><p></p><p>The world's spiritual energy frantically poured into its mouth. Its jade white body radiated a hazy glow, as if a layer of white mist enveloped the true dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>Bang! One golden dragon after another was destroyed. Xu Yan's expression grew solemn as he struck out palm after palm, continuously replenishing the destroyed golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>"Is this dragon qi? True dragon breath?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned deeply.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Snow True Dragon's breath at this moment didn't seem to be aimed at him, but was passively triggered.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the world shook once, emitting a faint rumble. The sky above shone with light.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Realm Stairway has opened!" The Tai Miao Sect Master exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>The opening of the Dao Realm Stairway meant that experts from the Dao Realm would soon descend to the Divine Realm. The true dragon calamity should also come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Although, based on the current situation, even without Dao Realm experts descending, the true dragon calamity would end. But the opening of the Dao Realm Stairway held a different significance.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao looked up at the sky, his expression calm, but the corner of his mouth revealed a mocking smile.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how you all struggle, scheme, and plot against each other!"</p><p></p><p>He laughed coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the Earth Cloud Realm, the clouds of mist covering the ground had already dispersed.</p><p></p><p>The huge heavenly cave mouth seemed to have been brewing for a long time. The powerful aura contained within was about to burst out.</p><p></p><p>Cracks had appeared in the light barrier sealing the heavenly cave mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven's Bane expert guarding the heavenly cave had a flushed face as he struggled to maintain it.</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen's expression was somewhat nervous. At this moment, a spirit bird flew over, bringing a message.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen's expression changed drastically the moment he saw the message.</p><p></p><p>"That brat Xu Yan, how dare he ruin my grand plan!"</p><p></p><p>He could no longer sit still at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was subduing the dragon in the Tai Miao Realm! Although news that Xu Yan had already subdued the dragon hadn't arrived yet, he was now fighting evenly with the true dragon. The true dragon's unstoppable momentum had been instantly broken.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan's intervention suppressed the true dragon and caused the Tai He Realm to not open the Dao Realm Stairway, how could the plan succeed?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Heaven Seventeen was shocked and furious, killing intent surging.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, light flashed in the sky. He finally breathed a sigh of relief - the Dao Realm Stairway had opened.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare!" Heaven Seventeen said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Seventeen, watch for the right moment. As soon as the time is ripe, tell us to remove the seal!" A Heaven's Bane expert said with difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen nodded. He stared intently at the sky, waiting for the best moment.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai He Realm, at the location of the Dao Realm Stairway.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother is subduing the dragon. I really want to go see." Meng Chong said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping nodded. Unfortunately, the two of them were currently waiting for the Dao Realm Stairway to descend and really couldn't be in two places at once. They could only regretfully miss Big Senior Brother subduing the dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, after Big Senior Brother subdued the true dragon, they would have a chance to see the true dragon's appearance.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The steps in the sky became clearer and clearer, emanating an aura of heaven and earth. Then, at the end of the steps, the outline of a small world appeared faintly.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a step descended! The Dao Realm Stairway opened! The token in Wu Tiannan's hand gave guidance - he only needed to step onto the stairway to leave the Divine Realm and head to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Holding this token, one could ascend the stairway and enter the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Headmaster Wu, you should go up," Meng Chong said to Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan hesitated and said, "My strength is low, and the Dao Realm must be very strong. Why don't I give this token to you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head and said, "If I want to go to the Dao Realm, I naturally will go. Nothing can stop us. Headmaster Wu, since you have this token, you should be qualified. You should have a place to stay when you reach the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, in that case, I'll go to the Dao Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan thought about the person he was looking for. With no news in the Divine Realm, he could only try his luck in the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, Jiang Buping, now that the Dao Realm Stairway has opened, I hope you two won't..." The Tai He Sect Master said solemnly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Headmaster Wu is about to ascend the stairway. If you try to stop him, I won't be polite," Meng Chong interrupted.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" A voice came from atop the Dao Realm Stairway.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping's expressions grew solemn. The person who spoke had extremely strong power.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Emissary, a true dragon has fallen into the Divine Realm and is wreaking havoc everywhere. The Divine Realm is facing a great calamity!" The Tai He Sect Master said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>A shocked voice came from the stairway.</p><p></p><p>Then, the stairway shook. Several figures were coming down the stairway.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grabbed Wu Tiannan and vanished instantly, fleeing far away in a flash.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping did the same. Before Wu Tiannan could react or ask what was happening, the world began to shake violently. </p><p></p><p>The sky shattered, the laws of heaven and earth appeared and then instantly collapsed. Immediately after, the power of the Dao surged forth.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura erupted from somewhere in the divine realm, shooting towards the sky and the Dao Realm Stairway!</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, one could see a vast dragon aura merging with this terrifying force. A faint dragon's roar seemed to echo across the world.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sky exploded. Under the impact of this terrifying light, the Dao Realm Stairway instantly collapsed!</p><p></p><p>The earth shook and the entire divine realm trembled.</p><p></p><p>As the Dao Realm Stairway shattered, a huge rift opened in the sky. A powerful aura poured down from the rift. It seemed as if a small world was falling from the sky.</p><p></p><p>This sudden calamity stunned everyone. The Taihe Sect Master and others didn't even have time to flee before they were engulfed and instantly annihilated by the collapsing power of the Dao Realm Stairway.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Sect fell into chaos as the remaining Immortal Venerable Lords roared in anger.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping felt their hearts pounding. That terrifying aura was too frightening, and it seemed extremely unusual. </p><p></p><p>They sensed the auras of the Netherworld, demon sorcerers, and undying true spirits within it, as if it had gathered energies from beyond this world and erupted in an instant to strike the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, Meng Chong heard several screams coming from atop the stairway.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth seemed to have become chaotic. A force of rules was slowly manifesting. The collapse of the Dao Realm Stairway had only just begun to trigger a chain reaction.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Jiang Buping and Wu Tiannan instantly fled far away.</p><p></p><p>At the site of the stairway, an aura from the Dao Realm came crashing down. The force of rules swept out amid rumbling and shaking. It was as if a small world had fallen from the sky, smashing towards the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was undoubtedly a great calamity for the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts only had time to take their closest disciples and descendants. The rest of the weaker martial artists could only leave their fates to heaven.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Taihe Realm began a great exodus.</p><p></p><p>The shaking continued. Not just the Taihe Realm, but the entire divine realm was trembling. As the shaking went on, the realm gates collapsed, leaving only wilderness connecting the various realms.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it would take even longer to escape from the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, with the collapse of the realm gates and the connecting of the realms, some things also became different. Crossing the wilderness became easier, with many of the taboos disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The collapse of the Dao Realm Stairway shook the divine realm. The major powers in particular were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai and Diying, how could they be so reckless?"</p><p></p><p>"The stairway has collapsed, what are we to do now?"</p><p></p><p>"It's over, has our path forward been completely blocked?"</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts felt their scalps go numb. Some even regretted standing by and watching as Tianshai and Diying ran wild.</p><p></p><p>At the site where the Dao Realm Stairway collapsed, that small world continued to fall amid thunderous booms. The laws of heaven and earth also manifested at this moment, seemingly forced to appear by the impact of energies from beyond this world, maintaining the operation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A force of rules was also guiding that small world as it fell towards the Taihe Realm, connecting the divine realm and the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Diyun Realm.</p><p></p><p>The huge celestial rift erupted with a terrifying aura, striking the sky and bombarding the Dao Realm Stairway.</p><p></p><p>After the eruption, this celestial rift began to shrink.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth surged forth, working to repair this rift and block the continued impact of energies from beyond this world.</p><p></p><p>"We've succeeded!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi smiled.</p><p></p><p>The most crucial step had finally been completed.</p><p></p><p>The tasks that followed were already beyond what his current strength could participate in.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xu Yan?!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold voice with a hint of allure came from within the celestial rift.</p><p></p><p>A pink light flickered, as if trying to enter this world.</p><p></p><p>The Charming Witch!</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi's mouth twitched. He didn't understand how Xu Yan had managed to offend such a powerful being.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is in Xianglong!" Tian Shiqi replied.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The celestial rift continued to shake as the Charming Witch tried to take the opportunity to enter this world. However, this rift was already in the process of closing and recovering. The laws of heaven and earth kept manifesting, making it impossible for her to enter.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!" The Charming Witch's face was full of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>"Capture Xu Yan and bring him to me. There will be a great reward!"</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Charming Witch could only reluctantly offer a reward.</p><p></p><p>"The world is reunifying. You'll be able to enter later, Senior, and settle accounts with him personally then," Tian Shiqi said after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" The Charming Witch snorted coldly before finally withdrawing reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>The shaking in the divine realm continued. Radiant light flashed across the sky as a storm of spiritual energy swept across the divine realm. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to become more active and volatile at this moment.</p><p></p><p>This sudden change shocked all the powerful experts in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Taiyao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Taiyao Sect Master and others were stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Realm Stairway had collapsed. Was the Taihe Realm about to be destroyed? Old Man Xiao also had a surprised expression, muttering to himself: "So it was the Diying Realm? Diying is already dead, absorbed by Tianshai. It makes sense for the Diying Realm to fall."</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect that what's guiding the fall of the Diying Realm would be related to true dragon energy. Could it be that the treasure stolen from the True Dragon Clan back then was actually taken by Diying, and later obtained by Tianshai? Or perhaps that treasure was integrated into the Diying Realm, which is why Tianshai chose the Diying Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Of the 300 realms in the Dao Realm, not every realm still had a Realm Lord by now. Even for those realms that did have Realm Lords, they were not necessarily the original creators of those realms.</p><p></p><p>In that battle back then, many of the original masters of those small worlds had perished or disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai was not the original Realm Lord, but he was extremely powerful, belonging to the second generation of Realm Lords. The Tianshai Realm he occupied was not originally his.</p><p></p><p>"What great ambition!" Old Man Xiao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>He turned his gaze towards the battlefield between Xu Yan and the Jade Snow True Dragon. The battle had already concluded.</p><p></p><p>After spitting out that blast of true dragon energy, the dragon had become weakened. It was now entangled by eighteen golden dragons, unable to move at all, not even able to struggle in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had subdued the dragon! A true dragon, just subdued like that!</p><p></p><p>"You bastard, let me go quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the voice of a young girl on the verge of tears rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You lecher, you shameless scoundrel, you filthy bastard, let me go quickly, release me now!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's mouth twitched as he couldn't help but sigh again, "What a sin!"</p><p></p><p>Then he marveled again: "Tianshai, you really have guts, to actually ambush that old dragon's precious granddaughter!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his head to look at the sky, his expression extremely solemn. The divine realm was undergoing great changes. The Dao Realm Stairway had collapsed. Was the world reunifying?</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at the true dragon he had subdued, with an expression of surprise and astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"A female dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"H-how dare you speak to me like that?!"</p><p></p><p>That dragon was so angry she was about to cry!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

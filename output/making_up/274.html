        <h1>Chapter 274</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou did not experience a huge upheaval despite the destruction of the Yushen Sect and the Su family, as well as the killing of the True Inheritor of the Crimson Abyss. Instead, it remained unusually calm.</p><p></p><p>This left many of Yuzhou's Lingzong and noble families, as well as numerous martial artists, puzzled. Did the Crimson Abyss Sect abide by the so-called rules of the Heavenly Prodigies' Confrontation and not plan to take revenge? But some believed this was a sign of an impending storm, and that the Crimson Abyss Sect was brewing a big move.</p><p></p><p>In the Zheng Imperial Palace, the Zheng Emperor summoned important members of the imperial family and several high-ranking ministers.</p><p></p><p>"Yuzhou is likely to experience upheaval. Our Zheng Kingdom has always maintained neutrality and does not participate in disputes. This time, no one is permitted to get involved, regardless of who it is.</p><p></p><p>"If we incur the displeasure of the Superiors, it will be a disaster from which we can never recover!"</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor warned solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Abyss Sect is about to take action?" </p><p></p><p>One of the ministers asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It should be about time," the Zheng Emperor replied, not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>"Father, about that reclusive cultivator force in Yuzhou..."</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince began cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"This matter has nothing to do with us. They have not targeted or provoked our Zheng Kingdom, and the Superiors have not issued any orders. It is all unrelated to us.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, unless the Superiors give an order, or they violate the laws of our Zheng Kingdom, we shall not interfere, suppress, or support them..."</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor said firmly.</p><p></p><p>The special status of the Zheng Kingdom meant that as long as they upheld their duty and did not interfere in martial arts disputes, whether it was the reclusive cultivators or the Lingzong and noble families, the Zheng Kingdom would not be implicated.</p><p></p><p>And the Superiors Lingzong had an implicit understanding not to issue orders for the Zheng Kingdom to get involved in these disputes, as the Zheng Kingdom's strength was not significant enough to make a difference.</p><p></p><p>After issuing the decree, when everyone had left, the Zheng Emperor sat in his chair, his expression slightly worried. There was a mysterious reclusive cultivator force in Yuzhou, and their strength was not weak.</p><p></p><p>"Do the other states also have such forces?" the Zheng Emperor sighed. "In this Lingdomain, every so often, there are those who seek to shake the position of the Lingzong.</p><p></p><p>"The ones who have truly come close to toppling the Lingzong were the Wanxing Academy. That's why the Wanxing Academy collapsed, and the former Wanxing Prodigies either died or disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon's reputation is formidable, and the top-tier Lingzong he has destroyed are numerous, casting a shadow over the Lingzong families. In the end, he was only able to flee to the Inner Domain and meet a complete demise."</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor shook his head with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Lingdomain ultimately belongs to the Lingzong. With the existence of the Superiors Lingzong and the lack of Superiors families, the Lingzong are the true masters of the Lingdomain.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Kingdom is an exception. Why is it that the Great Zhou Kingdom stands on equal footing with the Superiors Lingzong? This is a hidden secret that no one knows - what gives the Great Zhou Imperial House the right to be on par with the Superiors Lingzong!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Jianxiu Sect, a top-tier Lingzong of the Lingdomain, the Sword Dao Lingzong.</p><p></p><p>Although they are both top-tier Lingzong, the Crimson Abyss Sect is far from being able to compare to the Jianxiu Sect in terms of strength, let alone the fact that the Jianxiu Sect is actually a subordinate Lingzong of the Superiors Thousand Blades Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Jianxiu Sect, which only cultivates the Sword Dao, has few disciples, but each one possesses extraordinary sword talent and unparalleled killing prowess.</p><p></p><p>Every disciple who joins must undergo the "Tempering of the Sword" to cultivate the Sword Dao, deepen their understanding of the sword techniques, and enhance their combat experience.</p><p></p><p>During the sword tempering process, many martial artists inevitably become the "Whetstone of the Sword".</p><p></p><p>The majority of the Whetstones are reclusive cultivators, while the remaining are disciples from other Lingzong and noble families.</p><p></p><p>The Jianxiu disciples, feeling that their sword dao has become powerful and their sword techniques have reached the pinnacle, often look down on the reclusive cultivators as unworthy opponents for their sword tempering. They will then challenge the disciples of other Lingzong and noble families.</p><p></p><p>This can be considered a "Confrontation of the Heavenly Prodigies" among the Lingzong.</p><p></p><p>The Jianxiu disciples are known for their ruthless and fierce fighting style. When they use other Lingzong disciples as Whetstones, they often emerge victorious more often than not.</p><p></p><p>Since the Jianxiu Sect is a subordinate Lingzong of the Thousand Blades Palace, whenever a disciple completes their sword tempering and becomes the top disciple of the Jianxiu Sect, suppressing the Heavenly Prodigies of the same realm, they can earn a spot to be promoted into the Thousand Blades Palace.</p><p></p><p>The Jianxiu Sect is one of the gateways for the Thousand Blades Palace to select their Heavenly Prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"Patriarch Hong!" </p><p></p><p>Ying Zongzhu of the Crimson Abyss Sect respectfully cupped his fists.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Hong, the current Patriarch of the Jianxiu Sect, was a peak Forged Spirit cultivator with a stern countenance and three flowing long beard strands.</p><p></p><p>Although Ying Zongzhu was also a peak Forged Spirit cultivator, he was extremely respectful in front of Patriarch Hong, as Patriarch Hong's strength was far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Hong, who had dedicated his life to the Sword Dao and whose sword techniques had reached the pinnacle, was one of the Forged Spirit cultivators just below the Superiors Lingzong in terms of strength.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that he possessed one of the Ten Blessed Constitutions.</p><p></p><p>He had once single-handedly defeated three peak Forged Spirit cultivators, shocking the entire region.</p><p></p><p>Both Patriarch Hong's strength and his background were not something Ying Zongzhu could match.</p><p></p><p>"Is the sword dao that Xu Yan has displayed genuine?" </p><p></p><p>Patriarch Hong asked while examining the intelligence report Ying Zongzhu had presented.</p><p></p><p>"It is genuine!" </p><p></p><p>Ying Zongzhu replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Patriarch Hong's eyes, and after a moment of contemplation, he said, "Such a sword dao is indeed remarkable. How could a reclusive cultivator possess such a powerful sword dao? Even my Jianxiu Sect does not have such a sword dao."</p><p></p><p>Pausing for a moment, he continued, "The sword dao of my Jianxiu Sect has never been inferior to others. Xu Yan's sword dao has unique aspects. As a mere reclusive cultivator, how could he possess such a powerful sword dao? I suspect his teacher has stolen our Jianxiu Sect's secret techniques. What do you think, Ying Zongzhu?"</p><p></p><p>Ying Zongzhu was overjoyed to hear this, and he nodded, "Exactly! Xu Yan's sword dao is indeed the secret techniques of the Jianxiu Sect. This is also the reason why I have come to the Jianxiu Sect, to inform Patriarch Hong that your sect's secret techniques have been stolen!"</p><p></p><p>Patriarch Hong nodded, "Since it is the stolen secret techniques of my Jianxiu Sect, we must retrieve them. And we must eliminate the one who has stolen them. This time, I will personally take action, and the Jianxiu Sect will also get involved."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Patriarch Hong!" </p><p></p><p>Ying Zongzhu said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>He then continued, "In Luozhou, there is a mysterious reclusive cultivator force that has gathered together, and their strength seems to exceed expectations, even having peak Forged Spirit cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"I suspect this reclusive cultivator force may be related to the remnants of the Wanxing Academy. The Crimson Abyss Sect, the Qingyu Kingdom, and other Luozhou Lingzong and noble families are preparing to eliminate this reclusive cultivator force.</p><p></p><p>"But I fear they may have hidden powerful experts. I humbly request Patriarch Hong's assistance!"</p><p></p><p>A cold gleam flashed in Patriarch Hong's eyes as he said, "These lowly reclusive cultivators dare to rebel? Since they are reclusive cultivators rebelling, as fellow Lingzong, how can I stand by and watch?"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Patriarch Hong!" </p><p></p><p>Ying Zongzhu felt relieved, and then continued, "This reclusive cultivator force may be related to the one in Yuzhou. And Xu Yan is most likely a prodigy cultivated by this force.</p><p></p><p>"These Wanxing remnants not only have stolen the secret techniques of your sect, but they also dare to plot a rebellion. They are unforgivable!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said!" </p><p></p><p>Patriarch Hong stood up, his voice cold, "These Wanxing remnants who dare to dream of a comeback, their foolish ambitions shall be crushed!"</p><p></p><p>That day, the Patriarch of the Jianxiu Sect and two Elders left the sect and headed to Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>And in Luozhou, a shocking upheaval was about to unfold one day.</p><p></p><p>The Lingzong and noble families of Luozhou, such as the Crimson Abyss Sect and the Qingyu Kingdom, suddenly launched attacks on various hidden locations.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The stronghold slaughtered numerous wandering cultivators. </p><p></p><p>Even the Refining Spirit warriors were killed, several of them.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Luozhou Millennium Alliance suddenly exposed itself.</p><p></p><p>"Who leaked the information?" the Luozhou Alliance Master asked angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Master, our actions have been secretive, but Luozhou is not like Yuzhou. I'm afraid the Crimson Darkness Sect and the Azure Cloud Dynasty have already noticed something."</p><p></p><p>"Now that we've been exposed, let's fight!" a powerful member of the Luozhou Millennium Alliance said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Then, let's fight, and see how much strength the Crimson Darkness Sect and the Azure Cloud Dynasty have!" the Luozhou Alliance Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Millennium Alliance suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm should have a place for us wandering cultivators. Those unwilling to be oppressed, exploited, or enslaved, fight for this lifetime, strive for the eternal peace of us wandering cultivators' descendants, join the Millennium Alliance, and fight for a place of our own!"</p><p></p><p>The Millennium Alliance appeared and issued a call. The wandering cultivators united, striving for eternal peace.</p><p></p><p>The great battle erupted, with the Millennium Alliance's powerful members taking action, including Refining Spirit Realm experts. One strike, and they killed a Crimson Darkness Sect Refining Spirit Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance Master revealed the might of the Refining Spirit Realm, suppressing the Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>As the Millennium Alliance appeared and displayed its powerful strength, some oppressed wandering cultivators with grievances against the Spiritual Sects joined the battle.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Darkness Sect and the Azure Cloud Dynasty of the Luozhou Spiritual Sects never imagined the Millennium Alliance would be so strong. With a single strike, they resisted the Spiritual Sects' attacks and gained the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>"How can the wandering cultivators be so strong? Where did they get such powerful cultivation methods?"</p><p></p><p>"That must be the Myriad Stars Secret Art, the work of the remnants of the Myriad Stars!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Darkness Sect and the Azure Cloud Dynasty, the leading Luozhou Spiritual Sects, were shocked and furious. They had thought they could suppress the wandering cultivators, but instead found themselves at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Once they were at a disadvantage, the wandering cultivators of Luozhou saw a glimmer of hope. More and more joined the battle, wanting to seize the opportunity to overthrow the Spiritual Sects. Even if they couldn't succeed, they could still plunder the Spiritual Sects' resources.</p><p></p><p>The battle swept through Luozhou, with three minor Spiritual Sects being captured and looted by the wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As more wandering cultivators joined, the Luozhou Spiritual Sects became more passive, but their foundations were soon revealed.</p><p></p><p>The assembled warrior troops swept away the scattered wandering cultivators, until they clashed with the Millennium Alliance's elite forces, suffering mutual losses.</p><p></p><p>The deciding factor was the confrontation between the Refining Spirit experts.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Luozhou Alliance Master was extremely powerful, not a weak one in the Refining Spirit Realm, and forcefully pushed back the Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Luozhou Alliance Master, the Millennium Alliance had other Refining Spirit Realm experts battling the Azure Cloud Dynasty's strong members, but they were at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will kill you!" The Luozhou Alliance Master, with unparalleled heroism, charged towards the Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder, wanting to slay this top-tier Spiritual Sect Grand Elder and inspire the morale of the Luozhou wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous!" The Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder was furious. "Remnants of the Myriad Stars, unforgivable!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, the cultivation method I practice may be from the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy, but I'm not one of the past Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy's people, and the Millennium Alliance is not the Myriad Stars Martial Arts Academy!" The Luozhou Alliance Master sneered, unleashing his martial arts secret techniques, his powerful strength pushing the Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder into retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you are the remnants of the Myriad Stars or the Millennium Alliance, you are all lowly wandering cultivators, daring to defy your superiors? Today, I'll let you know that the might of the Spiritual Sects cannot be provoked!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold, sharp voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! A sword light streaked across the sky, with a terrifying destructive force, slashing towards the Luozhou Alliance Master.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Luozhou Alliance Master's expression changed drastically, hastily trying to defend, but this sword possessed immense shattering power, instantly breaking through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" The Luozhou Alliance Master's heart shook, continuously striking to block the sword, but he was forced to retreat, in a sorry state.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Annihilation Sword, Sect Leader Hongzhai!" The Luozhou Alliance Master gritted his teeth and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Hongzhai the Sect Leader came wielding a sword, with two Sword Sect Elders behind him, their swords slashing towards the Millennium Alliance's Refining Spirit experts.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! In just a few breaths, a Refining Spirit Realm initial warrior was slain on the spot!</p><p></p><p>"Daring to defy your superiors, a crime unforgivable. Today, I shall temper my sword with your lives!" Hongzhai raised his sword, the powerful sword light illuminating the sky, his strength far exceeding the Crimson Darkness Sect's Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance Master's heart sank. The Sword Sect was indeed the top-tier Spiritual Sect under the Thousand Blades Palace, and Hongzhai was renowned - he was no match for him!</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll come help you!" A Refining Spirit Realm peak expert from the Millennium Alliance rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, and this time, even with someone assisting the Luozhou Alliance Master, the two against one were still being pushed back by Hongzhai, covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>The Millennium Alliance, which had previously been in the ascendant, now displayed signs of defeat. Many wandering cultivators outside the Millennium Alliance ceased their attacks and did not dare to intervene further, some even turning to attack the Millennium Alliance members, trying to curry favor with the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance Master coughed up blood, deathly pale and panting heavily, while his ally had already lost an arm, their injuries severe.</p><p></p><p>The Millennium Alliance's Refining Spirit experts had already lost more than a dozen members, most of them falling to the Sword Sect Elders' swords.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Sect!" The Luozhou Alliance Master cursed inwardly. In this battle, the Millennium Alliance was about to be defeated, and the foundations they had built in Luozhou for so long might not be able to be maintained. The roots and strength of the Spiritual Sects were indeed difficult to shake.</p><p></p><p>"Lowly wandering cultivators should have a lowly mentality. Daring to rebel, you seek death. Today, I shall annihilate you all!" Hongzhai, with his long beard fluttering, the sword light flashing, a terrifying sword beam thundered down.</p><p></p><p>The Great Annihilation Sword! The Luozhou Alliance Master gritted his teeth and tried to block, but he was powerless, unable to defend against this sword, doomed to die.</p><p></p><p>"Calling us lowly wandering cultivators, what makes you Spiritual Sect warriors any more noble?" At this moment, a faint sigh was heard.</p><p></p><p>A cane, shining like the light of the moon, tapped the sword beam in midair, and with a boom, the sword beam shattered.</p><p></p><p>Hongzhai's gaze focused on the old man who had intervened.</p><p></p><p>Silver light appeared behind the old man, like a crescent moon, though it was incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the old man's aura was still very strong, very powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Hongzhai asked.</p><p></p><p>The old man calmly replied, "The so-called remnant of the Myriad Stars!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, today I shall slay this remnant of the Myriad Stars!" Hongzhai sneered, rushing towards the old man with his sword. However, the old man tapped his cane, and a crescent moon shone in the sky, pouring out a powerful force that the unstoppable Great Annihilation Sword could not break through.</p><p></p><p>Boom! After just a few breaths, Hongzhai found himself at a disadvantage, but the old man also found it extremely difficult to gain the upper hand, as their strengths were not far apart.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

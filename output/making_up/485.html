        <h1>Chapter 485</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But for Old Man Xiao, at this moment, he felt like an ant facing the majestic might of heaven!</p><p></p><p>Even Taicang had never given him such a feeling! And Taicang was the foremost of the seven great world masters, with strength beyond imagination. </p><p></p><p>Not just Taicang, even that one from the Immutable Divine Temple couldn't give him such a feeling! The person before him had strength that already surpassed Taicang and that one from the Immutable Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>Where did such a powerful expert come from? The Immutable Land? Was he related to the Immutable Divine Temple? Old Man Xiao was shocked beyond words, his eyes wide as he stared at the person sitting casually in the chair, even picking up a pastry to taste.</p><p></p><p>The impression he gave was like that of a pampered young master with beauties attending to him!</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, Old Man Xiao's heart was trembling. Xu Yan's words came back to him one by one, and now he actually started to believe that what Xu Yan said was true! Not just boasting!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others watched as Old Man Xiao's aura surged, his strength incredibly powerful. Even an Immortal Venerable would be like an ant before him.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were marveling at Old Man Xiao's formidable power, in an instant, that powerful aura dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao hadn't even finished speaking when he fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Then they saw Old Man Xiao standing there dumbfounded, his body trembling slightly, his legs shaking, as if he had been frightened out of his wits! Xu Yan couldn't help but click his tongue, muttering: "Master didn't even do anything to him, why is he shaking? Old Man Xiao's courage seems a bit lacking!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the others nodded in agreement!</p><p></p><p>Master's tone was gentle, and he hadn't even revealed any powerful aura, still sitting there casually. He had merely calmed Old Man Xiao's aura, yet it scared him this much? "This old man, he's strong alright, but his courage is too small!" Su Lingxiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Man Xiao had no mind to care about Xu Yan and the others' discussion. His heart was trembling as he forced himself to calm down, but for a long while he was unable to control the shock in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The higher one's realm, the broader one's knowledge, the more deeply one understands how terrifying this is! "Who... who are you?" Old Man Xiao asked in a trembling voice.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, be polite, don't panic, just keep a normal state of mind!" Li Xuan's tone was still gentle.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Old Man Xiao felt his shoulder being patted lightly twice.</p><p></p><p>He still couldn't sense how the other party had patted his shoulder, and more terrifyingly, his trembling heart gradually calmed down.</p><p></p><p>It was as if those two pats had soothed the fear and unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>What kind of expert could do this?</p><p></p><p>Although Old Man Xiao's body had stopped shaking and his mind had calmed down, he still stood there dumbfounded, not knowing how to face this situation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face still wore a gentle smile. Calming Old Man Xiao's uneasy emotions was merely a divine ability he had used. With his strength, how could Old Man Xiao resist the influence of his divine ability? Taicang couldn't do it because Taicang's martial arts were inadequate! He didn't have such marvelous and mysterious divine abilities like him!</p><p></p><p>"You... Senior, are you from the Immutable Land?" Old Man Xiao's tone unconsciously became respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, and no." Li Xuan smiled and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how to address Senior?" Old Man Xiao gritted his teeth and asked.</p><p></p><p>"My name carries too much karmic weight, little friend, you cannot bear it." Li Xuan smiled faintly, his Dao Ancestor halo faintly visible.</p><p></p><p>"If you must have a way to address me, then you may call me Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Dao Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>It was like thunder roaring in Old Man Xiao's mind, his spirit shaken, unable to calm for a long time!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he couldn't help but recall some things Taicang had once said.</p><p></p><p>The primordial chaos was immutable, heaven and earth were created, all things in the world were within untouchable, supreme rules. Life and death, illusion and reality, all kinds of marvelous and unfathomable abilities were within it.</p><p></p><p>Just like the martial arts he cultivated, all came from comprehending the mysteries, obtaining great opportunities, and then giving birth to wisdom in the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>He had experienced endless years, but had barely touched this Dao, not yet standing on it, standing firm, or going far! And what Taicang had said in the past was that formless yet omnipresent, mysterious and untouchable Dao.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was shocked beyond words. Taicang had not yet stood on that Dao, yet this person called himself the Dao Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>What an unfathomable existence this was! Old Man Xiao's whole person became dazed. Originally he was curious about Xu Yan's master, wondering who was planning something, to have taught such a monstrous disciple.</p><p></p><p>But now that he saw him, he was shocked beyond words!</p><p></p><p>Dao Ancestor?! At this moment, Old Man Xiao was a bit lost, as if his mind had suffered a huge impact. His mind was buzzing with the two words "Dao Ancestor".</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Xuan, who was so profound and immeasurable that just glancing at him seemed to reveal the infinite Dao of the world, Old Man Xiao couldn't even raise a thought of doubt.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a figure appeared in Old Man Xiao's mind.</p><p></p><p>Elegant and majestic, gentle yet dignified, as if everything in the world was within his grasp, as if all the martial arts in the world were his footprints.</p><p></p><p>Taicang!</p><p></p><p>Even though Taicang was dead, he had allowed the Taicang world to survive for long ages until now. Even that one from the Immutable Divine Temple had not appeared to occupy the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>In Old Man Xiao's heart, although Taicang had been defeated, he was still superior to that one from the Immutable Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>It was just that Taicang lacked time.</p><p></p><p>How could that dark, invisible figure in the primordial chaos compare to Taicang?</p><p></p><p>However, today, Taicang's invincibility, Taicang's majesty, received a strong impact in his heart! He had seen an existence stronger than Taicang, and much, much stronger.</p><p></p><p>It was as if all the Daos in the world were his footprints, and he called himself the Dao Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>For a moment, Old Man Xiao was unable to bear this huge impact. He felt as if his faith was collapsing, his whole person dazed.</p><p></p><p>"I want to be alone for a while," Old Man Xiao said dazedly as he turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked surprised and was about to call out to Old Man Xiao to ask what was wrong.</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan waved his hand and said, "Let this little friend go calm down by himself."</p><p></p><p>Watching Old Man Xiao leave, Li Xuan smiled, his Dao Ancestor halo receding, his whole person returning to an ordinary, unremarkable appearance.</p><p></p><p>He understood Old Man Xiao's situation. It was nothing more than encountering someone stronger, more majestic, and more unfathomable than the one in his beliefs, and being unable to accept it for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the person in his beliefs had a profound connection with him.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang, huh." Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Although Taicang was dead, his strength still became the belief of a martial artist like this.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, this world was opened up by Taicang.</p><p></p><p>And the Heaven Purple was formed from the remaining purple light when opening up the world.</p><p></p><p>"If he hadn't created the Heaven Purple, Taicang might have been even stronger," Li Xuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>That ray of purple light contained great creative power.</p><p></p><p>The masters of the seven great worlds all obtained the creative power of the purple light and opened up worlds. Those masters of smaller worlds also obtained some purple light, just less of it.</p><p></p><p>Because they obtained purple...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Creating a small world with the purple light of creation, one is thus called the master of a small world.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Realm's 300 realms were originally small worlds.</p><p></p><p>Those who came later, without obtaining the purple light of creation, can only be considered realm lords, not masters of small worlds. There are ultimately some differences between the two.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao is not a master of a small world, but a realm lord.</p><p></p><p>He should be among the second generation of cultivators who started practicing after Cang and others. Cang can be considered his master.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad in strength," Li Xuan acknowledged Old Man Xiao's power. Although he did not obtain the purple light of creation, his strength was no weaker than masters of small worlds, and even stronger than some weaker small world masters.</p><p></p><p>"He's been too deeply influenced by Cang."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wasn't worried that Old Man Xiao would become dejected from this point on. To have cultivated to this level, his will must be very firm. It was just that the sudden impact made it difficult for him to accept for now.</p><p></p><p>After calming down for a while, he would naturally recover. Moreover, Li Xuan's divine ability just now could continue to influence him, so there wouldn't really be any problems with his state of mind.</p><p></p><p>With Old Man Xiao gone, there were no outsiders left here, only familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu excitedly tugged on Xu Yan's sleeve, "Senior Brother, where's the dragon, the real dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and the others also had expectant looks on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"It's right here!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled happily and took out the turtle shell, moving Ao Yuxue out.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue was resting and recovering when she was suddenly moved out. She immediately looked very aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"This is a real dragon?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had a surprised expression.</p><p></p><p>Her little hand stroked the small horns on Ao Yuxue's head, her face full of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's face turned red, but she didn't dare to get angry.</p><p></p><p>"Show your true form, let my junior brothers and sisters see!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan ordered.</p><p></p><p>"You're bullying me too much, I'm not a monkey!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue said pitifully.</p><p></p><p>"How about this, you show your true form, and my junior sister will treat your injuries," </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suggested after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"This is the last time!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue knew she couldn't refuse.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A flawless jade-white true dragon instantly appeared, the might of a true dragon spreading out.</p><p></p><p>Even though Ao Yuxue restrained her aura, the might of a true dragon still surged, fully displaying the majesty of a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a true dragon!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and the others marveled.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, can your pet Jade Little Dragon turn into a dragon?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought of Senior Brother's pet Jade Little Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it can or not, I can't say for sure!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu reached out to stroke Ao Yuxue's dragon body, her eyes sparkling. Ao Yuxue felt a bit uneasy seeing Su Lingxiu's gaze, which seemed to want to dissect her!</p><p></p><p>"What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Ao Yuxue!"</p><p></p><p>"Sister Yuxue, how about we make a deal?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's heart tightened, instinctively feeling that this deal probably wasn't a good thing.</p><p></p><p>"No, I won't do it!" </p><p></p><p>She hurriedly shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Then, she transformed back into human form and even instinctively hid behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others had strange expressions. Su Lingxiu wanted to study the true dragon's body, just like she had studied the Sea Spirit race before.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was a bit disappointed, but not discouraged. Ao Yuxue would be staying here from now on, so there would be plenty of opportunities. As long as the benefits were attractive enough, she would definitely agree.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was no danger.</p><p></p><p>Just like Cai Ling'er back then.</p><p></p><p>"These pills are for you. Take them to recover a bit. I see you've suffered quite a loss!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu handed a bottle of pills to Ao Yuxue.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue hesitated for a moment before accepting them. Her keen intuition told her that these pills would greatly benefit her recovery. She couldn't help but feel delighted, while also being amazed at the miraculous effects of the pills.</p><p></p><p>After all, she knew that with her current level of damage, even if she returned to her clan, it would take many treasures and a long period of recuperation to recover.</p><p></p><p>After seeing the true dragon, everyone became curious about how Ao Yuxue fell into the Divine Realm and lost her reason, causing havoc everywhere.</p><p></p><p>"Since subduing you, I haven't asked you how you fell into the Divine Realm, and why you caused such slaughter?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The dragon calamity had caused quite a disturbance in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although behind this was the plot of Tianshadiying, and Ao Yuxue was also a victim, she had indeed caused considerable trouble.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue said angrily: "It's all because of you despicable humans who deceived me in my young naivety, trapping me in some unknown place. Until I sensed the Heavenly Tiger's qi and unconsciously unleashed my dragon might.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon and tiger qi intertwined, and I don't know how I fell down. Moreover, that place was strange, I... I don't know how I was affected.</p><p></p><p>"In my consciousness, there were only thoughts of killing and causing havoc, no other thoughts at all.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for my subconscious feeling that killing the weak was wrong, along with my dragon race's inherent nature, which gave me some control, I wouldn't have just indiscriminately killed. I only sought out cultivators above the Immortal realm to kill..."</p><p></p><p>The more Ao Yuxue spoke, the angrier and more aggrieved she became, "You people, if you want to kill each other, then kill each other, but you come to harm me and then try to put the blame on me. You're bullying a dragon too much!"</p><p></p><p>"Who deceived you? How did they trick you?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue had caused havoc throughout the Divine Realm, killing many, but she indeed hadn't harmed cultivators below the Immortal realm. Most deaths were collateral damage.</p><p></p><p>They had originally thought that Ao Yuxue only killing Immortal realm cultivators was intentional, but they hadn't expected that it was because when Ao Yuxue lost her reason, due to the inherent pride of the true dragon race, she disdained to attack the weak. This was why she controlled the scope of her destruction, only killing the strong.</p><p></p><p>"I came out from the Dragon Realm to play and met some people in trouble who begged me for help. I was soft-hearted and helped them, but who knew they would trick me into a place I couldn't get out of..." </p><p></p><p>As Ao Yuxue spoke, her dragon might couldn't help but ripple out, her face red with anger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood and said, "Those people were all Immortal realm cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue nodded! This explained why Ao Yuxue was so resentful towards Immortal realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As Ao Yuxue recounted what happened, Xu Yan and the others roughly understood the process. Ao Yuxue had been trapped for a long time, wearing down her patience and will, making her become irritable.</p><p></p><p>That place was somewhat special. The aura inside continuously invaded Ao Yuxue's body, all to cooperate with collapsing the Dao Realm's heavenly stairway and drawing down a realm of the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue, a young dragon who had never experienced hardship, couldn't withstand this kind of situation. Naturally, she fell into it, her will collapsed, and she was easily influenced and lost her reason.</p><p></p><p>Her vigilance was also insufficient. After all, before this, Ao Yuxue had been a dragon in a greenhouse, never experiencing danger or harsh lessons!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

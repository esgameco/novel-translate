        <h1>Chapter 178</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He recalled those martial arts scholars, and a smile appeared on his face. He had shaken the inner domain, slaying peak great masters, so they must have all heard about it.</p><p></p><p>He should also be aware that he was not a martial arts master, but a pre-celestial realm martial artist.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts scholars all loved to delve into the martial arts, being obsessed with the martial way. When the true martial arts were presented before them, how could they not be moved? "A true martial artist is not a reckless person, as my master taught me, and I am a true martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Green Pine Pavilion lacked martial artists. It couldn't have him personally handle everything, nor could it disturb his master's peaceful and elegant life.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the martial arts scholars were very suitable candidates.</p><p></p><p>Once they made a commitment, found their faith, they would undoubtedly defend it with their utmost effort, even sacrificing their lives for the Green Pine Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial arts scholars were one of the foundations of the Seven Star Academy. To poach them would not be an easy task, and it might even lead to enmity with the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy was undoubtedly very powerful. Although Xu Yan was not afraid, it would still cause him a lot of trouble, and this trouble would last for a while, even interfering with his master's carefree life.</p><p></p><p>However, since Pu Yuntian had invited him to the Seven Star Academy, and the academy's abbot wanted to see him, it was likely related to his previous discourse on the martial way.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they could reach some form of cooperation.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Seven Star Academy was different from other forces, as its focus was on researching and propagating the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I'm going to challenge the Martial Arts Arena!" Meng Chong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Chong's strength, he could even kill peak great masters. Passing the Martial Arts Arena was a certainty.</p><p></p><p>After all, his strength was evident, even if the ninth-level arena was guarded by peak great masters.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Arts Arena of the Seven Star Academy was as lively as ever.</p><p></p><p>Today, there was a bald burly man who, just like Xu Yan before, directly wanted to challenge the upper levels of the arena.</p><p></p><p>This really angered the Seven Star Academy disciples guarding the arena.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong didn't even bother to enter the arena, and with a flick of his finger, he sent the person flying.</p><p></p><p>This scene was very familiar.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists, including the Seven Star Academy disciples, had a strange expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Could this bald reckless man be from the same school as Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>They were just too similar.</p><p></p><p>Pu Yuntian sighed, "Little friend Xu, your disciple doesn't need to challenge the arena. The arena has no meaning for him."</p><p></p><p>Directly strangling peak great masters, this burly man came to challenge the arena - wasn't this just bullying?</p><p></p><p>"My disciple wants to enter the Scriptorium to study the martial arts classics, so he naturally has to challenge the arena," Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"For today, we'll make an exception and let your disciple enter the Scriptorium," Pu Yuntian said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"That won't do. The rules of the Seven Star Academy must still be followed. We can't let people think that just because he's my disciple, he doesn't have to challenge the arena. Let them know that my disciple has the ability to pass the arena."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and refused.</p><p></p><p>Pu Yuntian opened his mouth, not knowing what to say. Weren't the rules meant to be broken? Now he was insisting on following the rules?</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Meng Chong directly passed through the ninth-level arena, shocking all the spectators.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Scriptorium. The ninth level has been opened for you," Pu Yuntian said, leading Xu Yan and Meng Chong to the Scriptorium.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, go directly to the ninth level. You can look at the lower levels another time," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Chong nodded and entered the Scriptorium, heading to the ninth level.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend Xu, follow me. The abbot wants to see you," Pu Yuntian gestured for Xu Yan to follow.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed Pu Yuntian to the core area of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend Xu, you are in the pre-celestial realm, not the master realm, right?" Pu Yuntian asked along the way.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I've said so before," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Pu Yuntian nodded. "Little friend, from where did you receive your teachings?"</p><p></p><p>"My master has transcended the mundane world. Even if I tell you, you wouldn't know," Xu Yan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>They passed through a refined courtyard area and entered a dilapidated small courtyard at the back of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, there was a seven-grade spiritual tea tree, over ten meters tall, with lush foliage and tender green buds.</p><p></p><p>Under the tree, there was a stone table and a few stools.</p><p></p><p>An old man with white hair was sitting on a stool, brewing tea.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled. The old man's strength was very powerful, far exceeding the Fire Extermination Demon Sovereign, and he even gave the impression of being beyond the great master realm.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, please sit," the old man said warmly, with a benevolent smile on his face. After Xu Yan sat down, the old man personally poured him a cup of tea.</p><p></p><p>"This tea is from the spiritual tea tree here. This spiritual tea tree is very ancient, rumored to have been planted by the founder of our Seven Star Academy..."</p><p></p><p>The old man introduced the spiritual tea tree beside them.</p><p></p><p>Pu Yuntian stood silently to the side.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drank a cup of tea and asked, "Senior, how should I address you?"</p><p></p><p>"White Cloud Empty, some people call me Old Man White," the Seven Star Academy abbot, White Cloud Empty, chuckled.</p><p></p><p>After that, White Cloud Empty seemed to be making casual conversation, introducing the Seven Star Academy while continuously refilling Xu Yan's tea, chatting for nearly half an hour.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "May I ask, what realm is above the pre-celestial?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, White Cloud Empty's expression became slightly solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Penetrating the Profound." Xu Yan put down his teacup and said, "Penetrating the profound mysteries of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>"Penetrating the Profound?" White Cloud Empty murmured a few words to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend, what are your thoughts on the martial arts of the masters?" White Cloud Empty asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan found himself in a difficult position.</p><p></p><p>To directly say that it was a false martial art? The old man before him was extremely powerful, and if he got offended and went berserk, it would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his master had not said that it was a false martial art.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he said, "There is no view. Cultivation is different, and there is no true or false in the martial arts."</p><p></p><p>White Cloud Empty let out a wry laugh. Although Xu Yan said there was no true or false in the martial arts, in his eyes, the martial arts of the masters were indeed false martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts have no true or false." White Cloud Empty smiled and said, "The founding of the Seven Star Academy was for the purpose of researching the martial arts, and many of the martial arts techniques currently circulating in the inner domain were originated from the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"The mission of the Seven Star Academy is to research the martial arts and explore the true essence of the martial way. No matter what martial arts technique it is, we will research it without prejudice.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it is a murderous technique that harms the heavens and creates sins, we will not refrain from researching it. Perhaps there are things worth learning, and we can create new martial arts techniques."</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy has contributed greatly to many secret martial arts techniques, some of which came at an extremely high price.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It was derived from the techniques of taking life, used to save one's life in times of crisis, or even to perish together with the enemy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood the meaning of Bai Yunkong's words - the purpose of the Seven Star Academy was to explore the true essence of the martial dao, without developing hostility due to the differences in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong continued, "But no matter how the scholars of our academy have delved into the martial dao, how they have created techniques and secret arts, the fundamental has not changed.</p><p></p><p>"They have all been within the existing framework of the martial dao. There have been scholars who wanted to break out of this framework, but they all failed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's appearance had caught the attention of many martial arts scholars of the Seven Star Academy, as his martial arts were different from the inner domain, going beyond the existing martial dao.</p><p></p><p>A group of martial arts scholars were almost driven mad.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of these martial arts scholars, there was nothing more attractive than discovering a new realm.</p><p></p><p>"So, what do you mean?" Xu Yan asked blinkingly.</p><p></p><p>"Would you be willing to become a grand scholar of our Seven Star Academy? Don't worry, there are no other constraints, it's just that your martial arts need to be exchanged and shared."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong paused for a moment, then said, "Of course, you may feel that our Seven Star Academy is trying to steal your martial arts techniques, and if you don't agree, it is also understandable."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled freely and said, "Spreading the martial dao, why not? I have a few requests."</p><p></p><p>Spreading the martial dao? Xu Yan had no objection to this, as his master had the heart to spread the dao since entering the world.</p><p></p><p>Since he had spread it to the remote border, why not spread it to the inner domain as well? "Oh, what requests do you have, my young friend? Feel free to ask."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was a little surprised.</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Young friend, have you obtained the permission of your master to spread the martial arts? Lest the old fool's request violates the rules."</p><p></p><p>"My master, what kind of person is he? Spreading the dao throughout the world, how could that be a problem?" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was deeply shaken, and asked solemnly, "May the old fool pay respects to your master and seek guidance from him?"</p><p></p><p>"This needs to be discussed with my master first," Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"You old turtle, Xu Xiaoyu has come, and you didn't even say a word, hiding and concealing, afraid that I would know?" Suddenly, an unkempt old man with messy hair and dark eye circles stormed in.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan recognized at a glance that this was also a martial arts scholar, and seemingly not weaker than Bai Yunkong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but smile inwardly. The trip to the Seven Star Academy was going to be smoother than expected. Bringing back a few martial arts scholars would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>As for cooperating with the Seven Star Academy, it was also worth considering. Being a grand martial arts scholar was just a title, without any real loss.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The second batch of Yun Qi Dan was sold, and the strong experts of the major forces immediately used their connections to contact the Tianbaoge, obtaining the priority purchase qualification.</p><p></p><p>Those masters without a strong background could only watch helplessly as the Yun Qi Dan was sold out again.</p><p></p><p>As a result, they began to inquire everywhere about the whereabouts of the Changqinggé.</p><p></p><p>The major forces were also continuously using their own intelligence to obtain information about the Changqinggé.</p><p></p><p>Tieshang County in Lanping Prefecture was under the jurisdiction of the Great Yue Kingdom. The county magistrate of Tieshang was, after all, a subject of the Great Yue Kingdom. The Changqinggé was within the borders of Tieshang County, so the county magistrate immediately seized this opportunity to perform a meritorious deed.</p><p></p><p>He personally went to the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Yun Qi Dan had caused a stir in the martial arts world of the inner domain, and all the forces were waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial study of the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom, the reigning emperor of the Great Yue was looking at a Yun Qi Dan in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Any news of the Changqinggé?"</p><p></p><p>A eunuch emerged from the shadows. "Your Majesty, no news has arrived yet."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a eunuch entered the imperial study and reported that Tieshang County had transmitted important intelligence through the Tiwei Guard.</p><p></p><p>The Tiwei Guard was the inner guard of the imperial house of the Great Yue Kingdom, under the direct control of the Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor glanced at the intelligence and his eyes suddenly gleamed with brilliance. The Changqinggé was in Tieshang County! And it seemed not to be strong in power!</p><p></p><p>"It must be controlled in my hands!" The Great Yue Emperor immediately ordered, "Transmit the decree to the Tiwei Guard, they must seize control of the Changqinggé. Since it is within the borders of my Great Yue Kingdom, it must be under my rule. They must act quickly!"</p><p></p><p>With the Great Yue Emperor's order, Tiwei Guard experts quietly left the capital that very day, carrying the imperial decree and avoiding the attention of many forces.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the inner domain, on a perilous high peak, a tall building had been established. In the dark cave, black-robed figures could be seen standing in the corridors and shadows.</p><p></p><p>At the top of the tall building, in the main hall, seven black-robed figures stood, and in the chair at the head of the hall sat an elderly man leaning on a cane. </p><p></p><p>He looked extremely old, his white hair and wrinkled face showing his advanced age. But the seven people standing below, although they were peak Grandmaster experts, were tense and nervous, afraid of saying the wrong thing and incurring punishment.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the Hidden Tower, the old man had never changed, always remaining the same, but he had not died of old age.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious and unfathomable Hidden Tower Master, his strength was also mysterious and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Even peak Grandmaster experts still looked upon him with awe.</p><p></p><p>"Three peak Grandmaster experts have died, and there is not a single clue?" The Hidden Tower Master's voice was emotionless.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the seven peak Grandmaster experts all lowered their heads, not daring to even take a breath.</p><p></p><p>"The Stone Lingering Grass sacred land, the person died, and the Stone Lingering Grass is also gone, not a single trace?" The Hidden Tower Master continued.</p><p></p><p>One of the black-robed figures spoke in a low voice, "From some clues, it seems that Xu Yan is related to the matter of the Stone Lingering Grass sacred land."</p><p></p><p>"Where is he now?" The Hidden Tower Master's voice was indifferent, but the seven people knew that the Master was preparing to take action himself.</p><p></p><p>"He has gone to the Seven Star Academy."</p><p></p><p>One person replied.</p><p></p><p>"He is not important, Suling is the most important. Find her whereabouts at all costs, no matter what methods or means are used, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing that Xu Yan was at the Seven Star Academy, the Hidden Tower Master abandoned the idea of going after him.</p><p></p><p>The top priority was to find Suling's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" The seven people hurriedly responded.</p><p></p><p>One of them then spoke up, "Master, the Tianbaoge is selling a medicinal pill called the Yun Qi Dan, which can greatly increase the cultivation speed of Grandmaster martial artists. Is it related to Suling? </p><p></p><p>"She has studied medicine and alchemy since she was young, and she has the true teachings of the Medical King, and she is..."</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Master looked at the speaker and said, "Then find the source of the Yun Qi Dan, no matter what methods are used."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" The seven people bowed and retreated, quickly leaving the tall building to investigate the various intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Sitting alone in the tall building, the Hidden Tower Master opened his seemingly hazy eyes, revealing a terrifying brilliance.</p><p></p><p>"No one can stop my steps. I have waited too long. She is the only opportunity. Without entering the Spirit Realm, how can I attain the legendary Celestial Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan or anyone else, whoever dares to obstruct me, will die without a doubt!"</p><p></p><p>The ominous and murderous voice came from the Hidden Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The snow in Bingzhou melted, and the great flood swept through Yunzhou and Dazezhou, bringing the greatest disaster in the history of the Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Patriarch of Leiyun Manor and other powerful experts were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts gathered in Hongzhou were all alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, go back!"</p><p>"My Yunzhou is in disaster!"</p><p></p><p>The experts from Yunzhou frantically left and returned to Yunzhou.</p><p></p><p>Their families, friends, and sects were all in Yunzhou. How many of them would escape this great calamity?</p><p></p><p>"This is not ordinary, the Jingxue Palace does not have the ability to create such a crisis. There must be an unknown incident, and this matter must be investigated quickly," the Patriarch of Leiyun Manor said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He directly led a portion of the Leiyun Mountain Manor's experts to leave.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the powerful experts from Taimiao Sect, Yuling Palace, Great Zhou Kingdom, and many top Spiritual Sects also left, heading towards Yunzhou and Dazezhou.</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Bingzhou melted?" Li Xuan furrowed his brows, recalling Mu Qianliu's warning not to go to Bingzhou.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's expression also changed, as he also remembered Mu Qianliu's words. Could it be that Mu Qianliu had already known about the great disaster hidden in Bingzhou back then.</p><p></p><p>After the last time, Mu Qianliu disappeared again and did not return to the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>But after the news of the destruction of the Xingxing Palace spread, while others did not pay much attention, Meng Shushu was more vigilant and inquired further, learning about the identity of Tang Jinyan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Mu Qianriu's reaction when he mentioned the death of Elder Su, and his mention of Tang Jinyan, it seems that Tang Jinyan was likely the mastermind behind it all.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu destroyed the Xingxing Palace and killed Tang Jinyan, then completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu suspected that Mu Qianriu might have killed Tang Jinyan, destroyed the Xingxing Palace, and then perished there, perhaps even committing suicide to atone for his sins? The person had disappeared, and could no longer be found.</p><p></p><p>As for what happened in Bingzhou, it seems that no one knows.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Yunmiao, and Ziyun came to the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Bingzhou has melted, Yunzhou and Dazezhou have been flooded, the casualties are said to be severe, a great disaster!" Du Yuying sighed.</p><p></p><p>With such a great calamity, an entire state being flooded, the casualties must be horrifying. The Spiritual Realm has eighteen states, and each one is far more vast than the Inner Realm, it's unimaginable how terrifying this disaster is.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to take the people of Wanshi Alliance to Yunzhou and Dazezhou..." Fang Hao came to bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>As a native of the Spiritual Realm, he was naturally more saddened by such a huge disaster in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao led some of the Wanshi Alliance's experts to leave for Yunzhou and Dazezhou, while Tan Wenlin remained to oversee the subsequent affairs of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I should also go and do my part for the disaster in Yunzhou," Wu Tiannan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Go," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Wu Tiannan left, Suling Xiu also prepared to go to Yunzhou.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Changqing Pavilion's flying ship was about to take off, suddenly a rainbow light appeared, like a bridge stretching from Hongzhou across the vast sea to the other side.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Everyone was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes slightly, this rainbow light was formed by the gathering of the power of the laws of heaven and earth, reaching across the sea.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the Divine Bridge?" Xu Yan exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"It's not the Divine Bridge, but a virtual bridge. The Divine Bridge is real, not like this. Someone has opened a virtual bridge, summoning an honored guest to descend," Fu Yunxiu said with a furrowed brow.</p><p></p><p>"Summoning an honored guest to descend?" The others were puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm, as if he already knew everything that was happening.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, what is this about?" Xie Lingfeng asked impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"A transcendent Spiritual Sect has opened a virtual bridge. Behind every transcendent Spiritual Sect, there is something extraordinary. Whenever a Spiritual Prodigy needs to leave the Spiritual Realm, they will open a virtual bridge. </p><p></p><p>"When the virtual bridge opens, they summon an honored guest to descend and take away the Spiritual Prodigy, then the virtual bridge will disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Generally, they can only open the virtual bridge once every ten years, and it won't last too long."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yunxiu briefly explained.</p><p></p><p>Before Xie Lingfeng could ask further about where they were going after leaving the Spiritual Realm, he saw the Sect Master of the Qianwu Palace and a group of Elders standing in the rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>"Qianwu Palace summons the honored guest to descend and eliminate those who have violated the rules of the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of Qianwu Palace shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Qianwu Palace!" Fu Tianhai hurried to the Changqing Pavilion, his expression somewhat grave.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you all should hide for a bit. The Qianwu Palace is summoning the honored guest, and they must be coming for you," Fu Tianhai said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan furrowed his brows and said, "I want to see what kind of honored guest the Qianwu Palace can summon!"</p><p></p><p>With the master here, what was there to be afraid of?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also raised his brows, looking towards the end of the rainbow light, curious to see what powerful expert would descend. The end of the rainbow light must lead to somewhere.</p><p></p><p>As a Shen Xiang Realm cultivator, his strength had already surpassed Lian Shen Tian Ren, so he had some confidence.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai looked at Li Xuan, this mysterious and powerful expert might not be afraid of the backer behind the Qianwu Palace.</p><p></p><p>So he no longer tried to persuade them.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rainbow light fluctuated, and a figure came from the end of the rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>The powerful aura shook the heavens and the earth, as if the might of the heavens and earth was embodied in this person.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable!" Fu Tianhai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable?" Li Xuan thought to himself, it was just as he had guessed, the cultivation above Lian Shen Tian Ren was to refine the laws of heaven and earth into one's body.</p><p></p><p>The person walking out of the rainbow light had an extremely powerful aura, far beyond what a cultivator who had refined the power of the laws could possess.</p><p></p><p>The other party had already refined the laws of heaven and earth into their body, with the mighty power of the heavens and earth in their hands.</p><p></p><p>Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable!</p><p></p><p>"Not in the early stage of Nen Fa, but likely in the late stage!" As the Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable approached, Li Xuan could also judge the other party's strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth were thick and fused with their divine soul, the mighty power of the heavens and earth was completely within their body. This profound understanding of the laws was far beyond the initial stage of Nen Fa.</p><p></p><p>Likely in the late stage of Nen Fa!</p><p></p><p>The other party held a long spear, a divine artifact far more powerful than the spiritual artifacts of the Spiritual Realm. If the spiritual artifacts of the Spiritual Realm were considered low-grade, then the one in the other party's hand was a high-grade one.</p><p></p><p>"Their strength and divine abilities are comparable to the Shen Tong Realm."</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, the Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable's realm was higher than the Shen Tong Realm, but their actual strength was similar.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Xu Yan has reached the peak of the Shen Yuan Realm, he would not be a match for the Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable, but in the Shen Tong Realm, he would not fear them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>When he was in the Shen Tong Realm, he could already defeat a Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable. Now in the Shen Xiang Realm, he would be even more unafraid.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I am above the Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland Dao had already far surpassed the Taiyang Dao even when he was in the Shen Yuan Realm. Upon entering the Shen Tong Realm, his strength was theoretically comparable to the Lian Shen Tian Ren Realm, but in reality, he was stronger than a Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>The mysteries of the Shen Tong Dao were extraordinary, naturally making him even stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Qianwu Palace and the others were overjoyed, hastily kneeling and welcoming respectfully: "The Qianwu Palace respectfully welcomes the Heavenly Venerable's descent!"</p><p></p><p>"Who has violated the rules of the Spiritual Realm, that you have summoned the honored guest to descend?" the Nen Fa Heavenly Venerable asked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shadow had already arrived in the airspace above Hongzhou, its voice rumbling like thunderous waves.</p><p></p><p>The remaining powerful figures in Hongzhou all had shocked expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin and the other Wanshi Alliance cultivators all had their expressions change drastically as they looked at the person walking out from the rainbow light. Their hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>Is this the profound foundation of the Superb Spirit Sect? Is this the support that the Superb Spirit Sect relies on to dominate the Spirit Realm, and also the origin of the Spirit Realm's rules?</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!" Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a match for him! I'm still too weak!" Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>What does the peak of the Spirit Realm amount to?</p><p></p><p>The master was right, one cannot become arrogant just because they have gained a bit of strength. The martial dao is boundless, and there may be even stronger experts out there! The person walking out from the rainbow light was wearing a black armor and holding a long spear, like a general on the battlefield, with an aura of ruthlessness. As if he had experienced countless battles and emerged as a powerful figure from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As he completely stepped into the territory of Hongzhou, the might of the Celestial Lord shook the surroundings, and the laws of the Spirit Realm seemed to be under his control.</p><p></p><p>The long spear in his hand emanated a chilling aura, making onlookers shudder.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Celestial Lord!" The Qian Wu Palace Master and the others respectfully and enthusiastically greeted him.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord swept his gaze and saw the five core geniuses including Hu Buibai, revealing a smile and saying, "Good, very good. You have performed a meritorious deed by representing the Qian Wu Palace to accept these five Spirit Body disciples."</p><p></p><p>The Qian Wu Palace Master and the others were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, who has violated the rules of the Spirit Realm? Who has offended the Qian Wu Palace!" The Celestial Lord said with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Qian Wu Palace Master was about to speak, a figure suddenly rushed in from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was at the peak of the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm, his face was now pale, panting heavily, having consumed a tremendous amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>With a panicked tone, he shouted, "Your Eminence, a grave matter has occurred! A mysterious black vortex has appeared at the location of the Icy Snow Palace in Icy State!"</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Icy State has melted, all related to this!" </p><p></p><p>This person was the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm expert who had rushed here frantically from Icy State.</p><p></p><p>To avoid the unknown danger, he had taken a long detour, and only now arrived in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>The Qian Wu Palace Master was furious, as this person had interrupted him just when he was about to report an important matter to the Celestial Lord. He glared at the man, about to reprimand him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the newly arrived Celestial Lord, upon hearing this, had a drastic change in expression.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and instantly grabbed the approaching cultivator, his eyes widening in shock as he asked, "What did you just say?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivator's face turned deathly pale, his whole body trembling, his lips quivering. This powerful expert was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, I mean no harm. Quickly, tell me!" The Celestial Lord took a deep breath and softened his tone to ask again.</p><p></p><p>"The location of the Icy Snow Palace has turned into a mysterious black vortex, very ominous. The snow in Icy State seems to be related to this. After I discovered this, I hurried to report it!" The cultivator said with trembling lips.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Lord's expression immediately changed drastically, a look of disbelief on his face. "A celestial vortex has appeared in the Spirit Realm? How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is Icy State?" The Celestial Lord asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"It's right this way!" The cultivator pointed.</p><p></p><p>"Transmit my order, all cultivators of the Spirit Realm sects are to gather in Icy State!" The Celestial Lord looked at the Qian Wu Palace Master and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>With that, he soared into the sky, declaring, "I, the Celestial Lord, shall go to Icy State to defend against the crisis!"</p><p></p><p>Without caring about the astonished gazes of the Qian Wu Palace Master and the others, he instantly departed, rushing towards Icy State.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do we do?" The Qian Wu Palace elders were bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had invited the Celestial Lord to descend in order to eliminate the Wanshi Alliance and cultivators like Xu Yan. But now the Celestial Lord had heard about the crisis in Icy State and directly gone there.</p><p></p><p>Defend against the crisis?</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Lord's order must be obeyed!" The Qian Wu Palace Master, though unwilling, could only follow the Celestial Lord's command.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the pale-faced cultivator and inquired about the details of the matter.</p><p></p><p>After the cultivator finished recounting, the Qian Wu Palace Master's expression also changed. The crisis in Icy State seemed even more terrifying than imagined! "A celestial vortex? There is only one celestial vortex relic in the Spirit Realm, why has it appeared at the Icy Snow Palace?"</p><p></p><p>The Qian Wu Palace Master's heart was filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not yet know the full implications of a celestial vortex, the fact that it had alarmed the Celestial Lord so much meant it was an extremely grave crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Tianhai, transmit the order, all cultivators of the Spirit Realm sects are to gather in Icy State, as per the Celestial Lord's command!" The Qian Wu Palace Master shouted.</p><p></p><p>He then led the Qian Wu Palace cultivators and the forces of their affiliated sects to depart for Icy State.</p><p></p><p>"Wanshi Alliance, you're in luck this time. Tan Wenlin, go to Icy State!" Fu Tianhai smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>A crisis had occurred in Icy State. All the cultivators set out for Icy State.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let's go to Icy State and take a look as well," Su Lingxiu said curiously, wondering what had happened in Icy State that had caused the Celestial Lord to rush there.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu originally wanted to persuade them, but thinking that the senior was a peerless expert, even a great crisis in Icy State would not pose a threat to the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Chicat, Jade Little Dragon, and Xiao Ha also came to the Evergreen Pavilion, and they all set out for Icy State together.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship took to the skies, turning into a beam of light and rushing towards Icy State.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Cloud State, a tragic massacre was unfolding.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud State cultivators who had just returned had already suffered some casualties.</p><p></p><p>"The fiend from the Icy Snow Palace, they must die!" Angry and furious shouts echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right, the people of the Icy Snow Palace are no longer their original selves, only their physical bodies remain!" Xin Mengrou said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Wu Tiannan directly attacked and killed an Icy Snow Palace woman.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! Her physical body was shattered by him, but the strange spiritual entity that had inhabited it seemed to have been withdrawn.</p><p></p><p>"The source is in Icy State, in the Icy Snow Palace, let's go there directly," the Cloudy Manor Lord said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>This great calamity in the Spirit Realm was even more terrifying than the previous Blood Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>The group headed straight for the Icy Snow Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Icy State has all melted." </p><p></p><p>Upon entering Icy State, there was no longer any pristine white snow, no biting cold, only a warm and pleasant atmosphere.</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right!" </p><p></p><p>In the flying ship, Fang Hao's expression was extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>After entering Icy State, he discovered that the auspicious spiritual energy had been disrupted, and the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth had lost their usual sensitivity and vitality.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the spiritual mechanisms appeared normal, but they had actually lost their keen perception of the abnormalities in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the spiritual mechanisms could not detect certain irregularities in the world.</p><p></p><p>This discovery weighed heavily on his heart, and he slowed down the speed of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for the senior to arrive, there's no need to take unnecessary risks," Yue Changming said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded, transmitting a message to the Wanshi Alliance experts, warning them not to rashly advance, and to be prepared to retreat at any time.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 347</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The snow in Ice Province melted, causing massive floods to sweep through Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province. The greatest disaster in the history of the Spirit Realm had arrived!</p><p></p><p>Powerful figures like the master of Thunder Cloud Manor were all shocked!</p><p></p><p>The gathered experts in Rainbow Province all changed expressions dramatically.</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, go back!"</p><p></p><p>"My Cloud Province is facing a great calamity!"</p><p></p><p>The experts from Cloud Province frantically left, returning to Cloud Province. </p><p></p><p>Their families, friends, and sects were all in Cloud Province. How many would be able to escape this catastrophe?</p><p></p><p>"This is unusual. The Snow Palace absolutely does not have the ability to create such a crisis. Something unexpected must have happened. We must investigate this thoroughly as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>The master of Thunder Cloud Manor had a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>He immediately led a group of Thunder Cloud Manor experts to depart.</p><p></p><p>Following them, experts from Ethereal Sect, Spirit Control Manor, Great Zhou Kingdom and other top spirit sects all left one after another, heading towards Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province.</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Ice Province melted?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. He thought of Mu Qianliu's warning not to go to Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's expression also changed, likewise recalling Mu Qianliu's words. Could it be that back then, Mu Qianliu already knew about the hidden catastrophe in Ice Province?</p><p></p><p>After last time, Mu Qianliu had disappeared again. </p><p></p><p>He did not return to the Mu family.</p><p></p><p>However, when news came of the Water Star Palace being destroyed, while others paid no attention, Meng Shushu took note and investigated a bit, learning about Tang Jinyan's identity.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Mu Qianliu's reaction when he mentioned Old Master Su being killed, and how he brought up Tang Jinyan, it seemed the mastermind back then was very likely Tang Jinyan.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu had destroyed the Water Star Palace and killed Tang Jinyan.</p><p></p><p>Then he completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu suspected that after killing Tang Jinyan and destroying Water Star Palace, Mu Qianliu may have also perished at Water Star Palace, probably by suicide?</p><p></p><p>To atone for the sins in his heart? The person had already vanished, never to be found again.</p><p></p><p>What exactly happened in Ice Province back then, likely no one knew anymore.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao and Zi Yun came to Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The snow in Ice Province has melted, flooding Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province. It's said the casualties are devastating. What a catastrophe!" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed.</p><p></p><p>Such a disaster, with an entire province flooded, how horrific must the death toll be.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm had eighteen provinces, any single province was more vast than the entire Inner Realm. It was simply unimaginable how terrifying this calamity was.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to lead the people of Eternal Alliance to Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province..." </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao came to bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>As someone born and raised in the Spirit Realm, he naturally felt more sorrow for such a massive disaster in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao led some of the Eternal Alliance experts to depart for Cloud Province and Great Marsh Province. Tan Wenlin stayed behind to oversee Eternal Alliance and handle subsequent affairs.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, for the disaster in Cloud Province, this junior should also go and do his part!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan said with a heavy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Go then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Wu Tiannan left, Su Lingxiu also prepared to head to Cloud Province.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Evergreen Pavilion flying ship was about to launch, suddenly a beam of rainbow light appeared abruptly, like a bridge stretching from Rainbow Province, seemingly spanning across the Azure Sea to reach the other shore.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes slightly. This beam of rainbow light was formed from the convergence of the laws of heaven and earth, reaching beyond the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the Divine Bridge?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's not the Divine Bridge, but the Phantom Bridge. The Divine Bridge is solid, not like this. This is someone opening the Phantom Bridge to invite an honored guest to descend," </p><p></p><p>Fu Yunxiu said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"Inviting an honored guest to descend?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others looked at her in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also curious inside, but as a high-level expert, he had to appear to have everything under control and know all matters between heaven and earth. So his expression remained calm, as if he was already thoroughly familiar with this.</p><p></p><p>"Mom, what's going on?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng also asked curiously, urging her to explain.</p><p></p><p>"A transcendent spirit sect has opened the Phantom Bridge. Every transcendent spirit sect has extraordinary backing. Whenever a spirit body prodigy needs to leave the Spirit Realm, they would open the Phantom Bridge.</p><p></p><p>"When the Phantom Bridge opens, it invites an honored guest to descend and take away the spirit body prodigy, then the Phantom Bridge will disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Generally, the Phantom Bridge can only be opened once every ten years, and it won't exist for too long."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun explained briefly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was about to ask further where they go after leaving the Spirit Realm, when he saw the master of Thousand Martial Palace and a group of elders standing in the rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Martial Palace invites the honored guest to descend and destroy those who violate the rules of the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The master of Thousand Martial Palace called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Martial Palace!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai moved swiftly, arriving at Evergreen Pavilion with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you all should hide for now. Thousand Martial Palace inviting an honored guest to descend must be aimed at you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and said: "I want to see just what kind of honored guest Thousand Martial Palace can invite!"</p><p></p><p>With Master here, what was there to fear?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow, his gaze looking towards the end of the rainbow light. He also wanted to see what kind of expert would descend, and where the end of the rainbow light led.</p><p></p><p>He was already at the Divine Phase realm, with strength surpassing Spiritual Refinement Celestials. So he still had some confidence.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai looked at Li Xuan. This mysterious expert likely had an extraordinary background, and may not necessarily fear the backer of Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>So he no longer tried to persuade them.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rainbow light fluctuated, and a figure came from the end of the rainbow light.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura shook the surroundings. As he walked, it was as if all the mighty power of heaven and earth was within his body.</p><p></p><p>"It's a Law Condensation Celestial Lord!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Law Condensation Celestial Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently. It was indeed as he had guessed - cultivation above the Spiritual Refinement Celestial realm involved condensing the laws of heaven and earth into one's body.</p><p></p><p>The person walking in the rainbow light had an incredibly powerful aura, far beyond martial artists who had merely condensed law power.</p><p></p><p>He had already condensed the laws of heaven and earth into his body, possessing the mighty power of heaven and earth. With every move, he wielded the majesty of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Law Condensation Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>"Not early stage Law Condensation, probably late stage."</p><p></p><p>As the Law Condensation Celestial Lord drew closer, Li Xuan also judged his strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth were profound, fused with his spirit. The mighty power of heaven and earth was all within his body. That profound law of heaven and earth was not as simple as just entering the Law Condensation realm.</p><p></p><p>Probably late stage Law Condensation!</p><p></p><p>He held a long spear in his hand, which was a divine artifact far more powerful than spirit artifacts of the Spirit Realm. If spirit artifacts of the Spirit Realm were considered low grade, the one in his hand was high grade.</p><p></p><p>"Strength comparable to the Divine Ability realm."</p><p></p><p>In theory, the Law Condensation Celestial Lord realm was higher than the Divine Ability realm, but their strength was comparable.</p><p></p><p>"Even if Xu Yan reached peak Divine Element realm, he would be no match for a Law Condensation Celestial Lord. But at Divine Ability realm he would not fear."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt relieved inside.</p><p></p><p>He could kill a Law Condensation Celestial Lord when he was at Divine Ability realm. Now that he was at Divine Phase realm, he feared even less.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I surpass Law Condensation Celestial Lords."</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness martial way far surpassed the Supreme Azure martial way at Divine Element realm. Upon entering Divine Ability realm, it was theoretically comparable to Spiritual Refinement Celestials, but in strength it was at the Law Condensation Celestial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>And it was even stronger than Law Condensation Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The profundity of divine abilities was extraordinary, naturally a cut above.</p><p></p><p>The master of Thousand Martial Palace and others were overjoyed, hurriedly prostrating themselves in welcome: "Thousand Martial Palace respectfully welcomes the Celestial Lord's descent!"</p><p></p><p>"Who has violated the rules of the Spirit Realm, requiring an honored guest to descend?"</p><p></p><p>The figure on the rainbow light</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shadow had already arrived in the sky above Hong State, its voice rolling like thunder.</p><p></p><p>The remaining powerful figures in Hong State all had terrified expressions.</p><p></p><p>Tan Wenlin and the other World Alliance martial artists all changed their expressions dramatically, looking at the person walking out of the rainbow light with trembling hearts.</p><p></p><p>Was this the foundation of the Transcendent Spirit Sect? Was this what the Spirit Realm relied on to rule, and the origin of its rules?</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!" Xu Yan said with a solemn expression. </p><p></p><p>He was no match! "I'm still too weak after all!" Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>What did being at the peak of the Spirit Realm count for?</p><p></p><p>His master was right - one shouldn't become arrogant just from gaining some strength. The martial way is endless. Just when you think you're the strongest, there may be even stronger people!</p><p></p><p>The person walking out of the rainbow light wore black armor and held a long spear, like a general on the battlefield, with an aura of killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had experienced countless battles and emerged as a powerful figure from the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Stepping out of the rainbow light and fully entering Hong State territory, the Heavenly Venerable's might shook in all directions. It seemed even the laws of heaven and earth in the Spirit Realm were under their control.</p><p></p><p>The long spear in their hand exuded a chilling killing intent that made people's hearts go cold just looking at it.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Heavenly Venerable!" the Thousand Martial Palace Master and others said respectfully and fervently.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable's gaze swept over them, landing on Hu Bubai and the other four core geniuses. They smiled and said, "Good, very good. You as this generation's Thousand Martial Palace Master have recruited five Spirit Body disciples. You have rendered a great service!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master and others were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, who has defied the rules of the Spirit Realm? Who has offended the Thousand Martial Palace?" the Heavenly Venerable asked with a piercing gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the Heavenly Venerable, it was..." The Thousand Martial Palace Master had just opened his mouth when at that moment, a figure came rushing frantically from the horizon.</p><p></p><p>Even with peak Tempering Divine Human realm cultivation, his face was pale and he was panting heavily, having expended a great deal of energy.</p><p></p><p>His voice carried a tone of fear as he called out loudly: "Esteemed Upper Sect member, something terrible has happened! A unknown black cave has appeared where the Silent Snow Palace is located in Ice State. </p><p></p><p>"The melting of snow in Ice State is related to this!"</p><p></p><p>This person was the peak Tempering Divine Human realm martial artist who had rushed over frantically from Ice State.</p><p></p><p>In order to avoid unknown dangers, he had taken a big detour, and had only just hurried over.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master was furious - how dare this person interrupt his report of important matters to the Heavenly Venerable! This person deserved death! He glared angrily, about to rebuke him.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, the Heavenly Venerable who had just descended, upon hearing this, had a huge change in expression.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of their hand, they instantly summoned the martial artist who was still flying over. With widened eyes, they asked in shock: "What did you just say?"</p><p></p><p>That martial artist was so frightened his face turned deathly pale. His whole body trembled, his lips quivering. This powerful figure was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, I mean you no harm. Speak quickly!" The Heavenly Venerable took a deep breath and asked again in a gentler tone.</p><p></p><p>"Where the Silent Snow Palace is located in Ice State has turned into a black cave. It's very strange. The melting of snow in Ice State seems to be mostly related to this. After I discovered it, I hurried over to report!" The martial artist said with quivering lips.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Venerable's expression changed drastically in an instant, with a look of disbelief. "A Heaven's Cave has appeared in the Spirit Realm? How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is Ice State?" the Heavenly Venerable asked gravely.</p><p></p><p>"You can reach Ice State from here!" The martial artist pointed.</p><p></p><p>"Relay this Venerable's order - all Spirit Sect martial artists in the Spirit Realm are to gather in Ice State!" The Heavenly Venerable looked at the Thousand Martial Palace Master and said sternly.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the words left their mouth, their figure rose into the sky and said: "This Venerable will go to Ice State to suppress the enemy!"</p><p></p><p>Without regard for the shocked expressions of the Thousand Martial Palace Master and others, they vanished in an instant, heading straight for Ice State.</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, what should we do?" The elders of the Thousand Martial Palace were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Originally, they had invited the Venerable to descend in order to kill the World Alliance and Xu Yan's group. But after arriving and hearing about the changes in Ice State, the Venerable had gone directly to Ice State.</p><p></p><p>Suppress the enemy?</p><p></p><p>"The Venerable's orders cannot be disobeyed!" No matter how unwilling the Thousand Martial Palace Master was, he could only obey the Venerable's orders.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the pale-faced martial artist and asked for details.</p><p></p><p>After listening to his account, the Thousand Martial Palace Master's expression also changed. The changes in Ice State seemed even more terrifying than imagined!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven's Cave? The Spirit Realm only has one Heaven's Cave relic site. Why would a Heaven's Cave appear at the Silent Snow Palace in Ice State?" The Thousand Martial Palace Master felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what a Heaven's Cave signified, the fact that it made the Venerable so nervous and cautious meant it must be an extremely great crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Fu Tianhai, relay the order for Spirit Sect martial artists to gather in Ice State. This is the Venerable's command!" the Thousand Martial Palace Master called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>He then led the Thousand Martial Palace martial artists and affiliated Spirit Sect forces to set out for Ice State.</p><p></p><p>"World Alliance, you're lucky. Tan Wenlin, go to Ice State!" Fu Tianhai said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Something big had happened in Ice State.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists set out for Ice State one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let's go to Ice State and take a look too." Su Lingxiu said curiously. What exactly had happened in Ice State that made even that Venerable go there directly?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu originally wanted to try to dissuade them, but then he thought about how his senior was a peerless expert. No matter how big the changes in Ice State, they couldn't possibly threaten Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat, Jade Little Dragon, and Little Ha also came to Evergreen Pavilion to go to Ice State together.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Evergreen Pavilion flying ship rose into the sky, turning into a beam of light heading straight for Ice State.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Cloud State was in a miserable state, with killing still ongoing.</p><p></p><p>Some of the Cloud State martial artists who had just returned had already fallen.</p><p></p><p>"Those Silent Snow Palace freaks deserve to die!" Roars and angry voices could be heard constantly.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. The Silent Snow Palace people are no longer the original people, only their physical bodies remain!" Xin Menrou said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Wu Tiannan attacked directly, killing a Silent Snow Palace woman.</p><p></p><p>With a loud crash, the Silent Snow Palace woman's physical body was destroyed by him. However, the strange soul inhabiting the body seemed to be taken back.</p><p></p><p>"The source is in Ice State, at the Silent Snow Palace. Let's go directly to the Silent Snow Palace." The Lightning Cloud Manor Lord said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>This great disaster in the Spirit Realm was even more terrifying than the Blood Demon calamity from before.</p><p></p><p>The group headed straight for where the Silent Snow Palace was located.</p><p></p><p>"All the snow in Ice State has melted."</p><p></p><p>Upon entering Ice State, the vast expanse of white snow was nowhere to be seen. There was no bone-chilling cold, only a warm spring-like feeling.</p><p></p><p>There was no scorching heat, just a pleasant warmth.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!" On the flying ship, Fang Hao's expression was extremely grave.</p><p></p><p>After entering Ice State, he discovered some peculiarities in the patterns of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Within the mild atmosphere, there seemed to be an unknown force blocking the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, causing it to lose its vitality.</p><p></p><p>On the surface, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth appeared normal, but in reality it had lost the sensitivity it should have had.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was unable to detect some abnormalities in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This discovery made his heart heavy, and he couldn't help but slow down the speed of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait for Senior to arrive. There's no need to take risks!" Yue Changming said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded and sent a message to the World Alliance's powerful figures, telling them not to advance rashly and to be prepared to flee at any time.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 333</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paused for a moment and shook his head, saying, "I am not the Sword King, I am the Sword God!"</p><p></p><p>The title of Sword King was not worthy of him.</p><p></p><p>The woman was puzzled, "How did a Sword God suddenly appear? Benefactor, are you not the Sword King? Looking across the Azure Sea, only the Sword King could possess such sword dao!"</p><p></p><p>The woman said this with some disbelief.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan immediately became interested.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Sea has a Sword King? Where is he, and how powerful is he?" </p><p></p><p>Since he claimed to be the Sword God, the existence of a Sword King in the Azure Sea piqued his curiosity. He wondered how the other's sword dao would compare, though he presumed it would be roughly on par with the Thousand Sword Palace.</p><p></p><p>The woman was certain that this person was not the legendary Sword King, and she was greatly shocked. "When did the Azure Sea produce such a powerful sword cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"The Sword King is in Yuntiancheng. He single-handedly defeated all the sword cultivators of the Azure Sea, sweeping through the sword dao of Yuntiancheng. All the sword cultivators of the Azure Sea are in awe of him. They all say that the Sword King's sword is the true embodiment of the sword dao."</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the Sword King is a very arrogant person. Although he says his sword dao has just begun, barely entering the door of the sword dao and not yet comprehending the true essence of the sword dao, in his eyes all the sword cultivators of Yuntiancheng are trash."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened and couldn't help but feel this style was familiar.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask, "What is the name of this Sword King you speak of?"</p><p></p><p>The woman felt a bit embarrassed, "I only know him as the Sword King, but I don't know his actual name."</p><p></p><p>Just then, one of the escaped Refining Spirit cultivators, who was stronger than the others, was surrounded and about to be killed by the Blood Knife Bandits. He was only able to relax after Xu Yan stepped in and eliminated the bandits.</p><p></p><p>This cultivator then walked over and said, "The Sword King's name is Xie Tianheng!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood, no wonder the style was so familiar - it was Xie Tianheng! "So Xie Tianheng has even earned the title of Sword King."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, it seems that in the past few years Xie Tianheng's strength has risen rapidly, likely reaching the ranks of the Supremely Powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard of Xie Lingfeng?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Since Xie Tianheng had achieved the title of Sword King, Xie Lingfeng, who also had exceptional talent, should have also carved out a reputation for himself in the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"Is he not the son of the Sword King?" the cultivator asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The son of the Sword King was once a genius of Yuntiancheng, but alas, these past few years he has made no progress, and has even been surpassed by those he once defeated. His reputation as a genius has been tarnished, and he has long since faded into obscurity," the cultivator sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The fall of a genius, the son of the Sword King, has even been mocked as a waste," he lamented.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clicked his tongue. So Xie Lingfeng had fallen so far? </p><p></p><p>It was understandable. Xie Lingfeng had exceptional talent, and should have already perfected his Spirit Sense Realm cultivation. With that foundation, breaking through to the Refining Spirit Realm should not have been a problem.</p><p></p><p>But he had been unable to break through, while his former subordinates continued to advance, reaching the late and peak Refining Spirit Realm, naturally surpassing Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he had faded into obscurity, and was even mocked as a waste.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, just wait a little longer. I will come find you, and you will surely rise again, surpassing those who once served under you," Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the father and son of the Xie family had made quite a name for themselves in the Azure Sea Yuntiancheng, rather than staying low-key.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked the cultivator for more information about the Xie father and son. The cultivator only knew that a few years ago, Xie Tianheng first made a name for himself by challenging a Refining Spirit Realm cultivator. At the time, Xie Tianheng was at the Great Celestial Realm, and everyone thought he would surely lose. But Xie Tianheng rose up powerfully, displaying extraordinary sword dao and defeating his opponent across realms. From then on, his reputation soared.</p><p></p><p>"It is rumored that the Sword King's wife has an extraordinary background, otherwise with the Sword King's former arrogance, he would have long been surrounded and beaten to death," the cultivator sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, understanding that Xie Tianheng's wife must be from the Spiritual Realm, though he didn't know how an Inner Realm cultivator like Xie Tianheng managed to marry a woman from the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>After asking a few more things about Xie Lingfeng and not getting much more information, Xu Yan bid farewell and left on the sea beast-drawn boat.</p><p></p><p>"Sword God? Could it be that I'm about to witness another sword dao showdown?" the cultivator muttered excitedly. Such a grand event, he couldn't afford to miss it. And if the Sword King were to hear that someone dared to call themselves the Sword God, he would surely be enraged...</p><p></p><p>In the Yuntiancheng of the Azure Sea, the Transcendent Spiritual Sect ruled the entire Azure Sea, even the Azure Sea Overlord Spiritual Race had to heed the orders of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The Du family was the City Lord's family of Yuntiancheng. In this generation, the City Lord Du Tianhai's strength was extraordinarily powerful, rumored to have surpassed the previous City Lords.</p><p></p><p>He was undisputedly the number one power in the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Although Yuntiancheng was under the control of the City Lord's Mansion, there were also many other factions. The Spiritual Race held important positions in the City Lord's Mansion, their status and influence were supreme.</p><p></p><p>There had long been rumors that from ancient times, Yuntiancheng and the Spiritual Race had a contract, jointly ruling the Azure Sea, and in certain times the Spiritual Race had to obey the orders of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>The specific content and terms of the contract were only known to the true inner circle of the City Lord's Mansion and the Spiritual Race's upper echelons.</p><p></p><p>Among the major factions of Yuntiancheng, the Myriad Stars Academy was one. After being driven out of the Eighteen Provinces, they established a martial arts academy in Yuntiancheng, and had since cultivated many renowned martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Stars Academy's principal was rumored to have a deep friendship with the City Lord, so the academy was seen as having the backing of the City Lord's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>To this day, the Myriad Stars Academy's influence in Yuntiancheng, and even the entire Azure Sea, was already quite substantial.</p><p></p><p>The academy's students included geniuses from all over the Azure Sea, as well as scions of prominent Yuntiancheng families, especially those from declining noble houses.</p><p></p><p>There were also students from the Spiritual Race, who increasingly preferred to send their younger generation to the academy to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>A few years ago, two notable events occurred in Yuntiancheng:</p><p></p><p>Firstly, the crown prince of the Great Zhou Royal House was sent to the Myriad Stars Academy to cultivate. Secondly, Yuntiancheng's City Lord Du Tianhai suddenly gained a son-in-law and a grandson from the Inner Realm, through the City Lord's Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>The major powers of Yuntiancheng were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>And those who had long admired the City Lord's daughter were completely stunned - how could they be surpassed by someone from the Inner Realm? Their goddess had actually married an Inner Realm man and had a son with him?</p><p></p><p>When this news spread among the major powers of Yuntiancheng, many couldn't help but recall a certain past event.</p><p></p><p>It was said that the City Lord's daughter had once gone to the Eighteen Provinces, reportedly because the scandalous affairs of the Wood Family's playboy had reached the Azure Sea, and the City Lord's daughter felt the Wood Family's playboy was too despicable, so she went to eliminate him.</p><p></p><p>The pursuit of the Wood Family's playboy was said to have led her all the way to the Inner Realm, and it took many years before she returned to Yuntiancheng.</p><p></p><p>As for whether she actually eliminated the Wood Family's playboy, there were no further rumors about that.</p><p></p><p>And the Wood Family's playboy seemed to have disappeared, with Yuntiancheng once rumoring that he had likely been killed by the City Lord's daughter.</p><p></p><p>The end.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So, you went to the Inner Realm and actually had a son? The admirers were struck like by lightning, all wanting to see what was so outstanding about that guy from the Inner Realm that he managed to win the heart of the city lord's beloved daughter.</p><p></p><p>There were rumors that when the city lord Fu Tianhai learned that he suddenly had a son-in-law and a grandson, he almost died of anger, but the deed was done, so he could only pinch his nose and endure it. After all, he couldn't just kill the person, right? Moreover, the son-in-law seemed to have good natural talents, as he had broken through to the Small Celestial Realm soon after arriving in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>At first, to avoid trouble, the city lord's son-in-law stayed deep within the city lord's mansion, never going out, letting the rumors and gossip spread, appearing very low-key and obedient to the city lord's orders.</p><p></p><p>Until, after the city lord's son-in-law broke through to the Great Celestial Realm, he started to become arrogant.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he did was to viciously beat up a certain young master from a prominent family who had admired his wife.</p><p></p><p>Then, he also challenged another Refining Deity Realm cultivator, calling him a waste over and over again, full of disdain and arrogance, angering the other party to the point of near death.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the city lord's son-in-law, at the Great Celestial Realm, defeated the Refining Deity Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>At this point, all the major powers couldn't help but look at him with different eyes.</p><p></p><p>When the city lord's son-in-law broke through to the Refining Deity Realm, he became even more arrogant, looking down on everyone as if they were all trash, one by one beating up all those who had once admired his wife.</p><p></p><p>And the city lord's grandson also gradually revealed his prowess, defeating one genius from prominent families after another.</p><p></p><p>However, the city lord's grandson has now become a fallen genius. He was once so glorious, but now he has become so wretched, surpassed by those who were once his inferiors, mocked by his former subordinates.</p><p></p><p>His strength has made no progress at all, and he has become the embodiment of a waste.</p><p></p><p>Under the guidance of some people with ulterior motives, a saying even started to circulate in the Cloud Sky City: "A genius for a moment is not a true genius, and may even be a waste, just like the son of the Sword King!"</p><p></p><p>The son of the Sword King, a fallen genius, but the Sword King himself has become more and more unrestrained, more and more overbearing, just like his name.</p><p></p><p>He even once looked down on his father-in-law, only to be beaten up severely.</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard of the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>A young man was sitting cross-legged on the edge of the pond in the courtyard, a sword resting horizontally on his knees, the sword intent swirling around him, like surging waves and rushing water sounds emanating from the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"What martial art did you have Feng'er cultivate? Now look, he has reached a bottleneck!" </p><p></p><p>At the courtyard gate, a beautiful woman, with one hand on Xie Tianheng's waist, said with dissatisfaction.</p><p></p><p>She was Fu Tianhai's beloved daughter, Fu Yun.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng grinned and said, "It was his own choice. Besides, reaching a bottleneck is just a matter of lacking the next cultivation method, a small matter. I'll go to the Eighteen Prefectures soon to bring back the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>"This so-called Great Wilderness Martial Art, is it truly that powerful? If so, why didn't you record more cultivation methods back then?" </p><p></p><p>Fu Yun was still dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Remembering too many would make it hard to comprehend," Xie Tianheng said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, in a few days I'll go to the Eighteen Prefectures. Although Feng'er hasn't broken through yet, his sword intent is more refined, his comprehension of the Sword Dao is deeper. Once he breaks through, his strength will surely be even greater."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun sighed and said, "I suddenly realized that I was tricked by you when I went to the Inner Realm back then. It's all my fault for being too young!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng's mouth twitched as he said, "My lady, I didn't trick you. I've done everything I promised you. Looking out at the azure sea, the Sword Dao is supreme!"</p><p></p><p>"You can only show off in the Azure Sea. I've heard that the Eighteen Prefectures have produced a Sword Deity, not even twenty years old, who has already suppressed the geniuses of the Spiritual Realm. </p><p></p><p>"He even blocked the gate of the Thousand Sword Hall to challenge them, slaying the Thousand Sword Hall genius, and took the divine artifact right in front of the Thousand Sword Hall's strong cultivators, who were unable to stop him."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun gave him a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was shocked and asked, "The Eighteen Prefectures have produced such a genius? What is his name?"</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, "Could it be Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Such a bold and arrogant style, and also known as the Sword Deity, he immediately thought of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, the Sword Deity Xu Yan, he's famous throughout the Eighteen Prefectures," Fu Yun said.</p><p></p><p>Indeed! </p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng sighed inwardly, Xu Yan is as unrestrained as ever, no wonder he is the disciple of the senior. I'm still far behind.</p><p></p><p>"Set a small goal, when will I have the strength to suppress my father-in-law? Then I can be even more unrestrained!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Eighteen Prefectures, any other rumors? Like someone who is very skilled with the dao, or some extraordinary medicinal pills?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng asked.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun looked at him suspiciously and said, "Don't you already know about it?"</p><p></p><p>"No, I've been too busy dealing with those good-for-nothings to pay attention to these things," Xie Tianheng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"There's a Dao Venerable named Meng Chong, also very powerful, second only to Xu Yan. And there's the Long Qing Pavilion, rumored to have a medicinal saint who can revive the dead and heal all ailments, their medicinal pills are said to be miraculous.</p><p></p><p>"It's said they can easily heal root damage, spirit body collapse, and even old injuries. The rumors are incredible, I even want to go to the Eighteen Prefectures to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun spoke of the news from the Eighteen Prefectures with an incredulous expression.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng nodded, this was all within his expectations. Even in the Cloud Sky Azure Sea City, he had already established such a fearsome reputation, how could Xu Yan and Meng Chong be weak?</p><p></p><p>They would only be stronger.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Xie Ling Feng, who was still cultivating his sword intent, and couldn't help but feel helpless. His own son had actually stopped his rapid progress.</p><p></p><p>"In a few days, I'll take Feng'er to the Eighteen Prefectures."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Is it for Feng'er's cultivation method?" </p><p></p><p>Fu Yun asked.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng nodded and said, "The competition among geniuses has already begun, right? If Feng'er goes to the Eighteen Prefectures, he'll have a chance to participate. Otherwise, with his current strength, he won't be able to participate in the Genius Confrontation."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun sighed and said, "To participate in the Genius Confrontation, I'm afraid it's too late. You know, the geniuses who can participate in the final battle of the Genius Confrontation are at least cultivators who have condensed a wisp of the Heaven and Earth's spiritual energy."</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"What confidence do you have? You're only at the level of cultivators who have condensed a wisp of the Heaven and Earth's spiritual energy, and Feng'er is even further away. There's less than three years until the Genius Confrontation, even if Feng'er gets the next cultivation method, how could he possibly cultivate to the level of the strongest in just two years?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun frowned.</p><p></p><p>"That's why we need to go to the Eighteen Prefectures. With the help of medicinal pills and guidance, two years will be enough!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a steward hurriedly came.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter? Another challenge for Feng'er? Refuse them!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun frowned and said to the steward.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, there is someone named Xu Yan outside the city lord's mansion, claiming to be a old friend of the young master..."</p><p></p><p>The steward began to speak.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 471</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Tianzi scratched his messy hair, looking expectantly outside the small stone house, then disappointedly hung his head.</p><p></p><p>"He's not really not coming, is he? If he doesn't come, I'll be so bored."</p><p></p><p>When someone has been lonely for a long time, it gradually becomes a habit. But suddenly one day, when pulled out of that loneliness, it becomes unbearable to return to it.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was not originally a person with a calm temperament who could endure patiently. He was forced by circumstances to stay here, and it gradually became a habit. </p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan's arrival broke that habit, and he could no longer remain patient.</p><p></p><p>"If I had known, I would have said some more valuable things."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi felt some regret.</p><p></p><p>Finally someone had come who was incredibly powerful, someone he could talk to, and who didn't seem to have any bad intentions. But because of his caution, the conversation had stalled, and now the person wasn't coming anymore.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, Taicang tricked me into coming here, locked me up here, and then died himself. Isn't that just making things difficult for me?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang died, but he just had to protect this world and shelter humanity. He's really made things hard for me. What should I do now?</p><p></p><p>"This world is starting to have some problems too. Taicang's painstaking efforts are ultimately not appreciated."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of these things, Tianzi both resented Taicang and felt very troubled.</p><p></p><p>"That guy should be very strong, stronger than Taicang? Maybe even stronger than that terrifying guy?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi frowned in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Next time he comes, I'll say some things and see how he reacts, see if he knows anything."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi recalled something.</p><p></p><p>"Besides Taicang and that terrifying guy, where else could there be such a powerful expert? If one really existed, Taicang would have known, and that terrifying guy would have known too.</p><p></p><p>"But he's not that terrifying guy in disguise, nor is he one of those other six guys. Could his strength really be so great that even Taicang and that terrifying guy didn't know about him?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more Tianzi found it difficult to understand.</p><p></p><p>"That terrifying guy, although very very strong, was still detected by Taicang. Not just Taicang, but those other six as well. Yet this person has never been mentioned before.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang never mentioned him, those six never mentioned him either. It's really strange. If his strength is truly so great, to the point of being invincible and lonely, he shouldn't care about this world.</p><p></p><p>"He wouldn't covet this world like that terrifying guy, would he?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi pondered, thinking about what he should and shouldn't say if he saw Li Xuan again.</p><p></p><p>He even considered how to probe whether the other party was truly invincible and lonely.</p><p></p><p>"If he's really that powerful, he should know about the battle between Taicang and that terrifying guy, right?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi suddenly had an idea - maybe he could test him? "Yes, if he comes again, I'll test to see if he knows about the battle between Taicang and that terrifying guy. Such a massive battle - if he doesn't know about it, he must not be from the same era as Taicang, but a later arrival.</p><p></p><p>"If he's a later arrival, no matter how strong he is, could he really surpass Taicang? If he really did surpass Taicang, it would only mean this later arrival is too much of a freak, but that seems impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The more Tianzi thought about it, the more he felt he was clever to have figured out the key so quickly.</p><p></p><p>He waited and waited, but Li Xuan didn't come. Tianzi's hair became messier and messier as he pulled at it, and he grew increasingly agitated.</p><p></p><p>He even smashed the only bed left in his space to vent his frustration.</p><p></p><p>But he regretted it immediately after.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, now I won't even be able to lie down comfortably. That was the bed Taicang made for me!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi wanted to cry but had no tears.</p><p></p><p>"He's not really never coming back, is he?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi deflated, slumping in the small stone house, looking utterly dejected.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long he had been sitting in the stone house.</p><p></p><p>Just then.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tianzi, what's wrong with you?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as Tianzi heard this voice, he became extremely excited, with tears in his eyes. He had finally come.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you..."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi looked up, and his body suddenly shook. He was greatly shocked, his eyes widened, and he abruptly stood up, unconsciously becoming nervous.</p><p></p><p>"You... you..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, surrounded by the Dao Ancestor's halo, entered the small stone house, quite satisfied with Tianzi's reaction.</p><p></p><p>"Little Tianzi, don't be so alarmed."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, a table appeared, and he brewed a pot of tea.</p><p></p><p>"Come, have some tea!"</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor's halo gradually disappeared, and he returned to his ordinary appearance.</p><p></p><p>The more ordinary he looked, the more unsettled and nervous Tianzi became.</p><p></p><p>All the probing questions he had prepared were forgotten.</p><p></p><p>He picked up a cup of tea and downed it in one gulp to calm his nerves!</p><p></p><p>Normally, he wouldn't be able to drink this tea, or if he did, he would complain it was garbage. But now, after drinking a cup, Tianzi didn't seem to notice how bad it tasted. Instead, he poured himself two more cups and drank them one after another.</p><p></p><p>Just to calm his nerves!</p><p></p><p>"Tea isn't meant to be drunk like that. Oh well, you're just a kid, you don't understand the way of tea."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>By now, Tianzi had gradually calmed his shock. He scratched his hair and asked curiously, "Senior, what was that just now?"</p><p></p><p>What he had just witnessed was the most shocking thing he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, just a trace of my true form's power."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said casually with a smile.</p><p></p><p>But inside, he was delighted. Tianzi had been thoroughly intimidated, hadn't he?</p><p></p><p>Of course, apart from his physical martial arts, his other four martial arts had all reached the Realm of Establishing the Dao. In terms of strength, he had no need to worry about Tianzi at all.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was shocked again. If just a trace of his true form's power was already so unfathomable, how incredibly powerful must his real strength be?</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are you really that strong?" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi couldn't help but ask again.</p><p></p><p>"In your eyes, what does 'strong' mean? In my mind, there is no concept of 'strong', because everything I see is weak and fragile, including this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was stunned for a moment. Even Taicang's world was so weak and fragile in his eyes? How was that not strong? Even that terrifying guy didn't dare to underestimate Taicang's world.</p><p></p><p>If Taicang's world wasn't strong, it wouldn't still exist today.</p><p></p><p>And in his eyes, such a powerful world was so fragile in the other's view?</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Tianzi decided to test him.</p><p></p><p>The battle between Taicang and that terrifying guy had shaken heaven and earth, lasting for a long time. If he knew about this battle, it would mean he was from the same era as Taicang and the others.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't know, he must be a later arrival. Could his strength really have reached such an unbelievable level?</p><p></p><p>"When I was trapped here, a battle broke out. I don't remember how long ago that battle was, I only know that the world shook for ten thousand years, and the realm beyond the sky was also disturbed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, do you know about this battle? What was the outcome?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi stared with wide eyes</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His eyes fixed on Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"You've learned to probe? That fellow Tianzi, is he preparing to say something? That battle should be the source of the changes in heaven and earth back then, right?" Li Xuan was slightly surprised inwardly, but his face remained calm and unperturbed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know about that battle, had never seen it, and naturally didn't know the outcome.</p><p></p><p>However, as a peerless expert, an unfathomable existence, Li Xuan had long ago crafted for himself an inscrutable, high-status identity.</p><p></p><p>Especially after reaching the Realm of Establishing the Dao, when he glimpsed the situation beyond heaven and earth with one look, he had made some preparations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since he wanted to learn the secrets of heaven and earth from Tianzi's mouth, he naturally needed a reasonable explanation, while also not lowering his image as an unfathomable expert.</p><p></p><p>So Tianzi's question didn't stump Li Xuan at all.</p><p></p><p>"The battle you mentioned? That was indeed quite a while ago. A bunch of little ones squabbling, they did make quite a commotion, even woke me up.</p><p></p><p>"Kids fighting is a normal thing, this Ancestral Dao has seen far too much of it. Compared to the time you mentioned, I've seen even more intense fights.</p><p></p><p>"So this Ancestral Dao simply moved to another place and went back to sleep.</p><p></p><p>"As for the outcome, this Ancestral Dao couldn't be bothered to find out. Among the fights I've seen, this was just a minor scuffle, not worth mentioning."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, his tone relaxed, as if talking about a group of children he had once seen brawling.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Such an intense battle, in his words, was just children fighting?</p><p></p><p>Why did it feel like he was boasting? While shocked, Tianzi couldn't help but ask, "You say you've seen more than one such battle?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "Of course, the battle you mentioned was just a minor incident."</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly are you? Do you know about Taicang?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart stirred. Taicang?</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Taicang Book?</p><p></p><p>The lord of this world?</p><p></p><p>"Taicang?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan appeared to reminisce for a moment, then nodded and said, "I've heard of a youngster called Taicang, quite talented!"</p><p></p><p>Just that?</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was increasingly dumbfounded. This person had heard of Taicang, and his impression of Taicang was that he was quite talented!</p><p></p><p>"Taicang has lived for a very, very long time. He existed before heaven and earth. You call Taicang a youngster, so how long have you lived?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was becoming unsettled, forgetting some secrets he shouldn't have mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly shocked to hear this. Taicang was that impressive? He actually existed before heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"Wait, could it be that Taicang created this world?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was amazed. If that was true, Taicang's strength would naturally surpass his current Realm of Establishing the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi had already let slip some information. It was the perfect opportunity to deceive him and probe for secrets.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped his tea, his gaze profound. The Ancestral Dao halo, mysterious aura, and even the Great Wilderness divine appearance faintly emerged, as if he was reminiscing about the past, his true form unconsciously revealing a tiny bit.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi had some doubts in his heart about whether Li Xuan was boasting, but now, seeing this Ancestral Dao halo, mysterious aura, and Great Wilderness divine appearance, the doubts in his heart instantly vanished! This person must be an incredibly terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>This faint glimpse of his true power was far beyond what Taicang could compare to. Even Taicang and that terrifying fellow were not so profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>"How long has this Ancestral Dao lived?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed wistfully and said, "I don't know how long it's been. When I attained the Dao, the Great Dao had not yet been born, time did not exist, there was nothing in the void, not even chaos had come into being..."</p><p></p><p>It was just boasting, of course, exaggerating to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was confident in his skill at boasting.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi listened in a daze, clutching his hair, completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"...I have seen far too many powerful beings, and have guided far too many beings. I have also created far too many cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"I have walked so far on the path of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Some call me the Ancestor of Martial Arts, others the First Divine Demon of Chaos, and some the Ancestor of the Great Dao... Of course, now some also call me the Martial Ancestor of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"But of course, my favorite is still the title of Ancestral Dao."</p><p></p><p>After this bout of boasting, Li Xuan felt quite pleased with himself.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was completely dumbfounded. Was this person really so powerful and inconceivable?</p><p></p><p>When he attained the Dao, the Great Dao had not been born and time did not exist?</p><p></p><p>Divine Demon of Chaos, Ancestor of the Great Dao, it all sounded terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"...I have watched far too many beings perish, seen far too much, so later on, I simply found a place to sleep, not looking, not managing, not asking.</p><p></p><p>"Those youngsters, too greedy, fighting back and forth, it's somewhat annoying. Now that I've woken up from my sleep and seen this world, I've come in to have a look around.</p><p></p><p>"Young one, you've experienced too little, you don't know what it means to be invincible and lonely."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, as if he had lived for too long, seen too much, and his heart had become numb. Now he was just trying to find some amusement for himself, to pass the time.</p><p></p><p>"As I said, this world is too weak, lacking some things. It's an incomplete world, with only rules and nothing else. Even this world that seems powerful to you is just so-so.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how many eons ago it was, there was once a being who, wielding a giant axe, opened up the heavens and earth, creating a vast world.</p><p></p><p>"That world was divided into three realms, had reincarnation, and was far beyond what this world can compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Alas, no matter how powerful a world is, it can't withstand too much turmoil. In the end, it became a mess and has probably disappeared into the river of time by now."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi swallowed hard, a look of shock on his face. There was actually a world before Taicang?</p><p></p><p>And it was even more powerful?</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful world had also disappeared into the river of time.</p><p></p><p>How long had this senior lived?</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi even felt his scalp tingling.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, are you saying you've known my identity all along?" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi asked cautiously.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he was starting to believe that Li Xuan really did know his identity.</p><p></p><p>"Would I lie to a youngster like you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a surprised smile.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Book of the Dao in his divine soul opened, projecting Tianzi onto its pages. Lines of information appeared:</p><p></p><p>"Spirit of the Taicang World, Beginning of Heaven and Earth, Transformed from the Opening Purple Light..."</p><p></p><p>Spirit of the Taicang World!</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan had some suspicions that Tianzi was no ordinary being and likely had deep ties to the Taicang World, he never imagined that he was actually the spirit of the Taicang World.</p><p></p><p>Now he also understood why Tianzi was trapped in this place.</p><p></p><p>The one who trapped him here was the lord of the Taicang World, Taicang!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

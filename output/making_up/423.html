        <h1>Chapter 423</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The building housing the Wanbao Alliance in the city suddenly exploded, shaking the entire city. Everyone looked up in shock to see a figure surrounded by wind and thunder, with stars suspended behind him, standing majestically like a god on the ruins of the Wanbao Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>With one punch, as if the sun had fallen from the sky, a True King Celestial Lord was instantly destroyed. </p><p></p><p>A flash of blade light swept across, cutting two True King Celestial Lords in half at the waist. It was wild, fierce, and terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!" </p><p></p><p>Those nearby fled in retreat.</p><p></p><p>"This is the criminal wanted by the Wanbao Alliance. Come quickly to capture and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>An angry roar echoed throughout the city. </p><p></p><p>It was the voice of the city lord!</p><p></p><p>"I said I didn't kill them, so I didn't kill them. You insist on pinning it on me - do you think I, Meng Chong, am easy to bully?"</p><p></p><p>Before everyone's terrified gaze, that god-like expert brutally killed the city lord with just three punches, obliterating him to ashes!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lords in the city roared angrily as they joined forces to attack that terrifying figure.</p><p></p><p>"Use joint attack techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted. So the group of True King Celestial Lords began to use joint attack techniques against Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>As warriors who had fought in the Heavenly Abyss before, they were well-versed in joint attack techniques. In an instant, they formed a joint attack, their energies connecting, shaking heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The power of heavenly and earthly laws descended, forming a powerful offensive force.</p><p></p><p>"Those who participate in capturing this villain will be heavily rewarded by our Wanbao Alliance..." </p><p></p><p>Feng Yang called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Worry about staying alive to collect the reward first. You - die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong swung his blade to attack, allowing the other attacks to land on his body while focusing solely on attacking Feng Yang.</p><p></p><p>This man was the head of the Wanbao Alliance branch, at the peak of True King Celestial Lord realm. Moreover, he wore defensive treasure armor, with much stronger defense than others.</p><p></p><p>As expected of those with deep pockets! But he had encountered Meng Chong. He couldn't escape even if he wanted to, and the others couldn't rescue him either, unable to harm Meng Chong in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! With a flash of blade light, Feng Yang was slashed to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"One more left!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned his blade to attack the leader of the treasure protection team, the strongest person present.</p><p></p><p>"Can you escape?"</p><p></p><p>Under Meng Chong's fierce barrage of blade attacks, the treasure protection team leader was also killed.</p><p></p><p>The group of True King Celestial Lords now wore expressions of shock and despair. What kind of expert was this? An Immortal Celestial Lord? </p><p></p><p>But there was clearly no aura of an Immortal Celestial Lord. Moreover, even an Immortal Celestial Lord wouldn't dare to physically withstand such powerful attacks.</p><p></p><p>Was this even human? The more they fought, the more terrified and fearful they became.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong! Invincible below Immortal Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Some True King Celestial Lords who hadn't been blinded by greed, or those too weak to enter the battlefield, hid in the distance with shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>This person's strength and martial prowess were so terrifying that he was invincible below Immortal Celestial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>No matter how many True King Celestial Lords joined forces, it seemed they were just going to their deaths!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Since you've made your move, there's no turning back. You can all die!"</p><p></p><p>A murderous light flashed in Meng Chong's eyes. Since they were already enemies, there was only one way to deal with enemies - kill them all! Although he also realized something was amiss - either they mistook him for the murderer, or someone had framed him.</p><p></p><p>But none of that mattered now. </p><p></p><p>Since they had attacked and wouldn't listen to explanations, he would kill!</p><p></p><p>As long as his strength was great enough, the Wanbao Alliance would naturally come to their senses and submit. Then they would naturally know he was innocent and that they had been used.</p><p></p><p>Without sufficient strength, without the power to make the other side bow their heads, no amount of explanation, even handing over evidence of being framed, would be of any use.</p><p></p><p>To save face and uphold the principle that they were not wrong, even if they knew they had been set up, they would still kill the framed person.</p><p></p><p>For no other reason than reputation and authority.</p><p></p><p>The only difference would be that they would also move against the one who framed him.</p><p></p><p>Only by forcing the other side to bow with overwhelming strength was explaining oneself the correct method.</p><p></p><p>Even without evidence to prove he had been framed, as long as the other side bowed, they would naturally acknowledge it, naturally investigate, and seek the truth!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a deep understanding of the behavioral principles of these major powers. Explanations without strength were futile! With sufficient strength, no explanation was needed!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, before the shocked gazes of the crowd of martial artists, a great sun appeared, surrounded by countless stars. A god-like figure stood within, encircled by wind and thunder, blade light flashing.</p><p></p><p>The group of True King Celestial Lords jointly attacking him seemed to sink into a deep swamp under the illumination of starlight, their movements slowing down.</p><p></p><p>Not one person could escape from that realm of sun and stars.</p><p></p><p>That god-like figure could be seen killing the True King Celestial Lords one by one with each slash of his blade and punch of his fist, turning them to ashes. Such a terrifying sight shocked all the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>True King Celestial Lords were top-tier martial artists, yet they were so helpless, easily killed like grasshoppers?</p><p></p><p>Was that an Immortal Celestial Lord?</p><p></p><p>But there was no aura of an Immortal Celestial Lord at all. It seemed he had cultivated some unknown, incredibly powerful martial art secret technique.</p><p></p><p>That was why he had such overwhelming power over those of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>"In my life, I thought I had experienced countless great battles and seen countless fights, but I have never seen a battle like today's!"</p><p></p><p>An elderly white-haired True King Celestial Lord muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was a True King Celestial Lord who had lived until now, near the end of his lifespan. In his long years, he had never seen a battle like today's.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The great battle ended. All the attackers had been killed!</p><p></p><p>The watching crowd of True King Celestial Lords saw that god-like figure sweep two awe-inspiring gazes over them. They shuddered in fright and unconsciously retreated, lowering their heads slightly, not daring to look him in the eye, indicating they were just onlookers.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong returned to his true form and searched for the treasure vault in the ruins of the Wanbao Alliance building.</p><p></p><p>Since entering the martial world, this was the first time he had killed on such a large scale. He felt a sense of utter satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With one slash, he cut open the underground vault. Meng Chong directly entered and began looting on a large scale.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong couldn't help but recall looting the vault in the Spirit Realm back then. He never imagined that after coming to the Divine Realm, he would finally loot a vault again.</p><p></p><p>After emptying it completely, Meng Chong rose into the air, looked around, and said in a deep voice: "Tell the Wanbao Alliance, I did not kill those people. Whether you believe it or not is up to the Wanbao Alliance to decide. If you think I, Meng Chong, am easy to bully and insist on pinning the murders on me, insist on putting a bounty on me, then try and see how sharp my blade is!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Meng Chong vanished in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't go to the Heavenly Abyss now. If he got trapped in there, it wouldn't be easy to fight his way out.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat helpless. How was this so similar to when he first arrived in the Nine Mountains Region? He had encountered assassination attempts then too.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong's brows furrowed!</p><p></p><p>"Heaven-Destroying Earth-Shadowing?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought of Tianshadiying. It was highly likely that Tianshadiying was behind this plot!</p><p></p><p>"Can't get rid of you, huh?" Meng Chong's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good!" In the great hall of the Wanbao Alliance in Baimu City, Yan Shanhe's chubby round face was filled with gloom and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>His disciple had been killed! The murderer had brazenly entered a Wanbao Alliance branch, launched a powerful attack that razed the branch to the ground, killed all those involved in the arrest, and robbed the treasury! This was unprecedented in the history of the Wanbao Alliance, and the first time someone had so blatantly challenged them!</p><p></p><p>"He's not the murderer? If he's not, then he should obediently surrender and come before me. Do you think I would wrongly accuse him? These are all excuses. How can such a villain not be eliminated?" Yan Shanhe's eyes flashed with murderous intent. This person was trampling on the prestige of the Wanbao Alliance, challenging them. He must die! Otherwise, where would the Alliance's authority be? Where would Yan Shanhe's face be?</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order: double the bounty. Whoever captures and kills this villain will be my honored guest and receive a Wanbao Token," Yan Shanhe said in a deep voice. </p><p></p><p>"Also, arrange a meeting with the major sects of Changyu Realm. Tell them Yan Shanhe requests an audience."</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to someone in the hall, an Immortal Lord of the Wanbao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"You are responsible for pursuing this villain. You must capture him and bring him back. I want to flay him alive in public, to show the martial artists of Changyu Realm that the Wanbao Alliance cannot be challenged!"</p><p></p><p>That Immortal Lord hurriedly replied, "Yes, Alliance Leader!"</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Abyss has been quiet lately, so we can spare more manpower. The top priority is to capture and kill this person. I want to see if this villain can really sweep through all the Refining Truth Realm martial artists of Changyu Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Shanhe said coldly.</p><p></p><p>From the information available, Meng Chong was extremely powerful. No True King Celestial Lord was his match. But what about a joint attack? If ten people weren't enough, what about twenty or thirty? He wanted to see if this person was truly invincible below the Immortal Lord realm! Even if he really was invincible below Immortal Lord, could he defeat an actual Immortal Lord?</p><p></p><p>Even if he was already an Immortal Lord, could he be invincible among Immortal Lords? The true strength of the Wanbao Alliance was not something outsiders could fathom!</p><p></p><p>The martial arts world of Changyu Realm was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>A Wanbao Alliance branch had been destroyed, its treasury robbed. The perpetrator was the same person who had killed Yan Ping. Even more shocking was that this person had single-handedly slain many True King Celestial Lords, displaying immense power.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this person come from? Is he from outside the realm? When has Changyu Realm ever had such a powerful expert?"</p><p></p><p>"He must be from outside. We've never heard of such a person in Changyu Realm before."</p><p></p><p>"To challenge the Wanbao Alliance like this, does he not know how powerful they are? Or perhaps he comes from a greater realm, with a deep background, and doesn't fear the Alliance's retaliation?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible. Even a prodigy from a greater realm wouldn't have reason to offend the Wanbao Alliance like this. Besides, the Alliance's composition includes forces from greater realms."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. In my opinion, he might be from a realm the Wanbao Alliance hasn't reached yet, so he doesn't know their strength."</p><p></p><p>Martial artists all over Changyu Realm, including those in the Heavenly Abyss, were discussing this fervently.</p><p></p><p>To think such a formidable person had appeared in Changyu Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanbao Alliance's bounty is really tempting. Should we form a team to hunt this person?"</p><p></p><p>"The major powers have all gotten involved. It's best for those of us without deep backgrounds to stay out of it. After all, that villain is too strong."</p><p></p><p>"What are you afraid of? If one person can't defeat him, can ten or dozens not do it?"</p><p></p><p>Changyu Realm was boiling. The powerful experts from several major forces had joined in, issuing arrest warrants.</p><p></p><p>In various cities, many martial artists were searching for traces of Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>There were even teams of True King Celestial Lords preparing to surround and kill Meng Chong to obtain the Wanbao Alliance's high bounty.</p><p></p><p>Besides the bounty, what was even more tempting was becoming Yan Shanhe's honored guest and receiving a Wanbao Token!</p><p></p><p>Even Immortal Lords were tempted.</p><p></p><p>The major powers of Changyu Realm all mobilized their intelligence networks to search for Meng Chong's whereabouts. Some Immortal Lords were ready to take action at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"This Wanbao Alliance is really rich!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong counted his gains and sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I've already gathered five or six tenths of the treasures needed to build up my foundation. But the Wanbao Alliance clearly won't let this go. I should go into the city and see what moves they're making."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong didn't care at all about offending the Wanbao Alliance. After all, they had struck first. Since that was the case, they would let strength decide.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, do you know about the Wanbao Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sent a message to Jiang Buping, seeking more specific information about the Wanbao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>As a former prodigy of a great clan, Jiang Buping naturally knew more about these major powers of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, the Wanbao Alliance is a commercial alliance formed by many powerful experts and various major forces. The Jiang family of Taikun Realm seems to be involved as well.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanbao Alliance has deep foundations, numerous powerful experts, and is spread across thirty realms..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping replied in his message.</p><p></p><p>"I see. This Wanbao Alliance can't be underestimated, but it's not a big problem."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, understanding the situation.</p><p></p><p>He had only offended the Changyu Realm branch of the Wanbao Alliance. He hadn't offended the branches in other realms yet. Even if the entire Wanbao Alliance were to hunt him down, he wouldn't fear at all.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, he would have to properly contend with the Wanbao Alliance. In the future, he wouldn't need to work hard to gather treasures; he could just rob the Wanbao Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, don't be careless. The Wanbao Alliance branches in various realms are actually of one mind, all under the leadership of the true main alliance. As for exactly how they're led, I don't know much about that either."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping warned.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. At worst, I'll put on a wig and change my identity. When I'm strong enough, I'll make the Wanbao Alliance answer for this!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Buping thought it made sense. With Second Senior Brother wearing a wig and changing his appearance, who could hunt him down? Besides, with Master around, there was no need to worry even if the Wanbao Alliance had some old monster.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put away the communication talisman and strode boldly towards a city. He wanted to see how the Wanbao Alliance would deal with him. As for being framed, whether people believed him or not depended entirely on strength.</p><p></p><p>In a secret room somewhere in Baimu City.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of Meng Chong has been arranged. The Wanbao Alliance is hunting him down. No matter how he explains, it's useless. Even if Yan Shanhe knows he's not the real murderer and was framed, he won't spare him.</p><p></p><p>"He's really a fierce person, directly destroying a Wanbao Alliance branch. This way, regardless of the truth, Yan Shanhe will definitely kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"The Clan Leader's methods are truly brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>"What about Xu Yan? Have we found any traces?"</p><p></p><p>"Clan Leader, we haven't discovered anything yet, but we're still searching. As soon as he appears in Changyu Realm, we'll know immediately."</p><p></p><p>"Good. Once Xu Yan's whereabouts are discovered, report to Lord Bayetiansa immediately. He wants to take action personally."</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong had already entered the city and was boldly walking towards the Wanbao Alliance branch in this city.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

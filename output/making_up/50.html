        <h1>Chapter 50</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 50 East River Prefecture is Boiling (Seeking Continuous Reading)</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's qi and blood were surging, as he executed the Descending Dragon Palm technique. It became more and more at his command, with the strength and subtlety of the palm force becoming increasingly refined.</p><p></p><p>After the dragon-shaped palm force was unleashed, the attacks of the giant dragon also appeared more agile.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the unparalleled might and ferocity, there was also a touch of softness and flexibility.</p><p></p><p>From this battle, Xu Yan gained deeper insights into the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>He felt that it wouldn't be long before he could comprehend the technique to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The scarlet-red giant dragon swept across the area, and Xu Yan advanced step by step.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>After the last row of Divine Might soldiers was blasted away, Xu Yan arrived before Jiang Pingshan.</p><p></p><p>Surrounded by a halo of qi, a scarlet-red giant dragon coiled around him, like a divine being commanding the dragon.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan's body trembled, and the war horse beneath him retreated and shivered, ready to collapse to the ground at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the young man before him, he couldn't help but be lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Could it be true that such powerful martial arts, as described in legends, truly existed in this world?</p><p></p><p>Recalling one of the reasons for his daughter's canceled engagement, Xu Yan's mind suddenly became clear.</p><p></p><p>The one lacking in wit was actually himself!</p><p></p><p>This awe-inspiring young man should have been his son-in-law, but now he had become an unattainable object.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with bitterness.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Might army is nothing special. I haven't even exerted my full strength yet," Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan looked at the fallen soldiers. Aside from the ones at the forefront who were severely injured or even dead, the rest of the soldiers' injuries were not too serious. They had merely lost their combat ability for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had held back.</p><p></p><p>Facing the encirclement of an entire army, he could still preserve his strength and show mercy. How powerful must his abilities be to accomplish this?</p><p></p><p>"You have won. The Xu family has won," Jiang Pingshan sighed and said with a complex expression.</p><p></p><p>"My father said to go see him," Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan was startled, as if he understood something, and nodded, "I will visit the Xu residence after I've dealt with the battlefield!"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a large group of people poured out of the prefecture city. They were holding weapons, their eyes gleaming with excitement, and they were shouting, "Capture Jiang Pingshan, capture the Divine Might army! Goddess Tian Mother bless us, Goddess Tian Mother bless us!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Tian Mother Sect members swarming in, Jiang Pingshan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>These Tian Mother Sect members had hidden themselves so deeply, and even after the great army's suppression, they still had such a formidable force remaining.</p><p></p><p>"Kou Ruozhi!" Jiang Pingshan's expression turned stern. This failed scholar had remarkable methods.</p><p></p><p>"Get out!" Xu Yan roared, his qi and blood surging. Two scarlet-red giant dragons swept out, blasting the Tian Mother Sect members away.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Might army I defeated cannot be taken advantage of by them. If they dare to come forward again, don't blame me for being merciless!"</p><p></p><p>He remembered his father's instructions, not to let the Tian Mother Sect seize the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Mother Sect members were frightened and dared not charge forward.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan heaved a sigh of relief. Raising his long spear, a troop of soldiers from the East River Great General's Mansion rushed out of the prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city, the dust was swirling, and another large army was approaching.</p><p></p><p>The East River Prefecture's army, the troops under Jiang Pingshan's control.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Might army was only temporarily assigned to him for command.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that the situation had been resolved, Xu Yan leaped up, moving with extreme speed and stealth, and in the blink of an eye, he disappeared from the battlefield, soon appearing before Xu Junhe and his wife.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, are you not injured?" Xu's wife anxiously grabbed his hand, checking him over.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, I'm fine. It's just a bunch of weaklings, they can't hurt me," Xu Yan said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back," Xu Junhe said, heaving a sigh of relief as the dust settled.</p><p></p><p>The influential figures of East River Prefecture...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The people with influential backgrounds came up one after another, trying to establish a relationship.</p><p></p><p>Even the common folk surged up excitedly, wanting to get a close look at the invincible son of the richest family.</p><p></p><p>"Get out of the way!" Xu Yan roared, his powerful aura shaking the air.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, no one dared to approach him.</p><p></p><p>However, voices could be heard from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, where did you find the master?"</p><p>"Young Master Xu, where is the master?"</p><p></p><p>It was well known that the son of the richest family had been seeking out masters. </p><p>Now with his formidable abilities, he must have found a master.</p><p>Where was this mysterious master? </p><p>Was he still accepting disciples?</p><p></p><p>The influential figures in the Donghe Prefecture were all excited, their eyes shining.</p><p>Yes, seek out the master!</p><p>It would be more direct to become the master's disciple than to try to establish a relationship with the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>The high-level practitioners of the Tianmu Sect were also excited, mobilizing their disciples to search for the master's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"The son of the richest family can become a disciple and learn powerful martial arts? My son is clever and capable, he can definitely become a disciple as well, and his martial arts will surely surpass Xu Yan's!"</p><p>"My daughter is intelligent and beautiful, skilled with her hands. She must be able to become a disciple as well! We must find the master!"</p><p></p><p>The influential figures in the prefecture all believed that if the "foolish son" of the Xu family could become a disciple and learn powerful martial arts, their own children, who were smarter and more capable, would definitely be able to do the same, and their martial arts would be even stronger than Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the entire prefecture was in an uproar. No one cared about the unrest in Donghe Prefecture or the Tianmu Sect's rebellion anymore - their minds were solely focused on how to seek out the master and become his disciples.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County, the elderly Mayi and the county magistrate finally came out of the courtyard, heaving a sigh of relief. They had talked until their mouths were dry the entire night. At least they had managed to save their lives.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the courtyard, they hurried back to the county government office to discuss their escape plan. It had been truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Li Xuan sat in a chair, leisurely listening as Mayi and the others had introduced the affairs of the Tianmu Sect, Qi State, and Wu State the entire night. </p><p>He now had a clearer understanding of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>What surprised him was that the Tianmu Sect truly had a Heavenly Mother. The current Heavenly Mother was a young girl, around sixteen or seventeen years old.</p><p>The Tianmu Sect's experts had praised her as the most beautiful woman in the world, and she had a compassionate heart, unable to bear seeing people suffer.</p><p>It was said that the Heavenly Mother could make evildoers stop their wrongdoing, and anyone she had persuaded never committed evil again. It was truly remarkable.</p><p>Moreover, despite her young age, the Heavenly Mother's medical skills were extraordinary, and she had saved countless commoners.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found himself quite interested in this young girl.</p><p>"I wonder if she would be suitable to be my disciple?"</p><p>The ability to persuade evildoers to reform was truly impressive. And her other talents were no small feat either - young, skilled in medicine, and possessing formidable martial arts.</p><p>She was a true prodigy.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the current Heavenly Mother is not in Qi State, but has gone to Wu State," Li Xuan sighed. He would have the opportunity to meet her in the future and see if she was suitable to be his disciple.</p><p></p><p>As for the Tianmu Sect, Li Xuan viewed it quite calmly.</p><p></p><p>The sky was already bright.</p><p>"I wonder how my disciple's family is doing now?"</p><p>Li Xuan pondered whether he should go to the prefecture.</p><p>"With Qi State's military power, Xu Yan should be able to handle the situation. It shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden light in his mind emerged...</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

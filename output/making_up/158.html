        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was not far from mastering the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the consumption of medicinal pills was also not small.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was almost daily refining pills, especially needing to refine qi and blood pills to supply to the Changqing Pavilion and for the use of the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>Her cultivation time was reduced as a result.</p><p></p><p>After half a month, Su Lingxiu also broke through to the great perfection of the qi and blood realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the great perfection of the qi and blood realm, you have achieved the complete mastery of the pill dao and martial dao (Xiantian realm)."</p><p></p><p>Golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Su Lingxiu, he was pondering a problem.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate martial cultivators in the borderlands and rapidly improve their borderland martial dao strength, medicinal pills are indispensable, and the required quantity of these pills is a considerable number.</p><p></p><p>Spirit herbs are secondary, after all, ordinary qi and blood pills do not require many spirit herbs to refine a large batch, or even a little, with spirit herbs as the main ingredient and precious herbs as auxiliary ingredients.</p><p></p><p>But relying on Su Lingxiu alone, how can she refine so many medicinal pills?</p><p></p><p>Even though she has reached the pinnacle in refining qi and blood pills, one furnace can refine dozens of pills, but with just her alone, she cannot sustain such a huge quantity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Lingxiu still needs to spend time cultivating the martial dao, studying the pill dao martial classics, refining higher-grade medicinal pills, and researching pill refining techniques, etc.</p><p></p><p>The borderlands are ultimately just a temporary dwelling place, entering the inner domain is inevitable, and the Changqing Pavilion will also enter the inner domain for development, focusing on the sale of medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that when the medicinal pills are released, the inner domain martial cultivators will surely flock to them.</p><p></p><p>What will follow are the coveting from all sides, as well as various threats, and whether the Tianbaoge can sit tight is an unknown.</p><p></p><p>As for cooperating with the Tianbaoge, it depends on what price the Tianbaoge can offer.</p><p></p><p>Of course, no matter how they cooperate, the initiative will be in the hands of the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>To have a large supply of medicinal pills, relying on Su Lingxiu alone, even if she works herself to death, she cannot supply enough.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of the assembly line production method, could medicinal pills also be done this way? The refining of medicinal pills is also divided into several steps, the complete pill refining technique is not easy to learn, but a single step is much easier.</p><p></p><p>In the final step, fusing and refining the extracted essence of spirit herbs, the medicinal pill is then produced.</p><p></p><p>And in this way, even if someone steals all the pill refining steps, it is still difficult to learn the pill refining technique, not to mention that the refining methods of each medicinal pill are different.</p><p></p><p>Those who are not pill dao martial cultivators cannot master the refining methods of various medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>The sale of medicinal pills in the inner domain, the most common are only three types.</p><p></p><p>Qi and blood pills, needed by the majority of martial cultivators, even if there are differences in the inner domain martial dao, the efficacy of qi and blood pills can still assist them in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Qi-nurturing pills, corresponding to master-level martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>And healing-type medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion only needs to produce these three types of medicinal pills, and it will be enough to obtain abundant resources in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>They can also accept commissions, such as exchanging a certain amount of spirit herbs for the refining of a medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>As long as the Changqing Pavilion is established in the inner domain, and the medicinal pills are promoted, once the martial cultivators have tasted the benefits, who would be afraid of not having spirit herbs?</p><p></p><p>Of course, in the beginning, the steps cannot be too big, otherwise the sudden and fierce impact will be very violent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan went to the inner domain to enjoy, not to constantly solve various troubles.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, only when the borderland martial dao becomes strong and forms a huge force, can they vigorously promote the medicinal pills, even if they face coveting and impact, they will have the strength to resolve it without Li Xuan's intervention.</p><p></p><p>Having thought this through, Li Xuan called Su Lingxiu over and pointed out the assembly line pill refining method to her, letting Su Lingxiu perfect it herself.</p><p></p><p>"This method of the master is good, I know how to do it now."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed to hear this.</p><p></p><p>Next, she began to ponder how to implement the assembly line pill refining, first separating the pill refining steps, the refining method of each step, how to preserve the semi-finished products, and how to proceed to the next step, etc.</p><p></p><p>This is a complex process, and it also requires pill furnaces, which means finding people to forge them.</p><p></p><p>But before that, they need suitable pill refining martial cultivators to learn the separated pill refining steps, and the assembly line pill refining cannot be put on the agenda in the short term.</p><p></p><p>For now, the required medicinal pills are not many, and Su Lingxiu has recently taken some time to refine a batch, which is enough to sustain the needs for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>She is pondering the assembly line pill refining while also comprehending the Eight Trigrams and the various martial dao techniques in the pill dao martial classics.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, Xu Yan had visited several forces and obtained the bounties.</p><p></p><p>As for the bounties from the three major countries, he only went to the Great Yue Country, perhaps it was because of his reputation as a prodigy, or the powerful deterrence of killing a great master, or perhaps the Great Yue Country did not care about that little bounty.</p><p></p><p>They gave it very generously, Xu Yan was very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>As for the other two countries, the journey was too far, so he could only temporarily shelve it, and when he has the opportunity in the future, he will go and collect the bounties.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Seven Star City, he met Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan again, and returned the Flying Swallow Token to Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, you have already made a name for yourself in the martial dao world, even the Skeleton of Slaughter died at your hands!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was only at the great perfection of the Xiantian realm, which corresponds to the great perfection of the Zongshi realm, yet he had already killed a great master.</p><p></p><p>This is truly the might of true martial dao!</p><p></p><p>"The great master was also very strong, the Skeleton of Slaughter was the strongest among the great masters I killed, I had to strike several blows to kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng: ...</p><p></p><p>Several blows to kill a renowned and powerful great master, and this is called the other party being very strong?</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to take over Canglan Island, that will be my territory from then on. After taking over Canglan Island, I need to purchase spirit herbs and then return to the Northern Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, are you going to stay in the Seven Star Academy to study the martial dao classics?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mentioned his upcoming plans.</p><p></p><p>"I have refined a true qi, but I don't have much insight into how to cultivate next, I want to ask the elders for guidance, why don't I accompany you on your journey?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>He came down the Sword尊Cliff this time to find Xu Yan, for the sake of his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan is returning to the borderlands, it's a good opportunity to go with him and directly seek guidance from the elders.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, it's good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Oh yes, Brother Xu, this is a generous gift from Miss Du."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had Hu Shan bring out a large box.</p><p></p><p>This was the generous gift that Du Yuying had sent to him at the Sword尊Cliff, and he had someone bring it from the Sword尊Cliff to hand it over to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, this is the gift that I had Miss Du send to you under my name, you should keep it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du sent it to you, it's not appropriate for me to keep it. Moreover, I let you use my name Xie Lingfeng, and raised your reputation, Brother Xu, you don't need to be polite, you should keep this gift, after all, it's Miss Du's heartfelt gift."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng smiled and opened the box.</p><p></p><p>Inside were some spirit herbs, a precious sword, and some other...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The treasures were quite valuable, which could be considered a generous gift.</p><p></p><p>"These two boxes contain the specialty products from the residence of the Duke of Du, the Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea. It is said that the production is scarce, the tea aroma is rich, and the tea leaves are like clouds. When brewed in the teapot, it's as if a pot of cloudy mist has been steeped."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng picked up one of the jade jars in the box to introduce it.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of three jade jars in the box, all containing Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea can only be considered a low-grade spiritual herb, but it is quite famous, all because of its cloudy mist name, and the pure fragrance is quite favored by some great master martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng placed the tea jar back in the box.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up as he said, "Good, I'll take it!"</p><p></p><p>The Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea, the master should like it, right? In the remote border regions, the master has been drinking coarse tea. Although the master's cultivation is too high, returning to simplicity and following the Dao naturally, he doesn't care about the tea. But as a disciple, I can't just let the master keep drinking coarse tea, right? Since there is spiritual tea, I must bring it back to pay respects to the master!</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, carry the box, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said happily.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, young master."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan quickly picked up the box, tying it to his back with a rope.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan puzzledly asked, "Brother Xie, don't you have a storage bag?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng wryly smiled, "Brother Xu, you don't know, storage bags are too expensive, and they can't be simply bought with spirit stones. Although my status at the Sword Sovereign Cliff is not bad, I still can't afford a storage bag!"</p><p></p><p>There was another reason he didn't mention.</p><p></p><p>Master martial artists, if they carry a storage bag, are prone to being robbed!</p><p></p><p>Even though he is a genius at the Sword Sovereign Cliff, and his father is Xie Tiangheng, he is still not immune to being robbed, the only difference is that they won't take his life.</p><p></p><p>Many great masters can't afford storage bags, and they are all envious. Once they discover a master martial artist has a storage bag, they will naturally want to rob it!</p><p></p><p>After all, not everyone has Xu Yan's strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned, the storage bag is even more precious than he had imagined, even someone like Xie Lingfeng can't afford it.</p><p></p><p>As they walked out, he asked, "What kind of person can have a storage bag?"</p><p></p><p>Master martial artists have killed many, including some great masters.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Killing Skeleton Bone, who is also a notorious great master, but he doesn't even have a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Usually, only peak great masters have them, but not all peak great masters have them," Xie Lingfeng thought for a moment and replied.</p><p></p><p>"Peak great masters, huh." Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Not easy to kill! With his current strength, killing a great master at the peak would not be a problem. But peak great masters are a bit difficult, after all, their strength is truly at the peak, far beyond those great masters below the peak.</p><p></p><p>In the entire inner domain, there are not many peak great masters. Any force that has a peak great master as its pillar is considered a top-tier force.</p><p></p><p>Just as they came out of the side courtyard, they saw Du Yuying hurriedly running towards them, with Cui'er following behind her.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was not wearing a veil, her beautiful countenance radiant, her delicate white cheeks flushed with a light blush, making her even more enchantingly beautiful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan remained calm. "Miss Du!"</p><p></p><p>He nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, are you going to Canglan Island?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying softly asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not hide it. Suddenly, he thought of something and said, "Thank you for the generous gift."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying saw the box Hu Shan was carrying, her eyes filled with laughter, the joy barely concealed. "I'm glad Young Master Xu likes it!"</p><p></p><p>She turned and reached out her hand, "Cui'er!"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er took out a bag and placed it in Du Yuying's hand. "Miss, here you go."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying held the bag in one hand, and with the other, she grasped Xu Yan's hand, placing the bag in his palm. "Young Master Xu, this contains 200,000 spirit stones. Although it's not much, it's Yuying's gratitude to you."</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, her delicate white hand subtly caressed the back of Xu Yan's hand, her jade-like face flushing even redder.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot accept unearned rewards. Miss Du, you should keep it," Xu Yan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>Although he was poor and lacked spirit stones, he was a man of principles.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, you killed the Killing Skeleton Bone, this is part of the bounty. He had been pestering our Du Mansion for some time, and Young Master Xu killing him has solved a major problem for our Du Mansion.</p><p></p><p>"These spirit stones, how could they repay Young Master Xu's kindness? This is all Yuying has for now, and I hope Young Master Xu will not refuse it!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had already prepared her words.</p><p></p><p>She held Xu Yan's hand tightly, her ten fingers intertwined with his, her voice soft as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then I'll accept it!" </p><p></p><p>It turned out to be the bounty for the Killing Skeleton Bone, Xu Yan was delighted and withdrew his hand, taking the spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>Miss Du is a good person, someone who knows how to repay. She might have been too excited, holding his hand without realizing it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands and said, "Miss Du, until we meet again!"</p><p></p><p>It was time to take his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, Yuying's gratitude to you is as deep as a mountain. If Yuying ever manages to obtain a storage bag to repay you, where should I seek you out?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying hurriedly asked.</p><p></p><p>"A storage bag?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, revealing his delight. "Miss Du, you are too kind. Storage bags are quite valuable..."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how precious the storage bag is, it cannot compare to Young Master Xu's kindness."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, you can try to find me on Canglan Island, or you can ask Brother Xie, he will convey the message for you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that Du Yuying was a girl who valued relationships and repaying kindness, and he immediately responded.</p><p></p><p>"Yuying will remember that!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan strode away, his figure swiftly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gave Du Yuying a strange look, shaking his head without saying anything, hurriedly following after Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du is truly a person who knows how to repay kindness, not in vain that I escorted her before."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's mouth twitched, was this knowing how to repay kindness? This was more like she had her eyes on you!</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du's talent is also not bad, it's just that her body seems to have some problems, but I don't know the reason. She has already reached the First Realm, the realm of the Martial Saint is not far away."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to praise, his good impression of Du Yuying greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was merely a simple good impression.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded, "Miss Du is a disciple of the Grand Tutor of the Seven Star Academy, her talent is indeed remarkable, and it may be related to her special physique."</p><p></p><p>That Du Yuying was a disciple of a Grand Tutor from the Seven Star Academy showed her extraordinary talent.</p><p></p><p>The three had just left the Seven Star City and were about to head to Canglan Island when a graceful figure fluttered over, dressed in snow-white robes. Even without seeing her face, she gave an enchanting, peerless aura.</p><p></p><p>The Unparalleled Pavilion, the lady in white!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

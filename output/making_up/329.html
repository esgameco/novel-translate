        <h1>Chapter 329</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The azure-colored flying boat shot through the hazy, cloudy sky without any hesitation, preparing to directly cross the Wuzhou and enter the Emerald Sea.</p><p></p><p>"This journey to the Emerald Sea, and then back to the Eighteen Realms, even if I don't attain the Divine Passage, I will at least reach the Perfected Spiritual Origin realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, if this trip is successful and he obtains the divine treasure from the Emerald Sea, the foundation he has accumulated before breaking through the Divine Passage will be sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Genius Confrontation Battle begins, reaching the Perfected Spiritual Origin is a certainty. I hope I can accumulate enough foundation, so that after the Genius Confrontation, I can immediately break through to the Divine Passage realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, once he enters the Divine Passage realm, not only the geniuses in the Spiritual Realm, but the entire Spiritual Realm, except for his master, would have no one who could match him. He could easily push aside the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"If I can accumulate enough foundation, and there's not much time left before the Genius Confrontation, then I'll break through after the Confrontation, a few more days won't make a difference."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether he can accumulate enough foundation before the Genius Confrontation Battle arrives is still unknown. Even if he successfully obtains the divine treasure from the Emerald Sea, the accumulation of foundation still requires time to settle.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Ice State, among the Eighteen Realms of the Spiritual Realm, is the one with the least human presence.</p><p></p><p>Covered in ice and snow, never melting for years, as far as the eye can see is a vast expanse of white, not even a trace of verdant plants and trees.</p><p></p><p>The occasional plants visible are mostly white, emanating a faint chill.</p><p></p><p>The Ice State is the place where the most potent icy and cold spiritual herbs are produced. If one were to encounter a non-white plant in the Ice State, it would undoubtedly be a divine-grade spiritual herb.</p><p></p><p>The Ice State has a spiritual sect, though not among the Transcendent Spiritual Sects, it is still one of the top-tier sects, rumored to have cultivated an extremely powerful expert who has grasped the Spiritual Mechanism of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The Quiet Snow Palace, located deep within the Ice State, in the Quiet Snow Mountain Range, is the ruling spiritual sect of the Ice State.</p><p></p><p>The Quiet Snow Palace is one of the rare all-female spiritual sects in the Spiritual Realm, with not a single male warrior.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, it is said that the women of the Quiet Snow Palace are all of unparalleled beauty, with icy skin and jade-like physiques, like enchanting flowers blooming amidst the ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>The bitter cold of the Ice State is such that even small Celestial Immortal realm cultivators are unwilling to reside there for long, which is why there are few cities or populated areas in the vast Ice State.</p><p></p><p>The disciples of the Quiet Snow Palace are said to be mostly selected from the other states, cultivating icy and cold techniques, which allows them to not fear the severe cold, and even thrive in such an environment.</p><p></p><p>The beauties of the Quiet Snow Palace have gained some fame in the Spiritual Realm, with rumors that spiritual sect geniuses have gone there to seek a bride, and occasionally one would gain the favor of a beauty.</p><p></p><p>There were once rumors of the peerless beauties of the Quiet Snow Palace, whose icy and alluring charm was most captivating even in the scorching heat, and that cultivators of fire-attributed techniques who married a Quiet Snow Palace beauty could experience the wondrous fusion of ice and fire.</p><p></p><p>However, after these rumors spread, the Quiet Snow Palace became greatly displeased, and since then, it has been rare for spiritual sect geniuses to be able to marry a Quiet Snow Palace beauty.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when the calamity of the Blood Demon swept through, the Ice State was not spared, experiencing a period of turmoil, with Blood Sect disciples coveting the beauties of the Quiet Snow Palace, leading to a series of major battles.</p><p></p><p>After the Blood Sect was annihilated and the Blood Demon retreated into the Inner Realm, the Ice State gradually faded from attention, and tales of the Quiet Snow Palace beauties have become scarce in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Quiet Snow Palace has become like a forgotten place, as if it has entered a state of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, within the Quiet Snow Palace, most of the previous buildings have already disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Only one ice and snow palace remains, and around this palace, throughout the entire Quiet Snow Palace, are lush and vibrant divine-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Deep within the ice and snow palace, there is a black, vortex-like cave, which appears to be on the ground, but gives a sense of being a rift in the heavens and earth, rather than an earthly cave.</p><p></p><p>There is a mysterious aura emanating from this cave, and it seems to be gradually expanding, with a warm and moist feeling within.</p><p></p><p>Outside the ice and snow palace, a man in thin clothing, shivering in the cold wind, is swallowing a divine-grade spiritual herb.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual herb is blood-red, possessing the divine effect of greatly replenishing one's spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>"This is the ninth one, I've recovered again, I should be able to hold on now."</p><p></p><p>The man is exceptionally handsome and graceful, but in the depths of his eyes, there is a hint of regret and fear.</p><p></p><p>He looks up at the Quiet Snow Palace, and in the sparse buildings, he can vaguely see the graceful figures of beauties, each with their own unique charm - some with imposing bearing, some delicate and pure, some gentle, some shy...</p><p></p><p>He has slept with all of them.</p><p></p><p>For over ten years.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he accidentally learned of a certain rumor and received a message that led him to the Quiet Snow Palace, he has never had a moment's peace, needing to heavily replenish himself every so often.</p><p></p><p>At first, he was greatly excited, wandering amidst the flowers and savoring the different beauties.</p><p></p><p>But later, it turned to terror.</p><p></p><p>And now, even a sense of numbness has set in.</p><p></p><p>Because all the beauties in the Quiet Snow Palace are the same person!</p><p></p><p>Their spiritual souls all belong to the same person! He even suspects that their physical bodies may also be the same person.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just a suspicion, the possibility is not very high, but the fact that their spiritual souls belong to the same person is 100% certain.</p><p></p><p>These beauties may have once been the disciples, elders, and others of the Quiet Snow Palace, but their spiritual souls have long been devoured, their physical bodies now inhabited by this single spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>What terrifies him even more is that this spiritual soul is extremely unique, vastly different from the spiritual souls cultivated by the warriors of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>These beauties, not only do they have different appearances, but even their personalities and temperaments vary greatly, and he has to deal with a different type of beauty every day, exhausting all his skills and sweet-talking to barely manage.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to catch his breath and find an opportunity to escape, the mastermind behind it all appeared.</p><p></p><p>Three years ago! Three years ago, he saw the breathtakingly beautiful, alluring, and soul-devouring mastermind.</p><p></p><p>Since then, he has been trapped in endless torment.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand to touch his cheek, even after consuming the divine-grade spiritual herb, he still cannot fully recover, his cheeks slightly sunken.</p><p></p><p>"If this continues, I'll be drained to death!"</p><p></p><p>The man muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although the experience is extremely pleasurable, and dying in such bliss could be considered the most wonderful way to go, he does not want to die!</p><p></p><p>The image of the gentle and jade-like woman flashes in his mind, the one he found most unforgettable among all the women he has encountered.</p><p></p><p>"When I left, you seemed to be pregnant, I wanted to stay with you until the child was born, and take you back home...but this unexpected incident occurred, and I had to return earlier.</p><p></p><p>"This one departure has trapped me here, perhaps you think I deceived you? But I truly did not lie to you, although I have had many lovers, you are still the one I love the most!"</p><p></p><p>The man murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a bewitchingly charming and seductive call came from the ice and snow palace, "Mu Mu, I want you, come quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Damn it! The man cursed inwardly, though it's not really a curse, as he knows he'll have to respond soon.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's time to take action.</p><p></p><p>"Here comes, my most beloved darling!"</p><p></p><p>The man's face was filled with doting, his eyes full of excitement as he turned and walked into the ice palace.</p><p></p><p>In the ice palace, amidst the ice and snow, on a pink couch, a person was reclining, completely nude, their skin seeming to merge with the ice and snow.</p><p></p><p>Even their hair was snow-white, their entire body shimmering with a snowy white luster. Seeing the man enter, they raised a beautiful leg, fully displaying their alluring charm.</p><p></p><p>Stunningly beautiful, enough to captivate countless men.</p><p></p><p>The first time the man saw this, he was also captivated. However, now, he felt a sense of fear within, though he dared not reveal it.</p><p></p><p>This woman seemed to not be human! Of course, she was also not a sea goddess, for he already had a sea goddess beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Mumu, you've finally returned handsome as ever."</p><p></p><p>"In this world, there is no one more handsome than me, Mu Qianliu. I'm willing to sacrifice my soul and body for you!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't say such things, how could I bear for you to sacrifice your soul and body? The most precious thing in this world is you, Mumu."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, my darling, you are still so icy and alluring..."</p><p></p><p>This man was the long-missing playboy of the Mu family, Mu Qianliu!</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>"Wuwu, Mumu, you're withered, what do I do? I drained you too harshly this time!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianliu was now emaciated, looking completely hollowed out, his face sunken, no longer the handsome and dashing man he once was.</p><p></p><p>His eyes were lifeless, a trace of fear still lingering in the depths.</p><p></p><p>His body trembled slightly as he stammered, "It's fine, I'm excited, I'm so happy, I'm willing to die."</p><p></p><p>"Mumu, I won't let you die. If you die, what will I do? How will I find happiness?"</p><p></p><p>The woman said, stuffing divine spiritual herbs into Mu Qianliu's mouth one after another.</p><p></p><p>After eating several divine spiritual herbs, Mu Qianriu finally regained a bit of vitality, but he still looked emaciated and hollowed out.</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, I've damaged your foundation. You've eaten too many divine spiritual herbs, so the effect is no longer obvious now."</p><p></p><p>The woman frowned.</p><p></p><p>Struggling, Mu Qianriu stood up and put on a thick spiritual robe, his body and legs trembling, but his gaze was resolute as he said, "It's a small matter. I'll go gather some divine spiritual herbs, find a friend to concoct a nourishing medicine, and I'll be able to recover in ten days to half a month."</p><p></p><p>"Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, it's just too cold. My darling, I'm afraid I'll freeze to death if I go out!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu said while hugging himself.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, that's a small problem."</p><p></p><p>The woman raised her hand, and from the deep black vortex in the ice palace, a reddish-brown stone flew out, warm to the touch like a heated iron block.</p><p></p><p>"Carry this with you, and you won't feel cold anymore."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu took the stone and tucked it into his chest, excitedly stepping forward to embrace the woman, reluctantly saying in the end, "My darling, wait for me. When I return, we'll battle for three days and three nights!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, three days and three nights, how tantalizing."</p><p></p><p>The woman nodded, her flushed face filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month, at most half a month, and I'll be back."</p><p></p><p>"Mumu, I'll wait for you!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu walked out of the palace, continuously plucking divine spiritual herbs and putting them in his mouth as he left the Icy Snow Mountain range. </p><p></p><p>After leaving the mountain range where the Icy Snow Palace was located, Mu Qianriu looked back, the fear in his eyes no longer fully concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Something is not right here, a crisis, a crisis in the spiritual realm, is it about to erupt here?"</p><p></p><p>His gaze resolute, he stepped away, slowly at first, then suddenly taking to the skies, fleeing towards the outside of the Ice State.</p><p></p><p>"My foundation is nearly depleted, this time I won't be able to recover. I never thought Mu Qianriu would meet this end!"</p><p></p><p>Completely drained, he thought.</p><p></p><p>"Half a month, only half a month. If I exceed half a month, she will come looking for me!"</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>To escape this time, for the past three years, every time he was about to be drained dry, he would make an excuse to leave the Icy Snow Palace to recover, always returning within half a month.</p><p></p><p>Time and time again, he kept his word, finally causing the other party to relax their vigilance, granting him this opportunity to flee.</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he was nearly drained dry, he would use secret techniques to restore himself. </p><p></p><p>But overusing those techniques had severely damaged his foundation.</p><p></p><p>This time, recovery would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>Certain death!</p><p></p><p>"She shouldn't be able to leave the Ice State, as long as I get out of the Ice State, I'll be able to completely escape her. Her spiritual power and consciousness are mostly focused on that cave.</p><p></p><p>"That's why she didn't notice my foundation was almost completely depleted and I could no longer recover.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, I would never have been able to leave successfully.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is that cave? What happened in the Icy Snow Palace back then?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu pondered, his speed increasing, frantically fleeing outside of the Ice State.</p><p></p><p>He had to leave the Ice State within half a month.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the Ice State, he had already refined the spiritual energies of heaven and earth, not just a single thread, but almost grasping the essence of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, he would be considered a top expert in the spiritual realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he had no resistance at all.</p><p></p><p>That woman was terrifyingly powerful, Mu Qianriu even suspected she might not even have a physical body!</p><p></p><p>"I won't live, let me go see her one last time before leaving the Ice State."</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the Icy Snow Palace were too mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Frantically fleeing, he even resorted to using some secret techniques at the end, the speed boost allowing him to escape the Ice State before the half-month period was up.</p><p></p><p>Mu Qianriu did not stop, not even daring to return to the Mu family, afraid of bringing disaster back with him.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at a large city, he found a base and left a message to be delivered to a certain someone.</p><p></p><p>After doing all this, Mu Qianriu headed straight for the Jade State.</p><p></p><p>Back in the Icy Snow Palace in the Ice State, a graceful figure suddenly appeared above the palace, her gaze gradually turning icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"You lied to me! You dared to lie to me, I'll grind your bones to dust, I'll grind your bones to dust. I treated you so well, and you dared to lie to me.</p><p></p><p>"You can't escape, I will find you. I hate it the most when people deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the ice palace dissolved, and the women in the Icy Snow Palace all rapidly fled in all directions, searching for Mu Qianriu.</p><p></p><p>But of course, they found nothing!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it! You will die for this! You dared to lie to me, you played with me and then abandoned me. I'll skin you alive!"</p><p></p><p>The woman screamed madly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The original black cave now emitted warm air, a reddish glow surging out from the black cave, causing the surrounding ice and snow to begin melting.</p><p></p><p>The warm air continued to spread, extending towards the entire Ice State, and the black cave was also slowly expanding.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

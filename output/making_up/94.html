            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 94 - The Inner Realm and Spirit Crystals, Xu Yan Comprehends Again</p><p></p><p>Outside Yunshan County, Xu Yan, Xie Lingfeng, Meng Chong, and Hu Shan were sparring, while Li Xuan was sitting in a chair, watching the cultivation methods written by Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts of the Inner Realm are also powerful, the Sect Master martial artists cannot be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cultivation methods, Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, both Xue Wuxin and Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were very weak.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Xu Yan, they were far inferior.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan had a Jade Bone foundation, and after breaking through to the Primordial realm, he had transformed into a Dragon Soaring Mountain and River Spiritual Bone, and had also comprehended the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>He had also grasped the true meaning of the Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>His strength was naturally incomparable to Xie Lingfeng, a Sect Master of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>But if one thinks that the martial arts of the Inner Realm are weak, that would be one-sided.</p><p></p><p>Of course, at the moment, there is no doubt that the martial arts he has created, the martial arts system he has established, is stronger than the martial arts of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>But he cannot conclude that the martial arts of the Inner Realm are weak and have nothing to learn from.</p><p></p><p>"Someone like Shi Er, with a Bronze Bone foundation, may not necessarily be able to defeat Xie Lingfeng after breaking through to the Primordial realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently evaluated.</p><p></p><p>With the cultivation methods as a reference, and knowing Xie Lingfeng's specific strength, he could easily assess the gap.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng's talent is indeed very high, among the younger generation in the Inner Realm, he is one of the top ones. Shi Er is no match for him, which is not surprising, but he will not lose to that Hu Shan, and may even surpass him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan estimated the gap between the two.</p><p></p><p>Overall, the martial arts he has created are stronger and have more potential, especially in the foundation of martial arts, which is far superior to the martial arts of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>It also sounds more mysterious.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xie Lingfeng would think that the martial arts he cultivates are false.</p><p></p><p>"After this comparison, my martial arts completely surpass them. I wonder if the Sect Masters of the Inner Realm are truly the peak?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the cultivation methods in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Masters are already the peak.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it is not ruled out that Xie Lingfeng and the others have not yet accessed the secrets above the Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that the Sect Masters are not the peak, and Xie Lingfeng and the others have not yet accessed the secrets above the Sect Masters."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took out an ancient leather book.</p><p></p><p>This ancient leather book, although he could not understand it, Li Xuan was certain that it was not ordinary, and the level it involved should be very high.</p><p></p><p>With his current cultivation, he was still unable to see through it.</p><p></p><p>Every time he looked at the ancient leather book, he seemed to have different feelings, and the patterns he saw seemed to change.</p><p></p><p>He could only conclude that his cultivation level was still too low, and he could not see through the secrets within.</p><p></p><p>"The ancient leather book came from the imperial palace treasury of the Wu Kingdom, it is a relic left behind, which shows that the remote border regions also once had powerful experts."</p><p></p><p>The reason why the border regions cannot cultivate is that the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth has been extinguished, but when the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth was extinguished, this is no longer known.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others also do not know.</p><p></p><p>"Within the same realm of Heaven and Earth, why is the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth active in the Inner Realm, while it is extinguished in the border regions? Could it be that the spiritual mechanism is gradually withering, and as time passes, the Inner Realm will also approach the border regions where the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth is extinguished?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate the martial arts of the Inner Realm, one must have the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth, only with the existence of the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth can one sense the spiritual Qi, and the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth can be gentle and refined into the body.</p><p></p><p>"What is the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth like?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had never left the border regions, and after breaking through the Primordial realm, although he could sense the existence of the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, he had never experienced the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts can actually be cultivated without the existence of the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth, this shows that the spiritual mechanism of Heaven and Earth is not a must for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to flip through the ancient leather book.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's group returned from the sparring, and Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan again asked Li Xuan to teach them martial arts.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to seize this rare opportunity to get guidance from an expert.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already looked through the cultivation methods of the two, and as for guidance, with his Primordial realm cultivation, it was not difficult either.</p><p></p><p>The focus of the guidance was mostly on the refinement of true Qi.</p><p></p><p>Without the ability to refine true Qi, everything would be in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know of the Taicangs?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xie Lingfeng and asked.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was taken aback, "Taicangs?"</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, "Never heard of it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently, Xie Lingfeng had not heard of the Taicangs, and the ancient leather book had not appeared in circulation either.</p><p></p><p>Turning the jade talisman in his hand, Xie Lingfeng cupped his hands and said, "The junior will not disturb the senior's tranquility."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was entertaining Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, and during the meal, he naturally asked about the Inner Realm, and Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan began to introduce the Inner Realm and the cultivation of the martial arts of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently.</p><p></p><p>As Xie Lingfeng introduced, he gained more understanding of the cultivation of the martial arts in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of martial arts in the Inner Realm starts from the Nine Grades, and can be assisted by medicinal pills and decoctions... If one can obtain spirit herbs, the effect of assisting cultivation will be even better.</p><p></p><p>"According to Xie Lingfeng, medicinal pills and decoctions cannot be taken too much, each dose must be taken at least seven days apart, so that the remaining medicinal power can be completely refined.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, the accumulation in the body will be detrimental to the cultivation of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"As for spirit herbs, there are no such drawbacks, the spiritual power contained in the spirit herbs is pure, easy to refine, and will not remain, but spirit herbs are rare, and ordinary martial artists simply cannot afford them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found that the Inner Realm did not have elixirs, they had alchemists, but they did not refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The spirit herbs are simply decocted and then consumed, and different spirit herbs have different medicinal powers, but there is no method to refine them into elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Inner Realm has no elixirs, if I create some elixir refining, if successful, it will definitely be a treasure for martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly intrigued.</p><p></p><p>"For Sect Master and above martial artists, they also directly consume spirit herbs for cultivation, but generally the spirit herbs have little effect on Sect Master martial artists, and their cultivation still mainly relies on their own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Or they cultivate with spirit crystals, which can increase the speed of refining martial arts inner Qi, but spirit crystals are rare, and they are usually not extravagant to use for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"In most cases, spirit crystals are used to increase the recovery speed of inner Qi after consumption during battles."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng talked about the cultivation of Sect Master martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"This is a spirit crystal!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took out five spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up a spirit crystal, he could sense that the spiritual Qi contained in the spirit crystal was much gentler than the spiritual Qi he sensed from Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual Qi contained in a single spirit crystal was not much.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit crystals are naturally formed by Heaven and Earth, they are quite rare, and in the Inner Realm, they are the currency of martial arts, used to purchase spirit herbs, treasured weapons and other items."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xu Yan did not understand the origin of spirit crystals, Xie Lingfeng explained, "The formation of spirit crystals is actually similar to the jade mines in the border regions, the difference is that the spirit crystal mines in the Inner Realm are transformed from jade mines, the jade mines nurture the spiritual Qi of Heaven and Earth, and gradually transform into spirit crystals over time.</p><p></p><p>"The large spirit crystal mines are entirely spirit crystals, while most spirit crystals are mixed in the jade mines, because only a portion of the entire jade mine has transformed into spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Jade mines are very valuable in the Inner Realm, because most jade mines, to a greater or lesser extent, contain some spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were like naive country boys who had never seen the world. At this moment, they had a look of sudden enlightenment on their faces, as if they now understood.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but feel a longing for the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm, the flourishing of the Martial Dao! </p><p></p><p>It was much more interesting than the desolate borderlands.</p><p></p><p>"These few spirit crystals, I'll give them to Brother Xu."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't be polite." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily accepted them.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Hu Shan also took out five spirit crystals and handed them to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"One spirit crystal is worth ten thousand taels of gold in the Inner Realm, but spirit crystals can be exchanged for gold, while gold is difficult to exchange for spirit crystals. Normally, no one would really use spirit crystals to exchange for gold."</p><p></p><p>"The things that can be bought with spirit crystals are things that gold may not be able to buy."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng continued to introduce the uses of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, his disciple had suddenly become richer than himself.</p><p></p><p>No, his disciple was originally richer than himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm is quite interesting, the borderlands are like a remote and backward small town, while the Inner Realm is a prosperous big city. If you go to the Inner Realm, you probably won't want to come back to the borderlands anymore, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Going to the Inner Realm is a must, when to go, there's no hurry for now.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others settled down in Yunshan County, and every day they would spar with Xu Yan and Meng Chong, while also comprehending and refining the true qi cultivation method. Xu Yan also gave them pointers.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a Xiantian Realm cultivator, and had long been familiar with refining true qi from his blood and qi.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method that Li Xuan had passed on to Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, he was naturally also proficient in, and could penetrate the true meaning of the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>However, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were still unable to refine true qi.</p><p></p><p>They were somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>"Go ask the master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan nodded, they could only ask the senior expert for advice.</p><p></p><p>After hearing their explanation, Li Xuan immediately understood where the problem was.</p><p></p><p>The divine mechanism of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were Inner Realm cultivators, in order to cultivate, they could not lack the divine mechanism of heaven and earth. And to purify the inner qi of the Martial Dao and refine it into true qi, they naturally could not lack the spiritual qi of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The two of them cultivated the Martial Dao of the Inner Realm, but they did not have the bridge to heaven and earth within their bodies. In the borderlands without the divine mechanism of heaven and earth, they were unable to sense the existence of the spiritual qi of heaven and earth, and naturally could not cultivate.</p><p></p><p>They were unable to purify the inner qi of the Martial Dao and refine it into true qi.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method he had passed on to Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had no problems at all.</p><p></p><p>After understanding the reason, Li Xuan spoke, "The Martial Dao of the Inner Realm cannot lack the divine mechanism of heaven and earth. To purify and refine true qi, one cannot lack the spiritual qi. That's why you two are unable to refine true qi."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan heard this and suddenly understood, the heart that had been hanging finally dropped.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for your guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Since they could not cultivate in the borderlands, it was time to return to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of coming to the borderlands was to kill Xue Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, when will you go back?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan naturally understood this principle.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's gaze was firm as he said, "Cultivation of the Martial Dao cannot be neglected for a single day. Brother Xu, I will return to the Inner Realm tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Good! Someday, I will go to the Inner Realm to find you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, if you come to the Inner Realm and encounter any trouble, just mention my name, Xie Lingfeng. My name still has some use in the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, delighted, "Really?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng proudly thumped his chest and said, "I, Xie Lingfeng of the Sword Saint Cliff, have a renowned reputation in the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed, then asked, "Can I mention your name for any matter?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded and said, "Of course, for any matter, as long as you encounter difficulties or troublesome situations, Brother Xu can just mention my name!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What about me?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong came over and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Ge, you can also mention my name!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thumped his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Mentioning your name is that effective in the Inner Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng finally regained a bit of his own pride.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xie Lingfeng, am a renowned genius in the Inner Realm, with a formidable reputation."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded and said, "If I encounter any matter, I won't be polite and will definitely mention your name."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought for a moment and spoke up, "Ahem, you can also mention my name. My reputation in the Inner Realm is not weaker than the young master's."</p><p></p><p>The Sword Saint Cliff, Master Hu Shan, was also a renowned cultivator in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xie Lingfeng, then at Hu Shan, and felt a bit strange in his heart. Going to the Inner Realm, they can mention their names if they encounter any trouble?</p><p></p><p>He had a premonition that these two would be taken advantage of!</p><p></p><p>His disciple's thought process was sometimes quite different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan took their leave and before returning to the Inner Realm, they planned to make a trip back to the Qi Kingdom's capital.</p><p></p><p>According to Xie Lingfeng, the Qi Emperor was a decent person, and had allowed him to go to the palace to temper his heart using the imperial concubines. Before leaving, he had to express his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan agreed, the Qi Emperor was indeed a good person. He had also used the palace to temper his heart, laying the foundation for his Sword Heart Illumination.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off Xie Lingfeng and the others, Xu Yan and Meng Chong continued to ponder the Eight Trigrams.</p><p></p><p>The days returned to their usual routine.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked through the ancient books every day, and at the same time, used the Martial Dao cultivation methods of the Inner Realm as a reference to further improve the cultivation methods above the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already entered the Blood Qi Realm, the physical martial arts cultivation method of the Xiantian Realm, which also needed to be perfected.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already broken through to the Xiantian Realm, although he had just entered it, he could still pass down the cultivation methods above the Xiantian Realm to him.</p><p></p><p>Once Xu Yan comprehended them in advance, the feedback from the Golden Finger would come earlier, and he could break through the realm.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had already reached the late stage of Refining the Dantian, and was not far from entering the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Shi Er is a servant, what kind of feedback will he get when he enters the Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was a servant, not a disciple, and he was cultivating a already perfected Martial Dao cultivation method, not a newly edited one. Whether he could receive any feedback was an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Even if there was feedback, it would probably be minimal.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city of Yunshan, Xu Yan was walking the Eight Trigrams, when his footsteps paused, stopping at the Zhen Trigram.</p><p></p><p>The Zhen Trigram, representing thunderous force!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the techniques of Spatial Shift, Nimble Footwork, and the profound principles of the Eight Trigrams he had comprehended flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he seemed to have a new enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Swift as a thunderbolt, leaving no trace..." Xu Yan murmured, "The thunderbolt, it's just a flash, a flash and it's gone without a trace."</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight suddenly appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>His figure abruptly vanished from the spot, leaving no trace in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes widened as he looked around, but he could no longer see his senior brother's figure, as if he had disappeared from sight in the blink of an eye!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

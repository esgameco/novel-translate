            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 36: Mastering the Dragon Palm Technique (Seeking Readers)</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, when you just started cultivating the control of your qi and blood, the chickens were too small, and your qi and blood could instantly envelop them. How can you improve your control?"</p><p></p><p>"Go find something bigger to practice with."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu said earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!" Xu Yan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He threw the charred chicken on the ground and eagerly approached the horse he had ridden, cracking his knuckles and eager to try.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu: ...</p><p></p><p>This disciple, his brain really doesn't work well.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, this horse is also not suitable."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, the horse was too big, and his qi and blood could not envelop it, so he should find a smaller prey.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll go hunting now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu was gratified, his disciple had finally figured it out, it shouldn't be long before he could eat some wild game.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's hands were surging with qi and blood, the scorching aura permeating, and a fragrance of meat wafted over.</p><p></p><p>A wild boar, roasted by him, was now cooked.</p><p></p><p>Although most of it was charred black, at least half the meat was roasted and edible.</p><p></p><p>"My control of qi and blood has made a huge improvement!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and struck out, a powerful qi and blood palm force erupting forth, this qi and blood had condensed into a giant python with a long horn.</p><p></p><p>The outlines of its eyes and mouth were clearly visible.</p><p></p><p>"I'm close, the dragon-shaped palm force is not far away."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was thrilled.</p><p></p><p>He threw down the roasted boar and continued to catch wild boars to practice.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how my foolish disciple's cultivation is going?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu sighed inwardly, he still hadn't gotten to eat any wild game.</p><p></p><p>It had all been charred to carbon by Xu Yan, how could he eat it?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has mastered the technique of roasting meat with his bare hands, his control of qi and blood has improved, your disciple's bare-handed meat roasting skill has reached the pinnacle, with perfect control of his qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared, and in an instant, Li Xuanyu felt as if he had practiced the bare-handed meat roasting countless times, reaching the pinnacle level.</p><p></p><p>And his control of qi and blood was 100% perfect.</p><p></p><p>With 100% control of his qi and blood, Li Xuanyu felt that his use of his own qi and blood had reached an astonishing level.</p><p></p><p>Every bit of qi and blood could be manipulated at will.</p><p></p><p>The improvement in qi blood control had also led to a huge increase in his strength.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could completely conceal the qi and blood throughout his body without leaking a trace.</p><p></p><p>He raised his right hand, and the qi and blood on his index finger shot out like flames, sometimes growing larger, sometimes shrinking, and the intensity of the qi and blood heat could also be controlled at will.</p><p></p><p>"So this is 100% qi and blood control!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu was greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>His foolish disciple is quite impressive, progressing so quickly.</p><p></p><p>That night, Xu Yan returned.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he was not far from condensing the dragon-shaped palm force.</p><p></p><p>His control of qi and blood had made a huge improvement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu sat in the chair, it was time to show his disciple a thing or two.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, come here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was holding a just-slaughtered chicken, preparing to make dinner.</p><p></p><p>"Master."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu took the chicken from his hand, "Disciple, watch closely."</p><p></p><p>As he said this, he tapped his finger on the chicken leg.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood surged, and soon the fragrance of roasted meat wafted over.</p><p></p><p>He handed the chicken back to Xu Yan, saying, "Tear it open and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan obeyed, tearing open the chicken leg, and his eyes widened in shock.</p><p></p><p>The chicken leg was partially cooked.</p><p></p><p>But only the meat within an inch's range was cooked, the meat beyond that was still raw.</p><p></p><p>"This is 100% control of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"If you can achieve this, roasting the chicken leg while the meat outside remains raw, your qi and blood control will be sufficient."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyu finally revealed his skill in front of his disciple, feeling at ease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shocked, so this was 100% qi and blood control?</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will definitely be able to do it!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, just do your best, no need to force it."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Do not deliberately pursue it, and do not be negligent in your cultivation!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reminded him with a nod.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that the foolish disciple, in order to achieve 100% control over his qi and blood, would become negligent in his cultivation, causing his cultivation progress to be slow - this would be putting the cart before the horse.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, his disciple's talent was truly strong.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he had revealed his skills, Xu Yan had spent five days and was already able to roast a chicken leg thoroughly, while the meat other than the chicken leg was not affected at all.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not achieved 100% control over his qi and blood, he had already reached 80%.</p><p></p><p>This was already extremely impressive.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also decisive, not deliberately pursuing 100% control over his qi and blood, and instead focused his attention on cultivating the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out with a palm, and a scarlet red dragon over ten feet long and as thick as a calf's leg erupted forth, crashing into the ground and creating a large crater.</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating the dragon-form palm force, its power has increased by more than double, but I still feel that something is lacking."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Although he had refined the dragon-form palm force, the majestic and unparalleled power he had envisioned had not yet appeared.</p><p></p><p>He still felt that something was missing.</p><p></p><p>"Dragons have divine abilities, adapting to the situation - divine abilities are powerful, and adaptability is agile... I understand now.</p><p></p><p>"What's missing is agility. My current palm force is too rigid.</p><p></p><p>"It lacks vitality!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan once again entered a state of enlightenment, pondering how to truly master it.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Xu Yan immersed himself wholeheartedly in the cultivation of the Descending Dragon Palm, not even going to contemplate the Bagua or cultivate his body art.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he repeatedly practiced the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>Continuously adjusting, continuously cultivating the Descending Dragon Palm according to his understanding of the incantation.</p><p></p><p>Another seven days passed.</p><p></p><p>While cultivating the Descending Dragon Palm, Xu Yan struck out with a palm, and a ten-foot-long scarlet dragon roared out, seemingly about to crash into a tree in front of him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slightly flipped his palm, and the scarlet dragon suddenly coiled around, bypassing the tree trunk, and its tail whipped the tree trunk with a crack.</p><p></p><p>Snap!</p><p></p><p>The tree was broken by the dragon's tail.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet dragon then plunged into the ground, creating a large crater.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally more or less mastered it. This palm's power is about ten times stronger than when I first started cultivating the Descending Dragon Palm!</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the Descending Dragon Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>Raising both hands, he struck out with his right palm, and a ten-foot-long scarlet red dragon-form palm force gushed forth. He then followed with a strike from his left palm, and another dragon-form palm force erupted.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his hands in motion, the two dragon-form palm forces coiled and swirled - one circling around him for defense, the other suddenly striking out, its dragon head seemingly about to crash into the target, but then abruptly rearing up, its dragon tail lashing down, before the dragon head returned and struck out with a thunderous impact.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, the roaring sounds continued.</p><p></p><p>The two scarlet red dragon-form palm forces flew and swirled, sometimes diving, sometimes plunging into the ground, sometimes swaying their heads and tails!</p><p></p><p>"Dragons have divine abilities, adapting to the situation - so that's how it is!</p><p></p><p>"I have finally comprehended it!</p><p></p><p>"Although I still do not possess the might of divine abilities, and have only grasped the superficial aspects, but given my current realm, this is already a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally cultivated the Descending Dragon Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>He had finally grasped two lines of the Descending Dragon Palm incantation, although only superficially.</p><p></p><p>But he had still mastered it.</p><p></p><p>If he had cultivated the Descending Dragon Palm when he was killing the mountain bandits, he would not have had to rely on brute force.</p><p></p><p>A single palm strike could have wiped out all those mountain bandits!</p><p></p><p>"I still need to practice more, to achieve effortless control and fluent execution. And right now, I can only manifest two dragons, I'm still far from perfecting it.</p><p></p><p>"And my power is still not fierce enough, the dragons I strike out are still not agile enough!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan summarized his shortcomings and continued practicing on the hillside, with fragments of rock flying, vegetation being destroyed, and one crater after another appearing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

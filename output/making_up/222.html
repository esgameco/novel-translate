        <h1>Chapter 222</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu suppressed her breath and cautiously approached Meng Chong, but before she could get close, Meng Chong turned around and said in surprise, "Junior sister, have you mastered the technique of breath suppression?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's face fell as she said, "It was taught to me by the master. This breath suppression method is too common, and you were able to detect me from so far away."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled and said, "Junior sister, I've comprehended the Dao of the Sword and awakened the Sword Spirit. Your breath suppression method cannot deceive me, but other martial artists may not necessarily be able to detect you."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go find the eldest brother."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu headed towards the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, where's the eldest brother?"</p><p></p><p>She looked around in confusion, as the eldest brother usually meditated on the Dao of Martial Arts here.</p><p></p><p>But he was not there. As she passed by Xu Yan, her gaze swept over him, but she unconsciously dismissed him as just a rock.</p><p></p><p>She went back and forth on the mountain peak a few times, passing by Xu Yan twice, but still did not notice him.</p><p></p><p>"Master, master, the eldest brother has left."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu hurriedly ran to Li Xuan and said.</p><p></p><p>With a worried expression, "The medicinal pills I prepared, the eldest brother didn't take them with him. Why did he leave without telling us? Master, do you know the eldest brother has left?"</p><p></p><p>She unconsciously thought that Xu Yan had entered the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal pills she had specially refined for entering the Spirit Realm had not even been given to the eldest brother yet, making her somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, "Your eldest brother is still on the mountain."</p><p></p><p>"No, he's not there, Master. I just went to look for him."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"You all search carefully, go look for him again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll go look for him again."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu blinked her eyes and ran back to the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>This time, she searched meticulously, not missing a single rock or tree, but still could not find the eldest brother's figure.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've looked at every rock and tree, but I still can't see the eldest brother."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu ran back and reported.</p><p></p><p>You've been mistaking him for a rock and ignoring him, how could you possibly find him?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh inwardly, the Merge with the Environment technique that Xu Yan had comprehended was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's cultivation at the Penetrating Realm was far inferior to Xu Yan's, there was no way she could possibly detect Xu Yan's presence.</p><p></p><p>"How could your master be deceiving you? Go look for him again carefully."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu pondered.</p><p></p><p>She ran to Meng Chong and said, "Second brother, the master said the eldest brother is on the mountain, but I've searched everywhere and can't find him. Come help me look."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong paused, then stood up and said, "Okay!"</p><p></p><p>The two of them went to the mountain peak, and Suling Xiu looked around, asking, "Second brother, do you see the eldest brother?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered and said, "No."</p><p></p><p>After circling the mountain peak, he asked, "Are you sure the master said the eldest brother is on the mountain?"</p><p></p><p>"The master said so."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded glumly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood in place, carefully observing every blade of grass and tree on the mountain peak, his Dao of the Sword permeating the entire area, not missing a single detail.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he still could not find him.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, greatly shocked. Had the eldest brother really comprehended this concealment technique?</p><p></p><p>This method of hiding one's presence was truly extraordinary. If one could reach this level, where even Heaven and Earth did not know of one's existence, it would not be strange for Meng Chong to be unable to detect him, as the eldest brother's cultivation was superior to his own.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been observing the mountain peak the entire time. Meng Chong's method of using the Dao of the Sword to investigate the mountain was correct, but he had encountered Xu Yan, whose cultivation was higher than his, and whose Sword Dao surpassed his Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's third layer of Sword Dao had merged with the environment, replacing the surroundings with his Sword Dao. Meng Chong's Dao of the Sword was weaker than Xu Yan's Sword Dao, so naturally he could not detect the subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, at this moment, both Meng Chong and Suling Xiu had already stepped into Xu Yan's Sword Dao. Even though Meng Chong vaguely felt something was off, he had not discovered the hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>"If this was an ambush or sneak attack, unless one is much stronger, it would be impossible to avoid it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. If Xu Yan wanted to launch a sneak attack, even if his cultivation was higher than Li Xuan's, he would still be unable to evade it.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak, Xu Yan withdrew his Sword Dao and revealed his presence.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's eyes widened as she looked at him in astonishment, "Eldest brother, have you been here the entire time?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I couldn't detect you at all."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was shocked. She had come and gone several times, and searched thoroughly, but had always overlooked him.</p><p></p><p>"Eldest brother, have you comprehended it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, then nodded, "I've comprehended some of it, but have not yet fully grasped its true essence."</p><p></p><p>"Eldest brother, please teach me."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan passed on the Merge with the Environment technique to Suling Xiu and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"It's so profound, no wonder the master said the breath suppression method he taught me was very ordinary."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>She would need some time to comprehend the Merge with the Environment technique.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had already comprehended the Merge with the Environment technique, it was time for him to go to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was preparing to go to the Spirit Realm, and Li Xuan's group was going to see him off to the Qianbei region, where the entrance to the Spirit Realm was.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure came rushing in.</p><p></p><p>It was the long-absent Meng Shu Shu.</p><p></p><p>"My cousin, it's been so long, you haven't been hiding from your debts, have you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the travel-worn Meng Shu Shu and asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not, I discovered a treasure trove and got caught up there for a while."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu looked at the group, greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He had just come out of the treasure trove and heard about the series of changes in the Inner Realm, the magnitude of which gave him a sense of the world being turned upside down.</p><p></p><p>The powerful Great Yue Kingdom had disappeared, replaced by the Great Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>"Treasure trove?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up as he put his arm around Meng Shu Shu's shoulder and asked cheerfully, "My cousin, did you gain a lot?"</p><p></p><p>He no longer cared much about the storage bag Meng Shu Shu owed him, since he already had one and was not short on money.</p><p></p><p>"A lot!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu nodded excitedly, taking out five ancient-looking storage bags from his clothes.</p><p></p><p>"Look, these storage bags have larger spatial dimensions and can store more things than regular ones."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu grinned excitedly.</p><p></p><p>This trip had yielded a huge harvest, as he had stumbled upon an ancient relic.</p><p></p><p>"This one is for you, and this one is for Xu Shixiong!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu handed one storage bag each to Meng Chong and Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He then stuffed one of the remaining three storage bags into Suling Xiu's hand, saying, "Inside are my harvest from this trip, the lowest grade is sixth-grade spirit herbs, and there's even one that seems to be a fourth-grade spirit herb!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were all surprised. What kind of treasure trove had Meng Shu Shu discovered to gain such a massive harvest, including a fourth-grade spirit herb that had never appeared in the Inner Realm before?</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu then said mysteriously and excitedly, "Do you know, the biggest harvest I got this time was..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This is the harvest, not a spiritual elixir, not a storage bag, but this!" </p><p></p><p>He took out an ancient book made of some kind of animal hide from a storage bag. </p><p></p><p>"Oh, what is it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his eyebrows, revealing a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Cultivation Art!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said solemnly, "The cultivation art of the supreme martial artists, the complete Celestial Cultivation Art!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Waiting to see Xu Yan and the others, they all had an expression of shock.</p><p></p><p>The result, they all remained calm, as if this Celestial Cultivation Art was not as valuable as a spiritual elixir.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Celestial Cultivation Art, aren't you excited?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was a bit confused.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, patted his shoulder, and said, "Celestial, I know, I've already killed one, it's just like that."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu: ...</p><p></p><p>Killed? Killed one?</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was dumbfounded, swallowed his saliva, and said, "Senior Brother Xu, you're not joking, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If I say I killed, then I killed, I never joke. I'm about to go to the Spirit Realm, you know the gate to the Spirit Realm has appeared, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was stunned, the gate to the Spirit Realm has appeared?</p><p></p><p>He instinctively looked at Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know something about this?"</p><p></p><p>After hearing about the gate to the Spirit Realm, Meng Shu couldn't help but look at Su Lingxiu, making one suspect that he might know something.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Ah? I just wanted you to take a look if that is a grade four spiritual elixir, is the Celestial Cultivation Art not as valuable as a grade four spiritual elixir?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>He forcibly changed the topic and continued, "As for the gate to the Spirit Realm, I've seen it in a certain treasure land, but I don't know the specifics."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his shoulder and said, "It seems you know a lot of things, our family's, you don't need to hide it."</p><p></p><p>"I don't know anything, I really don't know anything!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Shu shook his head vigorously.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, Second Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shook her head, there was no need to force Meng Shu to speak.</p><p></p><p>She thought, her grandfather and Meng Shu's grandfather were close friends, and it was because of the Hidden Tower incident that they perished.</p><p></p><p>It was not surprising that Meng Shu knew some things, even about her own origins.</p><p></p><p>But since Meng Shu didn't say anything, there was no need to force him. As for her origins, Su Lingxiu had already let go, she only wanted to improve her own strength. If there were still enemies, she would just kill them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu heaved a sigh of relief, holding the ancient book awkwardly and said, "The Celestial Cultivation Art, really has no value?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand and took the book.</p><p></p><p>After flipping through it, he immediately said, "It doesn't have much value. To break through to the Martial Celestial realm, one must enter the Spirit Realm, it cannot be cultivated in the inner realm. </p><p></p><p>Now the inner realm is mainly focused on the Desolate Martial Dao, but looking at it can still help understand the cultivation of the Martial Celestial realm."</p><p></p><p>This Celestial Cultivation Art actually encompassed the three Celestial realms.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu heard this and couldn't help but feel disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Our family's, where did you find this? In a Celestial Tomb?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously as he flipped through the Celestial Cultivation Art.</p><p></p><p>"I accidentally entered there, it was an ancient ruin buried underground, it seems to be a sect, but there are not many remaining treasures, this cultivation art was found in one of the storage bags."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu told them the location of the treasure land.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong handed the book to Su Lingxiu after reading it, patting Meng Shu's shoulder and said, "Our family's, you should switch to cultivating the Desolate Martial Dao, otherwise you have to enter the Spirit Realm to break through, and the Spirit Realm..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't continue, Meng Shu seemed to know something about it.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu took a deep breath and nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Cultivation Art, after going through twists and turns, ended up in Li Xuan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu's sudden return delayed things a bit, and then he set out for the Cyan North region.</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Spirit Realm in the Cyan North region, Li Xuan's group arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple is going to the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath and respectfully said to his master, Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the gate to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu looked at the gate to the Spirit Realm, his expression complex, with some nostalgia, some sadness and loss.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped forward and walked towards the gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>On the peak of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, a group of powerful experts from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion silently watched.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is going to the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think will happen to Xu Yan in the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"With his outstanding talent, he will surely be taken in by some forces in the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily, Xu Yan is very proud, and that senior is also unfathomable, he should not join other forces. Of course, Xu Yan's treatment in the Spirit Realm will be better."</p><p></p><p>Where there are prodigies, they will receive certain preferential treatment. </p><p></p><p>The more monstrous the prodigy, the more low-born they are, the more the major forces will want to recruit and cultivate them into powerful pawns.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the Spirit Realm, the water waves surging, was tightly closed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came to the gate of the Spirit Realm, a surge of power gushed out, agitating the wavy gate, making it more turbulent.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall in front of the gate of the Spirit Realm, two Gathering Spirit Martial Artists were sitting cross-legged on both sides, silently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Guarding the gate of the Spirit Realm was a trivial task. After the Blood Demon incident, the gate of the Spirit Realm was not as frequently opened as before, and the number of times it had opened could be counted on one hand.</p><p></p><p>The recent opening was because of Jiao Ming from the Water Star Palace and that Ping'er.</p><p></p><p>If not for these two who had not yet returned to the inner realm, they would have directly and completely closed the gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for allowing inner realm martial artists to enter, they had never thought of it. The Spirit Realm's Spirit Sect also did not mention the matter of inner realm martial artists coming to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that they had completely cut off the path of advancement for that inferior land.</p><p></p><p>Even the excellent geniuses that might appear, they didn't need them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a buzzing sound, the two pillars in the main hall began to vibrate, a layer of wavy power rippling on the pillars.</p><p></p><p>A faint glow flashed on the pillars.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, is it Jiao Ming or that wild woman coming back?"</p><p></p><p>From the vibration of the pillars, they could judge that the person about to open the gate of the Spirit Realm was not weak, not comparable to the martial artists of the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>"Open it, after these two return, we can completely close the gate of the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>The other person spoke.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, a force was injected into the pillar, causing the pillar to rotate slightly.</p><p></p><p>The gate of the Spirit Realm opened.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked back at his master and the others, took a deep breath, and resolutely stepped into the gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan's mind stirred, and a divine elemental avatar instantly followed Xu Yan into the gate of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the gate of the Spirit Realm, they saw that the gate of the Spirit Realm was between two large mountains, and in front of the gate of the Spirit Realm was a huge palace.</p><p></p><p>The divine elemental avatar was about to continue forward through the palace, but suddenly, as the gate of the Spirit Realm closed, the connection with the main body was greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

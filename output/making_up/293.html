        <h1>Chapter 293</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"He actually dares to come directly to the gate of the Qianwu Palace and challenge them? Who gave him that courage?"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Xu Yan? Is he the one who killed Yu Changfeng in Luozhou?"</p><p></p><p>"Not just Yu Changfeng, he even killed the Sect Master of the Sword Sect."</p><p></p><p>"These wandering cultivators are so valiant nowadays, directly coming to challenge the gate of the Qianwu Palace. Where is the majesty of the Superb Spirit Sect?"</p><p></p><p>"Whew! Xu Yan is so strong, and have you noticed, his sword dao seems to be extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, I feel it might even be stronger than the sword dao of the Qianwu Palace."</p><p></p><p>The spectating martial artists discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, on the peak of the Qianwu Palace, the Palace Master and the elders all had gloomy expressions as they gazed down.</p><p></p><p>According to their plan, the geniuses of the Superb Spirit Sect were supposed to descend the mountain later and sweep away the other geniuses, showcasing the Sect's power, and then overwhelm the geniuses of the Myriad Alliance with their absolute advantage.</p><p></p><p>They had the confidence and assurance to do so.</p><p></p><p>Even though they knew the Myriad Alliance had Wu Tiannan backing them, and Wu Tiannan's strength was terrifying, how could the foundation of the Superb Spirit Sect be ordinary?</p><p></p><p>They had already started to invest more resources to cultivate geniuses capable of fighting, determined to achieve the final victory in the competition of the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>But the result was someone directly coming to their doorstep to challenge them.</p><p></p><p>This was something they could never have anticipated.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword dao is this?"</p><p></p><p>An elder of the Qianwu Palace asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the sword dao of the Qianwu Palace, but when he saw Xu Yan's sword dao, he felt an inability to draw his own sword!</p><p></p><p>"You can't see the crux of it either?" </p><p></p><p>The Palace Master asked gravely.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling of being unworthy to clash swords with him, as if the sword dao I've cultivated painstakingly is just the plaything of a three-year-old child!"</p><p></p><p>The elder said with a heavy expression.</p><p></p><p>"How is that possible!" </p><p></p><p>The other elders were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>One must know, the one who said those words was the number one in the sword dao of the Qianwu Palace, the current Sword Dao Elder!</p><p></p><p>"I have the same feeling!"</p><p></p><p>Another elder who cultivated the sword dao also said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"This youth must have stolen our Qianwu Palace's sword dao!"</p><p></p><p>An elder said with a sinister gaze.</p><p></p><p>"It was because of this matter that Huang Liang went to Yuzhou and ended up dead."</p><p></p><p>Someone reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, now that he has come to our gate, what is there to fear?"</p><p></p><p>"But the rules of the genius competition..."</p><p></p><p>"Is he a genius of the Myriad Alliance? Since he is not, why bother with so many rules? Isn't the one surnamed Wu supposed to stand up for this wandering cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The debating people looked towards the Palace Master.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master pondered for a moment and said solemnly, "The timing is not right, and Xu Yan seems to have a connection with that fellow Wu Tiannan. Otherwise, where did this extraordinary sword dao of his come from?</p><p></p><p>"You must know, without any weak points, if that Wu Tiannan goes berserk, we may not necessarily be able to stop him.</p><p></p><p>"Wait until the Divine Bridge is about to descend, then we'll act. Let's see then what Wu Tiannan can do!"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Elder agreed, "The Palace Master is right, the timing is not right!"</p><p></p><p>"Then how should we deal with Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>An elder frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't there geniuses from the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families? Let them take action."</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The other elders nodded.</p><p></p><p>If the Qianwu Palace's own geniuses fought him directly, wouldn't that make them look cheap?</p><p></p><p>Just set a threshold, let Xu Yan defeat all the geniuses of the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families first, then come talk about challenging the Qianwu Palace's geniuses!</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Qianwu Palace, the battle was reaching its climax. With a single sword strike, Xu Yan sent numerous sword forms sweeping the Qianwu Palace's warrior away.</p><p></p><p>The Life-and-Death Sword Wheel emerged in an instant, and under the alternation of life and death, a sword circled around the neck of the warrior, causing the head to fall.</p><p></p><p>The Xunfeng Sword Intent swept like a storm, the spiritual soul dissipated, and the physical body turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>After slaying another Qianwu Palace warrior, Xu Yan stood with his sword, arrogantly gazing at the gate of the Qianwu Palace and coldly said, "Are the geniuses of the Qianwu Palace all cowards?"</p><p></p><p>The spectating martial artists were all shocked. The Qianwu Palace was being slapped in the face, yet they did not unleash their thunderous might to subdue the intruder? </p><p></p><p>Could it be that this genius competition had some hidden agenda, that even the mighty Superb Spirit Sect's Qianwu Palace dared not violate?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>An elder of the Qianwu Palace stepped forward, his aura powerful, as if the might of the heavens and earth had converged upon him, a supreme expert!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes narrowed slightly, ready to flee at any moment. This elder's aura was stronger than Huang Liang's, he was definitely not Xu Yan's match.</p><p></p><p>"What, your Qianwu Palace has no more geniuses, only you old fellows left?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the elder contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"How arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>"The rumors about Xu Yan's arrogance are true, I see it for myself today!"</p><p></p><p>The spectating martial artists all sucked in a cold breath.</p><p></p><p>This was a supreme expert, yet Xu Yan was treating him with such contempt.</p><p></p><p>Song Zeng's anger surged, but he suppressed it and said coldly, "The Qianwu Palace, the Superb Spirit Sect, holds an esteemed position. How can our sect's geniuses be challenged by you, a mere wandering cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>You must first defeat all the geniuses of Qianwu Prefecture, then come challenge our sect's geniuses. Otherwise, you have no qualifications!</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had come all the way to their gate and killed two of their warriors, making them lose some face, but letting their geniuses fight him directly would make their geniuses look cheap, right? If not for the constraints of the genius competition, they would have slapped Xu Yan to death long ago.</p><p></p><p>However, the Qianwu Palace was being closely watched by Wu Tiannan, and if they violated the rules of the genius competition, Wu Tiannan would surely find a reason to strike them down.</p><p></p><p>The other Superb Spirit Sect sects might not necessarily join the Qianwu Palace in dealing with Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>In the previous battle at the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, it was the former Palace Master of the Qianwu Palace who struck down Wu Tiannan, but the latter actually managed to escape with his life.</p><p></p><p>And his strength had advanced further, reaching the pinnacle of the Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful expert keeping an eye on them, the Qianwu Palace could only endure for now.</p><p></p><p>"The Qianwu Palace is very strong, their geniuses all have spiritual body talents, two realms higher than me. Even if I defeat them, their elders will definitely not sit still and will all rush at me.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, I'll have to use the divine talisman from my master, but that won't do. As Xu Yan walking the martial path, how can I rely on my master's protection?</p><p></p><p>"I'm about to break through to the Spirit Origin Realm, a few more battles should do it. Once I enter the Spirit Origin Realm, there won't be much to fear anymore."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I, Xu Yan, shall subdue all the geniuses of Qianwu Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Song Zeng's face darkened, this brat Xu Yan was truly arrogant, wanting to single-handedly subdue all the geniuses of Qianwu Prefecture?</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see how you plan to subdue the geniuses of Qianwu Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Song Zeng snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>The spectating martial artists were all fired up.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial State was about to become lively. Those geniuses would likely appear one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Where will Xu Yan challenge next? One of the three kingdoms' seven sects or eight great families?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course, they are all subordinate forces of the Thousand Martial Palace."</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were whispering among themselves.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he moved his figure and retreated. Just as everyone thought he was about to leave, Xu Yan suddenly raised his hand and struck down with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Hundreds of meters outside the Thousand Martial Palace gate, the soil surged and piled up. Soon, a towering platform dozens of meters high had appeared, solidified from the compressed earth.</p><p></p><p>On the flat platform, Xu Yan took out some unknown treasures and inserted them into the four corners. In an instant, an unknown force gathered and converged on the earthen platform.</p><p></p><p>As this force gathered, the earthen platform became as solid as bedrock.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood proudly on the platform, holding a sword, and proclaimed, "I am the Sword Immortal Xu Yan. Outside the Thousand Martial Palace gate, I challenge the geniuses of the Thousand Martial State!"</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists were dumbfounded. How could he be so bold? They had thought he would leave the Thousand Martial Palace to challenge the major forces, but he had directly set up a dueling platform outside the palace gate and challenged the geniuses of the Thousand Martial State. Song Zeng's face turned green with anger. "Xu Yan, you are outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at him and said, "This is what you said. I have to defeat all the geniuses of the Thousand Martial State before I can challenge your Thousand Martial Palace geniuses. The Thousand Martial State is so vast, it would be tiring for me to travel around. Setting up the dueling platform right at the Thousand Martial Palace gate is much more convenient. It also allows your Thousand Martial Palace to watch the battles, so you can't claim I didn't defeat the Thousand Martial State geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Song Zeng's face was grim. Xu Yan's words were not without reason, but openly setting up a dueling platform at the Thousand Martial Palace gate was almost like slapping them in the face. "Xu Yan, do you think the rules of the genius confrontation mean nothing to you? You can act recklessly?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at him disdainfully. "I've never cared about so-called rules. Rules are shackles for the weak. I, Xu Yan, have always broken the rules. Your Transcendent Spirit Sect's rules are nothing to me."</p><p></p><p>The onlooking martial artists were stunned. No one had ever dared to openly call the Thousand Martial Palace the most shameless before. Xu Yan was the first in the history of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Song Zeng's face flushed red with rage. He had never been so humiliated, being openly scorned and insulted by a young wandering cultivator. He had to kill Xu Yan! "Xu Yan, no matter who is backing you, you must die today!"</p><p></p><p>Song Zeng was about to strike with a blade infused with heaven and earth's power, but he suddenly sensed a faint aura locking onto him. The Thousand Martial Palace Master also moved to the clouds above, his expression solemn and alert. A powerful force was gathering within the Thousand Martial Palace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised. "So strong! Far exceeding Black Bright. If that person attacks, I would have difficulty escaping, except for my master's divine talisman." He realized his strength was still too weak. Even at the peak of the Spirit Element Realm, he would not be able to withstand this powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>In the clouds above, a scholar-like man was reading a book, completely ignoring the gloomy Thousand Martial Palace Master. "Wu Tiannan! How dare you come to my Thousand Martial Palace, are you not afraid of being killed?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan smiled and said, "You can try. I, Wu Tiannan, have come to supervise whether anyone has violated the rules of the genius confrontation. After all, everyone knows the Thousand Martial Palace is the most shameless."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master coldly snorted, "We'll see how long you can be arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Wu Tiannan was the powerful expert backing Xu Yan. The Thousand Martial Palace Master ordered the geniuses of the Three Kingdoms' Seven Sects and Eight Great Families to defeat Xu Yan, regardless of whether they were from the Thousand Martial State or not.</p><p></p><p>Up in the clouds, Wu Tiannan was puzzled, "Xu Yan's sword dao is so profound and unheard of. Where does his inheritance come from?" An ordinary wandering cultivator daring to challenge at the Thousand Martial Palace gate - where did he get such boldness and arrogance?</p><p></p><p>The news of Xu Yan setting up a dueling platform at the Thousand Martial Palace gate to challenge the geniuses of the Thousand Martial State quickly spread. The entire Thousand Martial State was shaken, and everyone was amazed at Xu Yan's audacity and courage. What's more incredible was that the Thousand Martial Palace did not suppress Xu Yan with overwhelming force, but instead allowed him to challenge the geniuses at their gate.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, don't be so arrogant. The top geniuses of the Thousand Martial Palace are not someone you can challenge. Today, I will slay you!"</p><p></p><p>A figure rapidly approached.</p>

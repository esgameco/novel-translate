        <h1>Chapter 538</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has gained insight into part of the Indestructible Body of Ten Thousand Ways, and your physical martial arts have broken through to the Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly. His physical martial arts had also broken through to the Transformation Realm, further increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong had memorized the Indestructible Body of Ten Thousand Ways, Li Xuan began instructing Fang Hao in the Qimen martial arts, similarly using the Golden Book of the Great Way to present the Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The powerful and profound nature of using the Great Way as power and the Way as formation caused Fang Hao to become immersed in it, entering a state of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has gained insight into the Qimen Transformation, and your Qimen martial arts have broken through to the Transformation Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Qimen martial arts had also broken through to the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of the five martial arts, four had now broken through to the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My strength keeps growing stronger. Only by increasing one's strength can one find the greatest joy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled warmly as the Ancestor of the Way's halo appeared. The Golden Book of the Great Way turned to another page, revealing the profundities of the Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Similarly, Jiang Buping gained insight into the Extreme Soul Transformation, and the Extreme Soul martial arts also broke through to the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>With this, all five martial arts had broken through to the Transformation Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all the disciples came out of their enlightenment, Li Xuan did not stop imparting martial arts, but continued to teach.</p><p></p><p>At this stage of martial arts, it was no longer appropriate to continue creating realm after realm. Li Xuan already had ideas on how to continue strengthening martial arts without needing to create more realms one by one.</p><p></p><p>"As your master has said, all martial arts ultimately converge on the same path - to use the Great Way as the road and to practice the Great Way."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke to this point, his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other four hurriedly bowed respectfully, listening attentively to their master's teachings.</p><p></p><p>"Your master has always said that martial arts have no limit. Even though your master has no peers on the martial path and no one who can stand shoulder to shoulder with him, he has still not reached the end of the martial path. Perhaps he will never reach the end, but will just keep walking..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Master is too lonely. Perhaps only master knows what it means to be invincible and lonely, unable to find an opponent to challenge. On the martial path, when master looks back, there's not even anyone to see his back. How can he not be lonely?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan sighed inwardly. He could never experience the feeling of invincible loneliness that his master felt, this loneliness on the martial path. </p><p></p><p>After all, no matter how much he cultivated, master was always ahead on the martial path. He could never experience this kind of "loneliness and solitude" that his master felt.</p><p></p><p>"Master took me as a disciple not only because our meeting was fated, but also because of loneliness, solitude, and boredom!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood his master's mindset in emerging to take disciples.</p><p></p><p>It was because he was bored and looking for some amusement.</p><p></p><p>He could never understand this mindset of his master's. On the martial path, he couldn't even see his master's back, so how could he understand this state of mind?</p><p></p><p>But perhaps not. Although he couldn't see his master's back, one day when he looked back and couldn't see any peers, maybe he would have this kind of mindset?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his five disciples, his expression solemn, and said in a deep voice: "The Primordial Heaven and Earth is for understanding the Great Way. Once you understand the Great Way, you practice the Great Way. Therefore, the Primordial is for practicing the Way.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Primordial is practicing the Way - walking on the Great Way, with the Great Way beneath your feet, using the Great Way as your path. This is practicing the Way.</p><p></p><p>"Practicing the Way has no realms, no boundaries, and no end. How far you can go depends on your own insights and your ability to use the Great Way.</p><p></p><p>"Every zhang you walk is like advancing a realm. The Great Way is infinite, endless. When you start practicing the Way, you will have completed your apprenticeship. After that, the path depends on you. How you walk it is entirely up to you."</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Primordial was practicing the Way! This was the path of martial arts that Li Xuan had determined after deep thought. Practicing the Way was endless, without realms. One just kept walking.</p><p></p><p>Once the disciples entered the stage of practicing the Way, every step they took would be reflected back a hundredfold. There was no need for Li Xuan to rack his brains thinking about how to create more realms.</p><p></p><p>In the future, he could truly grow stronger while lying down, without having to expend mental effort on how to create techniques for his disciples to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Once they successfully entered the stage of practicing the Way, Li Xuan was confident that with his disciples' talents, they could explore the martial path on their own and continue practicing the Way.</p><p></p><p>They would truly complete their apprenticeship.</p><p></p><p>And his great undertaking in martial arts would be successful, his teaching of disciples complete!</p><p></p><p>Of course, practicing the Way was extremely difficult. Besides successfully practicing the Way, one also had to understand how to step onto the Great Way and how to walk on the Great Way.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Realm was the foundation for practicing the Way, and also a door to practicing the Way. Stepping through this door meant seeing the Great Way, but seeing it didn't necessarily mean being able to step onto it or walk on it.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as they saw the Great Way and understood the method of practicing the Way, Li Xuan was confident that he could break through to practicing the Way. Once he entered the stage of practicing the Way, Li Xuan was confident that even without feedback from his disciples, he could continue practicing the Way.</p><p></p><p>The use of the Golden Book of the Great Way would also be further enhanced. The Golden Book of the Great Way might even be the source of the Great Way! "Practicing the Way, practicing the Way. Those who practice the Way are eternal. The road is long and endless, without limit!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke solemnly, he waved his hand. Golden light shimmered, as if the Great Way appeared. A figure walked leisurely on the Great Way, step by step, but there was never an end or limit. He seemed lonely, yet also self-content and unrestrained.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other four were shocked and immersed in this vision of practicing the Way. They couldn't come back to their senses for a long time. This scene was deeply imprinted in their minds.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the foundation of practicing the Way and the profundities of the Great Way were all presented in this vision. As long as they gained some insight, they would definitely be able to walk on the Great Way in the future.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan withdrew the vision of practicing the Way presented by the Golden Book of the Great Way. He let out a breath and sat back in his chair. He had taught his disciples everything he needed to teach.</p><p></p><p>From now on, it truly depended on the disciples' own comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Practicing the Way... if one could enter the stage of practicing the Way, what would happen? Would one be able to transcend the Unchanging Land?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Land was vast and boundless. Should he break open the Unchanging Land and turn it into a world? Or was there another cosmos beyond the primordial chaos?</p><p></p><p>All of this was unknown.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that if he truly reached the stage of practicing the Way, perhaps he should explore whether there were boundaries to this primordial Unchanging Land, and how the Unchanging Land existed.</p><p></p><p>However, these things were still somewhat distant for him.</p><p></p><p>The disciples were all immersed in their insights. Li Xuan looked up at the Great Wilderness World. The Heavenly Dao continued to slowly grow stronger, and the world slowly devoured the primordial chaos, turning it into a corner of the world.</p><p></p><p>This process was very slow, but as long as the overall strength of the world continued to increase, the Heavenly Dao would also continue to increase, and the expansion of the world would not stop.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao... perhaps one day it will replace the primordial chaos?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Golden Book of the Great Way, Li Xuan smiled. The Heavenly Dao was ultimately within the Great Way. His Heavenly Dao Seal had also become stronger due to the enhancement of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The disciples were all immersed in their insights and couldn't wake up for a while. Li Xuan sat leisurely in his chair, waiting for the disciples to wake up.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard, Mu Xie, who was sweeping, was shocked in his heart. Although he couldn't see everything happening in the courtyard, the faintly visible golden light and the profundities that were beyond his ability to perceive or fathom had already far exceeded his understanding.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Xie felt increasingly fortunate that he hadn't been casually crushed to death, and had even been allowed to stay in this small courtyard, sweeping fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leaf.</p><p></p><p>"An opportunity, this is a great opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>This thought emerged and couldn't be suppressed. Mu Xiao felt unprecedentedly lucky to be able to sweep here, what an incredible opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Great kindness of the Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao's eyes became moist.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to sweep for the Dao Ancestor is an immense opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Holding the heavy broom, Mu Xiao slowly swept the ground. His heart was extremely calm, without anxiety or irritation. It was as if all negative emotions had been swept away along with the fallen leaves.</p><p></p><p>He was like an old man, slowly sweeping the ground, devout and respectful.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er also came to his senses and, seeing Mu Xiao's change, said: "If one day the Dao Ancestor gives a lecture, that would be an even greater opportunity for you!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao paused his sweeping motion, showing joy and anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"When will the Dao Ancestor give a lecture? Can I listen too?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er smiled, "No one knows when the Dao Ancestor will lecture. As for whether you can listen, since you're here, would they cover your ears?</p><p></p><p>"Being here when the Dao Ancestor lectures is fate. Since it's fate, of course you can listen."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Mu Xiao nodded repeatedly, determined to diligently sweep the ground and never leave, so he could surely wait for the opportunity to hear the Dao Ancestor's lecture!</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and Xu Yan awoke from his enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The figure walking on the great Dao in his mind seemed to gradually move further away, slowly disappearing.</p><p></p><p>His mind was shaken. So this was how all martial paths converge - ultimately all walking on the great Dao, using the great Dao as the path, and the great Dao is infinite, endless.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators who could reach this step were probably very few.</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely be able to enter the stage of walking the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought firmly.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had already reached the peak of the Heaven and Earth realm. He was only one step away from the Establishing Dao realm. Walking in the Unchanging Land, comprehending the primordial chaos, he believed he could accumulate more insights and establish his own Dao.</p><p></p><p>After establishing the Dao, there was Creation, and after Creation was混元 (Primordial Unity).</p><p></p><p>There were still three realms before walking the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also knew that the three realms became increasingly difficult to break through, requiring longer time for cultivation and accumulation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how far have you walked on the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled mysteriously, "How far? I don't know. Looking back, it's vast and empty. Looking forward, it's endless. Just keep walking. The scenery along the Dao is enchanting."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, walking the Dao is difficult! Difficult! As difficult as ascending to the blue sky from the mortal world. But walking the Dao is also easy, as easy as sailing downstream. Everything depends on enlightenment, on the heart, on one's own Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Everything that needed to be taught had been passed on. The future path now depended on the disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Land of Primordial Chaos still held some unknown dangers, not to mention a huge potential opposing force - the Unchanging Divine Temple. And that person from the Unchanging Divine Temple was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Xuan, who had reached the Creation realm in all five martial paths, was full of confidence about this. Even if that person from the Unchanging Divine Temple had improved their strength over such a long period after killing Tai Cang, he was confident he could subdue them.</p><p></p><p>His disciple wanted to explore the Unchanging Land, so naturally he needed to ensure his disciple's safety. This was crucial to his martial arts career and whether he could enter the stage of walking the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, before his disciple went to the Unchanging Land, Li Xuan enhanced his disciple's life-saving jade talisman, which could protect the disciple even from that person from the Unchanging Divine Temple.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the Unchanging Land of Primordial Chaos was boundless, and going deep into it, one could easily lose direction and be unable to find the way back.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Li Xuan personally crafted sensing pearls, so they could sense the direction of Heaven and Earth and not get lost, unable to find their way back.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping, after bidding farewell to everyone, left Qinghua Sect, preparing to head to the Unchanging Land of Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>When going to the Unchanging Land to explore the unknown, having a guide was naturally the best option.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, it's time to go to that great opportunity."</p><p></p><p>On the blue sea, Xu Yan said to the Ancient Sea Turtle.</p><p></p><p>"Going now? It's very dangerous."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle asked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has improved, enough to deal with many dangers. Besides, when has the Unchanging Land of Primordial Chaos not been dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's determination, the Ancient Sea Turtle nodded and said: "Alright, I'll accompany you on this trip. But too much time has passed, the great opportunity may not be in the original place. However, it shouldn't be difficult to find."</p><p></p><p>As the Ancient Sea Turtle spoke, it rose from the blue sea into the air, like a huge island.</p><p></p><p>After rising into the air, the Ancient Sea Turtle's enormous body began to shrink. When it shrank to about ten feet in size, Xu Yan, along with Meng Chong and the others, landed on its back.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go. You're familiar with the Unchanging Land, perfect to explain it to us!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle was a bit dumbfounded. Were they treating it as a mount?</p><p></p><p>I haven't even pledged allegiance yet!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle wanted to shake the people off its back, but then it thought, these are all true disciples of the Dao Ancestor, I can't afford to offend them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, does this mean I've also become a member of the Dao Ancestor's faction?</p><p></p><p>If so, I've gained a lot!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, the Ancient Sea Turtle no longer resisted and carried Xu Yan and the other three towards the outside of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Unchanging Land of Primordial Chaos is boundless. Every area is different, and changes occur after a period of time. Only by personally experiencing it can one understand the uniqueness of the Unchanging Land. Words cannot adequately describe it."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle began to introduce the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Ancient Sea Turtle?"</p><p></p><p>"Aren't those Sword Immortal Xu Yan, Sky God Meng Chong, Extraordinary Fang Hao, and Spear Demon Jiang Buping? Are they going to the Unchanging Land?"</p><p></p><p>Some realm lords discovered Xu Yan and the others, quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"They should be going to the Unchanging Land for training. After all, they are true disciples of that person, can't view them with common sense!"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!"</p><p></p><p>The realm lords withdrew their gazes, unable to be envious!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle, carrying Xu Yan and the other three, broke through the barrier of Heaven and Earth and entered the Unchanging Land. Looking back, Heaven and Earth were magnificent and vast, like a brilliant pearl in the Unchanging Land of Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, they vaguely understood why the Unchanging Divine Temple wanted to devour Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>They also understood why Unchanging True Spirits all wanted to enter Heaven and Earth. Heaven and Earth were like a light in the darkness, attracting beings from the darkness.</p><p></p><p>"Of the seven great Heavens and Earths, only one remains."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Looking up towards where Mingyu and Wumo's Heaven and Earth used to be, not a trace could be seen. The other Heavens and Earths had long disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Thinking back, one could see seven different magnificent pearls existing in the Primordial Chaos.</p><p></p><p>Among them, Tai Cang was the most magnificent and enchanting, and also the largest.</p><p></p><p>Now, Tai Cang had also become history, replaced by Da Huang. And because of the existence of the Heavenly Dao, Da Huang now looked even more magnificent and spectacular than Tai Cang did.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

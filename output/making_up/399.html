        <h1>Chapter 399</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Due to the arrival of the Red Cat and its deception of the Wind Spirit Tiger, Spirit Mountain was undergoing changes. The spirit beasts of Spirit Mountain were receiving training, transforming into an army of demon soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Nine Mountains region was also experiencing undercurrents. Since Meng Chong's arrival, he had faced successive assassination attempts, both open attacks and covert strikes. </p><p></p><p>If not for his powerful abilities, incredibly strong physical body, and extraordinary martial arts skills, he likely would have fallen.</p><p></p><p>"Who is targeting me?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already changed his appearance, wearing a wig on his bald head to conceal his most easily identifiable feature.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother appeared at Mount Dagai, but his whereabouts have been unknown for some time. Is he in seclusion making a breakthrough? What forces are behind the people targeting me? For now, I'll assume a different identity and venture into the Heavenly Cave to accumulate treasures. After my strength improves, it won't be too late for revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had formulated his next plan of action.</p><p></p><p>Due to the nature of martial arts, once he made a move in the Heavenly Cave, his tracks would quickly be exposed. Therefore, he couldn't stay in the Heavenly Cave for too long.</p><p></p><p>"The Minor Heavenly Eye technique is almost fully comprehended. I should spend more time on it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong began concealing his identity as he set off to explore the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As usual, Li Xuan sat leisurely in his chair, playing with a jade ruyi scepter in one hand while holding the Taicang Book in the other.</p><p></p><p>He had already read to the 17th page of the Taicang Book, with only the last page remaining to complete the entire book.</p><p></p><p>At present, Li Xuan's understanding of the Taicang world's principles and laws had reached an extremely high level. </p><p></p><p>Because of this, he was gradually perfecting the next realm beyond the Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Ability Martial Canon was also being further refined.</p><p></p><p>The goal of three thousand divine abilities was not far off. These divine abilities covered a wide range with various wondrous uses, not just attack and defense types.</p><p></p><p>"The way of divine abilities is truly profound. With the principles as reference, creating divine abilities has become easier."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan marveled inwardly at the great progress his martial arts undertaking had made recently.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has gone to the Nine Mountains region. Meng Chong should be heading there soon too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Among his five disciples, only Jiang Buping had not truly entered the door yet. But the issue of the Unchanging Qi was close to being resolved, and his entry into Extreme Soul martial arts was not far off.</p><p></p><p>Day after day, those around him were training diligently. This included his maid Cai Ling'er, who had activated her bloodline and obtained the Sea Spirit inheritance. She had become much more hardworking in her cultivation, and her strength was progressing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Meng Shushu, and Zhou Ying had already broken through to the late stage of the Divine Will Realm. It must be said that with the aid of pills and the rich spiritual energy of the divine realm, their cultivation speed had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had made great improvements in his formations and communication talismans, naturally advancing his Qimen martial arts as well.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had returned briefly before leaving for the Nine Mountains region.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Minor Heavenly Eye. You have mastered the Minor Heavenly Eye."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. In that instant, he felt as if his eyes could see through everything in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A third eye could even manifest in the center of his brow.</p><p></p><p>This third eye was formed of swirling light, marvelously profound.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Minor Heavenly Eye. Xu Yan truly hasn't disappointed me!"</p><p></p><p>Having obtained the Minor Heavenly Eye, Li Xuan felt everything was different. Looking at the Taicang Book, he seemed able to see traces of the principles being drawn.</p><p></p><p>He seemed able to see the traces of time left by the person who depicted the principles.</p><p></p><p>Reading the Taicang Book became even easier. Looking up at the sky, he could see the operation of heavenly principles, the existence of natural laws, the origin of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He even seemed to see an outline above the sky, like another world.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't continue looking. The divine ability of eye techniques had finally been supplemented.</p><p></p><p>"The Minor Heavenly Eye is already so powerful. How much more formidable must the true Heavenly Eye be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that this divine ability he had created was too mystical. The difficulty of cultivating it would be too great.</p><p></p><p>"With my Minor Heavenly Eye, I should be able to discover what's hidden in that stone room, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious stone room in the Wu Kingdom palace concealed unknown secrets, likely related to the owner of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan didn't immediately go to the Wu Kingdom palace to investigate.</p><p></p><p>"No rush. The Void-Breaking Realm is not strong enough yet, and I haven't fully mastered the Taicang Book. The secrets of heaven and earth won't run away."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suppressed his bubbling curiosity.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the great divine ability Heaven's Will Stabilizes the Spirit. You have mastered Heaven's Will Stabilizes the Spirit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had comprehended another divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Heaven's Will Stabilizes the Spirit!</p><p></p><p>This divine ability was one of the great divine abilities Li Xuan had created. It was a special type of divine ability. He hadn't expected Xu Yan to actually comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being the pioneer of my martial arts undertaking."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in an excellent mood.</p><p></p><p>In his good mood, he began instructing Feng Yan, who was busy working, on cultivating divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was overjoyed and listened carefully, afraid to miss even the slightest detail.</p><p></p><p>All this time, he had been staying at the Qimen Institute and Medicine Institute. As a mighty Immortal Venerable, he had become an errand boy. Wasn't it all for divine abilities? Wasn't it to gain the recognition of a great expert? Wasn't it to seize this rare opportunity?</p><p></p><p>Now, the opportunity had come! Feng Yan was cultivating a minor divine ability. However, as he practiced Taicang martial arts, the difficulty of cultivating divine abilities was still too high for him.</p><p></p><p>But since Wu Tiannan had successfully cultivated one, it meant Taicang martial artists could indeed cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Even if the divine abilities they cultivated were weaker than those of Great Wilderness martial artists, they were still divine abilities that could enhance the power of Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Feng Yan on the method of divine abilities, Li Xuan returned to his martial arts undertaking. As for whether Feng Yan could cultivate a divine ability, it all depended on his own talent.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping's entry into Extreme Soul martial arts is now a certainty. It's time to prepare divine abilities for Extreme Soul martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"The techniques of Extreme Soul martial arts should naturally have special characteristics. Even the weapons of Extreme Soul martial artists should be different."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to create the Extreme Soul Martial Canon, as well as divine abilities and other methods exclusive to Extreme Soul martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that for the sake of his martial arts undertaking, he didn't have a moment to spare. Though he appeared leisurely, every day his time was fully scheduled.</p><p></p><p>Time passed as he created martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong was ambushed by True King Venerables. At the cost of minor injuries, he killed one True King Venerable. Your martial arts experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao startled Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was ambushed and killed one person at the cost of minor injuries?</p><p></p><p>"What forces did Meng Chong offend in the Nine Mountains region?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Since the life-saving jade talisman he had given hadn't been triggered, it meant that although Meng Chong was ambushed, his life wasn't in danger.</p><p></p><p>"Immortal Venerables must guard the Heavenly Cave and can't easily leave their posts. With Meng Chong's defense, True King Venerables would find it difficult to seriously injure him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment, feeling that Meng Chong's ambush seemed somewhat</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong was ambushed and surrounded by True King Celestial Lords. He forcefully killed one of them, and your martial arts experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>As a result, over the next month, the Great Dao Golden Book provided feedback several times, all about Meng Chong being surrounded and attacked.</p><p></p><p>There was even one time when Meng Chong was ambushed and poisoned severely. He used his Golden Body acupoints to absorb and neutralize the poison, pretending to be dying from poisoning, and then counterattacked to kill one of the assassins.</p><p></p><p>"With Meng Chong's powerful and mystical physical body, ordinary poisons can't harm him at all. Moreover, he carries antidote pills refined by Su Lingxiu. But for them to resort to such despicable methods, which power has Meng Chong offended?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned involuntarily. At this rate, even Immortal Celestial Lords might personally take action. With Meng Chong's current strength, he was certainly no match for an Immortal Celestial Lord. His life-saving jade talisman would inevitably be triggered.</p><p></p><p>After some thought, Li Xuan used the pretext of inquiring about the forces in the Nine Mountains Realm to find out which power there specialized in using poisons or cultivating poison techniques.</p><p></p><p>Surprisingly, the result was that there were no forces in the Nine Mountains Realm that specialized in using poisons or cultivating poison techniques.</p><p></p><p>There weren't even any well-known martial artists who cultivated poison techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled - could it be that Meng Chong hadn't gone to the Nine Mountains Realm after all?</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was an Immortal Celestial Lord with an extremely high status in the Nine Mountains Realm, so he naturally knew it very well.</p><p></p><p>"Strong people grow in adversity. Facing such a crisis, Meng Chong's strength will improve even faster!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about it - perhaps this crisis Meng Chong was facing was also an opportunity for him to improve himself.</p><p></p><p>With the jade talisman, even if attacked by an Immortal Celestial Lord, he could still get through it safely.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Divine Phase Realm. You have reached great completion of the Void Breaking Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the Divine Phase Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed - his strength had finally improved again.</p><p></p><p>He had reached great completion of the Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has undergone extreme sublimation at the peak of the Divine Phase Realm, transforming into a Mountain River Sacred Body. You have obtained an Innate Mountain River Sacred Body."</p><p></p><p>Another transformation and sublimation, just as expected. This transformation was into a Mountain River Sacred Body.</p><p></p><p>"Sacred Bones, Sacred Body, perfect and flawless. His talent has improved again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>With this transformation, Xu Yan's talent and strength had greatly increased. As his talent improved, comprehending Heaven and Earth Realm martial arts would also become much easier.</p><p></p><p>"Mountain River Sacred Body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sensed his own body, feeling as if his flesh contained a mountain and river, as if he himself had transformed into mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this the embryonic form of a martial arts heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. He believed that after Xu Yan's transformation, his Mountain River Sacred Body would be the same, with his body embodying the image of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth Realm is not far off."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt relieved. He had an intuition that Xu Yan would soon be able to comprehend Heaven and Earth Realm techniques.</p><p></p><p>Once entering the Heaven and Earth Realm, it would be a huge transformation and improvement.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan breaking through to the Divine Phase Realm and undergoing extreme sublimation, his strength greatly increased, and feedback came one after another.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to improve the martial arts techniques beyond the Heaven and Earth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that he should focus on subsequent martial arts techniques next.</p><p></p><p>"This Red Cat is really something."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat had gone to the Nine Mountains Realm some days ago, wanting to establish a beast clan in the Divine Realm. However, with its current strength, that would be quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, soon after arriving in the Nine Mountains Realm, although the beast clan had not been established, it had already gained control over the spirit beasts of Spirit Veneration Mountain.</p><p></p><p>Through his Great Beast Divine Control, Li Xuan could roughly grasp Red Cat's situation. He was quite surprised that Red Cat had managed to control the spirit beasts of Spirit Veneration Mountain so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger is of the same species as Red Cat, and is the king of spirit beasts. There's no saying that one mountain cannot contain two tigers. On the contrary, due to the scarcity of tigers, they would be more tolerant of their own kind..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan somewhat understood how Red Cat had managed to persuade Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"These two people..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly frowned, noticing that there was something unusual about one person each in the Qimen Academy and the Medicine Academy. Although they had entered with legitimate identities and were doing odd jobs in the academies,</p><p></p><p>Under Li Xuan's Little Heavenly Eye, he could see at a glance that these two were spies, and extremely skilled ones at that.</p><p></p><p>Their every move and behavior showed no flaws whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>After all, those who could be arranged to enter the Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy had all been personally verified by Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>To be able to deceive Great Yue Emperor, an Immortal Celestial Lord, showed how extraordinary these two were. The power behind the scenes that could cultivate such spies must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Late stage True King Celestial Lord..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the other people in the Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy, including those sent from Tianwu Gate and Ten Thousand Thunder Sect for trade and cooperation.</p><p></p><p>"Another one, from either Tianwu Gate or Ten Thousand Thunder Sect... Are they spies from the Netherworld or some other force?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat surprised. Whether from Tianwu Gate or Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, those who could be sent here must be deeply trusted.</p><p></p><p>Yet such people were actually spies!</p><p></p><p>"They've cultivated a technique that excels at concealing aura, used for infiltration. The aura of this technique is deeply hidden. On the surface, they appear to be martial artists from Tianwu Gate and Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, but in reality they are from other forces..."</p><p></p><p>These spies appeared to be cultivating techniques from Tianwu Gate and Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, but their martial foundation was not actually from those sects.</p><p></p><p>If not for Li Xuan's Little Heavenly Eye, it would have been difficult to discover this clue.</p><p></p><p>Even he found it difficult to detect; Immortal Celestial Lords like the master of Tianwu Gate would find it even harder to discover, unless the spies revealed themselves.</p><p></p><p>"They're hidden deep enough, infiltrating even to my place..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment, then decided to expose the spies' identities.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had infiltrated his disciple's territory. As a master, how could he remain indifferent?</p><p></p><p>He called for Stone Two, "These few people, go tell Feng Yan to arrest them. Let Great Yue Emperor interrogate them thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two was startled, but immediately nodded.</p><p></p><p>Receiving the order, Feng Yan didn't ask why. Since it was the high master's instruction, he would just carry it out.</p><p></p><p>As an Immortal Celestial Lord, he immediately captured those few spies.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Feng Yan, why are you arresting us?"</p><p></p><p>One of the spies asked angrily and in shock.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao were also puzzled as to why Feng Yan had suddenly taken action to arrest people.</p><p></p><p>"You know very well in your hearts!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>The few Shadow members' hearts sank. Had they been exposed?</p><p></p><p>Impossible. With their infiltration abilities, there was no way they could have been exposed.</p><p></p><p>"I am from Tianwu Gate..."</p><p></p><p>"Shut up."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's sudden arrest naturally alerted Great Yue Emperor, as two of them had been personally verified by him and arranged to handle miscellaneous affairs in the Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan, representing the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect and in charge of affairs here, frowned, not knowing why Feng Yan was targeting martial artists from the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Feng Yan, what is this about?"</p><p></p><p>Great Yue Emperor asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"Spies. Investigate them thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan directly handed the people over to Great Yue Emperor, adding: "It was pointed out by the senior. There won't be any mistake!"</p><p></p><p>Great Yue Emperor, Cheng Zhan, and the person in charge from Tianwu Gate immediately changed expression.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

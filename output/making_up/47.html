        <h1>Chapter 47</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 47: The Xu Family Calls the Shots in Donghe Prefecture</p><p></p><p>The crisis of the Xu family was revealed when Xu Yan's formidable power emerged, showing superhuman abilities, forcing Xu Junhe to consider some follow-up matters.</p><p></p><p>Collaborate with the Tianmu Sect and rebel together?</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe dismissed this idea, as a rebellion by the Tianmu Sect would not succeed - they did not have the right timing, location, or people on their side.</p><p></p><p>There's no need to let his son act on behalf of others.</p><p></p><p>The Tianmu Sect is not worthy!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the more crucial reason was that Xu Junhe understood his son.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was obsessed with the martial arts legends in story books, and now that he had truly cultivated and achieved results, he would undoubtedly focus more of his mind on martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>After a rebellion, there would be many trivial matters that would require Xu Yan's involvement, which would delay his martial arts cultivation, a life Xu Yan did not wish to lead.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xu Junhe also did not want his son to be entangled in such trivial matters.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the root cause of the struggle for the crown prince was in the capital Jing'an, and Xu Yan needed to go there to resolve it once and for all.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a long whistle sounded, coming from the direction of the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate's Office.</p><p></p><p>The Donghe Prefecture Magistrate quickly turned around, his expression changing repeatedly - the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate's Office had fallen?</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi revealed a smile and cupped his hands towards Xu Junhe: "The Donghe Prefecture Magistrate's Office is now under the control of our Tianmu Sect. From today onwards, I, Kou Ruozhi, am the new Donghe Prefecture Magistrate."</p><p></p><p>The Donghe Prefecture Magistrate's face changed drastically, looking at Kou Ruozhi with shock and exclaiming, "You've even infiltrated the Magistrate's Office?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi waved his feather fan and sneered, "You incompetent fools are only valued by the foolish old Emperor Qi. I Kou merely used a few simple methods."</p><p></p><p>Looking down on the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate, he continued, "You thought you could trap us like a fish in a jar, but did you not know that we were waiting for this opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, dense footsteps came from the street, and a large group of soldiers surrounded them, led by the Donghe Prefecture Prefect!</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, the rebels have been apprehended."</p><p></p><p>The Prefect came before Kou Ruozhi and saluted.</p><p></p><p>He gestured behind him, and a servant brought forward a set of official robes.</p><p></p><p>Those were the robes of the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi put on the official robes, then took out a thin mask and wore it on his face. In that instant, Kou Ruozhi's appearance was nearly identical to the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate.</p><p></p><p>"Throw all these impersonating Tianmu Sect rebels into the dungeon to await sentencing!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi ordered in a voice barely distinguishable from the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>The Donghe Prefecture Magistrate fell to the ground in shock, staring at Kou Ruozhi and exclaiming, "You want to impersonate me?"</p><p></p><p>"Is there a problem with that?" Kou Ruozhi chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The soldiers the Prefect brought had already disarmed and bound all the injured and fallen officials, and were now escorting them away.</p><p></p><p>"Get our Magistrate a new set of clothes and a new face."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi commanded.</p><p></p><p>One of the Tianmu Sect experts stepped forward and directly stripped off the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate's official robes, replacing them with a new set of clothes, and putting a mask on his face.</p><p></p><p>Now the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate had become the appearance of a different Tianmu Sect expert.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xu, how is it?" Kou Ruozhi asked with a hint of pride.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent tactics!" Xu Junhe praised.</p><p></p><p>"Master Xu, what do you think of our collaboration?" Kou Ruozhi asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"As for the collaboration, let's wait until you can completely control Donghe Prefecture," Xu Junhe replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Then Master Xu, please wait and see!" Kou Ruozhi stepped out, his gait indistinguishable from the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate's.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, he had been secretly imitating the Donghe Prefecture Magistrate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The Tianmu Sect had actually infiltrated the Prefecture Magistrate's Office, and Kou Ruozhi was truly a formidable individual.</p><p></p><p>"Take them all away, do not disturb Master Xu!" Kou Ruozhi waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Governor of Donghe Prefecture was held hostage by a high-level master of the Tianmu Sect. His face was pale, but he let out a cold laugh and said, "The Tianmu Sect won't amount to much. You, Xu Junhe, better be careful!"</p><p></p><p>"The Governor need not worry!" Xu Junhe cupped his hands and replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>The injured soldiers were all taken away, and the bloodstains on the ground were cleaned up.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the sky was just starting to brighten.</p><p></p><p>"Father, should we rebel?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>He was extremely dissatisfied with the old man Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Your maternal grandfather and his family are all in the capital. If you rebel, what will happen? Even if you kill the Emperor Qi, how can you bring them back to life?" Xu Junhe looked at his son and said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Then should I go to the capital for a visit?" Xu Yan thought about it and felt it made sense.</p><p></p><p>If news of the rebellion spread to the capital, his maternal grandfather's family would surely be killed.</p><p></p><p>The journey was long, and he was afraid he wouldn't be able to save them in time.</p><p></p><p>"My husband, what should we do now?" Xu's wife looked worried.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, tell your father honestly, how strong are you? If the Divine Might Army mobilizes, can you withstand them?" Xu Junhe asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He had to know his son's strength in order to make an accurate judgment on the next step.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thumped his chest and said, "Even if a hundred thousand-strong army comes, I can come and go as I please. I can single-handedly push back a large army, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>"Is that true?" Xu Junhe was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Xu Yan raised his head proudly. "Father, although my martial arts have just begun, my strength has already surpassed the ordinary."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, that's good!" Xu Junhe was relieved.</p><p></p><p>His foolish son might have a foolish blessing, actually cultivating such powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After pacing back and forth a few times, Xu Junhe said, "Although Kou Ruozhi has control of the prefecture government, it's not that easy to take over Donghe Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The Donghe Prefecture Governor is just a sacrifice. Qi's country wants to eliminate the Tianmu Sect within Donghe Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The action against my Xu family is just a lure, and also an action by the Crown Prince's faction to establish merit and consolidate the Crown Prince's position."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, with his humble status, had married the daughter of the serving Minister of Personnel, the former Donghe Prefecture Governor, and amassed a huge fortune. He was no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was analyzing the situation and the developments that might occur next.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the Donghe Army General's Mansion, Jiang Pingshan, should be taking action.</p><p></p><p>"Kou Ruozhi and the others are like turtles in a jar. The real storm is about to come."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's expression was grave as he said, "Yan'er, you will crush Jiang Pingshan's army and display godlike abilities. After defeating Jiang Pingshan's army, don't let Kou Ruozhi and the other Tianmu Sect people seize the opportunity...</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Pingshan must not die!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Xu Junhe said, "Donghe Prefecture is under the control of our Xu family. After this battle, the Emperor Qi in the capital should know what to do.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, you go to the capital and help your maternal grandfather intimidate the imperial court and officials."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "Father, I know what to do."</p><p></p><p>Then he looked up and asked, "Father, do you want to become the Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was taken aback, then shook his head and smiled, "I am a merchant, and having Donghe Prefecture is enough for me. Being the Emperor is too tiring."</p><p></p><p>Since his son had cultivated such powerful martial arts, surpassing the ordinary, Xu Junhe's vision should also be elevated. What's the point of being a mundane Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's face was full of a radiant smile. Who wouldn't want to become the legendary martial arts master?</p>

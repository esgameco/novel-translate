        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After hearing the plan, Blood Extreme was extremely excited. To become the master of heaven and earth was actually so simple - just replace the current one.</p><p></p><p>Only a disciple of the Dao Ancestor could come up with such a method.</p><p></p><p>"Master, from now on I will be Blood Demon, a powerful figure of the Immutable Divine Palace!" Blood Extreme said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"I'm glad you understand," Su Lingxiu nodded with satisfaction. </p><p></p><p>Once Blood Extreme successfully replaced Blood Demon, backstabbing the powerful figures of the Immutable Divine Palace during the great battle in the wilderness would definitely have unimaginable effects.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Blood Extreme would betray them after replacing Blood Demon, Su Lingxiu believed Blood Extreme was a smart person who knew how to choose. If they could let him replace Blood Demon, they could naturally also make him vanish without a trace. Blood Extreme should be very clear about this point.</p><p></p><p>"The process of transforming into a soul seed is quite painful and takes some time. I also need to modify your divine soul, which will make it easier to replace Blood Demon," Su Lingxiu said as she began preparations.</p><p></p><p>To ensure the plan went smoothly, she still needed to ask her master for some help. After all, Blood Demon was the master of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Immutable Land, inside a great mountain.</p><p></p><p>This mountain was naturally formed from a fallen true spirit. Blood Demon's true self was hidden inside this mountain.</p><p></p><p>As for chasing down Demon Shaman, he couldn't be bothered to do the legwork.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, I'm about to break through. I can sense the great power of the child soul," Blood Demon said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Through his connection with the child soul, he realized it had already become much stronger and had cultivated various powerful divine abilities and great techniques.</p><p></p><p>Now the child soul's strength was not much weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>"I must find a way to draw it back and strengthen myself once the child soul becomes powerful," Blood Demon thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He was also worried about the possibility of the child soul going out of control. Although this probability was extremely small, he had to guard against it.</p><p></p><p>He immersed his divine sense and began to communicate with the child soul.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, he obtained a technique from the child soul - the art of integration and unification. It could integrate all the cultivated avatars back into oneself.</p><p></p><p>The various divine abilities, secret techniques, and cultivation levels of the avatars would all be integrated back.</p><p></p><p>"This is just what I need," Blood Demon began to cultivate. As he practiced the art of integration and unification, he found that his connection with the child soul became stronger.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he could draw the child soul back at any time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if the child soul's strength surpassed his true self, because it was a child soul, it could not resist his summoning or the art of integration and unification.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a technique passed down by the Dao Ancestor," Blood Demon sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>What he didn't know was that when he cultivated the integration technique, Tian Zi had slightly weakened the heavenly dao rules' shielding of the child soul. This created the illusion for Blood Demon that his connection with the child soul had strengthened and he could integrate and summon it back at any time.</p><p></p><p>This was all part of the plan. Through sensing the child soul, Blood Demon ultimately could not detect the existence of the heavenly dao or see through the illusion created by the power of the heavenly dao.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the heavenly dao operating the entire world and the cycle of reincarnation established, the heavenly dao had strengthened considerably. Its rules had become even more profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was even less able to see through it.</p><p></p><p>"No rush. Wait for the child soul to break through to the realm above Establishing the Dao, then immediately summon it back and integrate. Obtain the great techniques and power cultivated by the child soul. I will surpass that one from the Immutable Divine Palace in one step," Blood Demon was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before he could take over.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Shaman, you'd better run far away and not get killed so quickly. After I take over, I can accept you as a subordinate. I'm not like that one, and I don't need to devour heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>A blood pool appeared beneath him. Blood Demon's form gradually disappeared, merging into the blood pool. Only a blood pool remained in the mountain, bubbling and steaming.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, one true spirit after another seemed to smell the blood and walked in. Seeing the blood pool, they became excited.</p><p></p><p>They ran to the edge of the blood pool and lowered their heads to drink the essence blood. At that moment, a bloody hand reached out and grabbed the true spirits, pulling them into the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>Splash! The true spirits let out brief screams of agony in the blood pool before disappearing. Only the blood in the pool seemed to boil even more fiercely, with more steaming bubbles.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Immutable Land, Demon Shaman's strong arm plunged into the body of a true spirit. The true spirit struggled as its physical body gradually withered, its flesh and blood disappearing until only a thick layer of skin remained.</p><p></p><p>"You came quickly!" Demon Shaman looked back towards a certain direction, snorted coldly, and instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Not long after he left, a figure immediately arrived, looked in the direction Demon Shaman had fled, and continued the pursuit.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Crack! The sound of a long whip cracking rang out in the Immutable Land, accompanied by roars.</p><p></p><p>In the chaotic Immutable Land, a figure wielding a long whip was driving a group of immutable true spirits towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>This figure had three strange worms coiled around its body, writhing like tentacles. A row of saw-like bone spikes stood up in the middle of its head.</p><p></p><p>Gray qi swirled around it, obscuring its features. It wielded the whip like a shepherd, driving a group of immutable true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Among this group of immutable true spirits, there were some with strength comparable to the Realm Lord level. However, even so, they dared not show any resistance under this person's driving.</p><p></p><p>The vast procession of true spirits marched through the Immutable Land. The sound of the whip cracking rang out from time to time. Finally, in the distance of the chaotic land, a jewel-like object could be seen.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang, your world should also disappear," the figure raised its head and looked towards the distant jewel-like object, its eyes glowing with a faint green light.</p><p></p><p>Crack! With the sound of the whip, a group of immutable true spirits let out roars and surged mightily towards that jewel-like object.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness world had already returned to peace.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures were gradually getting used to the new world order and the division of the world into yin and yang.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan devoted himself wholeheartedly to the great undertaking of the martial way. He no longer paid much attention to everything else in the Great Wilderness world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to Canglan Island to accompany his parents and guide his family members in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was in secluded cultivation. Jiang Buping was in secluded cultivation. Fang Hao, the sect master of Qinghua Sect, was also in secluded cultivation except for handling some sect affairs.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Tian Zi were plotting to trap Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>She had already refined Blood Extreme's divine soul into a soul seed and successfully fused it into Blood Demon's child soul.</p><p></p><p>It was quietly and gradually eroding the child soul, secretly strengthening itself in preparation for seizing Blood Demon's power.</p><p></p><p>Plotting against a master of heaven and earth was no easy task. Su Lingxiu sought out her master to strengthen the soul seed further and had Blood Extreme cultivate a divine ability related to the divine soul that could increase the chances of seizing Blood Demon's power.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had already broken through to the Venerable realm and accompanied Yu Yao to Yu Yao Heavenly Cave. Li Xuan could only sigh that Wu Tiannan was deeply blessed with good fortune to directly obtain a heavenly cave.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was immersed in comprehending the heavenly dao. He felt his strength had increased slightly and believed he could definitely forge a new path.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng had already...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jing returned to Sword Master Cliff with his wife Fu Yun to continue his grand endeavor of establishing a sword sect.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng went back to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu and Shi Er also ran back to Canglan Island. Returning to their familiar homeland, they felt they could be more useful there.</p><p></p><p>After all, their strength still gave them an advantage in the Eastern Wilderness, the former inner region.</p><p></p><p>Everyone now had their own goals and things they wanted to do. The world had regained peace, as if entering a period of recuperation after the turmoil.</p><p></p><p>In the azure sea with its shocking waves, a giant turtle surfaced and looked up at the sky, absorbing the essence of heaven and earth to nourish itself.</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle realized that after the changes in the world, it seemed to no longer be in danger. Those realm lords would not deliberately target it, so it didn't need to worry about exposure.</p><p></p><p>"The Wilderness is great!" the sea turtle thought contentedly.</p><p></p><p>In the True Dragon Cave Heaven, a huge sculpture was finally completed.</p><p></p><p>It was a sculpture of a nine-clawed purple-gold giant dragon, built with extremely rare materials and located at the core of the True Dragon Cave Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Bow!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Lie led a group of true dragons to prostrate themselves on the ground and kowtow to the purple-gold giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>All the true dragons kowtowed one after another.</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming was very confused. After his father returned, why did he want to build a dragon ancestral shrine to worship the dragon ancestor?</p><p></p><p>What puzzled him even more was that the ancestor of the true dragons was his grandfather Ao Hong, but his grandfather didn't look like this, nor did he have nine claws.</p><p></p><p>Grandfather was a five-clawed azure dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, his father insisted that this was the ancestor of the true dragon clan, a nine-clawed purple-gold dragon! He said it with absolute certainty, and even said that even if grandfather Ao Hong came back, they would still have to worship this ancestor!</p><p></p><p>The other true dragons were also confused, but Ao Lie was the leader of the true dragon clan and currently the strongest and highest-ranking member of the true dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>Since he said so, it must be true, or perhaps it involved some secret of the dragon clan? After Ao Lie led the group of true dragons in kowtowing and paying respects, he looked very satisfied, and his whole dragon form relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Our true dragon clan also has a powerful backer. The ancestor of our true dragon clan is the real supreme being."</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue did not return to the true dragon clan, but instead followed Xu Yan to Canglan Island. Ao Lie was very supportive of his beloved granddaughter's choice.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, worthy of being his beloved granddaughter, she was as shrewd and perceptive as himself, skilled at grasping opportunities!</p><p></p><p>Randomly recognizing an ancestor would be an embarrassing thing, but if the recognized ancestor was extremely powerful, it would not be embarrassing, but an honor.</p><p></p><p>So, this nine-clawed purple-gold dragon was now the ancestor of the true dragon clan!</p><p></p><p>Even if his own father Ao Hong luckily came back alive, it wouldn't change this fact.</p><p></p><p>Such a thick and strong leg must be held tightly.</p><p></p><p>As long as they held tightly to this powerful backer, they wouldn't have to worry about the true dragon clan being threatened with extinction by the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, several elders of the clan will reside in the dragon ancestral shrine. Dragons of the clan must frequently worship the dragon ancestor. Outstanding youths of the clan will receive training at the shrine. Every year, we will hold a grand ceremony to worship the dragon ancestor. Understood?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie said with a solemn face.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>All the true dragons nodded.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the realm lords in the Great Wilderness looked up towards the outside of the world, their faces changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! One figure after another appeared instantly at the edge of the world, looking towards the Immutable Land with extremely grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Even Tianshai, who was responsible for the great construction and hard labor in the Underworld, came out.</p><p></p><p>The figures of Meiwu and the other six also appeared successively.</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, it seemed as if a storm was sweeping in. Roaring sounds were deafening, and a group of immutable true spirits were roaring as they charged towards the world.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" </p><p></p><p>Ao Lie looked at the group of immutable true spirits, his eyes narrowing as a terrifying figure appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"It's him!"</p><p></p><p>"Who?" asked a realm lord in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Xie!" Ao Lie said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The realm lords were all confused about who Mu Xie was.</p><p></p><p>But Meiwu and some of the older generation of powerhouses had extremely grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Mu Xie, a powerful figure from the Immutable Divine Palace. He has the ability to command immutable true spirits. He once commanded immutable true spirits to invade the True Spirit World. The leader of the Heavenly Tiger clan, Tian Hu, fell in that battle, and the Heavenly Tiger clan was nearly wiped out.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, it was the Lord of True Spirits, Ao Hong, who dispersed the immutable true spirits with his powerful dragon might, breaking Mu Xie's power to command true spirits."</p><p></p><p>An old voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the source of the voice. It was an extremely elderly old man who gave off a sense of decrepitude, as if he had little life left.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a special aura seemed to swirl around him, giving people an ominous feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Tai He, you've actually become like this!" </p><p></p><p>Tai Miao exclaimed in surprise, then sighed.</p><p></p><p>Tai He!</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures present were all startled when they heard this. This legendary ancient small world lord, who had been rumored about but never seen, had actually aged to this extent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he seemed to be entangled by some strange aura, constantly suffering from torment.</p><p></p><p>"Being able to live until now is all thanks to Big Brother's help," Tai He sighed.</p><p></p><p>Tai Miao's expression was sorrowful. The "Big Brother" Tai He referred to was naturally Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>"Not many of the old acquaintances are left," another old voice sounded.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked over to see another decrepit old man.</p><p></p><p>Tai Kun!</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu, Yan Mo... we meet again," Tai Kun chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu and the other six had complex expressions, with both reminiscence and sorrow.</p><p></p><p>Among the many powerful figures, only Tai He, Tai Kun, and Tai Miao were from the same era as them. Xiao Yao, Yu Yao, and the others all belonged to the younger generation.</p><p></p><p>As Tai Kun appeared, three more figures emerged. Although they looked old, they did not have the same decrepit air as Tai He and Tai Kun.</p><p></p><p>These three were all ancient small world lords who had been in hiding for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Cang Lie and Jiang Feng looked at their masters, then at the group of immutable true spirits charging towards them, their expressions sorrowful.</p><p></p><p>The crisis had already arrived.</p><p></p><p>Their masters had appeared, which meant that they, the two of them, would have to enter the vast Immutable Land and flee this world.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Mu Xie." </p><p></p><p>Tai He looked at the rolling group of true spirits, then at Ao Lie, shaking his head and sighing, "You little dragon, you're still too weak. You can't intimidate these true spirits or break his power to command true spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Back then, Tian Hu could actually do it, but Mu Xie was slightly stronger, so Tian Hu ultimately lost."</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie sighed and asked, "Is Mu Xie a world lord?"</p><p></p><p>"You could say that. Actually, 'world lord' is just our way of saying it. The powerful figures at the level of the Immutable Divine Palace don't call themselves that, after all, they don't have worlds, so they can't be called world lords.</p><p></p><p>"But in terms of strength, they are at that level. Although they are slightly weaker than true world lords, they still belong to the world lord level."</p><p></p><p>Tai He nodded.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

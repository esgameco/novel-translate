        <h1>Chapter 69</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 69: Meng Chong: The Great Sun Golden Bell is Extremely Powerful</p><p></p><p>The Innate Realm has already transcended the mundane. In the eyes of ordinary people, there is little difference between them and the divine.</p><p></p><p>A lifespan of thousands of years is actually within a reasonable range.</p><p></p><p>Absorbing and exhaling the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, the Innate True Qi is endless, so the longevity is naturally extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>And if the foundation is Jade Bone Innate, the lifespan will naturally be even longer.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited. Why did he cultivate the martial dao? </p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason was to become powerful, to achieve immortality!</p><p></p><p>This is the ultimate meaning of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"I am now at the entry stage of the Innate Realm, the Innate True Qi seems endless, and I already have the cultivation methods of the Innate Realm. Next, I should create the cultivation methods above the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I need to determine the realm and connect it well with the Innate Realm, so that it can form a complete system."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a state of excitement.</p><p></p><p>His disciple is so powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has not yet broken through the Innate Realm, he does not know the profundities of the Innate Realm. Even if I create the cultivation methods above the Innate Realm for him now, he would not be able to comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>"It is impossible for him to comprehend the cultivation methods across realms."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>So the cultivation methods above the Innate Realm can only be comprehended by Xu Yan after he breaks through the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Without breaking through the Innate Realm, even if one comprehends the cultivation methods of the Innate Realm, without personally experiencing the changes of the Innate Realm, it is impossible to use that as a foundation to comprehend the cultivation methods above the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he can start working on preparing the next realm now.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's cultivation speed, it should take about a month for his Qi and Blood to be complete, and it will take some time to break through the Innate Realm. Within two months, Xu Yan should be able to break through the Innate Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Once Xu Yan breaks through the Innate Realm, he will receive the feedback from the Godly Manual again.</p><p></p><p>Directly reaching the peak of the Innate Realm!</p><p></p><p>"It's time to work on the next realm, to create the cultivation methods!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had refined to the Bronze Bone stage. He felt his own immense strength, his physical body like a golden bell covering him. He clenched his fist and felt that he could easily kill a top martial artist of the jianghu with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>If he had this strength back then, he wouldn't have needed to take the risk to assassinate Emperor Wu, using Emperor Wu's hand to take revenge.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, come here!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong called out.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Meng, what are your orders?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er asked with a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>He had finally grasped the threshold of refining the skin through these days of arduous cultivation, and his heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Come, punch me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Stop spacing out, come, punch me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong urged.</p><p></p><p>"Is that really okay?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er hesitated.</p><p></p><p>What if he ends up injuring the person?</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can hurt me? Stop the nonsense, hurry up!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at him disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er took a deep breath, stepped forward, and fiercely punched Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Shi Er felt as if he had punched a huge mountain, his fist hurt a bit, and there was a recoiling force that made his arm numb!</p><p></p><p>"Is that all? Use your full strength!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt that this punch was like a tickle to him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll try again!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's eyes narrowed, he let out a loud roar, and punched Meng Chong's chest with all his might.</p><p></p><p>This punch, he had used his full power.</p><p></p><p>He was a top martial artist of the jianghu, having mastered the Powerful Strength.</p><p></p><p>A full-power punch could split rocks and break stones.</p><p></p><p>However, when it landed on Meng Chong's chest, it was still like punching a huge mountain, giving Shi Er a feeling of an ant trying to shake a mountain.</p><p></p><p>The recoiling force made him retreat two steps, and his entire arm felt numb.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong has become this strong already?</p><p></p><p>In such a short time, he can completely ignore the attacks of a top martial artist of the jianghu?</p><p></p><p>"Did you really use your full strength?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at Shi Er with puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>He had restrained himself, not daring to unleash the full force of his physical rebound, afraid of hurting Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>So, this is it?</p><p></p><p>The supreme martial arts master of the jianghu has become so weak?</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had a speechless expression on his face, saying, "This punch is the strongest I've ever thrown in my life."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly excited, thinking that the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering must be truly powerful.</p><p></p><p>He pulled out the knife he had stuck in the ground and threw it to Shi Er, saying, "Come, cut me!"</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was dumbfounded, looking flustered.</p><p></p><p>Cut with a knife?</p><p></p><p>Has Meng Chong's brain been cultivated to the point of dysfunction?</p><p></p><p>This is a knife, a blade of steel. Even with a strong physique, how could it be withstood?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Meng Chong's martial arts haven't even reached the entry level, still in the foundational stage, and he wants to rely on his bare flesh to resist a steel blade?</p><p></p><p>"I'm not afraid, what are you afraid of? Come on, do it!" Meng Chong urged.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was speechless, "You iron-headed fool may not be afraid, but I am! If I hurt you, what am I going to do?"</p><p></p><p>"For real?" Shi Er still hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Come on!" Meng Chong patted his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!" Shi Er gripped the steel knife and struck at Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sharp steel knife did not cut in.</p><p></p><p>"Put some strength into it!" Meng Chong said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Another strike, still unable to break through. There wasn't even a mark on Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>"Use full force!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath, his flesh like a golden bell, his entire body impenetrable, his muscles faintly glowing with a golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er gritted his teeth and struck at Meng Chong's chest with all his might.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The steel knife broke into two pieces, Shi Er staggered back, his hands trembling, a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>There wasn't even a mark on Meng Chong's chest!</p><p></p><p>As a supreme martial arts master of the jianghu, his full-force strike couldn't even injure Meng Chong's flesh and blood?</p><p></p><p>This is too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his chest, now understanding that his current physical defense could completely ignore the top martial arts masters of the jianghu. </p><p></p><p>Ordinary steel blades could not harm him.</p><p></p><p>However, if it was a precious sword, that would be a different story!</p><p></p><p>"Continue cultivating, strive to refine the Diamond Lotus Bone as soon as possible, and enter the martial dao!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was full of vigor as he immersed himself in arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was also stimulated, and began to cultivate diligently as well!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was wandering around Yunshan County when a voice suddenly caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I see your innate talent is still quite good. Since we have met, it is fate. Here is a martial arts secret manual, and I will sell it to you at a good price."</p><p></p><p>This sounded rather familiar.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan followed the voice and saw an old man with white beard, wearing a wide-sleeved robe, holding a yellowed booklet in his hand, talking to a young master from a wealthy family.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I wish to become your disciple..."</p><p></p><p>"Your talent is only so-so, not up to my standards. But since we have met, and I see your sincere heart for the martial dao, I will sell you this martial arts secret manual."</p><p></p><p>The old man spoke in a lofty manner, then continued, "The laws of the martial world are not to be taken lightly. Martial arts secret manuals have their own value. I'm not after your money, but this is the rule of the martial world - secret manuals cannot be given away for free!"</p><p></p><p>The young master from the wealthy family felt disappointed and regretful, but soon perked up. Although he failed to become the old man's disciple, he had still obtained a martial arts secret manual, so his trip was not in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior. I will purchase the secret manual."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, since we have met by fate, a hundred taels of silver will do."</p><p></p><p>"Here is the payment, senior."</p><p></p><p>The young master handed over the silver and received the secret manual.</p><p></p><p>"Ponder and cultivate well!" </p><p></p><p>The old man encouraged him, then turned and left, catching up to another young master from a wealthy family: "Young man, I see your innate talent is still quite good. Here is a martial arts technique..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>What a swindler! And there are actually people who believe him.</p><p></p><p>This is truly outrageous!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

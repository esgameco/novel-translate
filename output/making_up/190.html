        <h1>Chapter 190</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If there are any parts you don't understand, you can come find me, and I'll explain it for you," Xu Yan said as he handed the booklet to Peng Yuan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"We can understand it, we can understand it," Peng Yuan and the others said excitedly as they left, gathering together to start examining the martial arts of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't bother with them, instead going to the mountain peak on Canglan Island, sitting cross-legged and continuing to comprehend the profundities of the Penetrating Mystery, to ponder the Sword Wheel Sword Dao and the Mountain and River Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the others looked at the cultivation methods in the booklet, one by one shocked beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"Golden Bone? Can it really refine such a powerful Golden Bone? Indestructible for ten thousand years, still shining golden?"</p><p></p><p>"This, this, this... Jade Bone? Flawless Jade Bone, unchanging for all eternity? So mystical, so profound, so arcane!"</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan and the others were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Golden Bone was already so mystical, yet there was an even more mystical Jade Bone.</p><p></p><p>Could a flesh and blood body really refine these?</p><p></p><p>And this was just the foundation of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Sinews and bones thundering, qi and blood like a raging storm, unimaginable, unimaginable!"</p><p></p><p>The martial dao scholars exclaimed in amazement, as if intoxicated, as if they had opened up a new world and seen a new realm.</p><p></p><p>"I hate myself for being a Sect Master cultivator, otherwise I would definitely cultivate the Great Wilderness Martial Dao!" one of the scholars cried out, beating his chest in anguish.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Peng Yuan and the others repeatedly flipped through the booklet, gradually comprehending it, and also cross-referencing it with many inner domain martial dao classics.</p><p></p><p>They even tried to cultivate, to sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>However, their martial dao foundations were already firmly established, and they were Sect Master cultivators - how could they cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>In the meantime, they consulted Xu Yan a few times, asking about some of the more mysterious aspects they didn't understand.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, Brother Xu, on your breakthrough!" Xie Lingfeng sighed inwardly. In the short time since he last saw Xu Yan, he had already broken through to the Penetrating Mystery realm.</p><p></p><p>While he had just barely broken through to the peak of the Sect Master realm, his strength was falling further and further behind.</p><p></p><p>His sword dao insights had also risen to a higher level, but he still had not attained sword heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>Although he had refined true qi, he could not be considered a Primal Realm cultivator, stuck in an awkward realm between the two.</p><p></p><p>Neither Primal Realm nor Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie has been refining true qi for a long time, I wonder if he has any insights on how to transition to cultivating the Great Wilderness Martial Dao?" Xu Yan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"It's difficult," Xie Lingfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had also been pondering this issue, but had never found a solution. Even when he thought of some methods, he was ultimately unable to put them into practice.</p><p></p><p>"Coincidentally, Scholar Peng Yuan and the others are here, let's discuss it together and see if we can find a way," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He naturally understood the impact the Great Wilderness Martial Dao would have on the inner domain. Even sword saints like Sword Saint Cliff, who single-mindedly cultivated the sword dao, were shaken and felt lost.</p><p></p><p>The other top powers could only imagine.</p><p></p><p>If they were unable to transition to cultivating the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, their lineages and status would be threatened. The major powers would likely unite to try and suppress the Great Wilderness Martial Dao while it was still in its infancy, nipping it in the bud.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng joined Peng Yuan and the others in their discussion, delving into the martial dao, expounding on their respective insights, searching for a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>As for Hu Shan, he felt rather awkward, unable to participate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The hidden pavilion's mountain cave remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Ever since the Hidden Pavilion's Master and the peak Sect Masters were killed, the remaining Hidden Pavilion members were all in a state of panic.</p><p></p><p>The members whose identities were unknown quickly destroyed their black robes and eliminated everything related to their identities, fleeing to other places. In a sense, they had withdrawn from the Hidden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>But more of the Hidden Pavilion members hid within the Hidden Pavilion itself, not daring to go out, planning to reorganize the Hidden Pavilion after the storm had passed.</p><p></p><p>Although the Hidden Pavilion Master had died, and all the peak Sect Masters had been killed, there were still Sect Master experts remaining.</p><p></p><p>Which of these Sect Master experts did not have some ambition? The opportunity to control the Hidden Pavilion was right in front of them, how could they miss it? Several Nascent Soul Sect Masters had already clashed in secret, vying for the position of the Hidden Pavilion's new Master.</p><p></p><p>Due to the fear of exposing their whereabouts and being found by Xu Yan, they had not engaged in full-blown conflict, but had tacitly hidden in the Hidden Pavilion, cultivating in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>Since they had to hide for a while and completely conceal the Hidden Pavilion's traces, whoever broke through to the peak Sect Master realm first would become the new Hidden Pavilion Master.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they could no longer use the name "Hidden Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The black robe decorations also had to be discarded.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if they encountered Xu Yan or someone from the Long Green Pavilion, wouldn't they be in trouble?</p><p></p><p>The mountain cave was silent, the tall pavilion still stood, but the top floor that had once been the Hidden Pavilion Master's residence was now occupied by several Nascent Soul Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>They were all cultivating frantically, striving to break through to the peak Sect Master realm as soon as possible, to seize the position of the Hidden Pavilion's new Master.</p><p></p><p>The previously silent mountain cave suddenly had the sound of a cave door opening, which seemed especially jarring in the quiet.</p><p></p><p>The many powerful Hidden Pavilion members immediately emerged, and the Nascent Soul Sect Masters on the top floor all came out, looking towards the entrance of the Hidden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As a secretive power, the Hidden Pavilion's location was extremely hidden, and those who knew the headquarters were all Sect Masters, the core members of the Hidden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>All the core members were now hiding in the Hidden Pavilion, so no one should be outside.</p><p></p><p>Could it be the Long Green Pavilion that had found this place? Thinking this, the Hidden Pavilion's experts couldn't help but feel a chill.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps echoed from the entrance corridor, the sound reverberating in the cave. There was only one person approaching, and they were not concealing their tracks at all.</p><p></p><p>The more this was the case, the more uneasy the Hidden Pavilion's experts became. The first person they thought of was Xu Yan! If it was Xu Yan, he would indeed come in such a bold and arrogant manner.</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul Sect Master experts exchanged glances, prepared to fight to the death or surrender directly, if surrender was allowed.</p><p></p><p>A white-robed figure emerged from the corridor, entering the cave.</p><p></p><p>Not Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>However, the Hidden Pavilion's experts did not feel relieved. The newcomer was not from the Hidden Pavilion, and although not Xu Yan, he was still an outsider. How had he found the Hidden Pavilion's location?</p><p></p><p>The Nascent Soul Sect Masters looked at the visitor, dressed in white robes with a thin blue mask covering his face, making him appear as if his face was tinged with blue.</p><p></p><p>Blue Mask!</p><p></p><p>Upon recognizing the newcomer, the Hidden Pavilion's experts all shrank back, expressions of terror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It was common knowledge that there were many secret powers in the inner domain, but the most mysterious of the three major secret powers was the Blue Mask!</p><p></p><p>The other most mysterious secret power, whose strength was the greatest, was even the Sky Treasure Pavilion could not fathom its depths.</p><p></p><p>It was known that this mysterious secret power, the Blue Mask, had all its members wear blue masks to conceal their faces. Every Blue Mask member encountered was a Sect Master expert.</p><p></p><p>"Blue Mask?!" one of the Nascent Soul Sect Masters said, his expression grim.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Tunnel</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man looked at the martial artists of the Hidden Tower, his voice calm and flat, "What is the old man of the Hidden Tower planning to do? What kind of task has he received?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Hidden Tower glanced at each other, no one daring to speak.</p><p></p><p>A few Grand Masters also remained silent for a long while, until one of them said, "This is the secret of the Hidden Tower. How could we know?"</p><p></p><p>"You truly don't know?" The blue-faced man's voice became slightly gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know!" The martial artists of the Hidden Tower said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man looked at one of the Hidden Tower martial artists, suddenly reaching out and grabbing him.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist's expression changed drastically, the aura of a Grand Master about to erupt, but in an instant, his eyes were filled with terror and fear.</p><p></p><p>"Spare me!" </p><p></p><p>In that moment, just as he was about to resist, he felt a great mountain pressing down on him, his powerful Grand Master cultivation instantly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>He had experienced this once before, when the Master of the Hidden Tower had become enraged.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man's strength was comparable to the Master of the Hidden Tower! Poof! The blue-faced man grabbed the man by the neck, coldly asking, "You truly don't know?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining Hidden Tower martial artists were all drenched in cold sweat, their faces pale.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master with the hand around his neck had terrified eyes, his lips trembling as if trying to speak.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man loosened his grip slightly. "Speak!"</p><p></p><p>"We were tasked to capture a person, and he only gave us one mission - to find and capture Su Lingxiu!"</p><p></p><p>"What is the purpose of the capture?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, we really don't know!"</p><p></p><p>Crack! </p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man tightened his grip, snapping the Grand Master's neck and killing him instantly.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Hidden Tower martial artists were horrified, their faces ashen.</p><p></p><p>"The old master is dead, and people without value have no need to live. If you know nothing, then go join the old master."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man's gaze was icy as he looked at the group.</p><p></p><p>"As for the specific purpose the master wanted to capture Su Lingxiu, something to do with the Celestials, we really don't know. But the answer may be in the master's secret chamber, which we cannot open."</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man listened silently, and suddenly a terrifying aura seemed to envelop the cave.</p><p></p><p>All the Grand Masters felt as if a great mountain was pressing down on them, their movements sluggish and their strength greatly diminished. They had no chance of escaping, not even the ability to fight back.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man looked at the few Grand Masters. "Kill them!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Masters did not hesitate, instantly attacking and ruthlessly killing the remaining Hidden Tower martial artists. The battle was completely one-sided, like a massacre.</p><p></p><p>In just a short while, aside from the few Grand Masters, everyone else was dead. The blue-faced man then took out several light blue masks, identical to the one he was wearing.</p><p></p><p>"Wear them."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Masters hurriedly put on the masks.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, this is my branch."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, my lord!" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Masters hurriedly kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>They had survived! With the Hidden Tower Master dead, following the blue-faced man was now their way out.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the secret chamber?"</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man asked.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, it is here."</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master eagerly led the blue-faced man to the stone wall of the cave.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man's gaze fell on the opening in the wall, forged with precious materials. Unless one knew the method to open it, even Grand Masters could not forcefully break through.</p><p></p><p>He extended a hand and placed it on the door of the secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A terrifying aura surged from the blue-faced man, causing the Grand Masters to retreat in shock. They felt the blue-faced man was even more formidable than the Hidden Tower Master.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man's palm turned blue, pressing against the door like a red-hot branding iron on grease.</p><p></p><p>Sizzling sounds rang out as his hand sank into the door. At a certain moment, cracks began to appear on the door.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The door shattered and collapsed, revealing the small secret chamber inside.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man stepped in. The cramped chamber only contained a few small boxes, with a jade box in the center bearing a floral pattern.</p><p></p><p>"This is it!"</p><p></p><p>Excitement and desire flashed in the blue-faced man's eyes. He reached out a slightly trembling hand to grab the jade box.</p><p></p><p>After opening the box, there was a scroll inside. He took it out and unrolled it, his whole body trembling with excitement as he stared at the contents.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he rolled up the scroll and put it away.</p><p></p><p>"The Gate of the Spirit Realm, Su Lingxiu?"</p><p></p><p>He murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Emerging from the secret chamber, he looked at the Grand Masters and asked sternly, "Where is Su Lingxiu, and who killed the old master?"</p><p></p><p>The surviving Hidden Tower members did not dare to hide anything, detailing how the Hidden Tower Master and a group of peak Grand Masters had gone to the Evergreen Hall to capture Su Lingxiu, only to be killed.</p><p></p><p>"The Evergreen Hall's strength is too terrifying. Dozens of peak Grand Masters were killed, including the peerless geniuses Xu Yan and Meng Chong, who are from the Evergreen Hall."</p><p></p><p>The last person said, his voice trembling.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Tower Master and the Withered Demon Venerable had both perished at the Evergreen Hall. He felt a sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>But his eyes soon turned icy cold.</p><p></p><p>"Su Lingxiu must be captured, no one can stop me. The one in the Evergreen Hall cannot monopolize the chance to enter the Spirit Realm Gate. The Great越Kingdom's imperial court probably also has some plans. Someone like me should start making some connections."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I have a task for you."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Please command, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Masters hurriedly kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Go to the forces that have previously attacked the Evergreen Hall and still have surviving peak Grand Masters. The opportunity for revenge has come, and someone will surely want to deal with the one in the Evergreen Hall..."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>After giving the task, the blue-faced man took the jade box and scroll and left.</p><p></p><p>In the Great越Kingdom's imperial palace, the Great越Emperor sat in the study, his expression gloomy and dark as he looked at the intelligence reports about the Great Wilderness. His hands were trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>Resentment and frustration were evident on his face, yet he also felt a sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Hall was too powerful, and the Great越Kingdom had no choice but to retreat and make concessions to protect itself.</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the imperial attendant outside the study spoke up sternly.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

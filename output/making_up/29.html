        <h1>Chapter 29</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 29: Xu Yanming Comprehends the Cultivation Technique of the Blood Qi Realm</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had entered the martial dao, his daily life remained the same - cooking when it was time to cook, feeding the chickens when it was time to feed them. Li Xuan also seemed to be as carefree as usual.</p><p></p><p>Behind the scenes, however, Li Xuan was racking his brains, trying to figure out how to create a cultivation framework for the Innate Realm, how to develop the theories for the Innate Realm, and even the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Innate Realm, he also needed to have a concept of the future cultivation direction.</p><p></p><p>In order to blindly create realms and cultivation techniques later on, he needed to lay a solid theoretical foundation.</p><p></p><p>If the cultivation technique was not mysterious enough, the cultivation practiced by Xu Yan would not be strong enough, and the realm of understanding would not be deep enough, which would not be sufficient for the prodigy Xu Yan to deeply comprehend.</p><p></p><p>If the technique was too mysterious and deviated from the framework, he was afraid it would not be able to connect to the next stage, and even more afraid that Xu Yan would not be able to comprehend it, getting stuck in the cultivation of the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Damn, this is too difficult!" Li Xuan sighed secretly.</p><p></p><p>The pressure in his heart prevented him from giving free rein to his creativity, making him feel constrained in his creation.</p><p></p><p>If he just blindly created the Innate Realm cultivation technique, he was afraid Xu Yan would not be able to comprehend it and get stuck in the Blood Qi Realm cultivation, ultimately harming himself.</p><p></p><p>On Li Xuan's side, he was secretly troubled by the blind creation of the Innate Realm cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>These past few days, Xu Yan had also been racking his brains trying to comprehend the four-line cultivation technique, but made no progress, feeling anxious and depressed.</p><p></p><p>"If I cannot even comprehend this simple cultivation technique, my master must be disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"What's the use of refining my jade-like bones? If I cannot comprehend the cultivation technique, how can I continue to cultivate the martial dao?</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is boundless. If I cannot even comprehend such a simple cultivation technique, how can I cultivate to become stronger and reach higher realms of the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned and pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he remembered his master's words.</p><p></p><p>"My master said that as long as I try my best, not being able to comprehend it does not hinder my cultivation...</p><p></p><p>"I have been completely immersed in the cultivation technique, consuming my mental energy, and neglecting my actual cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"My master was actually telling me not to be too obsessed with it, but to find enlightenment in the process of cultivation itself..."</p><p></p><p>After this realization, Xu Yan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He immediately calmed his mind and began to cultivate, carefully feeling the circulation of his blood qi and its gradual strengthening, with a single-minded focus on the cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, the four-line cultivation technique would float into his mind.</p><p></p><p>As he cultivated, Xu Yan gradually gained some enlightenment: "A thousand streams and ten thousand rivers flow into the great river... Each time I cultivate, my blood qi is increasing, growing bit by bit, just like the countless streams and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"Flowing for thousands of miles into the great ocean... The essence of this is the gathering of blood qi, becoming like the great ocean...No, it is the physical body becoming like the great ocean, containing the blood qi;</p><p></p><p>"Surging waves rise up in layers, the blood qi can shake the mightiest mountains - The blood qi cannot be calm, it must be like a raging current, like surging waves, only then can it fully stimulate the blood qi and effectively strengthen the physique.</p><p></p><p>"The blood qi can shake the mightiest mountains, does this not mean - the bones are like mountains, and the blood qi can shake them..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, enlightenment dawned on Xu Yan, and he felt that the meaning of the four-line cultivation technique had emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he vaguely comprehended and grasped the profound principles of the martial dao hidden within.</p><p></p><p>"The gathering of blood qi, like a raging current, like surging waves; striking the jade-like bones... The entire body becomes like a great ocean..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into a state of deep contemplation, and his blood qi gradually began to flow like a raging current, layer upon layer of blood qi continuously pounding against his skeletal frame.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now!" </p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement as he finally grasped the profound martial dao principles hidden within the four-line cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath, and his bones began to tremble, with a rumbling sound resonating throughout his body, as if there were thunderous roars echoing within.</p><p></p><p>The sound was not loud, as if it was only reverberating within his body.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, strands of blood qi began to emerge, circulating in a new way.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His entire body, the marrow in his bones flowed like a river, his qi and blood were constantly being generated, and it was becoming faster and more abundant.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the qi and blood in his body were like a surging torrent, constantly circulating, sometimes pounding against the bones, the qi and blood pounding against the bones, rolling back, and surging through his entire body.</p><p></p><p>In this repeated rolling back of qi and blood, his physical body was strengthened, and his qi and blood were also purified and their power became stronger.</p><p></p><p>The aura of qi and blood surrounded his body, and with every breath he took, his chest and abdomen rumbled, his qi and blood boiled, and his intense aura was like a surging flame.</p><p></p><p>However, after practicing the new cultivation method he had just comprehended, Xu Yan soon felt a sense of improvement in himself.</p><p></p><p>And it was an all-round improvement, his physical body was getting stronger, and his qi and blood were getting stronger as well.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation technique passed down by my master is truly profound. After comprehending the cultivation technique, the cultivation process is indeed different from not having comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>"After comprehending the cultivation technique, the improvement is faster, and the qi and blood have also become more powerful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally comprehended the cultivation technique, I will not disappoint my master!"</p><p></p><p>He was elated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was editing the cultivation technique of the Innate Realm, mainly the theoretical framework and how to connect it with the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>The first thing that has been determined is that the cultivation of the Innate Realm is True Qi!</p><p></p><p>To transform the entire qi and blood into Innate True Qi, this requires a process, and the first step is to open the Heaven and Earth Bridge!</p><p></p><p>"After opening the Heaven and Earth Bridge, the qi and blood will circulate the Microcosmic Orbit and transform into Innate True Qi... Only by opening the Heaven and Earth Bridge can one inhale the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth and transform it into True Qi...</p><p></p><p>"The Innate cultivator can inhale and exhale the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, soar into the sky, and travel hundreds of miles in an instant, no longer an ordinary person..."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan pondered, the more he felt that this set of fabricated theories was very real, the theory was perfect, and the framework was solid.</p><p></p><p>He just needed his foolish disciple Xu Yan to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>The only problem was:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky, muttering in his heart, "Does this world really have spiritual energy? If not, wouldn't it be in vain?"</p><p></p><p>"The air here is so good, it should be sweet, so there should be spiritual energy, right?"</p><p></p><p>Whether spiritual energy exists or not, the Innate Realm is about inhaling and exhaling the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, refining it into Innate True Qi, returning from the mundane to the primordial.</p><p></p><p>"The second realm is edited to be so high, once cultivated, it will already be very powerful. For the subsequent realms, I need to continue editing them in a more profound direction, otherwise, they won't be strong enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, fabricating cultivation techniques was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>However, after a few days of pondering, he finally fabricated the cultivation technique of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Theoretically, it can be connected to the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for whether it can succeed, it all depends on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need to pass it on to Xu Yan for now, he has just entered the Qi and Blood Realm, he needs to get familiar with the Qi and Blood Realm first.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if he hasn't even comprehended the cultivation technique of the Qi and Blood Realm, and then has to start comprehending the cultivation technique of the Innate Realm, what if his brain can't keep up, wouldn't that be counterproductive?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself, deciding to wait a while, not until Xu Yan has cultivated the Qi and Blood Realm to perfection, at least he should have comprehended the four cultivation technique formulas.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if my foolish disciple has made any progress now? The four cultivation technique formulas I edited are still a bit too broad and not profound enough, I need to edit them to be more profound next time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan summarized his experience, and the next time he edited the cultivation technique formulas, he needed to make them more profound, with a stronger artistic conception, and also be able to connect with the cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't be too broad.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would be difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

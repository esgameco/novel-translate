        <h1>Chapter 25</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 25: I was just making it up, how did you actually succeed in cultivating?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's internal qi and blood were circulating, merging and integrating, consolidating into one. The gate of the martial dao had already opened, and at this moment, he was about to step into it.</p><p></p><p>After a night of cultivation and enlightenment, he finally understood how to merge and integrate, how to consolidate into one.</p><p></p><p>The three basic stages of refining the skin, refining the bones, and refining the organs had been tempered and completed, but that did not mean he had already stepped into the gate of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Only when the three were integrated, consolidated into one, and the physical body underwent transformation, with the qi and blood becoming round and unified, igniting the external, blazing like a fierce gale, would he have truly entered the threshold of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"This is the integration and consolidation, the condensation into one. I feel myself ascending, becoming stronger."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently contemplated his own transformation, his qi and blood becoming increasingly fierce and powerful, condensing and solidifying, extending outward for several zhang, refining into a fierce gale.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, a dull sound resonated within his body, and after the first sound, the sounds kept coming incessantly.</p><p></p><p>The tendons and bones trembled, emitting thunderous sounds, and with each tremor, the qi and blood would surge violently, surging and roaring, further triggering the tendons and bones to emit even louder sounds.</p><p></p><p>"Trembling tendons and bones, this is the trembling of tendons and bones!</p><p></p><p>"I'm finally about to step into the gate of the martial dao!</p><p></p><p>"Trembling tendons and bones, qi and blood like a fierce gale, it has been achieved!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited. After such a long period of arduous cultivation, on this day, he was finally about to step into the gate of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>With each trembling of the tendons and bones, the qi and blood would surge, the physical body becoming stronger, the strength soaring, and his control over himself continuously improving.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood gale also became more and more fierce.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The sky had already turned white, and a night had passed.</p><p></p><p>The sky had a faint layer of dark clouds, obscuring the sun.</p><p></p><p>In the small mountain village, a thunderous sound suddenly rang out, sounding urgent, one after another, each louder than the last.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan got up and washed up, suddenly hearing the thunderous sound.</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, he looked up: "Is it thundering? Is it going to rain?"</p><p></p><p>He walked out of the house, and suddenly his eyes widened, his mouth agape, the entire person dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and rubbed his eyes, then stared wide-eyed again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood in the cultivation area, and at this moment, his tendons and bones were trembling, his qi and blood like a fierce gale, the fierce gale qi enveloping his entire body. Even from a distance, one could feel the powerful force contained within.</p><p></p><p>And the thunderous sound was coming from within Xu Yan's body.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was dumbfounded, the entire person stunned: "I was just making it up, how did you actually succeed in cultivating? What kind of prodigy are you?!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, when Xu Yan insisted on becoming his disciple, he could only make up a cultivation method for the disciple's initiation ceremony, and even set a one-year deadline.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that Xu Yan, with his arduous cultivation, was just a simpleton obsessed with the so-called martial dao.</p><p></p><p>But the result was...</p><p></p><p>The fool was actually himself?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked, his eyes almost popping out. The cultivation method he had made up, Xu Yan actually succeeded in cultivating it. What kind of prodigy was this?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that those who were rejected in marriage were all blessed by fate?</p><p></p><p>Trembling tendons and bones, qi and blood like a fierce gale, weren't these exactly what he had made up?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's tendons and bones were trembling, and the thunderous sound echoed throughout the small mountain village, the fierce gale qi enveloping his entire body, containing a terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"I was just a liar, making it up, and you actually cultivated it? If you cultivated it, what am I going to do?</p><p></p><p>"Continue making things up? </p><p></p><p>"If it's exposed, won't I be punched to death?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was completely numb.</p><p></p><p>This disciple was too much of a prodigy, a prodigy that even frightened him.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a golden light surged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A voice sounded in his mind: "Your disciple has succeeded in cultivating the method you made up, so you can directly achieve the completion of the cultivation method, with your strength increased a hundredfold compared to your current realm!"</p><p></p><p></div></p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, a surge of qi and blood erupted from Li Xuan's body, like a fiery qi and blood flame soaring hundreds of feet into the sky.</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuan's mind, the cultivation process and methods of refining skin, refining bones, and refining organs appeared. His entire body had a pure and flawless jade-like quality, with spiritual rhythms flowing, and his qi and blood were like raging tides, boundless like the great sea.</p><p></p><p>This was the scene Li Xuan had described when his cultivation reached the great accomplishment stage - the qi and blood soaring hundreds of feet into the sky, blazing like flames.</p><p></p><p>"The golden finger has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>What delighted him even more was that his entire body had a flawless jade-like quality, with spiritual rhythms flowing. </p><p></p><p>This was exactly what he had fabricated - the realm of flawless jade that would never change through the ages.</p><p></p><p>"That disciple Xu Yan is too monstrous, not only has he succeeded in cultivation, but he has even refined a jade-like body!"</p><p></p><p>"It's happened, it's happened, this monstrous disciple must be properly utilized. Whether I can become invincible depends entirely on him!"</p><p></p><p>"It's over! If I had known he would be so monstrous, I should have fabricated immortal cultivation methods instead."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly felt a bit regretful.</p><p></p><p>If he had known his disciple would be so monstrous, he would not have fabricated martial arts cultivation methods, but rather fabricated immortal cultivation methods instead.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I left room for adjustment. This is just the entry-level realm of the martial path. I can continue to fabricate, making it bigger and stronger. I must carefully ponder the cultivation realms that come next, and not truly fabricate them."</p><p></p><p>"What is this golden finger of mine? Is my disciple's successful cultivation related to it?"</p><p></p><p>The golden light in his mind had already disappeared, as if it had never existed.</p><p></p><p>No matter how Li Xuan called out or searched for it, there was no trace of it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, this disciple of his, was definitely monstrous. If he was not monstrous, how could he have succeeded in cultivation and even refined a jade-like body?</p><p></p><p>As for whether his successful cultivation was related to Li Xuan's golden finger, Li Xuan was not entirely certain. But regardless, whether he could continue to grow stronger would now depend on this disciple Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had just entered the martial path, while Li Xuan had directly reached the great accomplishment of the cultivation method, with a strength a hundred times that of those at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>This hundred times stronger than those at the same realm meant a hundred times stronger than the great accomplishment of the cultivation method!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was relieved that he had not set the fabricated cultivation method too low. And this was just the entry-level realm, he was currently only at the great accomplishment of the entry-level realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation method he had fabricated only had the basic realms of refining skin, refining bones, and refining organs, as well as the martial path entry-level.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down, calm down, don't get excited, stay steady!</p><p></p><p>"I am a hidden supreme expert, I can't panic!</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple is coming, continue to deceive him, let him know the greatness of his master.</p><p></p><p>"Let him know that the martial path is limitless, and he must continue to cultivate arduously...</p><p></p><p>"Don't let him think about women, make him focus on comprehending the martial path, I must persuade him hard..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's tendons and bones thundered, his qi and blood were like a fierce gale. He had finally stepped into the martial path.</p><p></p><p>He had an excited expression on his face, feeling his own strength, feeling the blazing qi and blood aura, like raging flames that could incinerate grass and trees.</p><p></p><p>"This is the martial path!</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have finally stepped into the martial path, finally able to become my master's disciple!</p><p></p><p>"Those who mocked me as a fool, just wait and see what a martial arts expert is!"</p><p></p><p>The excited, thrilled Xu Yan, who was filled with infinite longing for the martial path, suddenly felt a terrifying aura rise up. A powerful force, as if it could destroy the heavens and earth, soared into the sky.</p><p></p><p>He looked up, completely dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>That terrifying qi and blood, soaring hundreds of feet into the sky, blazing like flames, as if it could boil the rivers and seas - compared to his master's qi and blood, his own was like a small stream before the vast ocean.</p>

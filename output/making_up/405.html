        <h1>Chapter 405</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When fellow disciples reunite, it's natural to recount their experiences.</p><p></p><p>"How dare the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows attempt to assassinate my junior brother! One day we will destroy them!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"So that force is called the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows. When my strength breaks through, it will be time for revenge against them!" Meng Chong said angrily, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, how is your training of the Small Heavenly Eye going?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Still lacking a bit," Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Small Heavenly Eye was too profound. Although he was just a tiny bit away from comprehending it, that tiny bit seemed like an insurmountable hurdle. Moreover, since arriving in the Nine Mountains Realm, he had been constantly evading assassination attempts by the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows, with no free time to calm his mind and carefully contemplate.</p><p></p><p>"I have some Blood Heart Fruits here that can aid in comprehending techniques. Junior brother can take them to comprehend the Small Heavenly Eye. You should be able to break through," Xu Yan said, taking out three Blood Heart Fruits. </p><p></p><p>After explaining the miraculous effects of the Blood Heart Fruits, he added, "Junior brother, if you have any divine abilities you want to cultivate, you can use these to comprehend them as well."</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, senior brother!" Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>With the Blood Heart Fruits, he was confident he could comprehend the Small Heavenly Eye. As for divine abilities, Meng Chong also had some he needed to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability Heaven's Will Stabilizes the Spirit was not within Meng Chong's cultivation scope, as he was a physical body martial artist, and this type of divine ability was not his forte.</p><p></p><p>Next, they set up a concealment formation. Meng Chong took the Blood Heart Fruits to comprehend the Small Heavenly Eye and cultivate divine abilities, as well as accumulate his foundation in preparation for breaking through.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he also began to organize his martial dao, but did not take the Seven Wonders Divine Flower. After all, once he took it, he would need to go into seclusion for a period of time to gain insights. </p><p></p><p>Currently, Meng Chong needed to comprehend techniques and break through realms. Even with the concealment formation, there was still a chance of leaking their whereabouts, so Xu Yan needed to protect him.</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't the right time to take the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, Xu Yan wasn't just idly standing guard. He was organizing his martial dao, especially the use of several divine abilities. He was also pondering something he had been considering for a long time - how to utilize the Immutable Qi.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong went into seclusion to cultivate and Xu Yan protected him, the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows who had been pursuing Meng Chong suddenly found that his trail had disappeared. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's whereabouts had also vanished once again.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Wan family was conducting an internal investigation, rooting out infiltrated Earth Shadow members. Once these Earth Shadow members realized they had been exposed, they immediately self-destructed without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>This made the Wan family's powerful experts feel a chill in their hearts. </p><p></p><p>How decisive!</p><p></p><p>They also realized the huge threat posed by the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>They immediately issued a bounty throughout the entire Great Canopy Mountain region, offering rewards for information on the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows, as well as for killing their members.</p><p></p><p>With the Wan family's actions, there was another wave of turmoil within the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heaven Killer in charge of the Great Canopy Mountain branch had a grave expression. Although no Wan family experts had attacked that fake branch, meaning their initial guess was correct - the Wan family had deliberately shown weakness, using Wan Tianlin as bait to lure them out - the Wan family's actions made him realize there was a traitor within the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how would the Wan family know the name "Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows"?</p><p></p><p>In the cave, the Five-Leaf Heaven Killer swept his cold gaze over everyone present and said in a deep voice, "Why has a traitor appeared in the Great Canopy Mountain region? You are all from this area. From now on, all missions must be reassigned. We must root out the traitor!"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows members now had solemn expressions. A traitor had appeared internally?</p><p></p><p>They were all willing to sacrifice themselves to restore the glory of heaven and earth, so why would someone betray them? Why would someone's faith waver?</p><p></p><p>"Sir, all Earth Shadows are cultivated from childhood. Every member is carefully selected and nurtured, with firm beliefs. They shouldn't betray us..." one person said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heaven Killer was silent for a moment. All members of the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows organization were cultivated from childhood, including himself who was nurtured by an old Heaven Killer. Their faith was solid, and there had never been betrayals or doubts about the great mission of the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>To restore the glory of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>But why had someone now abandoned their faith and betrayed them?</p><p></p><p>"Some people's faith has wavered. They think it's impossible to restore the glory of heaven and earth, so they betrayed us for their own selfish interests. That's because they are short-sighted and don't know the plans of the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Now, the time has come. The mission to restore the glory of heaven and earth will be fully advanced, not just in the Nine Mountains Realm..."</p><p></p><p>As the Five-Leaf Heaven Killer spoke solemnly, a hint of madness appeared in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Have the people infiltrated in various forces prepare to assassinate important figures and instigate conflicts. Also prepare to enter the Heavenly Cave in the guise of Nine Mountains Realm forces to discuss some cooperation matters.</p><p></p><p>"Lastly, prepare to organize manpower to occupy the realm gates and attack the Qinghua Realm..."</p><p></p><p>The Five-Leaf Heaven Killer began issuing orders.</p><p></p><p>"For this operation, I will report to the Seven-Leaf Heaven Killer and obtain his permission!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows members became excited, their eyes showing a mad glint.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" they responded enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, should we continue pursuing Meng Chong and Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"Kill them! How can we not kill them? We must kill them!" the Five-Leaf Heaven Killer said coldly.</p><p></p><p>At Heng Feng Mountain, Tian Seventeen sat at the head of the great hall.</p><p></p><p>A figure walked in, wearing a mask engraved with seven leaves.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I have returned!" The newcomer bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen nodded. Although he wore a seven-leaf mask, his status far surpassed that of a Seven-Leaf Heaven Killer. He had come to Heng Feng Mountain in the Nine Mountains Realm only temporarily to take the place of this Seven-Leaf Heaven Killer.</p><p></p><p>He had another purpose - to come for the Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?" Tian Seventeen asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"In reply to sir, everything went smoothly. The Netherworld Prison and Demon Witches have reached an understanding. The chaos in the Divine Realm can begin."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke the last part, this Seven-Leaf Heaven Killer's eyes were filled with fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Tian Seventeen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, the Five-Leaf branch wants to take some actions..." </p><p></p><p>He relayed the Five-Leaf Heaven Killer's plans.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen nodded and said, "The time has come. Let them do as they wish. We're not afraid of revealing the name of the Heaven Killers and Earth Shadows anymore. It's about time for us to appear in the world."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" The Seven-Leaf Heaven Killer was excited.</p><p></p><p>"You continue to oversee things here."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>After giving his instructions, Tian Seventeen took a step and instantly vanished.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen arrived at Spirit Veneration Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"You've come!" </p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger sat on a dazzling golden throne, wearing a large gold chain with 36 glittering gemstones around its neck, exuding the aura of a nouveau riche.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen</p><p></p><p>Here's the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Blinking his eyes, he looked back and surveyed his surroundings. This was Lingzun Mountain, the home of the Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't come to the wrong place.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Wind Spirit Tiger?" Tian Seventeen asked with a bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>It hadn't been that long since he last saw the Wind Spirit Tiger. Back then, it was lying on the ground, just a powerful spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>But now, upon seeing it, the Wind Spirit Tiger had completely changed. Not only was it sitting on a golden, glittering throne, but it was also wearing a large gold chain.</p><p></p><p>Even more absurd was the tiger-headed golden staff it held in its paw.</p><p></p><p>It looked like both a nouveau riche and much more imposing.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The Wind Spirit Tiger struck the ground with its golden staff, causing the entire earth to shake. It said majestically, "Tian Seventeen, how can you be so lacking in manners? You should address me as Lord Wind Spirit King!"</p><p></p><p>Damn! Tian Seventeen was completely taken aback. He looked at the Wind Spirit Tiger suspiciously, wondering if this old tiger had gone mad from trying to break through its bloodline shackles.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger tapped the ground with its golden staff, a look of disappointment on its face. "Why are you just like the Lingzun Sect Master, not understanding any etiquette? Well, considering our acquaintance, I'll give you a book of etiquette."</p><p></p><p>With a wave of its paw, a serving spirit beast immediately brought a small booklet to Tian Seventeen.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was furious inside. To be looked down upon for not understanding etiquette by a spirit beast? If not for the Wind Spirit Tiger's powerful strength, he would have been tempted to slap the spirit beast bringing the booklet to death.</p><p></p><p>"No need!" Tian Seventeen's face beneath his mask was extremely unpleasant.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger shook its head and sighed, "Tian Seventeen, you don't appreciate a good tiger's intentions. You'll suffer for it sooner or later..."</p><p></p><p>Damn! Tian Seventeen's mouth twitched. How had the Wind Spirit Tiger become so nagging after not seeing it for a while?</p><p></p><p>"Wind..." Just as he was about to interrupt the Wind Spirit Tiger's nagging and get straight to the point of his visit, he saw a striped fierce tiger wearing a long saber at its waist, walking towards them in a human-like manner.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, do we have a visitor?" Red Cat, hearing the commotion, immediately rushed over.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger's guests were naturally all Immortal Venerable level powerhouses, definitely worth meeting.</p><p></p><p>"My dear brother, you're here. This is Tian Seventeen, we've met a few times..." The Wind Spirit Tiger said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Ever since his dear brother Red Cat had arrived, he had truly started living the life of a king of spirit beasts, fully displaying the reverence due to the Wind Spirit Tiger King.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat sized up Tian Seventeen. This guy didn't look like a good person at all.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen also examined Red Cat. Where had this spirit tiger come from? Could the Wind Spirit Tiger's changes be related to it?</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, have you considered it?" Tian Seventeen asked directly.</p><p></p><p>"This king has thought it through. What about the benefits? The advantages? You can't just make empty promises. You need to offer real benefits, real advantages."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, wouldn't this king just be running errands for you?" The Wind Spirit Tiger said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat listened silently, starting to calculate in his heart. This Tian Seventeen was clearly seeking cooperation with the Wind Spirit Tiger for something, and obviously, the Wind Spirit Tiger was interested and had thoughts of cooperating.</p><p></p><p>However, because of some ideas that had been instilled in him recently, his attitude had changed. He didn't immediately agree but was weighing the pros and cons.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's gaze sharpened as he looked at the serving spirit beasts around the Wind Spirit Tiger, not continuing to speak.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger waved its paw, and the serving spirit beasts immediately left, retreating from the ancient forest.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen looked at Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>"My dear brother is my confidant and can represent me, the Wind Spirit King. There are no secrets he cannot know," the Wind Spirit Tiger said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen nodded and said, "As I said, with the turmoil in the divine realm and the unification of heaven and earth, you, Wind Spirit Tiger, can also advance further, breaking through your bloodline shackles. This is a tangible benefit."</p><p></p><p>"You only need to take action slightly, stirring up the situation or killing a few people. With your strength, Wind Spirit King, there's no risk to speak of. The benefits outweigh the drawbacks."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Wind Spirit Tiger pondering, Tian Seventeen continued, "If heaven and earth don't unify, you'll have no possibility of advancing further. But after unification, you'll advance further, becoming a true king of spirit beasts. All spirit beasts will have to obey your commands..."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger's eyes moved, seeming somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat remained expressionless but secretly transmitted a message to the Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, don't fall for it. This guy has bad intentions. Let's not even talk about whether the unification of heaven and earth can succeed. Even if it does succeed in the end, the biggest beneficiary definitely won't be you, brother."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, how can he achieve this with just his strength and yours, brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, once you take action, brother, you'll inevitably offend many powerful beings. Although you're not afraid, if this guy fails and pushes all the blame onto you, brother, once you face an encirclement by powerful beings, no matter how strong you are, it'll be hard to resist."</p><p></p><p>"As for breaking through the bloodline shackles, brother, you're already immortal. If you fail, the consequences would be too severe."</p><p></p><p>"Let him reveal some inside information, why he's so certain of success, and ask for some actual treasures. Don't just take his word for it..."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger had 100% trust in Red Cat, and the more he listened, the more reasonable it seemed.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Seventeen, explain some of your background. Otherwise, how can this king believe you can achieve this? For example, how many Immortal Venerables of our level do you have? Are there even beings above the Immortal level involved?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen frowned slightly. When had the Wind Spirit Tiger's mind become so agile?</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, you can rest assured. There will be stronger beings involved. Immortal Venerables of our level will be no fewer than the number of fingers on both hands..." Tian Seventeen thought for a moment and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger pondered, seemingly in thought, but actually listening to Red Cat's advice.</p><p></p><p>"What organization are you? Since we're cooperating, how can you be so secretive and hide things? Moreover, I want to see your strength, see your actions, see the results of your actions."</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, if your strength is too weak and I foolishly get involved, wouldn't I just become a pawn? For cooperation, there naturally need to be conditions. If I take action, how will you reward me? We should discuss this. Don't just talk about the benefit of breaking through bloodline shackles after heaven and earth unify."</p><p></p><p>"Whether heaven and earth can unify is still unknown. Even if they do unify, those who can break through bloodline shackles won't be limited to just me. So, immediate benefits cannot be lacking!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was surprised. When had the Wind Spirit Tiger become so shrewd? He unconsciously looked at the striped tiger.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Tian Seventeen, this king was merely hiding his abilities before. Do you really think this king has lived for such a long time and can't see through your intentions?" The Wind Spirit Tiger snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't admit that he was foolish before! Tian Seventeen thought about it and found some logic in it. This Wind Spirit Tiger was immensely powerful, one of the Twelve Spirit Beast Kings. How could it really be so foolish?</p><p></p><p>"We of the Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow are naturally powerful. It's no exaggeration to say that we don't take the strength of the entire Nine Mountains realm seriously."</p><p></p><p>"Since you, Wind Spirit Tiger, want to witness the strength of our Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, then watch. Our Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow will soon take action..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen revealed some of the upcoming actions of Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

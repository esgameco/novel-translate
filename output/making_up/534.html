        <h1>Chapter 534</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dao Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Taihe and Taikun's minds began to reel. What kind of being was this?</p><p></p><p>However, when Taimiao instructed the two to seek treatment for their injuries from Su Lingxiu, they couldn't help but feel a glimmer of hope. </p><p></p><p>If the wounds on their bodies could be healed, they would no longer need to constantly suppress themselves and endure the pain of erosion.</p><p></p><p>But then they recalled Su Lingxiu's excited expression earlier as she clamored about dissecting Mu Xie, and felt uneasy. Would that girl dissect them too?</p><p></p><p>Taimiao seemed to sense their concerns and said, "Don't worry, that girl is kind-hearted. She won't take your lives. To heal the wounds on your bodies, some sacrifice is necessary, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Then he looked towards a certain area of the Unchanging Realm, his gaze turning cold as he said in a deep voice, "With the Dao Ancestor in this world, the schemes of the Unchanging Divine Palace are destined to fail."</p><p></p><p>Taihe and Taikun nodded. </p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor's strength was beyond imagination, enough to protect this world.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then!" Taihe nodded.</p><p></p><p>If the world could be protected, his disciple wouldn't have to take the path of exile.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's form appeared and looked at the two of them, saying with a pout, "You two old fogies, it's really rare that you're still alive. If you want to advance further, you'd better comprehend my Heavenly Dao well."</p><p></p><p>"What's the deal with your Heavenly Dao?" Taimiao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Taimiao, you little woman, I'm not telling you!" Tianzi said with a haughty expression.</p><p></p><p>Taimiao glared at him in exasperation, "Why are you so petty? Big Brother Taicang is gone now, are you still holding a grudge over what happened back then? I gave you so many delicious treats and fun things back then, have you completely forgotten?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi scratched his head, "Fine, I, the great Tianzi, am magnanimous. I won't quibble with you, little woman."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he said proudly: "The Heavenly Dao is the great way of heaven and earth. Only a world with the Heavenly Dao is a perfect world. This is what the Dao Ancestor taught me.</p><p></p><p>"My Heavenly Dao can be enhanced without limit. As you cultivate and comprehend the Heavenly Dao, you can also become stronger along with it. As old acquaintances, I can give you some preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>"However, this is preferential treatment I'm giving you, not bestowed by the Heavenly Dao itself. The Heavenly Dao is supremely impartial and beyond question.</p><p></p><p>"As the Heavenly Dao grows stronger, you will grow stronger too. As more and more powerful beings emerge in this world, the world itself will continuously expand and strengthen..."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Taimiao and the others were shocked.</p><p></p><p>If what Tianzi said was true, wouldn't the Heavenly Dao keep getting stronger, and the world keep expanding and strengthening? And their path of cultivation would be nearly endless?</p><p></p><p>The stronger the Heavenly Dao, the stronger the world, the stronger they would become.</p><p></p><p>And they, being at the pinnacle of power in this world, would continue to remain at the pinnacle in the future. Given enough time, surpassing Taicang in strength may not be impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Can it really be enhanced infinitely?" Taihe asked in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Theoretically, yes. Perhaps it will stop increasing only after the entire Unchanging Realm has been transformed into our world?</p><p></p><p>"But who knows, the Unchanging Realm seems boundless. When that time comes, we can ask the Dao Ancestor for guidance again." Tianzi shrugged.</p><p></p><p>The entire Unchanging Realm transformed into their world?</p><p></p><p>Taihe and the others couldn't imagine it. Before this world came into being, they had all traveled the Unchanging Realm with Taicang.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Realm seemed boundless. Even after eons of travel, they had not left the Unchanging Realm. In fact, they felt that despite their lengthy travels, they had only moved about in a small area of the Unchanging Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, where did the Unchanging Divine Palace come from? It must have come from beyond all the areas of the Unchanging Realm they had traveled.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Unchanging Divine Palace, whether there were other powerful beings or forces in the Unchanging Realm, or even other worlds, was unknown.</p><p></p><p>That beam of world-creating purple light may not have been the first in the history of the Unchanging Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, we'll ride on your coattails, Tianzi, to comprehend the Heavenly Dao, break through our limits, and increase our strength. Of course, that's assuming we truly have a chance to recover," Taikun nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, you've endured for so long without dying. With Lingxiu's help, it'll just take some time to heal you," Tianzi said before happily walking away.</p><p></p><p>Taihe and Taikun were very powerful. If they comprehended and cultivated the Heavenly Dao, it could bring faster enhancement to the Heavenly Dao. After all, these two had followed Taicang for a long time, their knowledge far surpassed others, and their experience was broader.</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard of the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his teacup and drank leisurely, one hand playing with a jade ruyi scepter, relaxed and content.</p><p></p><p>Cai Linger stood gracefully to the side serving him, her beautiful eyes curiously looking at the figure suddenly brought here.</p><p></p><p>A row of bone spikes stood on its head, its eyebrows were curved and long, its eyes wide open with a faint green tinge. It seemed to be wearing a black leather outfit that looked smooth and shiny.</p><p></p><p>But that wasn't a leather outfit it was wearing. Rather, this being's skin was naturally like that.</p><p></p><p>This was an ugly humanoid creature, and it came from the Unchanging Realm, not any race or being from within this world.</p><p></p><p>Cai Linger had just witnessed the Dao Ancestor take action, reaching up to grab, and immediately bringing this creature down.</p><p></p><p>A creature grabbed by the Dao Ancestor must be very powerful. Although the Dao Ancestor's action seemed casual and effortless, this creature's strength must have already surpassed the Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>A World Lord level powerhouse! Cai Linger was shocked. Even a World Lord level powerhouse was casually grabbed by the Dao Ancestor. The Dao Ancestor's strength was truly unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>And how fortunate she was, what a great opportunity, to be able to become the Dao Ancestor's maid!</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie felt a bit dazed. Held by a hand, in an instant, he had arrived in this small courtyard. The gray energy surrounding his body had disappeared, revealing his true form.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that his powerful strength seemed to have vanished, and he couldn't sense even a trace of it.</p><p></p><p>However, he could still feel his own power, which meant his strength had only been sealed.</p><p></p><p>How the other party had sealed his strength, he couldn't perceive even a hint!</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard was ordinary. Under a large tree, a young man sat leisurely in a chair, contentedly drinking tea and enjoying pastries.</p><p></p><p>A stunningly beautiful woman stood by his side serving him, his maid.</p><p></p><p>But the young man looked ordinary, without any aura of a powerful being, as if he were just a common person, a young master from a wealthy family leisurely enjoying his maid's service.</p><p></p><p>That beautiful woman did have some strength, but not much. He could kill her with just a breath.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie stared wide-eyed at the young man. He knew that the one who had taken action must be the young man sitting casually in the chair.</p><p></p><p>The more ordinary he appeared, the more it indicated that the other party's strength was immensely powerful, already beyond his perception.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Mu Xie finally couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>The young...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he was not Taicang, he was within Taicang's realm. Could he be Taicang's successor? How could Taicang's successor surpass Taicang in such a short time? This was hard for him to believe.</p><p></p><p>Not much time had passed since the great battle and Taicang's fall.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Mu Xiao knew that what he considered "not much time" was relative to his own long lifespan and the long ages since Taicang created this realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party had started cultivating before Taicang's fall, to have surpassed Taicang after only one-thousandth of Taicang's time was simply inconceivable. </p><p></p><p>How could such a monstrous talent exist in this world?</p><p></p><p>Taicang was already incredibly talented, but it had taken him a very long time to reach this level of power.</p><p></p><p>Just as Mu Xiao finished speaking, he saw a figure he had overlooked earlier jump out from beside a large tree, angrily rebuking him: "How dare you! In the presence of the Ancestor of the Dao, why aren't you kneeling and kowtowing?"</p><p></p><p>Ancestor of the Dao?! Mu Xiao's mind buzzed. Although it was the first time he had heard this title, he felt it referred to an unfathomably profound being of such high cultivation and immense power that he wasn't even worthy of looking up to. As his heart trembled in shock, he stared at the young man with widened eyes.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, what did he see! A mysterious radiance flickered around the young man's body. Behind him seemed to be a scene of primordial wilderness from ancient times, before the emergence of the ages, indistinct in the primordial chaos. It was as if he existed before time itself, outside of the undifferentiated chaos.</p><p></p><p>What kind of being was this?</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao's heart shook violently, his legs even trembling slightly. Even that one from the Unformed Divine Palace was far inferior to the young man before him.</p><p></p><p>Ancestor of the Dao!!!</p><p></p><p>This title resounded in his mind, as feelings of awe and an irresistible sense of submission slowly grew and expanded within him.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was beside himself with excitement. Finally it was his turn to show off a bit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the other party was a powerful being at the level of a Lord of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>He strode over, raised his hand and pressed down. With a thud, he forced Mu Xiao to kneel prostrate on the ground, angrily rebuking: "To meet the Ancestor of the Dao is an incredible stroke of fortune. How dare you be disrespectful! Kneel properly and await the Ancestor's judgment!"</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Feng Yan pulled out a whip, standing beside Mu Xiao like an executioner ready to carry out punishment at any moment. If Mu Xiao showed any disrespectful behavior, he would immediately lash him with the whip!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a surge of violent rage welled up in Mu Xiao's heart. The green light in his eyes grew stronger and stronger, his breathing gradually becoming heavier. His already fierce face looked increasingly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>To be forced to kneel on the ground by what he considered an ant?!</p><p></p><p>A frenzied murderous intent grew wildly as Mu Xiao raised his head, his green eyes looking towards Feng Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a light "hmm" sounded like a thunderclap exploding in his mind. In an instant, the violent rage and frenzied killing intent all vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao was shocked. He suddenly looked towards the young man sitting in the chair.</p><p></p><p>"Born in chaos, wandering in the unformed, without comprehension of heaven and earth. Violent rage fills your mind. Though possessing intelligence, you remain uncivilized and untamed, having never received proper guidance. From now on, you shall remain here sweeping the ground and carrying water, to dispel your violent nature, abandon your savagery, and listen to teachings."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze fell upon him as he slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>As the Ancestor of the Dao, constantly fighting and killing would damage his image. So when it was time to "educate", he needed to "educate" these uncivilized savages!</p><p></p><p>Whack! Feng Yan lashed down with his whip, saying sternly: "Hurry and kowtow to thank the Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>On one hand, Mu Xiao was shocked by the Ancestor's power, unable to summon any resistance or anger. Yet he also hated this ant Feng Yan for daring to use the Ancestor's authority to humiliate him!</p><p></p><p>"Truly savage and uneducated. The Ancestor has shown you such great kindness, yet you don't know gratitude. How terribly impolite!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan glared back angrily, swinging his whip to lash down again.</p><p></p><p>"Kowtow and thank the Ancestor, then take up a broom. Calm your mind and sweep the ground - sweep away the violence in your heart as well!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao was furious.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly tried to jump up to fight Feng Yan to the death.</p><p></p><p>However, he felt as if a massive mountain was pressing down on his body, making it impossible to rise.</p><p></p><p>Whack whack whack! Feng Yan lashed him several times in succession, his face full of exasperation as he said: "You unteachable fool! The Ancestor is doing this for your own good, leaving you with such a great opportunity. Yet you don't know gratitude?</p><p></p><p>"Truly stupid and unteachable, only knowing how to fight and kill. You think I'm whipping you to bully you, but I'm doing this for your own good too!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao continued glaring at him angrily. This was going too far - to whip him and dare to say it was for his own good?</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and the others who had just returned all wore strange expressions. Why did these words seem so familiar? Unconsciously, they glanced towards Red Cat nearby.</p><p></p><p>Once upon a time, Stone Two had said similar things to Red Cat...</p><p></p><p>After hanging around Stone Two for so long, Feng Yan had picked up some of his habits.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed as she came up behind her master, massaging his shoulders while looking at Mu Xiao who was being scolded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, that's a powerful being at the level of a Lord of Heaven and Earth. Moreover, he's a creature from the Unformed Realm with intelligence - very rare. I'd like to dissect him and study him a bit. What do you think?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Li Xuan's mouth twitched. This girl Su Lingxiu wanted to dissect any new and interesting creature she saw. This habit had been picked up when he first instructed her to dissect living corpses of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao, who had been glaring angrily at Feng Yan with bared teeth, was suddenly terrified. He looked in shock at Su Lingxiu, who was acting coquettishly and trying to curry favor. It was hard to imagine such a gentle and beautiful young woman saying such brutal things.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan sighed beside him: "Now do you understand I was doing this for your own good? If you had kowtowed gratefully earlier, I would have taken you down and given you a broom to sweep. None of this would have happened!"</p><p></p><p>Of course, even if Mu Xiao had obediently swept the ground, he still wouldn't have avoided being dissected.</p><p></p><p>But this cruel truth could not be told to Mu Xiao. Right now the goal was to make Mu Xiao realize that Feng Yan really had been acting for his benefit earlier!</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao was panicking now. He looked at Feng Yan, and at one point actually felt that this ant who had been whipping him seemed to truly have his best interests in mind?</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu massaged her master's shoulders. "Don't worry, Master. I'll just dissect and study him a bit, I won't kill him. He's so powerful with such strong life force, he won't die.</p><p></p><p>"My dissection skills are very advanced now. I can absolutely guarantee there won't be any accidents. He'll still be able to continue receiving your teachings, Master."</p><p></p><p>The more Mu Xiao heard, the more his heart pounded in fear. Dissected but not dead? </p><p></p><p>Did that mean he would be wide awake as he was cut open and poked and prodded?</p><p></p><p>Just imagining it made Mu Xiao's whole body tremble involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"If you're going to kill me, then kill me! To humiliate me like this is unbecoming of a powerful being!" </p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao shouted angrily, not realizing his voice was shaking slightly as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

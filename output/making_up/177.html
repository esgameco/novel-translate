        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Battle of Canglan Island concluded with Xu Yan's powerful slaughter of three peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Sword God Xu Yan has truly risen in the inner realm, earning him the title of the top genius of the current generation, which he rightfully deserves.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, he directly used his formidable physical strength to crush the peak grand masters, also shaking the inner realm with his name.</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful cultivators did not linger and departed one after another.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao reluctantly left.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian and the old man also returned to the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu's strength is truly the best of the current generation," Xie Lingfeng sighed sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, I have just entered the martial dao," Xu Yan modestly replied.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, young friend, what sword technique is this?" Hu Hai asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This is my father, Hu Hai!" Hu Shan hastily introduced.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became serious and said, "You misunderstand, this is not a sword technique, but the Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai was stunned, suddenly recalling that Xie Lingfeng had previously said he had not yet entered the Sword Dao, and upon recalling Xu Yan's terrifying sword strike, it was completely different from all sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>In fact, there was no trace of any sword technique at all.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" he nodded thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island was not destroyed, and the buildings remained intact. Xu Yan and the others temporarily stayed there.</p><p></p><p>This battle brought Xu Yan some gains, allowing him to further refine and perfect his Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was the same, the fierce battle made him truly realize the essence of physical martial dao and how to unleash its formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also refining himself, Xu Yan's Sword Dao gave him some ideas.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to take the opportunity to ask Xu Yan for guidance on the Sword Dao, especially how to achieve sword heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>In addition to refining himself, Xu Yan was also waiting for the arrival of the remaining powerful cultivators of the Black-Robed Man, as well as the other grand sects of the Demon Cult.</p><p></p><p>During the Battle of Canglan Island, which had attracted the attention of many powerful cultivators, the Longevity Pavilion's Essence Qi Pill had already begun to be sold, spreading among the grand master cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Initially, each Essence Qi Pill was sold for 10,000 spirit crystals, with a copy of the Great Wilderness Chronicles as a bonus.</p><p></p><p>Since the pills were being sold by the reputable Tianbo Hall, although the price of 10,000 spirit crystals per pill was high, the cultivation effect was excellent, surpassing the effects of consuming spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if one's consumption became too great, it could be quickly replenished.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, as soon as they were released, cultivators rushed to purchase them. Although most only bought one to try, the sales volume was still not low, with the first batch of pills completely sold out.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qing was one of the three grand masters of the Small Forest City in the Great Yue Kingdom. He was the pillar of the Liang Family, one of the three great families in Small Forest City, but his strength was the weakest among the three grand masters.</p><p></p><p>He was only a grand master at the initial stage, and had been stuck at that level for over 30 years, always being suppressed by the other two families.</p><p></p><p>However, he had one more connection than the other two grand masters - he was close friends with the manager of the Tianbo Hall in Small Forest City.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he learned that the Tianbo Hall was selling a new medicine called the Essence Qi Pill, which was said to be able to assist cultivation and even help grand master cultivators break through their bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>Each pill was sold for 10,000 spirit crystals, which was quite expensive. In Small Forest City, 10,000 spirit crystals was almost the annual income of a middle-class family.</p><p></p><p>Although the Liang Family was not weak, 10,000 spirit crystals was also nearly a month's income for them. Fortunately, Liang Qing was a grand master cultivator, and the Liang Family had some foundations.</p><p></p><p>So he gritted his teeth and bought three Essence Qi Pills in total.</p><p></p><p>In the secluded chamber, Liang Qing cultivated after consuming one Essence Qi Pill. He was greatly astonished by the pill's effects - it was too powerful. He felt his bottleneck at the mid-stage grand master realm start to loosen.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed, realizing that the Essence Qi Pill was truly a treasure for grand master cultivation. With the assistance of this pill, his cultivation speed could increase three to five times without any problem.</p><p></p><p>The Essence Qi Pill was originally formulated for pre-Heaven realm cultivators, but inner realm grand master cultivators could also consume it. In fact, the effect on grand master cultivators was even better than on pre-Heaven realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>The reason was that the inner qi of grand masters, while inferior to true qi, could still be greatly enhanced and elevated by the Essence Qi Pill, more so than true qi.</p><p></p><p>After consuming the three Essence Qi Pills, Liang Qing successfully broke through to the mid-stage grand master realm.</p><p></p><p>He was ecstatic, seeing the hope of becoming the number one grand master in Small Forest City. He immediately went to find his friend at the Tianbo Hall, requesting to purchase more Essence Qi Pills.</p><p></p><p>However, the Essence Qi Pills had already been sold out, and he had to wait for the next batch to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Liang Qing was not the only one who had broken through their bottleneck thanks to the Essence Qi Pill. Even those who had not yet broken through could clearly sense the miraculous effects of the pill. As long as they had the Essence Qi Pill to assist their cultivation, reaching the grand master and peak grand master realms no longer seemed so distant.</p><p></p><p>Thus, grand master cultivators from all over flocked to the Tianbo Halls, urgently requesting to purchase the Longevity Pavilion's Essence Qi Pills, while also inquiring about the location of the Longevity Pavilion and the forces behind it, wanting to personally visit and purchase the pills.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming popularity of the Essence Qi Pill was beyond the Tianbo Hall's expectations. Before acting as the agent to sell the pills, they had tried the effects themselves, and while it was stronger than spiritual medicines, they did not anticipate such miraculous effects - increasing cultivation speed three to five times, which was too exaggerated.</p><p></p><p>But with such a hot sale, the Tianbo Hall's upper echelons also naturally recognized the tremendous potential value of the Essence Qi Pill. They immediately gathered together.</p><p></p><p>They had a grand master cultivator consume one Essence Qi Pill on the spot to test the effects.</p><p></p><p>"The effects are indeed not bad, but not as exaggerated as the outside rumors," the grand master said, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Do we still have any of the pills left for sale?" one of the upper-level members suddenly asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No, they're all sold out," the others replied.</p><p></p><p>The Tianbo Hall's upper echelons suddenly realized a problem - could it be that the Essence Qi Pill they had tried was different from the ones being sold?</p><p></p><p>"Go, purchase more Essence Qi Pills from the Longevity Pavilion, the more the better. For now, follow the original agreement."</p><p></p><p>The Tianbo Hall's upper management ordered.</p><p></p><p>The name of the Longevity Pavilion began to spread in the inner realm, and among the grand master cultivators, as well as the major forces, they all started searching everywhere for the Longevity Pavilion, wanting to purchase the Essence Qi Pills.</p><p></p><p>Everyone could see that the Essence Qi Pill could greatly strengthen one's own forces. Whoever obtained more Essence Qi Pills would undoubtedly have an advantage.</p><p></p><p>In Iron Mountain County, the Longevity Pavilion's second alchemy house had begun operations.</p><p></p><p>After the first experience, training the second batch of alchemy disciples was naturally easier and faster. Moreover, they all had a certain foundation in the martial dao, having been selected from the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, his two disciples had shown their might again - Xu Yan had killed three peak grand masters, while Meng Chong had killed one.</p><p></p><p>He had also received feedback from the Golden Finger, further improving his Sword Dao and combat experience, with his physical martial dao also rapidly advancing.</p><p></p><p>He had grasped the essence of physical martial dao combat.</p><p></p><p>Although his realm had not advanced, his strength had increased.</p><p></p><p>The first batch of Essence Qi Pills had been completely sold out, and the Tianbo Hall came to the Longevity Pavilion to purchase more, with the profit distribution following the original agreement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan knew that after the second batch of Essence Qi Pills was sold, the Tianbo Hall would pay more attention to the Longevity Pavilion and would likely try to find a way to incorporate it into the Tianbo Hall.</p><p></p><p>If the Longevity Pavilion did not agree, it might face strong suppression, so he would have to continue observing the situation.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Longevity Pavilion had become famous due to the Essence Qi Pill, even if it broke away from the Tianbo Hall's channel, it would still have no trouble selling the pills. The only concern was whether it would lose the powerful backing of the Tianbo Hall, and whether the various forces in the inner realm might have some ulterior motives, as this was an inevitable result. Even the highly reputable and renowned Tianbo Hall...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Pavilion, it's possible that they will also use some means to force me, all of which are possible.</p><p></p><p>'Sigh, trouble may come knocking on my door, and it will be time for me to take action? I am a supreme expert, so using my power to deal with these weaklings, wouldn't that be beneath my status?'</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he thought so, if Suling Xiu couldn't handle it, he would certainly have to step in.</p><p></p><p>'I hope the ones who come to cause trouble are at least Grand Masters, because Sect Masters are really too weak.' Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He then thought of another issue - the Tianbao Pavilion is so powerful, with branches all over the inner domain, if they could cooperate, it would actually be a very good choice.</p><p></p><p>'Invest in the Tianbao Pavilion? It's worth considering.' Li Xuan muttered to himself, as the commercial道 in the inner domain currently has no concept of shareholding.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion, with its medicinal pills, could invest in the Tianbao Pavilion, and then slowly become the actual controller of the Tianbao Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>'It's not a bad idea.'</p><p></p><p>Of course, the upper echelons of the Tianbao Pavilion are not fools either, if the Changqing Pavilion wants to invest, it must certainly demonstrate sufficient strength.</p><p></p><p>The weak have no right to talk about cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looked at the Tianbao Pavilion manager who came to his door, apologizing sincerely: "I'm sorry, I'm sorry, last time the Nurturing Qi Pill was given incorrectly, and I mistakenly gave you the Small Nurturing Qi Pill."</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion wanted to test the medicinal pills, so Xu Junhe had Suling Xiu specially refine the Small Nurturing Qi Pill, which only had one-fifth the effect of the real Nurturing Qi Pill.</p><p></p><p>This small effect, the Tianbao Pavilion would not be too interested in, and would certainly agree to act as the sales agent, forming an initial cooperation.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the first batch of Nurturing Qi Pills sold out.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual stones flowed in like a torrent.</p><p></p><p>The Nurturing Qi Pill was so popular that it could not be hidden from the Tianbao Pavilion, so Xu Junhe apologized sincerely, directly giving the excuse that the medicinal pill was made incorrectly.</p><p></p><p>This was just a stepping stone.</p><p></p><p>Both sides were tacitly aware, this is the way of commerce.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, where's the problem, mistakes happen in the midst of busy work, it's normal."</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion manager waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Next up was the matter of the second batch of Nurturing Qi Pills.</p><p></p><p>The quantity was much larger than the previous batch, and the Tianbao Pavilion was generous, directly paying the Changqing Pavilion the spiritual stones in advance.</p><p></p><p>The agreement remained unchanged.</p><p></p><p>As for what the Tianbao Pavilion will do next, there is no conclusion yet.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe also felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>He naturally understood that with the Tianbao Pavilion's strength, if they were to target the Changqing Pavilion, the Changqing Pavilion's current strength would be unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>Even if they don't use their powerful strength, just by blocking the medicinal herbs, they can cause the Changqing Pavilion's pill refining output to plummet.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I feel there may be some trouble, such as some powerful experts trying to break in and steal the pill refining secrets."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe frowned as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Since the senior said there's no problem, then there won't be any problems, Xu Junhe took his leave.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was refining pills to prepare for Zhou Ying's breakthrough to the Xiantian Realm, and she was already not far from the small success of the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>The second batch of pills was as popular as ever, but the Tianbao Pavilion did not sell them all, but kept a portion, beginning to research and try to crack the secret of the pills.</p><p></p><p>The major forces in the inner domain began to inquire about the location of the Changqing Pavilion and what kind of power it is.</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglang Island, Xu Yan bid farewell to Meng Chong and Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>No powerful experts came to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also didn't plan to wait any longer, preparing to head to the Seven Star Academy, just as Meng Chong wanted to challenge the Arena and enter the Depository to observe the martial arts secrets.</p><p></p><p>In these days, he had guided Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, and the two of them had all gained harvests, especially Xie Lingfeng, who felt that he had found a path to Sword Heart Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>However, within the Xiantian Realm, he probably could not achieve Sword Heart Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng decided to return to the Sword尊Peak to cultivate in seclusion, and also to observe the Sword尊Peak's depository, in order to further improve himself.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, if you need anything, you can send a message to me."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gave Xu Yan a token, with which he could go to the Sword尊Peak's stronghold and use the flying falcon to send a message to him.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the token, as the Changqing Pavilion's initial entry into the inner domain may face some troubles.</p><p></p><p>"I represent the Sword尊Peak to purchase a batch of medicinal pills from the Changqing Pavilion, and if you need anything, the Sword尊Peak is willing to lend a hand to ward off many troubles."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He naturally knew what the Changqing Pavilion would face in launching its medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the greatest pressure actually comes from the Tianbao Pavilion, this huge behemoth, no one knows how deep its foundations are or how many powerful experts it has.</p><p></p><p>"Good, Brother Xie representing the Sword尊Peak to purchase medicinal pills, a 30% discount!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai was puzzled, what are these medicinal pills? The Sword尊Peak and the Changqing Pavilion behind Xu Yan have reached some cooperation to ward off some troubles for the Changqing Pavilion? The cost is not small.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng is the strongest genius of the Sword尊Peak, and also the only son of the current Sword Master Xie Tianheng, and the next Sword Master of the Sword尊Peak, so he has the qualifications to make these decisions.</p><p></p><p>They parted ways, Xu Yan and Meng Chong set off for the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>As for the treasures of the Fire Devouring Demon尊, they can go search for them after returning from the Seven Star Academy, it's not too late.</p><p></p><p>If the map is fake, naturally it will be in vain, if it's real, the treasures of the Fire Devouring Demon尊are quite hidden, and they cannot be found by others in a short time.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, you and Uncle Hai are responsible for purchasing medicinal pills from the Changqing Pavilion, and also warding off some forces that intend to covet the Changqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master!" Hu Shan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"What are these medicinal pills?" Hu Hai asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"These are Nurturing Qi Pills, Uncle Hai, try them and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng handed him a bottle of Nurturing Qi Pills.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai poured out a pill, his eyes lighting up, realizing that these pills might not be simple.</p><p></p><p>After taking a pill, even though he was a peak Grand Master, he was still shocked.</p><p></p><p>This pill can actually assist cultivation, if a Sect Master cultivator uses it, the speed will certainly increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>And as long as one's talent is not too terrible, with this pill, breaking through the peak of the Sect Master realm seems to be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Those who can enter the Sword尊Peak naturally have good talent.</p><p></p><p>Even if the cultivators who rely on the pills to improve have a bit of instability in their strength, the improvement in realm will certainly bring an increase in overall strength, and after some tempering, their strength may not be truly unstable.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, these medicinal pills are so miraculous!" Hu Hai exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"This is refined by Xu Yan's junior sister, I have a deep friendship with Brother Xu, if you need to refine some special medicinal pills, just prepare the spirit herbs, I think the fifth-grade spirit herbs of our Sword尊Peak should be able to refine into medicinal pills."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said with a smile, then took out the Reviving Pill, saying, "This is the Reviving Pill, even if it's a peak Grand Master who has suffered heavy injuries, as long as there is a breath of life, they can be saved, and it can also repair damaged foundations."</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai's breathing became heavier, his eyes wide open, one look at the Reviving Pill could tell it was extraordinary, he had no doubt about Xie Lingfeng's words.</p><p></p><p>"Medicinal pills are so miraculous!"</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Young Master wants to use the might of the Sword尊Peak to ward off those troubles for the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>It's a bit stuck here... (This chapter ends)"</p>

        <h1>Chapter 301</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The burly man had a look of disbelief on his face. A single medicinal pill could restore the young man who had been crippled? Although it was hard to believe, he still fed the pill into the young man's mouth.</p><p></p><p>In just a few breaths, the young man's breathing stabilized, and color returned to his pale face.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I feel like I'm recovering!" </p><p></p><p>The young man opened his eyes and exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Really, that's wonderful, wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>The burly man was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, esteemed physician, for saving my son's life. May I ask your honorable name so that I may repay this kindness?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng interjected, "This is the Pill Medicinal Immortal Lady Su Lingxiu!"</p><p></p><p>"Pill Medicinal Immortal Lady?" </p><p></p><p>The burly man muttered a few words, then left while carrying the young man and profusely thanking her.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, it seems the Lingzong Sect sent him here. It looks like the Lingzong Sect has set their sights on the Changqing Pavilion, but don't worry, with me, Zhu Xingzheng, here, I won't let the Lingzong Sect's brats cause any trouble!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng thumped his chest proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Those Lingzong fellows, if they dare to cause trouble, they better not blame me. It's been a while since I've buried someone, and my burial techniques are a bit rusty!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu let out a cold laugh. </p><p></p><p>Did they really think she was a soft-hearted and easily bullied person? In the following days, several more severely injured martial artists came, almost all of them with their foundations destroyed, essentially beyond recovery in the Spiritual Realm. Their cultivation levels ranged from Sect Master, Grand Sect Master, Minor Celestial, Greater Celestial, to the strongest, the early Refining Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The Lingzong Sect's probing was obvious, and it was all within her expectations. </p><p></p><p>From the day the Changqing Pavilion was established, they had anticipated these events. Su Lingxiu didn't mind, as long as the treatment fees were sufficient.</p><p></p><p>She even couldn't be bothered to appear in person, letting Yue'er directly provide the medicinal pills for healing.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingzong Sect is really rich!" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er sighed as she looked at the several divine-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingzong Sect's treatment fees have been raised. The stronger the Lingzong Sect, the higher the fees. If they don't like it, they can leave. We don't need to coddle them, we'll just see how we feel about it."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>She didn't reject treating the Lingzong Sect's martial artists, but she needed to make some adjustments to the treatment fees. This way, she could obtain more resources from the Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was no longer concerned about the Lingzong Sect's probing at all, as the Saintly Perception Realm was his foundation.</p><p></p><p>These days, the feedback on Meng Chong and Xu Yan's battles would occasionally appear, and it was always a massive gain. Of course, news about the two of them hadn't come so quickly.</p><p></p><p>After all, the spread of information still required a certain amount of time, especially since Xu Yan and Meng Chong had already left Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan fought against five opponents and emerged victorious. You have obtained the 9th Technique of the Divine Oblivion."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Dao Golden Book came again.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Oblivion had already gathered all nine techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Your Divine Oblivion has been integrated, granting you the Great Saintly Perception Divine Oblivion."</p><p></p><p>Great Saintly Perception! Li Xuan was secretly excited. The power of the Divine Oblivion was undoubtedly formidable, and once the nine techniques were integrated into the Great Saintly Perception, its power would not be weaker than his current saintly perceptions.</p><p></p><p>If the Law of Heaven and Earth was combined with the Divine Oblivion, the power would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has been in many battles, he should have accumulated enough foundation and be about to break through to the Saintly Element Realm, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is close to completing the first stage of the Indestructible Golden Body, he should be close too."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's physical martial dao, with his progress in the great battles, had not been low in terms of the advancement of the Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also only half a step away from completing the Saintly Intent Realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Meng Chong's breakthrough was not far away either.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the Dao Golden Book provided feedback again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has completed the first stage of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body. Your Indestructible Golden Body has reached the second stage of great accomplishment."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt at ease, looking forward to Meng Chong comprehending the third stage of the Indestructible Golden Body, and his physical martial dao also breaking through to the Saintly Perception Realm, anticipating the saintly perceptions of the physical martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"This girl Su Lingxiu should have comprehended the saintly perceptions of the Pill Medicinal Martial Dao by now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Su Lingxiu, full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>With the three martial paths all breaking through to the Saintly Perception Realm, their strength would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao still lacked a bit, but the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao was rather special, its Saintly Perception Realm being different from the other three martial paths.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao is still a bit behind, but he's not slow either. He has comprehended a lot of the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to delve into the 9th page of the Taicangshu while also beginning to ponder the cultivation of the physical martial dao beyond the Saintly Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I also have some insights now. It won't be a problem to put it together, it's just a matter of corresponding to the Saintly Image and Breaking Void. The physical martial dao has its unique aspects, but the realms are roughly the same."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment, and he had some ideas for the subsequent cultivation of the physical martial dao. He could slowly put it together with time.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao Golden Book, he didn't need to worry about it not being powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>That day, Jiao Li brought in more than a dozen injured people, all of them with severe injuries, their foundations nearly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was delighted. The stronger the cultivator, the more severe their injuries, and the more she could gain from treating them.</p><p></p><p>In just a few hours, Su Lingxiu had healed the injuries of all the injured. Of course, their bodies were still weak and needed to rest for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>During the recovery period, taking medicinal pills would help them recover faster, and the medicinal pills required money to purchase.</p><p></p><p>Another batch of lucrative treatment fees was deposited, including high-grade spiritual herbs and some rare materials.</p><p></p><p>As for the precious spiritual herbs needed for the treatment of the Wanshi Alliance's experts, they were all provided by the Wanshi Alliance themselves. Su Lingxiu was increasingly pleased and offered an 80% discount on future treatment fees for the Wanshi Alliance's experts. The Wanshi Alliance's experts were all shocked, amazed by such miraculous pill medicinal arts. They even wanted to recruit Su Lingxiu into the Wanshi Alliance, but were rejected.</p><p></p><p>After their injuries were healed, the Wanshi Alliance's experts set out to return to the main alliance, needing to continue resting for a period of time. </p><p></p><p>Before leaving, they naturally made a large purchase of medicinal pills for injury recovery.</p><p></p><p>"Cai'er, aren't you coming back with me?" </p><p></p><p>Jiao Li looked puzzled at Cai Lingyi.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not going back. I want to stay here and repay Sister Lingxiu for healing my injuries."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi said reluctantly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Jiao Li nodded helplessly. These Sea Spirit Clan experts had been invited to lend their aid, and they wouldn't listen to his orders.</p><p></p><p>Since Cai Lingyi wanted to stay, he couldn't force her to return to the main alliance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Cai Lingyi staying behind was a good thing, as it could help strengthen the relationship with Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>After the Wanshi Alliance's experts left, Zhu Xingzheng shamelessly stayed behind, claiming that the Changqing Pavilion was short-handed and he wanted to stay and help.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi had a premonition that there might be some opportunities for her here.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is a specialty of my Sea Spirit Clan, the Emerald Sea Spirit Pearl Tea. Please have a taste."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi approached Li Xuan respectfully and brewed a pot of tea.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He took a sip of the tea, his eyes slightly brightening. This Emerald Sea Spirit Pearl Tea was quite good, the taste and spiritual energy were even better than the spiritual tea he was currently drinking.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad."</p><p></p><p>He nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi was inwardly delighted. "I'm glad the senior likes it!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Cai Lingér became more diligent in front of Li Xuan, like a maid.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind her, since he had a beautiful woman diligently serving him, and he was quite relaxed and at ease.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Shijie!" </p><p></p><p>Accompanying him was Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and glanced at Yue Changming, sighing inwardly. No wonder he was once the genius of the Wanxing Sect, after being guided by him and given a few diagrams of the Heavenly Earthly Principles, his strength has surged after this period of cultivation and comprehension.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming can now condense a strand of the Heavenly Earthly Principle Qi into his body.</p><p></p><p>This is the Heavenly Earthly Principle Qi, not the Heavenly Earthly Spiritual Mechanism, but a further cultivation after refining the Heavenly Earthly Spiritual Mechanism, condensing the Heavenly Earthly Principle Qi.</p><p></p><p>This has placed Yue Changming at a higher realm, stronger than Jiao Li and Cai Lingér.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er, seeing her grandfather, happily ran over.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér was shocked, the aura Yue Changming gave off was extremely powerful, just like those few in the Wanxing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>A true supreme expert! Yet this supreme expert was respectful towards the master of Suling Xiu, from which she could tell that this senior's strength was absolutely extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>Her choice was right!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's trip this time was to go to the Wanxing Alliance headquarters, to compete with the geniuses of the Alliance and the Lingzong Sect, and to prepare for his future smooth ascension to the position of the Alliance Master, to control the Wanxing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>With his arrival, the Wanxing Alliance will undergo a great leap, especially in information transmission and intelligence transmission, far surpassing the Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>After catching up, Li Xuan called Fang Hao over and pointed out the subsequent cultivation direction of the Qimen Martial Dao, as well as the most important, his ideas about refining the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fang Hao was immediately excited.</p><p></p><p>However, he pondered for a moment and said, "Master, refining the flying ship should not be difficult, but the consumption of flying the flying ship will be considerable, it may not be as easy as a martial artist's flight, and it may not be as easy as riding a spiritual beast."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Fang Hao speechlessly, this disciple's thinking is not right, after refining the flying ship, he still wants to rely on consuming his own true essence to drive the flying ship's flight?</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Crystals!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned, as if a window to the sky had opened, inspiration burst forth in his mind, and he bowed his head in some embarrassment, "It was the disciple's stupidity!"</p><p></p><p>"The Qimen Martial Dao lies in daring to innovate, daring to have ingenious ideas, you must remember this!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan solemnly instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I will remember it in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the things you made for Shen Haishou before had ingenious ideas, don't let the cultivation of the Qimen Martial Dao restrict your own ingenious ideas.</p><p></p><p>"Think more, see more, innovate more, dare to imagine, dare to innovate, not limited to formations, refining tools, restrictions and so on."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to earnestly teach.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go refine it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Refining the flying ship is a laborious task, of course it should be left to the disciple, taking in disciples is for the purpose of serving the master after all.</p><p></p><p>Because he needed to refine the flying ship, Fang Hao could only postpone his trip to the Wanxing Alliance headquarters and started to ponder it in the manor.</p><p></p><p>First, he had to conceptualize the shape and function of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu, upon learning of this, was excited and gave suggestions on the side.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, as for me, your Shijie, I am destined to practice medicine all over the world, having a flying ship would be much more convenient, moving the Changqing Pavilion onto the flying ship, when it's time to travel it will be a flying vehicle, and when it's time to land it will be a manor with a pavilion and tower."</p><p></p><p>Hearing Suling Xiu's words, Fang Hao felt that refining the flying ship would not be easy, and he needed to plan it carefully.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he could really succeed in refining it, it would be a huge harvest for him.</p><p></p><p>"The flying ship that Master sits on naturally cannot be simply refined, the materials required cannot be careless."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had an idea in his mind.</p><p></p><p>So he threw himself wholeheartedly into the grand undertaking of refining the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming also took this opportunity to ask Li Xuan for guidance on the Heavenly Earthly Principles, feeling that his comprehension of the Heavenly Earthly Principles was still too little.</p><p></p><p>The profundity of the Heavenly Earthly Principles, how could it be simply understood? He couldn't help but sigh inwardly, his initial good intention to give Xu Yan a heads-up so that he could flee and hide, ultimately led him to encounter the senior, and gain this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér was pouring tea for Li Xuan, hearing that Yue Changming wanted to ask about the cultivation of the Heavenly Earthly Principles, she was stunned. Has he already reached the level of cultivating the Heavenly Earthly Principles?</p><p></p><p>She hesitated whether she should withdraw, but seeing that Li Xuan did not ask her to withdraw temporarily, she gritted her teeth and stayed, serving a cup of tea and standing by as a maid.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind a little explanation of the Heavenly Earthly Principles, whether Cai Lingér could comprehend it or not, it all depended on her own talent.</p><p></p><p>Encountering a supreme expert, obtaining opportunities is normal.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and drew a ripple in front of him, a seemingly ordinary line, yet it seemed to contain some supreme principle of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"For you, you can focus on the comprehension of a single Heavenly Earthly Principle, once you have mastered one Principle, then comprehend the next Heavenly Earthly Principle.</p><p></p><p>"Each Heavenly Earthly Principle has its own profundity, and what each person comprehends is not exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>"The operation of the Principles, the laws of heaven and earth, each Principle has its own laws, the laws are constant, but not unchanging, the changes are within the laws.</p><p></p><p>"Once you have grasped the laws of a Principle, you will understand its changes; if you first comprehend one of the changes, and then comprehend the next change, in this gradual manner, you will naturally be able to comprehend the laws of a Principle."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earthly Principle that Li Xuan drew in front of him was one of the diagrams of the Heavenly Earthly Principles he had given to Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>He was confident that in the entire Lingyu Realm, or even the entire Taiyang, no one understood the Heavenly Earthly Principles better than him.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming listened respectfully, gaining some enlightenment, observing that Heavenly Earthly Principle, he was greatly excited, truly a supreme expert transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A few casual words had allowed him to suddenly understand and find the direction to comprehend the Heavenly Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for the guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming respectfully bowed and then withdrew to a place to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér was dumbfounded and shocked, the Heavenly Earthly Principle was drawn out just like that? What kind of supreme expert could do this?</p><p></p><p>"Comprehending the Heavenly Earthly Principles is actually so simple?"</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér was both excited and inspired, staying behind was indeed a wise decision.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, the Heavenly Earthly Principle he had drawn disappeared, and he silently sipped his tea.</p><p></p><p>As for how much Cai Lingér could comprehend, it depended on her own talent.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingér bowed and then also went to a place to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

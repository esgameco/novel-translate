        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 85: Thunderous Downpour, Thunderous Vajra</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a few deep breaths to calm himself down and said in a deep voice, "Brother Xu, please continue!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you really want me to continue?" Xu Yan hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!" Xie Lingfeng gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Alright." Xu Yan nodded and continued, "After refining the bones, it's time to refine the organs... With thunderous sinews and bones, and surging qi and blood, one has entered the realm of the martial dao. And I have already reached the peak of the qi and blood realm!"</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan finished speaking, Xie Lingfeng felt like his brain was about to explode, with a buzzing sound and a burning sensation. It was as if his brain was on fire!</p><p></p><p>He panted, his eyes gradually losing focus, beginning to doubt his life.</p><p></p><p>He had cultivated the martial dao since the age of six, and entered the path of the sword at six years old... Everyone praised him as the Sword Sovereign Cliff, the number one genius of the sword dao in a thousand years.</p><p></p><p>He also believed this to be true.</p><p></p><p>Looking at his peers in the inner domain, there were few who could match him.</p><p></p><p>And in the art of the sword, he was the number one among his peers.</p><p></p><p>But upon arriving at the remote frontier, it was as if he had discovered a cruel truth - he had never truly entered the path of the sword.</p><p></p><p>Even the martial dao he had cultivated was a false martial dao!</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan panted heavily, his eyes turning red, and he gritted his teeth, growling, "Don't talk nonsense, I am the inheritor of the Sword Sovereign Cliff, how could it be a false martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not angry, but rather his gaze was filled with pity. It was truly pitiful, that he had cultivated for half a lifetime only to discover that what he had cultivated was a false martial dao.</p><p></p><p>It was understandable that he could not accept this.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but reflect on himself, "Did I speak too bluntly?"</p><p></p><p>He then asked, "Let me ask you, I have reached the peak of the qi and blood realm, which is just the entry level of the martial dao, while you are at the Grandmaster realm, the pinnacle of the martial dao, yet your strength is not as good as mine. Isn't it obvious what is true and what is false?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Hu Shan was at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>One was just at the entry level of the martial dao, the other had already reached the pinnacle, yet the one at the entry level was stronger - the truth or falsehood was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng stood up in a daze, cupping his hands and saying, "Brother Xu, thank you for enlightening me. I wish to be alone for a while, I will come to express my gratitude another day."</p><p></p><p>"Very well, Brother Xie, please go." Xu Yan gave a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan took to the skies and returned to the capital of Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the frontier was originally to slay Blood Heartless, but it turned out that Blood Heartless had already been killed by someone else.</p><p></p><p>There were martial artists in the frontier?</p><p></p><p>But after a round of sparring, they discovered that what they had cultivated was actually a false martial dao?</p><p></p><p>Their view of the martial dao had collapsed!</p><p></p><p>In the capital, it was bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor and his ministers were all waiting for the result of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the two figures returned.</p><p></p><p>They directly went back to the imperial palace residence.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor was overjoyed, "Quick, prepare a generous gift, to express our gratitude to the expert!"</p><p></p><p>He glared at Guo Rongshan provocatively, as if saying, "Just wait and see!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Qi Emperor left, the ministers scattered like they were avoiding a plague, shouting praises to the Emperor's brilliance and swiftly following behind the Qi Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" Guo Yunkai had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er is back!" Guo Rongshan suddenly spoke, his entire demeanor relaxing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, you're alright, how did it go?" Guo Rongshan asked with a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather, don't worry, Xie Lingfeng and the others were cultivating a false martial dao, it's nothing to be concerned about. Xie Lingfeng has already recognized his own inadequacies!" Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan paused, turning to look towards the imperial palace, narrowing his eyes slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Yunkai, issue an order, there will be a grand court meeting tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, father!" Guo Yunkai was also delighted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had won!</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace's side residence, where Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were staying, the two of them sat on a stone bench, staring at each other blankly after returning. Xu Yan's exposition on the martial dao had dealt them a tremendous blow, shattering their view of the martial dao and causing them to doubt their lives.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Xie Lingfeng, the thoughts in his mind kept returning to Xu Yan's discourse on the martial dao, finding it increasingly unfathomable and unreal, his brain burning as he tried to comprehend how such an abstruse martial dao could be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor came running excitedly, followed by the Crown Prince.</p><p></p><p>As for the Third Prince, he had already been neglected.</p><p></p><p>"Experts? Experts?" The Qi Emperor was puzzled, feeling that the two experts didn't seem quite right.</p><p></p><p>His own people were right in front of them, but they didn't react at all.</p><p></p><p>"Experts? You two experts?" He waved his hand in front of Xie Lingfeng's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Get lost!" Xie Lingfeng suddenly grabbed the Qi Emperor's collar and threw him away.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince's face turned pale, and he swallowed hard, hastily scurrying away. Outside the residence, he saw his father angrily getting up, with the help of the Grand Eunuch.</p><p></p><p>"Father!" The Crown Prince hurriedly went to support him.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor had a black expression, angrily saying, "The experts you brought..."</p><p></p><p>"Shh!" The Crown Prince quickly raised his hand, signaling the Qi Emperor to be quiet.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor reluctantly closed his mouth and, with the support of the Grand Eunuch, walked out.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Grand Chancellor has summoned a grand court meeting tomorrow!" A eunuch hurried over and reported.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor heard this and became furious, "That Guo..."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Xu Yan has returned!" The eunuch quickly interrupted.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor swallowed back his words, his face flushed red with anger, gritting his teeth as he said, "Summon the ministers, there will be a grand court meeting tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>How utterly humiliating!</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor was filled with resentment, seeing the Crown Prince beside him, he took a deep breath and kicked the Crown Prince to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You ungrateful son, where did you find those experts? You've made me so angry!"</p><p></p><p>He kicked him a few more times, feeling a bit better, then strode away.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was so angry he almost vomited blood.</p><p></p><p>He cursed inwardly, "That old fool, always taking out his anger on his son, what a useless man!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stayed at the Qi Kingdom's residence, waiting for Xie Lingfeng to come and pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>He was delighted.</p><p></p><p>This trip was not in vain - he had sparred with the masters of the inner domain, gaining new insights into the sword dao, and incidentally let the martial artists of the inner domain know that what they cultivated was a false martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace's side residence, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan sat motionless for a day, their minds in complete disarray, having lost all sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>The collapse of their view of the martial dao had dealt them a tremendous blow.</p><p></p><p>They wanted to deny that what they cultivated was a false martial dao, but when they thought about Xu Yan's discourse on the martial dao, it seemed too abstruse, too unbelievable, completely overshadowing their own martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was just at the entry level of the qi and blood realm, could already contend with them at the Grandmaster realm - the truth or falsehood was apparently quite clear.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor's mood had plummeted from the clouds to the ground that day. He had thought he could re-establish his imperial might, but it was all for naught.</p><p></p><p>The grand court meeting began.</p><p></p><p>The ministers wore fawning smiles, the Grand Chancellor and his deputy bowing and greeting with even more reverence than the Qi Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Qi Kingdom knew that the Qi Emperor was now just a figurehead, with the real power in the hands of the Grand Chancellor, Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Zi entered the main hall, and just as he approached the Third Prince, the Third Prince secretly stuck out his foot and tripped him, causing Zi to stumble and nearly fall.</p><p></p><p>Zi immediately glared angrily at the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, the Crown Prince has failed to conduct himself properly in the court assembly..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan stood up solemnly and said to Qi Emperor with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, the Qi Emperor erupted in fury, "Bring this rebellious son out and give him thirty heavy strokes, punish him severely!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was suddenly shocked and lifted his head: !!!</p><p></p><p>Thirty heavy strokes again?!</p><p></p><p>He cursed inwardly, "That old fool, other than beating his son to vent his anger, what else can he do?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's mouth twitched, and he quietly sat back down. He had originally intended to use this opportunity to completely revoke the Crown Prince's status as heir, and punish him with a month of house arrest, but he never expected the Qi Emperor to be so ruthless as to order thirty heavy strokes directly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the imperial family is merciless!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan sighed inwardly, and throughout the rest of the grand court assembly, various court policies were passed, some officials were demoted, and others were promoted, but the Qi Emperor did not participate in any of it. </p><p></p><p>He only needed to sit above and issue an edict.</p><p></p><p>After the grand court assembly, the state affairs of the Qi Kingdom had been completely controlled by Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>Back in the imperial study, the Qi Emperor was seething with anger.</p><p></p><p>Unable to hold it in, he went to the separate courtyard again to seek an audience with Xie Lingfeng, but was thrown out again.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor almost died of anger!</p><p></p><p>What kind of high-ranking person is this, bullying him so?</p><p></p><p>"Bring that rebellious son out and give him another thirty heavy strokes!" </p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor ordered.</p><p></p><p>The eunuch chamberlain felt saddened for the Crown Prince, and softly said, "Your Majesty, if the Crown Prince is given another thirty heavy strokes, he may not be able to endure it."</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor was silent for a while, then said, "Then wait until he has recovered a bit, and then strike him again!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sat dazed for two days, finally regaining a bit of spirit, and took a deep breath, saying, "Hu Shan, I'm going to visit Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>"Young master, you go ahead, I still want to rest a bit more!" </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan replied wearily.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng ignored him and left the separate courtyard, arriving at the Qi Prince's Mansion to visit Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior Guo!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng greeted Guo Rongshan with a salute.</p><p></p><p>Although the man before him was not a martial artist, he was Xu Yan's grandfather, so the proper etiquette still had to be observed.</p><p></p><p>"It's Young Master Xie, Yan'er has been waiting for you to come, please go on in."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Qi Emperor had invited his sworn brother to stroll in the imperial gardens.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Guo has arrived, please have a seat."</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor greeted him warmly.</p><p></p><p>After some polite exchanges, the Qi Emperor said angrily, "Brother Guo, those two so-called high-ranking individuals have no sense of propriety, disrespect their elders, and have no regard for our Qi Kingdom's court. They must be severely punished!"</p><p></p><p>To actually throw me out directly!</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan hasn't done that.</p><p></p><p>The more the Qi Emperor thought about it, the angrier he became. Since the high-ranking individuals couldn't be dealt with, he might as well just let Xu Yan take care of these two high-ranking individuals to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked puzzled and said, "How could that be? Young Master Xie has been very respectful to me, and has not shown any disrespect to his elders. Who has been spreading rumors and slandering Young Master Xie?"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor: !!!</p><p></p><p>His mental state was somewhat collapsing, do they all think they are above me?</p><p></p><p>He glanced silently at Guo Rongshan, then suddenly gritted his teeth and angrily said, "Treacherous slave, daring to slander the high-ranking individuals and stir up trouble, he deserves to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor was furious, pointing to a eunuch standing by, "Take him away and behead him!"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch was startled and lifted his head, "Your Majesty, please spare me, I didn't..."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch chamberlain quickly covered his mouth, and several other eunuchs hurriedly stepped forward to restrain and drag him away.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's mouth twitched, he felt that the Qi Emperor seemed to have been overly stimulated and his mental state was not very good.</p><p></p><p>"His Majesty is getting old, shouldn't the Crown Prince be enthroned? The young can better withstand the stimulation."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, just a mere thirty heavy strokes would suffice, no need to create more bloodshed."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan persuaded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor grunted in response.</p><p></p><p>This emperor, it's better not to do anything, it's too frustrating!</p><p></p><p>At the An Wang Mansion, the Crown Prince had already given up.</p><p></p><p>He was lying on the bed, with two beautiful ladies attending to him, in a state of just eating and waiting to die.</p><p></p><p>He no longer sought the high-ranking individuals.</p><p></p><p>Before seeking the high-ranking individuals, he had already endured thirty heavy strokes.</p><p></p><p>After seeking them, he still endured thirty heavy strokes, so whether he sought them or not, he would still get beaten, so it's better not to seek them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Crown Prince had completely given up.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County, Li Xuan had returned from the capital city.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for Xie Lingfeng to come visit him, the high-ranking individual.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, he was still contemplating the Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist, and for the time being, there didn't seem to be much progress.</p><p></p><p>On this day, dark clouds covered Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was on a hillside outside the county town.</p><p></p><p>Scenes of his master's display of the Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist kept flashing in his mind, as he tried to comprehend the essence of the wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A gust of fierce wind swept in!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Lightning flashed across the dark, gloomy sky, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The wind and rain were coming!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong abruptly looked up at the sky.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>In a flash, another dazzling bolt of lightning split the thick clouds, illuminating the dark sky, and a sudden gust of wind swept in.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Meng Chong felt a spark of enlightenment in his mind, as if he had grasped the essence of the wind and thunder!</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a bolt of thunder struck down, and a large tree in the distance was instantly snapped and toppled.</p><p></p><p>A fierce wind suddenly arose, howling as it swept up the fallen leaves between the trees, causing them to dance in the air.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Meng Chong felt a flash of insight in his mind, comprehending the essence of the wind and thunder. </p><p></p><p>As his blood and qi surged, a jade-like golden light appeared, his golden bell of blood and qi shining brilliantly. Meng Chong threw out a punch, the violent power like thunderous lightning, fast and fierce.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a punch was thrown out, like a flash of lightning, with overwhelming and unmatched punching force, directly toppling a large tree.</p><p></p><p>"The Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist, I've grasped it, this is the essence of the wind and thunder!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly excited, his figure shifting as he started punching, the movements like thunder and wind.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack!</p><p></p><p>Large raindrops began to fall, and a fierce wind and rainstorm arrived.</p><p></p><p>But in the rain, a burly bald youth was punching, the fist techniques like thunderous lightning, and like a raging wind, the raindrops unable to fall around him.</p><p></p><p>Each punch unleashed a thunderous force, whipping up a gale, scattering the falling raindrops and the gusting wind.</p><p></p><p>A jade-like golden light emanated from his body, majestic like a golden vajra arhat, his fists invoking wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>The Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist, the comprehension was successful!</p><p></p><p>"What a heavy rain!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat under the eaves, watching the torrential downpour, the lightning flashing and thunder rumbling in the thick clouds, the fierce wind blowing as if it would tear the eaves off.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if my second disciple, cultivating in the mountains and forests, hasn't been struck by lightning?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly became a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know whether Meng Chong's current Great Sun Golden Bell could withstand a bolt of lightning.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

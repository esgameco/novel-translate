            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 34: Xu Yan: The Subduing Dragon Palm is Truly Powerful Beyond Measure</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan never expected Xu Yan to ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>It can only be said that Xu Yan, the one who managed to cultivate the fabricated technique, has a mindset and focus that are different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>However, this question is not difficult for him to answer!</p><p></p><p>He immediately looked at Xu Yan with a gratified gaze, his face full of satisfaction towards his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, the fact that you can ask this question at this time shows that your comprehension is still good, and you have already begun to glimpse the essence of the Subduing Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>"There is a saying that goes, 'fight fire with fire.' The Subduing Dragon Palm is the same - it subdues the dragon with the dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon is the supreme divine beast, born with supernatural powers. How can it be easily subdued?</p><p></p><p>"This Subduing Dragon Palm, by subduing the dragon with the dragon, not only subdues the dragon's body, but also subdues the dragon's heart. It attacks both its physical form and its willpower!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan started fabricating his words.</p><p></p><p>"Subduing the dragon's body, and also subduing the dragon's heart, attacking both its physical form and its willpower?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shocked in his heart, feeling that the Subduing Dragon Palm was truly profound and unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Although he did not understand how to subdue the body and the heart, how to attack the physical form and the willpower, it did not diminish his awe of the Subduing Dragon Palm at all.</p><p></p><p>His heart was greatly inspired: "I must cultivate the Subduing Dragon Palm. If one day I encounter a true dragon, I will use this palm to subdue it!"</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand. I will definitely cultivate the Subduing Dragon Palm and comprehend its true meaning!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a determined gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I believe in you!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt very gratified.</p><p></p><p>"The incantation of the Subduing Dragon Palm, remember it well, my disciple. This is the true essence of the Subduing Dragon Palm. If you can comprehend even a fraction of it, you will have mastered the basics of the Subduing Dragon Palm. If you can grasp its true meaning, then you will have attained a divine martial art."</p><p></p><p>For the sake of this Subduing Dragon Palm, Li Xuan had put in a lot of effort to fabricate the incantation.</p><p></p><p>Whether it can succeed or not, it all depends on Xu Yan himself.</p><p></p><p>"I will remember it by heart!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly: "The dragon has divine powers, responding to the situation with constant changes; its might shakes the world, its wrath startles heaven and earth; when enraged, it summons wind and thunder, when hidden, it leaves no trace; it strikes across thousands of miles, with the utmost yang and firmness, nothing can withstand it; yet it can be as supple and yielding as water, with unpredictable transformations, following the heart's desires."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured the incantation once, his eyes thoughtful, as if a flash of insight had appeared in his mind, vaguely feeling that he had understood something, yet unable to grasp it.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me, my disciple."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, with his hands behind his back, walked towards the flat area where the Bagua (Eight Trigrams) was drawn.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you see? This is the Bagua!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed to the Bagua diagram on the ground and said.</p><p></p><p>"Qian, Kun, Zhen, Xun, Kan, Li, Gen, Dui..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained to Xu Yan all the knowledge about the Bagua that he could remember, and also included some of his own fabricated, somewhat mysterious and powerful theories.</p><p></p><p>"The profound and ever-changing transformations of the Bagua are endless. How much you can comprehend and grasp depends entirely on yourself... The body techniques, the footwork, and so on, can all be understood through the Bagua."</p><p></p><p>"As a master, I can only guide you to the door. The actual cultivation depends on your own efforts. Today, I will pass on the Subduing Dragon Palm to you, along with the wonders of the Bagua. You should ponder and comprehend them well."</p><p></p><p>After the explanation, Li Xuan spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will definitely not disappoint you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was filled with the discourse on the Bagua, and the more he thought about it, the more profound and wondrous it seemed. He felt that he could continue to contemplate it endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"This is the supreme martial art!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Allocate your own cultivation time. Cooking, feeding the chickens, and so on, just do it once a day."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>He must give more time for his disciple to cultivate, and not waste it on feeding chickens, planting vegetables, and cooking.</p><p></p><p>Given his current level of attainment...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For a few days without eating or drinking, it won't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, disciple understands!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you continue to cultivate well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked away with his hands behind his back, in a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>Back in the village, sitting on the chair under the big tree, Li Xuan sighed. He didn't know whether his disciple could cultivate successfully.</p><p></p><p>Concentrating his consciousness, he wanted to explore his own golden finger.</p><p></p><p>But he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>The golden finger would only appear when Xu Yan's cultivation had some achievements, and got feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my strength is too low, so I can't actively see the golden finger?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan speculated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The function of the golden finger should be to make the cultivation method I made up theoretically allow people to cultivate successfully. Of course, there must be limitations, such as the disciple's comprehension ability can't be too poor.</p><p></p><p>"This foolish disciple Xu Yan has an extremely strong imagination and exceptional comprehension ability, so he can cultivate successfully. </p><p></p><p>"My golden finger should have been activated because Xu Yan successfully cultivated the cultivation method I made up. I'm really lucky that this prodigy became my disciple, otherwise I would have to guard this small village alone and couldn't go anywhere!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Accepting Xu Yan as his disciple was truly the wisest decision.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked a circle following the Bagua, and fell into deep thought. In his mind, there seemed to be some enlightenment, but he couldn't articulate it clearly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll first allocate the cultivation time. In the morning, I'll cultivate the Descending Dragon Palm, and in the afternoon, I'll contemplate the Bagua!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll first cultivate the Descending Dragon Palm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought so, and returned to the hillside where his master taught him the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he suddenly struck out a palm, the blood qi erupted, like a scorching flood, bursting out.</p><p></p><p>"No! This is just the power of blood qi, not the true power of the Dragon Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, falling into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He repeatedly pondered the incantation of the Descending Dragon Palm in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Dragons have divine abilities, the divine abilities of dragons must be unparalleled in fierceness and might. To be fierce and mighty, one must be savage and violent, concentrating the power in an instant..."</p><p></p><p>"My realm is still low, I can't demand too much. So I should lower the requirements..."</p><p></p><p>"Dragons have divine abilities, how can I unleash palm power like the divine abilities of dragons?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan entered a state of oblivion, contemplating and comprehending.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the legends and dragon paintings he had seen before emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he had a kind of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The blood qi gathered in his palm, in an instant, the blood qi compressed and refined into one, then he struck out a palm violently.</p><p></p><p>A surging blood qi flood with doubled power suddenly slammed into a tree not far away.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The tree instantly snapped and collapsed.</p><p></p><p>"I understand now, how to make the palm power fierce and mighty, how to make the palm power leap beyond the ordinary."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan opened his eyes, and a flash of insight appeared in his mind, comprehending how to unleash the fierce and mighty palm power.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his chest and abdomen bulged, he pushed out his palms, and the blood qi flood instantly became extremely savage and violent, bursting out with even greater power!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>It created a small pit in the ground.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally grasped some superficial understanding, this is just the beginning. This palm is more than doubled in power compared to my previous full-power strike of the Descending Dragon Palm. This is not the limit, but just the start!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"I've only grasped a little bit, but I can unleash such powerful palm power. The Descending Dragon Palm is truly powerful beyond measure!"</p><p></p><p>After gaining this enlightenment, the next step was to consolidate this level of understanding, continuously practice and refine it, and then continue to gain deeper comprehension to perfect it.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

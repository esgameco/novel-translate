        <h1>Chapter 145</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at him with disdain, "You third-rate grand master, so what if you insult me? What kind of trash can be killed with just a palm strike!"</p><p></p><p>Complete silence fell over the crowd!</p><p></p><p>A grand master, killed with just a palm strike?</p><p></p><p>He's gone completely mad, hasn't he? Even Fu Yuntian was dumbfounded, knowing that Xu Yan was very arrogant, but never imagined he would reach this level.</p><p></p><p>Being a master is one thing, after all he has the strength to be so arrogant. </p><p></p><p>But Yin Hong is a grand master! Although he had just recently broken through, a grand master is still a grand master, how could a mere master compare to him? Could it be that in just a few days, his strength has grown so much that he can now disregard grand masters?</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, why are you using someone else's identity to enter the Treasure Vault of our Seven Star Academy?" Fu Yuntian said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense, what do you mean by using someone else's identity? I'm just borrowing it!" Xu Yan said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I lent it to Brother Xu to use, is there a problem with that?" Xie Lingfeng was also shocked by Xu Yan's arrogance, but he knew that since Xu Yan said so, he must be confident that he can easily defeat that grand master with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>It's been such a short time, Xu Yan's strength has become so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>He looked at Fu Yuntian and said, "The Seven Star Academy doesn't have a rule prohibiting borrowing someone else's identity to enter the Treasure Vault and read the classics, right? I am Xie Lingfeng, my father is Xie Tianheng, the Grand Tutor. If the Academy is not satisfied, I, Xie Lingfeng, can take responsibility for this!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was silent for a moment, then said, "From today on, no one is allowed to borrow someone else's identity to enter the Treasure Vault, otherwise they will be severely punished!"</p><p></p><p>He established this rule.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan borrowing Xie Lingfeng's identity, he let it go, after all geniuses have certain privileges.</p><p></p><p>Especially such geniuses as Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Tutor, are you just going to let this matter slide?" Yin Hong was somewhat unwilling.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rubbed his hands and said, "Grand Tutor, your Seven Star Academy cannot engage in combat, how about we make a bet? If I can defeat him with a single palm strike, then this rule will be useless to me, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked, all staring in amazement at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>That is a grand master, being killed with a single palm strike is already terrifying enough, but you actually boast that you can defeat him with a single palm strike?</p><p></p><p>Even Fu Yuntian couldn't help but want to curse.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong, no matter how weak, is still a grand master. Even if it's him, he can't be defeated with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention defeating him with a single palm strike, even defeating Yin Hong with a single move would be difficult, no matter how weak he is, he is still a grand master!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, be careful!" Xie Lingfeng hurriedly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt that Xu Yan never spoke in vain, but a single palm strike to defeat a grand master, how terrifying is that? If he fails, and can't defeat him with a single palm strike, it would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, think it through carefully!" Du Yuying also hurriedly spoke up to persuade him.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong was so angry that his nose was about to twist. Being repeatedly despised and humiliated, he, the mighty grand master, how could he tolerate this?</p><p></p><p>Defeat him with a single palm strike? The audacious brat is too arrogant!</p><p></p><p>He rose into the air, the aura of a grand master surging, but he dared not suppress down, after all there was a group of Seven Star Academy disciples below, if he did that, it would be equivalent to provoking the Seven Star Academy, which he could not bear.</p><p></p><p>Glaring at Xu Yan, he said angrily, "Arrogant brat, I want to see how you can defeat me. Dare to come with me to the Arena and fight!"</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan ignored him, and instead looked at Fu Yuntian, chuckling, "Grand Tutor, how have you considered it?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was shocked by him, where did this confidence come from, to defeat a grand master with a single palm strike?</p><p></p><p>"You can go to the Arena and fight him, but you must consider carefully, the strength of a grand master, even the weakest grand master, is not something that can be compared to ten peak masters."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Going to the Arena is so boring, I, Xu Yan, have always been about breaking the rules. Only by defeating him with a single palm strike here will it be more exciting."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone: ...</p><p></p><p>You're really just here to break the rules, aren't you? Fu Yuntian pondered for a moment, then said, "Alright, if you can truly defeat him with a single palm strike, then I won't pursue it further. But if you can't defeat him with a single palm strike, you will stay in our Seven Star Academy, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>All the people present fell silent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>No one expressed any dissatisfaction with Fu Yuntian's proposal.</p><p></p><p>True geniuses have privileges, especially such monstrosities like Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Disperse." Fu Yuntian looked at the group of disciples and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone retreated, after all, when a grand master strikes, even a slight ripple could be fatal.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, are you confident?" Xie Lingfeng asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, he's just a third-rate grand master." Xu Yan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, you must be careful and not be careless!" Du Yuying said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes chuckled lightly, "In all my life, I've never seen a grand master being defeated. Today I'll be blessed to witness it, Young Master Xu, don't let me down."</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong in the air was furious, how dare someone so brazenly belittle him.</p><p></p><p>He glared at the woman in plain clothes, then noticed the old woman, his heart shuddering, and quickly averted his gaze!</p><p></p><p>A grand master! Stronger than him!</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, his aura surging, the might of a grand master undoubtedly displayed, he glared at Xu Yan and coldly said, "Arrogant brat, today I'll let you know the consequences of insulting a grand master!"</p><p></p><p>He had already decided, to go all out, to kill Xu Yan without giving Fu Yuntian a chance to intervene. A dead genius would have no value.</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" </p><p></p><p>Just as Yin Hong was about to strike, Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Brat, it's too late for you to back out now!" Yin Hong grinned viciously.</p><p></p><p>"Who said I'm backing out?" Xu Yan looked at him disdainfully and said, "Do you have spirit tickets on you?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was stunned, they were about to fight a life-and-death battle, what does spirit tickets have to do with it? Yin Hong was also a bit confused, frowning, "Of course I have spirit tickets!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed to hear this, and said, "Quick, hand over the spirit tickets, otherwise I'm afraid when I strike, I won't be able to control the force and destroy all the spirit tickets on you, that would be a huge loss!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone: ...</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong was so angry his face turned red, "Brat, how dare you humiliate me!" </p><p></p><p>He opened his folding fan, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan said, "As a grand master, you must have at least hundreds of thousands of spirit tickets on you, it would be such a pity to destroy them. Consider it a bet, quickly take them out, don't waste time."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yin Hong trembling with rage and not taking out the spirit tickets, he said again, "If you don't take out the spirit tickets, then I won't bet, let's see if you dare to strike!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong gritted his teeth in anger, if Xu Yan didn't bet, how could he strike him on the spot and kill this arrogant brat? </p><p></p><p>With his relationship with Xie Lingfeng, he could hide in the Seven Star Academy for a few days, and wait for the arrival of the Sword Sovereign Peak grand masters, then he would have no chance for revenge!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, he took out a small bag.</p><p></p><p>"Here!" </p><p></p><p>He threw the bag down, Xu Yan caught it and opened it, inside was a spirit herb and a stack of spirit tickets.</p><p></p><p>"You're a grand master, how can you be so poor? You're truly a waste, not even as good as the few masters I killed!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan complained dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>This is the first time he's going to kill a grand master.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ah, I thought I could make a big harvest. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>But the result, he's a pauper!</p><p></p><p>The onlookers all fell silent, just how poor are you! Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched, he finally understood why Xu Yan escorted Du Yuying, why he went to the Wushuang Pavilion to freeload - because he's poor! As someone from the border regions, where would he have spirit crystals?</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Yin Hong was about to explode with anger, his breathing was shaking as he angrily said: "If you kill me, everything on Canglan Island will be yours, the Grand Preceptor and the others can all testify for you!"</p><p></p><p>To kill Xu Yan, he was willing to go all out.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't kill Xu Yan today, he felt he might just choke himself to death! Xu Yan's eyes lit up as he looked at Xie Lingfeng and asked, "Brother Xie, is Canglan Island rich?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng frowned in thought and shook his head, "I've never heard of Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Hu Shan, "Have you heard of it?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong: ...</p><p></p><p>At this point, Du Yuying spoke up, "The Lord of Canglan Island is actually quite wealthy, with over a hundred thousand spirit crystals, he should have them."</p><p></p><p>After all, Xie Lingfeng was a genius of the Sword Saint Cliff, his level was too high, so it was normal for him to not know about Canglan Island, which was just a force in the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly got excited, "Good, after I crush you, Canglan Island will be mine!"</p><p></p><p>He took a few steps forward, looking back at Xie Lingfeng and said in a deep voice, "Brother Xie, watch closely, how I kill an enemy across borders, I'll demonstrate it for you today.</p><p></p><p>"Those present, watch as I, the Sword Saint Xu Yan, today crush a Grand Master with a single palm!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's eyes gleamed with murderous intent, although he was almost bursting with anger, at this moment, he had no sense of underestimating the opponent.</p><p></p><p>Daring to boast of crushing a Grand Master with a single palm, he must have the confidence to back it up.</p><p></p><p>And Yin Hong felt that Xu Yan's daring boast was due to a lack of understanding of the Grand Master's strength!</p><p></p><p>And this was his opportunity! His face became ferocious, his aura gathered around him, this strike was his all-out effort, he must kill that hateful young man! "Come at me with your life!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! In midair, the surging waves poured down, as if the heavens were collapsing, a terrifying pressure swept across.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were all horrified.</p><p></p><p>This is the might of a Grand Master?! Du Yuying's eyes widened, her hands tightly clenched together, nervously watching the young man!</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes also had a grave expression, not blinking at all!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's expression was solemn, his hand unconsciously resting on the hilt of his sword.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The dragon's roar sounded, and a golden giant dragon surged up, rushing towards the crashing waves, its majestic dragon aura seemed to make all living beings prostrate! It also seemed to have boundless anger surging within the dragon aura.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth seemed to have lost their color! That golden dragon, like a true dragon descended into the world, wrapped in a terrifying dragon aura, and that horrifying anger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The surging waves were shattered, rolling back.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong's pupils shrank, horrified.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to dodge, but it was as if he was pinned down by a powerful pressure, and just now he had poured out all his strength, now he was in a momentary state of power void.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch as the golden giant dragon rushed towards him, the terrifying power descended, the aura of death filled his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Bang! In the eyes of all, the Yin Hong in midair, exploded.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon's strike, thunderously crushed Yin Hong, a Grand Master, before everyone's eyes, was blown apart, his shattered body flying in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Another golden dragon flew out, circling and crushing in midair, the scorching aura permeated, the shattered body parts were instantly ground into ash, scattering in the wind.</p><p></p><p>Silence! Outside the Seven Star Academy's Classics Pavilion, a tranquil silence.</p><p></p><p>Many students of the Seven Star Academy, as well as the instructors, all stared with wide eyes, their mouths agape, unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian plucked a strand of his own beard, not even realizing that he had directly pulled out a strand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, had truly crushed a Grand Master with a single palm! "I'm stronger than Yin Hong, and much stronger, he couldn't be crushed by a single palm... it would take at least ten or more palms?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through Fu Yuntian's mind.</p><p></p><p>He was completely numb.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's hand was slightly trembling, he knew that Xu Yan never boasted, but when this scene of crushing a Grand Master with a single palm actually appeared, he was still shocked beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's eyes were fixed on that young man, unwilling to look away even for a moment, this was the one who escorted her back to the Du Marquis Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Today, in the Seven Star Academy, he crushed a Grand Master with an unprecedented single palm!</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes had a complex expression in her eyes, with a hint of tenderness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed, he was still too weak, far behind his master.</p><p></p><p>Back then, his master could directly reduce a Grand Master to ashes with a single palm.</p><p></p><p>And that Grand Master was stronger than Yin Hong.</p><p></p><p>However, a Grand Master is still a Grand Master, this palm of his had almost reached the peak of the Subduing Dragon Palm's power!</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he's a Grand Master, too hard to kill, my almost all-out palm could only blow him apart into more than a dozen pieces!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Everyone: ...</p><p></p><p>Please, don't say anymore, my heart can't take this excitement!</p><p></p><p>"Grand Preceptor, I don't have to follow the rules anymore, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the dazed Fu Yuntian.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, has your strength breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian gave a wry smile.</p><p></p><p>Just a few days ago, Xu Yan didn't have such powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian took a deep breath and said solemnly, "Young friend, what you discussed with the Martial Arts Scholar the other day, was not just made up?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it wasn't made up."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave him a disdainful look.</p><p></p><p>This is true martial arts, how could it be made up?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, let's go, let's gather somewhere."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>After crushing the Grand Master Yin Hong, shaking the Seven Star Academy, and gaining a large amount of spirit crystals, he could open up a bit and properly thank Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>After all, his reputation was truly useful!</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng revealed a smile, he could also ask Xu Yan to teach him about the sword dao and the cultivation of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, I know a quiet and elegant place in Seven Star City, suitable for a gathering without disturbance, shall we go there?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had now removed her veil, revealing her breathtakingly beautiful countenance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hesitated a bit, after all, he wasn't very familiar with Du Yuying, although he had escorted her along the way, but unfamiliar is unfamiliar!</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du is inviting, let's go as a way to thank the young master for the escort that day."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying supplemented.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan agreed.</p><p></p><p>Then he also said, "Oh yes, Miss Du, do you know where Canglan Island is? Tell me the location, that place is now mine."</p><p></p><p>"No problem."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, quickly go and arrange it, book that place for us."</p><p></p><p>He turned back and instructed Cui'er.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss!"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er excitedly hurried away.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 321</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The several elder Taimiao Sect elders' expressions changed abruptly. In just a few years, Xu Yan's strength had actually become so powerful.</p><p></p><p>Which genius in the Spirit Realm could be his match? The Dharma Protecting Elder also frowned, sensing a strong threat.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>The other elders, not caring about the loss of Taimiao Sect's dignity in bullying the fewer in number, rushed to attack Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Taimiao Sect disciples hurriedly retreated, fearing being caught in the crossfire, which would either kill or severely injure them.</p><p></p><p>They were inwardly shocked - Xu Yan was still so young, yet his strength was already so terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is so powerful!"</p><p>"Yes, yes, he's so good-looking and so strong!"</p><p>"That's right, I thought Junior Brother Yu was already a rare and outstanding young master, but compared to Xu Yan, he still falls short by a wide margin!"</p><p>"Junior Brother Yu is far inferior, lacking the heroic and domineering aura. Look at Xu Yan, so majestic, so domineering, so powerful, summoning true dragons with a wave of his hand!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the discussions of the senior and junior sisters, the male Taimiao Sect disciples' faces turned green with envy.</p><p></p><p>Especially that "Junior Brother Yu", he was completely disheartened! The sudden commotion had shaken the entire Taimiao Sect, with powerful experts attacking Taimiao Sect - were they from the Myriad Worlds Alliance? Yaren's figure flickered as she appeared on the battlefield, her expression changing drastically.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Yaren had already refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Let Xin Mengrou come out, I want to ask clearly, where are Shu Yuying and Yun Miaomiao? Have you Taimiao Sect done something unspeakable?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, eighteen giant dragons transformed into eighteen giant swords, the sword lights layering upon each other, forming a sword formation that surrounded the several Taimiao Sect elders.</p><p></p><p>Looking for people?! Yaren was a bit helpless, Shu Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were involved in Master Xin Mengrou's secret matters, so these elders didn't know about them when they entered Taimiao Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!" </p><p></p><p>Yaren's figure flickered as she came to Xu Yan's side. "I'll take you to the people you want to see."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, the sword formation disappearing. He recognized this Taimiao Sect woman, she had been observing the battle at the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall back then.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Yaren, you..." </p><p></p><p>The Dharma Protecting Elder was alarmed by Xu Yan's strength, and couldn't help frowning at Yaren.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's acquaintances are with the Master." </p><p></p><p>Yaren sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Protecting Elder frowned, why didn't she know about this? </p><p></p><p>However, Yaren was the disciple of the Sect Uncle, and had always been handling matters for the Sect Uncle, so those two people's identities were probably somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>"But Xu Yan..."</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of Xu Yan's arrogance, not only did he break into Taimiao Sect, disregarding the rule of not allowing outsider men to enter the mountain gate, he had even blasted away an elder - this was a direct provocation!</p><p></p><p>If they just let it go, where would Taimiao Sect's dignity be?</p><p>"I said at the mountain gate that I came to visit an acquaintance, but your gatekeeper was yelling that I, Xu Yan, was here to block the Taimiao Sect mountain gate, which is not my fault!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan interrupted her words.</p><p></p><p>Although he had entered the Taimiao Sect mountain, it was ultimately Taimiao Sect's responsibility.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan thought about it, even if the Taimiao Sect gatekeeper had asked him who he was visiting, they probably wouldn't have been able to find Shu Yuying and Yun Miaomiao, and he would have still barged in.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was still inevitable that they would come to blows.</p><p></p><p>The Dharma Protecting Elder paused, having the guarding warriors summoned, but Xu Yan disdained confronting them, looking at Yaren and saying, "Where is it? Lead the way, or have them come see me."</p><p></p><p>He came here for two reasons - one was to see the acquaintances, the other was to inquire about Xie Lingfeng's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"You..." </p><p></p><p>Yaren was about to let Xu Yan wait while she reported to her master, but suddenly paused, changing her words: "Just follow me."</p><p></p><p>She turned and led Xu Yan towards the peak of Taimiao Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Sister Yaren, you..." </p><p></p><p>The Dharma Protecting Elder's expression changed, the mountain peak was the core area of Taimiao Sect, even ordinary elders couldn't go up there, let alone an outsider.</p><p></p><p>However, her expression suddenly froze, and she didn't say anything further.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, it seemed someone had secretly transmitted a message to her, was it Xin Mengrou? Along the rugged and narrow mountain path, heading towards the peak, he saw some elegant courtyards on the way, all residences of Taimiao Sect's powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>The closer to the peak, the more flowers bloomed by the path, becoming even more beautiful, the purple and red hues faintly visible in the misty clouds, having a hazy, dreamlike beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Go up by yourself, at the foot of the peak, there are two elegant courtyards, that's where the people you're looking for reside."</p><p></p><p>Yaren stopped and said.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, not at all timid, nor fearing any potential plots, his strength was his foundation. Even if his own strength was insufficient to deal with any hidden dangers, he still had the divine talisman of his master's divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The higher up Taimiao Peak, the more ethereal it felt, the more unreal.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly stopped in his tracks, looking towards a certain spot on the mountain peak, his brow slightly furrowed. That place seemed a bit unusual.</p><p></p><p>"The secret place of Taimiao Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Without the curiosity to explore it, after all, this was Taimiao Sect's secret, he continued stepping up the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The two courtyards had come into view.</p><p></p><p>Elegant courtyards, blooming with gorgeous flowers, and standing in front of the courtyard gates were two beautiful women.</p><p></p><p>They were Shu Yuying and Yun Miaomiao.</p><p></p><p>After so many years, the two women had become even more beautiful and charming.</p><p></p><p>Especially Yun Miaomiao, compared to when she was in the Matchless Pavilion, she was even more captivating, as if constantly plucking at one's heartstrings.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying revealed a happy smile, her jade-like face flushing red.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao's voice reached him, directly entering his heart, stirring his heartstrings.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Shu, Miss Yun, it's been a long time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a smile, stepping forward, but suddenly halting his steps!</p><p></p><p>Something's not right! He took a deep breath, his gaze becoming focused, his spiritual sense spreading out, but the scenery he saw contained no problems.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, please come in."</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying quickly came over, wanting to lead him into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>But Yun Miaomiao also quickly approached, the two women glaring at each other in the middle, seemingly arguing through spiritual transmission.</p><p></p><p>The two women's expressions grew colder, their hostile postures becoming increasingly obvious.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu first met me, so he should first reminisce with me!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, when Young Master Xu came to my Matchless Pavilion before, I wholeheartedly entertained him, so he should first reminisce with me."</p><p></p><p>They were about to fight to decide the winner!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, carefully examining the surroundings, he felt like he had fallen into some kind of illusion, or perhaps a dream.</p><p></p><p>But what his spiritual sense saw, what his eyes saw, were all real, the courtyards were also real, it was just that the two women seemed to be fake?</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, what kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened, this was no ordinary martial arts attack technique, but a kind of illusion, a dream-like state, similar to an illusion technique, yet not a pure illusion technique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a false fantasy constructed by relying on the real environment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not pay attention to the argument between the two women, nor did he pay attention to their fierce fighting and pulling, ignoring the suddenly appearing beautiful scenery, but continued to look at this dreamlike scene.</p><p></p><p>"Dream, illusion, state of mind... Only by shattering the dream fantasy can one find the truth. With my current realm, I was momentarily careless and was enveloped by the dream fantasy.</p><p></p><p>"This shows that my state of mind is still lacking.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Heart Realm, I have a sword in my heart, and all things can be used as a sword, even dream fantasies can be my sword.</p><p></p><p>"But in the end, it is a counterattack measure that is deployed after entering the dream fantasy. How can I ignore all these dream fantasies, all these illusory appearances?</p><p></p><p>"My master said, the Wisdom Sword Realm, the Wisdom Sword slays the demons of the heart, the Wisdom Sword severs the threads of emotion, the Wisdom Sword slays the old self... Shattering all demonic obstacles, shattering all the unknown.</p><p></p><p>"With the Wisdom Sword in my heart, purifying the self, everything is me, not deluded, not self-deluded..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a moment of enlightenment, and in an instant, a flash of inspiration appeared in his mind, as if he had realized how to cultivate the Wisdom Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Wisdom Sword Realm, any dream fantasy, any demonic obstacle, would be nothing more than a bubble, and would be unable to hide from him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan simply sat down cross-legged, watching the two women fighting, seeing their torn clothes, graceful postures, and every move seducing the world, the beautiful and charming figures.</p><p></p><p>The dream fantasy is not real, but it can present the most beautiful scenery in the world.</p><p></p><p>It can directly touch the heart, awakening the most beautiful, or the most evil, the most frightening side in one's heart.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also in no hurry to escape the dream fantasy, directly cultivating self-awareness within the dream fantasy, further clarifying the cultivation path of the Wisdom Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>This is an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After realizing the cultivation path of the Wisdom Sword Realm, when his Sword Heart Realm is perfected, he can try to break through to the Wisdom Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>The profound and mysterious Wisdom Sword Realm is no longer out of reach, but can be cultivated! At this moment, Xu Yan was secretly excited, this trip to Taixuan Sect was not in vain!</p><p></p><p>No matter what the purpose is behind this dream fantasy, or who is behind it, it doesn't matter anymore, but it has given him an enlightenment and found the path to the Wisdom Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of Taixuan Mountain, Xin Mengrou was a little puzzled, what's wrong with this Xu Yan, he actually sat down directly, as if watching a play? And it seems he has discovered this dream fantasy? "Where is the flaw?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou pondered.</p><p></p><p>She looked at Duyuying and Yuncaimai beside her, and had some guesses in her heart, perhaps it was the behavior and attitude of the two women that caused the flaw?</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the dream fantasy seemed to become more real, and the two women who were originally fighting approached Xu Yan, as if they wanted Xu Yan to make a choice.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this!" Xu Yan murmured, and with a wave of his hand, a sword slashed down, without any hesitation or delay, and the two women were instantly destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou raised her eyebrows, this boy was too decisive, wasn't he afraid that they were real? And he struck without changing color, without the slightest hesitation, as if the beauties were nothing more than skeletons, not caring at all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step forward, and the mountains and rivers emerged from beneath his feet, the dream fantasy shattered like a bubble, and the scene in front of him did not change much, but it was no longer a dream fantasy, but reality.</p><p></p><p>Two elegant courtyards were there, but there were no Duyuying and Yuncaimai, but he saw two other familiar faces.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er and Wushuang.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu?" Cui'er rubbed her eyes, with a look of disbelief on her face, and then her jade face flushed red as she rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, is it really you? I've missed you so much!"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was excited, and didn't even bother to notify her mistress.</p><p></p><p>The little maid had changed a bit, seeming to have become more beautiful, and her strength had also increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>She had already reached the Great Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although she had just entered the Great Celestial Realm, with Cui'er's current age, her cultivation level was not bad, and she was on par with some ordinary geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Wushuang pursed his lips, this kid actually came to Taixuan Sect, and was even allowed to come up here.</p><p></p><p>"This kid has a fearsome reputation in the Spirit Realm, known as the number one genius of the Spirit Realm, and he still remembers these two girls, he can be considered a person who cherishes the old."</p><p></p><p>Wushuang muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how his master is doing."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's master, that mysterious and powerful figure, should be at the level of the Supremely Strong, right?</p><p></p><p>"It's Cui'er." Xu Yan smiled and asked, "Where is Miss Du?"</p><p></p><p>"The young mistress is at the peak, with Grandmother."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was about to open her mouth to invite Young Master Xu to the courtyard for a chat, but she saw Xu Yan look up at the peak and say, "Then I'll go find Miss Du." Without waiting for Cui'er's reply, Xu Yan took a step forward and headed straight for the peak.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er was stunned for a moment, and Wushuang was also taken aback. He silently cursed, "Xu Yan, you really don't understand a woman's heart! I've heard that the powerful Xin Mengrou is at Taixuan Sect, I, Xu Yan, have come to learn from her!"</p><p></p><p>With that, in the astonished gaze of Wushuang and Cui'er, a golden giant dragon roared beneath Xu Yan's feet and rushed towards the peak, as if he was riding the dragon.</p><p></p><p>Holding a long sword in his hand, Xu Yan's sword intent surged, with a fierce killing intent directly aimed at the peak!</p><p></p><p>Although the previous dream fantasy had given him an enlightenment and made him realize the cultivation path of the Wisdom Sword Realm, he was not the kind of person who would just take a beating without fighting back. Even if Xin Mengrou had not made a move, just using the dream fantasy to probe him was already a provocation in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>At the peak, Du Yuying and Yuncaimai were suddenly awakened from their cultivation, looking at the golden giant dragon soaring towards them, and the young man standing proudly on its head.</p><p></p><p>They were delighted, but also couldn't help but feel worried.</p><p></p><p>Turning their heads to look at Grandmother beside them, they couldn't see her expression, and their hearts became even more anxious.</p><p></p><p>"They say Xu Yan is wild, and he really is wild!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's voice was as ethereal as a dream fantasy, and petal after petal of flower petals rained down from the peak, each petal containing a strand of the power of the laws of heaven and earth. And with so many flower petals raining down, they were both dreamlike and untraceable, and contained a sharp killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" Xu Yan's heart trembled, Xin Mengrou was the strongest person he had encountered besides Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he didn't know the exact strength of Wu Tiannan, as he had never seen him fight, and Xu Yan felt that he was an old cunning fox who seemed to be hiding some strength.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The golden giant dragon let out a roar, its dragon aura surging, and Xu Yan raised his hand and slashed out a sword, the sword light thundering as if the cycle of life and death, the sword intent surging.</p><p></p><p>Puff puff! The flower petals were shattered one by one, and the sword light was also constantly being destroyed, while the golden giant dragon was already full of holes.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The golden giant dragon shattered, and the sword light also dimmed, but the flowers continued to rain down.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Suddenly, the stones and plants under Xu Yan's feet turned into fierce swords, soaring up, slashing towards those flower petals, and the swords became more and more, forming a torrential sword flow, about to be unleashed.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

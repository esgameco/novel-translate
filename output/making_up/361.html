            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Qi, you just wait!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu left with high spirits.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looked puzzled - what was going on with Emperor Wu's high spirits? </p><p></p><p>Had the senior said some words of encouragement to him?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Taicang Book in his hand and couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>Was the voice in the mysterious little stone house really the owner of the Taicang Book?</p><p></p><p>Would there be any danger if he went to the little stone house himself?</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Taicang Book must certainly be more powerful than him at his current stage.</p><p></p><p>"The voice has disappeared - has it truly died? Or is it deliberately avoiding Emperor Wu? According to Emperor Wu, that voice should be restrained, without freedom.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, there's no danger. I might as well go take a look, perhaps I can learn the secrets of the Taicang world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made his decision.</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly vanished from the spot, and the next moment he was at the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, looking towards that palace building.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing unusual!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned. He didn't detect anything unusual - the laws of heaven and earth were normal, the principles of heaven and earth were normal. There was no sign of any seal, nor any trace of a powerful being being restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Has it disappeared, or is it that with my current strength, I'm unable to perceive any clues?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>According to Emperor Wu, the owner of that voice seemed unable to perceive anything outside the little stone house.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go in and take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made his decision.</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out from his body and entered the palace.</p><p></p><p>Divine Martial True Body!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had used the Divine Martial True Body. Even if there was danger in the little stone house that destroyed the Divine Martial True Body, it wouldn't affect him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Divine Martial True Body had been altered to be completely different from Li Xuan's, to avoid the other party tracking his real body through the Divine Martial True Body.</p><p></p><p>The necessary caution was still needed!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's aura was concealed, as if he were an ordinary person sitting in a tavern in the capital city of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial True Body had silently entered the palace and saw that ancient and simple little stone house.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, it walked straight in.</p><p></p><p>After entering the little stone house, Li Xuan spoke: "Come out and meet me."</p><p></p><p>It was dead silent, with no response whatsoever.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Xuan no longer concealed himself. The Divine Martial True Body's aura was revealed, its gaze looking at the little stone house, wanting to see through its secrets.</p><p></p><p>The little stone house was just built of ordinary stones, very ordinary, as if a slightly stronger aura would turn it to dust and scatter it.</p><p></p><p>"The little stone house is somewhat unusual."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly discovered the unusual aspect.</p><p></p><p>The little stone house was indeed very ordinary, but these stones had once been surrounded by the power of principles.</p><p></p><p>It was only now that the power of principles had dissipated that the little stone house appeared so ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Other powerful beings might not be able to discover this clue, but it couldn't escape Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Although he hadn't completely memorized and mastered the Taicang principles, he had memorized half of them and was extremely familiar with the power of Taicang principles.</p><p></p><p>"The almost imperceptible traces of the existence of principles indicate that the principles disappeared not long ago. They were deliberately concealed. If the principles had disappeared long ago, there would be no traces left."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly made his judgment.</p><p></p><p>If the power of principles in the little stone house had disappeared long ago, there would absolutely be no traces left. Even if he was very familiar with the power of principles, he wouldn't be able to detect any clues.</p><p></p><p>"These powers of principles disappeared when I mobilized the laws of the Great Wilderness world and enhanced the spiritual energy of the Great Wilderness. This indicates that the other party sensed that the laws of heaven and earth were being artificially manipulated, and thus hid themselves."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>When Emperor Wu came to see the other party and got no response, it was because the other party had hidden.</p><p></p><p>"Why hide and not meet people? I have no ill intentions, I'm just here for a casual chat as I have nothing else to do. You've been here for such a long time, don't you feel lonely?</p><p></p><p>"I've known you were here for a long time. Today, on a whim, I just wanted to chat with you. Why hide and not meet?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>There was no echo from inside the little stone house.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't mind and sighed, "Well, if you won't meet, then so be it. I'll come chat with you again when I have time."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, there was still no response from the little stone house, so Li Xuan turned and left, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial True Body returned, and Li Xuan pondered for a moment before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that the existence in the little stone house, even if it was the owner of the Taicang Book, posed no threat, probably because it was restrained.</p><p></p><p>However, with his current strength, he still couldn't discover where the other party was.</p><p></p><p>"If it really is the owner of the Taicang Book, and with such strength it's still restrained, then this water is a bit deep. With my current strength, it's better to be more cautious."</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Taicang Book might not be able to threaten him because it was restrained, but what about the powerful being who restrained the owner of the Taicang Book? Once detected, they would surely appear.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had used tricks and schemes to restrain the owner of the Taicang Book, their strength must be extremely powerful. With his current strength, he might not be able to match them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what was in the little stone house might not be the owner of the Taicang Book, but possibly a being sealed by the owner of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, it would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"When I fully comprehend the Taicang Book and master the source principles of the Taicang world, I should be able to see the other party's traces, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>His strength was still not powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>"Only by transcending heaven and earth can one truly have the confidence to face it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, feeling some pressure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, he wasn't truly invincible yet.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a note of this little stone house in the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace. It was a place where he could learn the secrets of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>When his strength further increased, or after he had thoroughly comprehended the Taicang Book, he would come again.</p><p></p><p>The little stone house was silent, with no abnormalities. That mysterious voice didn't appear either, as if it didn't even know Li Xuan had been there.</p><p></p><p>Canlan Island.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, Li Xuan devoted more time to comprehending the principles of the Taicang Book, striving to completely memorize all the principles as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was also pondering over the Divine Ability Martial Classics and the fifth method of martial arts in his spare time.</p><p></p><p>He was continuously improving the martial arts methods for the realm beyond the Void-breaking realm, and the subsequent martial arts methods for the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has reached the Divine Ability realm and has understood the martial arts method of the Void-breaking realm. The martial arts method for the realm beyond the Void-breaking realm should be written out as soon as possible and passed on to him when I have time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. He had already determined the direction of cultivation after the Void-breaking realm, and was just waiting to perfect the martial arts theory and the framework of the martial arts method.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao should be about to break through too, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. It was less than a month until the opening of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had returned from outside and was accompanying his parents. He had already arranged everything in the Great Wilderness, and there would be no problems with his parents' safety.</p><p></p><p>This parting, who knows when he would return.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er has grown up, it's time for him to walk his own path," Xu Yan's mother said indulgently.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Mom. Canlan Island is very safe too. The arrays are very interesting. Mom is putting her heart into the arrays, trying to set up that so-called teleportation array as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother didn't feel much sadness about the parting. She had long known that Xu Yan would be venturing into a broader world.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mother doesn't ask for much. Yan'er, just be careful and stay safe when you're out there," said Mother Xu.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "Don't worry, Mother. I'm very experienced and won't encounter any dangers. With Master as my backing, even if there are old geezers, they can't threaten me."</p><p></p><p>Mother Xu nodded.</p><p></p><p>There were only ten days left until the Divine Bridge opened.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left a large batch of cultivation resources for his parents, as well as two flying ships and a divine element avatar.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had quietly turned the divine element avatars he had originally left for Xu Junhe and the others into divine ability jade talismans with the power of the Void-breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>With these talismans, they would be safe even if an Immortal Celestial Lord descended.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, next time you come back, I might not be able to hold you anymore!" Mother Xu said, reluctantly rubbing Red Cat's chubby head.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!" Red Cat waved its paws, and a line of text appeared:</p><p>"You'll be able to hold me, definitely able to!"</p><p></p><p>Mother Xu happily rubbed its head again.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship rose into the air, turning into a streak of light that disappeared on the horizon.</p><p></p><p>At the Gate of the Spirit Realm in the Northern Cang region.</p><p></p><p>The barrier with the Spirit Realm had already been reinforced by Li Xuan. Even an Immortal Celestial Lord would find it difficult to cross over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others looked back towards the Great Wilderness. They didn't know when they would be able to return to their homeland after this parting.</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial arts is long. You still have a long way to go. It's a blessing in life to have companions to walk with you to the end. True strong ones are lonely, because being invincible is always lonely," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" The disciples were shocked upon hearing this and hurriedly responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"So Master was living in seclusion in the borderlands because he was lonely being invincible. He had no companions left because he was too strong."</p><p></p><p>"The invincible are always lonely. Master had been lonely for too long. After extreme stillness comes movement - that's why he took me as a disciple and re-entered the world to wander freely!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, suddenly realizing that the reason his master had been living in seclusion in that small mountain village, and the reason he had taken him as a disciple, was because he had been lonely for too long.</p><p></p><p>After extreme stillness comes movement. He also felt that meeting Xu Yan was fate, which is why he took him as a disciple, left the small mountain village, and re-entered the world.</p><p></p><p>The space in front of the flying ship opened up, and they entered the void once again. Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu hurriedly focused on perceiving the mysteries of void-breaking again.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Hong Province, a gathering of top talents and powerful experts from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan gazed south towards the azure sea, his eyes full of anticipation. Would the person he was looking for be on the other side of the Divine Bridge?</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Yue Changming had also arrived in Hong Province. Now that the situation in the Spirit Realm was settled, even if powerful individuals came from the other side of the Divine Bridge, they couldn't change anything.</p><p></p><p>Everything depended on strength, and their master's strength was invincible.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of place is on the other side of the Divine Bridge?" Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng and his wife Fu Yun walked over. Fu Yun said, "The other side of the Divine Bridge is the Divine Realm. According to ancient records, it's close to the central region of heaven and earth, but specific information is unknown."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Which power does the Cloud Sky Azure Sea City belong to in the Divine Realm?" Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The transcendent spirit sects of the Spirit Realm all belonged to certain sects in the Divine Realm, which is why they could rule over the Spirit Realm. Finding and nurturing talented individuals with spirit bodies was also for the sake of cultivating talent for their superior sects.</p><p></p><p>These secrets were already known to these powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure either. My Cloud Sky Azure Sea City and the Sea Spirit Clan both belong to the same superior sect. Only my father and the Sea Spirit Clan leader would know," Fu Yun shook her head and said.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao didn't continue asking. Instead, he moved towards the azure sea. He was about to break through.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>At a certain location in the azure sea, a formation was set up. Fang Hao took a deep breath. The great forces of heaven and earth gathered, and the azure sea stirred up huge waves. Today, he was going to break through.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Fang Hao?"</p><p></p><p>"What is he doing? Is he breaking through?"</p><p></p><p>"How strong will Fang Hao be after breaking through?"</p><p></p><p>The heads of the Thousand Martial Hall, the Spirit Control Manor, and the Thunder Cloud Manor frowned as they looked towards the area of the azure sea where huge waves were rolling.</p><p></p><p>Now they had no other thoughts, after all, Fang Hao's master was an incredibly powerful expert. Even their superior sects probably couldn't afford to offend him.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, they could only try to befriend him and resolve any grudges.</p><p></p><p>Huge waves rolled, the great forces of heaven and earth gathered, and the power of laws converged. In the sky above, it seemed as if mysterious patterns were forming.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sat cross-legged. The power of heaven and earth entered his body, and heavenly and earthly wondrous patterns were being condensed. The first one was condensed, emitting a brilliant light with a kind of mystical power.</p><p></p><p>This wondrous pattern was different from the previous ones. It seemed to be a law pattern, the embryonic form of the laws of the Wondrous Gate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts that Senior Brother and the others practice generate divine abilities when breaking through to the Divine Ability realm, and divine abilities are the laws of martial artists. These wondrous patterns of mine are like divine abilities, belonging to the laws of the Wondrous Gate martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"These are Divine Ability Wondrous Patterns!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao understood in his heart. Now as he broke through, he was condensing Divine Ability Wondrous Patterns.</p><p></p><p>When the Divine Ability Wondrous Patterns were condensed, deploying the formations of heaven and earth would be like using divine abilities, possessing the mysteriousness of divine abilities!</p><p></p><p>The condensation of Divine Ability Wondrous Patterns continued. The second Divine Ability Wondrous Pattern was condensed.</p><p></p><p>One Divine Ability Wondrous Pattern could deploy one formation of heaven and earth with the power of a divine ability, while two Divine Ability Wondrous Patterns could deploy two formations of heaven and earth with the power of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough continued, and the condensation of Divine Ability Wondrous Patterns continued.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Abyss was the most dangerous place in the azure sea, and also a place where divine objects could be born.</p><p></p><p>But because it was too dangerous, no one had dared to venture deep into the abyss until now.</p><p></p><p>Those who had entered the abyss had never returned alive.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan's divine element avatar hadn't been able to enter the depths of the abyss or understand it clearly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, at the bottom of the abyss, a blood-red light emerged.</p><p></p><p>This blood-red light came from a dark cave.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Cave!</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light continued to emerge, and the dark Sky Cave turned a faint blood color. Looking into it, one could see blood waves surging like boiling water with blood bubbles.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The water of the azure sea was separated from the outside of the Sky Cave, while inside the Sky Cave, blood waves rolled, seemingly boiling. The blood-red light continued to emerge, growing stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, silhouettes appeared in the blood waves.</p><p></p><p>Although these silhouettes were no different from humans, their skin was blood-red, as if soaked in fresh blood. The aura around them also had a sense of blood and killing intent.</p><p></p><p>If there were familiar people, they would recognize these faces as identical to those of the strong individuals who had once entered the Azure Sea Abyss to explore but had never been seen again.</p><p></p><p>These people's eyes were a light red color. At this moment, they all raised their heads to look outside the Sky Cave, towards the waves of the azure sea, as if waiting for an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Bubble bubble bubble! Suddenly, waves surged in the blood waves of the Sky Cave. These people formed a circle, respectfully looking towards where the waves were surging.</p><p></p><p>Pop! A head emerged.</p><p></p><p>Blood-red long hair, a pale face, a thin blood-colored line on the forehead, eyes as red as blood, holding a blood-red long knife in hand.</p><p></p><p>A slender figure emerged from the blood waves, standing on top of the waves, raising its head to look outside the Sky Cave, with a cold smile on its lips.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

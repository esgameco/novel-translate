            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Old Man Qi, you just wait for me!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Huang left with high spirits.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looked puzzled, wondering what had happened to make Wu Huang so spirited?</p><p></p><p>Had the elder said some encouraging words to him?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Tai Cang Book in his hand and started to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Was the voice in the mysterious stone hut really the owner of the Tai Cang Book?</p><p></p><p>Would it be dangerous if he went to the stone hut himself?</p><p></p><p>The owner of the Tai Cang Book must be more powerful than his current self.</p><p></p><p>"The voice has disappeared, is it completely dead? Or did it deliberately avoid Wu Huang? According to Wu Huang's words, that voice should have been restrained and lost its freedom."</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, there is no danger, let me go take a look, perhaps I can understand the secrets of the Tai Cang heavens and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly disappeared from the spot, and the next moment he arrived at the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, looking at that palace.</p><p></p><p>"There is no abnormality!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned, he did not detect any abnormalities, the laws of heaven and earth were normal, the Tao of heaven and earth was normal, there was no trace of any sealing existence, nor any trace of a powerful person being restrained.</p><p></p><p>"Has it disappeared, or is it that with my current strength, I am unable to perceive the clues?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>According to what the Wu Emperor said, the owner of that voice seems to be unaware of the situation outside the stone hut.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a decision.</p><p></p><p>A figure emerged from within him, entering the palace.</p><p></p><p>Divine Martial True Body!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he used the Divine Martial True Body, even if there was danger in the stone hut, destroying the Divine Martial True Body would not affect him at all.</p><p></p><p>The aura of the Divine Martial True Body has been changed, completely different from Li Xuan, so that the other party cannot track his main body through the Divine Martial True Body.</p><p></p><p>The necessary caution is still needed!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's aura was hidden, appearing like an ordinary person sitting in a certain restaurant in the Wu Kingdom capital.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial True Body had silently entered the palace and seen the simple stone hut.</p><p></p><p>Without hesitation, it directly walked in.</p><p></p><p>After entering the stone hut, Li Xuan said, "Come out and let me see you."</p><p></p><p>It was silent, without any response.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Li Xuan no longer hid, the aura of the Divine Martial True Body was revealed, and his gaze looked into the stone hut, wanting to see through its secrets.</p><p></p><p>The stone hut was just an ordinary stone building, plain and simple, as if a slightly stronger aura could make the stone hut crumble into powder.</p><p></p><p>"The stone hut is somewhat unusual."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly discovered the unusual aspect.</p><p></p><p>The stone hut was indeed very ordinary, but these stones had once been surrounded by the power of the Tao.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the power of the Tao had dissipated, making the stone hut appear plain and ordinary.</p><p></p><p>If it were other powerful cultivators, they might not be able to detect this clue, but it could not be hidden from Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the Tai Cang Tao, although he had not completely mastered it, he had remembered half of it, and was very familiar with the power of the Tai Cang Tao.</p><p></p><p>"The trace of the power of the Tao that is almost imperceptible indicates that the power of the Tao has disappeared not long ago, it has been deliberately hidden, if the power of the Tao had disappeared long ago, there would be no trace left."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly made a judgment.</p><p></p><p>If the power of the Tao in the stone hut had disappeared long ago, there would definitely be no trace left, even though he was so familiar with the power of the Tao, he would not be able to detect the clue.</p><p></p><p>"When I activated the Great Desolation Heaven and Earth Laws and enhanced the Great Desolation spiritual energy, these powers of the Tao disappeared, indicating that the other party detected that the laws of heaven and earth were being artificially manipulated, and thus hid themselves."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor came to see the other party, but did not get a response, the other party was hiding.</p><p></p><p>"Why hide and not see people? I have no ill intentions, I'm just bored and want to chat with you, you've been here for so many years, aren't you lonely?</p><p></p><p>"I already knew you were here, today I felt like coming to chat with you, why hide and not see people?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>There was no response from the stone hut.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not mind, sighing and saying, "Alright, since you don't want to see me, I'll come find you another time to chat."</p><p></p><p>After saying this, the stone hut still did not respond, and Li Xuan turned and left, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Martial True Body returned, and Li Xuan pondered for a moment before turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>He was certain that the existence in the stone hut, even if it was the owner of the Tai Cang Book, did not pose a threat, it was most likely being restrained.</p><p></p><p>It's just that with his current strength, he was unable to discover where the other party was.</p><p></p><p>"If it really is the owner of the Tai Cang Book, and their strength is being restrained like this, the situation is a bit deep. With my current strength, it's better to be more cautious."</p><p></p><p>The one who restrained the owner of the Tai Cang Book, even if they used schemes and tricks, their strength must be extremely powerful. With his current strength, he might not be able to contend with them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what's in the stone hut may not even be the owner of the Tai Cang Book, it could be an existence sealed by the owner of the Tai Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>If that's the case, it would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Once I thoroughly comprehend the Tai Cang Book and master the source Tao of the Tai Cang heavens and earth, I should be able to see the other party's traces, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>His strength is still not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>"Only by transcending heaven and earth can one truly have the confidence to face it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, feeling a bit of pressure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was not truly invincible.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recorded the location of this stone hut in the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, this was a place where he could understand the secrets of the Tai Cang heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>When his strength further increases, or when he has thoroughly comprehended the Tai Cang Book, he will come here again.</p><p></p><p>The stone hut was silent and calm, without any abnormalities, and the mysterious voice did not appear, as if it did not even know that Li Xuan had been here.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>After returning from the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, Li Xuan devoted more time to the comprehension of the Tao of the Tai Cang Book, striving to thoroughly remember all the Tao.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also took time to ponder the divine arts, the fifth gate martial arts, and the martial arts beyond the Void Transcendence Realm, constantly improving them.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has reached the Divine Comprehension Realm and comprehended the martial arts beyond the Void Transcendence Realm, I should quickly compile the martial arts beyond the Void Transcendence Realm and pass them on to him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, the cultivation direction after the Void Transcendence Realm, he had already determined, he just needed to perfect the martial arts theory and martial arts framework.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao should be about to break through soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, it was less than a month before the opening of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had returned from the outside and was accompanying his parents, he had already arranged everything in the Great Desolation, and the safety of his parents would not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>This time of parting, he did not know when he would return.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er has grown up, it's time for him to walk his own path."</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother said affectionately.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, mother, Canglan Island is also very safe, the formation arrays are very interesting, mother has put a lot of effort into the formation arrays, trying to set up a transmission array as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother did not have much sorrow in her parting, she had long known that Xu Yan would venture into a broader world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Mother doesn't ask for much. As long as Yan'er is safe when he's out, that's all that matters," said Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother nodded and said, "Don't worry, Mother. I have plenty of experience and won't encounter any danger. I have my master to rely on, so even if there are old fellows, they won't be a threat to me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother nodded.</p><p></p><p>There were only ten days left until the opening of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had left a large amount of cultivation resources for his parents, as well as two flying ships and divine entity avatars.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had quietly transformed the divine entity avatars he had previously left for people like Xu Junhe into divine talisman seals, imbuing them with the power to break through the Immortal Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>With these divine talisman seals, even if an Immortal Venerable descended, their safety could be ensured.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, when you come back next time, I might not be able to carry you anymore!" Xu Yan's mother said with some reluctance as she gently rubbed Red Cat's chubby head.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!" Red Cat waved its paws, and a line of text appeared: "I can still be carried, I can definitely still be carried!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother happily rubbed its head again.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship of the Longevity Pavilion took off and disappeared into the distance like a streak of light.</p><p></p><p>In the Cang Bei region, at the location of the portal to the Spiritual Realm, the barrier had been reinforced by Li Xuan, making it difficult even for an Immortal Venerable to cross over.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan and the others looked back at the Great Wilderness, they didn't know when they would be able to return to their homeland.</p><p></p><p>"The path of the Dao is long and arduous. The road you have yet to walk is still too long. To have companions accompany you to the end is a blessing in life. True masters are lonely, for being unrivaled is a lonely path."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" The disciples responded with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"So that's why Master chose to seclude himself in the remote wilderness - because being unrivaled is a lonely path, and he had no companions left. Master has been lonely for too long, and that's why he decided to come out of seclusion and take us as disciples, to no longer be alone."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized the reason behind his master's previous seclusion and decision to take them as disciples.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship entered the void once again, and Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu focused their minds to comprehend the mysteries of breaking through the void.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Hongzhou, the top geniuses and experts of the Spiritual Realm had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan gazed at the azure sea, his eyes filled with anticipation, wondering if the person he was looking for would be on the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Yue Changming had also arrived in Hongzhou. Now that the situation in the Spiritual Realm was settled, even if powerful experts came from the other side of the Divine Bridge, they would be unable to change the outcome.</p><p></p><p>It all came down to strength, and their master's strength was unrivaled.</p><p></p><p>"What is the place beyond the Divine Bridge?" Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng and his wife Fu Yun approached, and Fu Yun said, "The place beyond the Divine Bridge is the Divine Realm. According to the records, it is a region close to the center of the heavens and earth, but the specific details are unknown."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>"What faction does the Yuntianbijie City belong to in the Divine Realm?" Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The supreme sects of the Spiritual Realm were all subordinate to a sect in the Divine Realm, which allowed them to dominate the Spiritual Realm and search for and cultivate genius spiritual body cultivators, all for the sake of their superior sect.</p><p></p><p>These hidden secrets were known to these powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not too sure about the specifics. Our Yuntianbijie City and the Sea Spirit Clan both belong to the same superior sect, but only my father and the Sea Spirit Clan's elder would know the details," Fu Yun replied with a shake of her head.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao didn't pursue the matter further and instead moved towards the azure sea, ready to break through.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>At a certain location in the azure sea, a grand formation had been set up. Fang Hao took a deep breath as the great energies of heaven and earth converged, and the azure sea churned with towering waves. Today, he would break through.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master, the御灵府 Master, and the Thundercloud Manor Master frowned as they watched the turbulent azure sea, wondering what Fang Hao was doing and how much stronger he would become after his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Since Fang Hao's master was a terrifyingly powerful expert, even their superior sect might not be able to offend him. Therefore, the only choice was to maintain good relations and resolve any enmity.</p><p></p><p>The heavens and earth's energies converged, and mysterious patterns seemed to form in the sky above. Fang Hao sat cross-legged, and the energies of heaven and earth entered his body. The divine patterns were being refined, and the first divine pattern emerged, emanating a dazzling light and possessing a mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>This divine pattern was different from the previous ones, seeming to be a pattern of the Dao of the Esoteric Martial Path, the embryonic form of a martial Dao technique.</p><p></p><p>"The martial path my senior brothers cultivate relies on the self-generation of divine abilities, which are the Dao of the martial cultivator. This divine pattern of mine is also like a divine ability, belonging to the Dao of the Esoteric Martial Path."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao realized that the divine pattern he was refining was a divine ability pattern of the Esoteric Martial Path.</p><p></p><p>As the divine ability pattern continued to be refined, the second one emerged.</p><p></p><p>One divine ability pattern could be used to deploy one heavenly and earthly esoteric formation with divine ability-like effects. Two divine ability patterns could be used to deploy two such formations.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough continued, and more divine ability patterns were being refined.</p><p></p><p>At the abyss of the azure sea, a place known as the Azure Sea Abyss, a place where divine treasures were said to be born, yet no one dared to venture deep into it, as those who did never returned.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan's divine entity avatar had been unable to explore the depths of the abyss.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the abyss, a crimson glow emerged from a dark cave - the Sky Cavern.</p><p></p><p>The crimson glow continued to surge out, turning the once-dark Sky Cavern into a faint blood-red color. Looking inside, one could see blood waves surging and boiling like a cauldron.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The waters of the azure sea were separated from the Sky Cavern, and within the Sky Cavern, the blood waves rolled and roiled, as if boiling, with the crimson glow constantly erupting.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, figures began to emerge from the blood waves. These figures were no different from humans, but their skin was blood-red, as if soaked in fresh blood, and their auras had a bloodthirsty, sinister quality.</p><p></p><p>If one were familiar with them, they would recognize these as the powerful experts who had once ventured into the Azure Sea Abyss but never returned.</p><p></p><p>Their eyes were a dull red, and they now gazed out towards the azure sea, as if waiting for their opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Gurgle, gurgle! Massive waves suddenly surged up from the blood waves of the Sky Cavern, and these figures formed a circle, reverently looking towards the source of the waves.</p><p></p><p>Plop! A head emerged from the waves.</p><p></p><p>It had long, blood-red hair, a pale face, and a thin crimson line between the eyebrows. Its eyes were a bloodshot red, and it held a crimson longsword in its hand.</p><p></p><p>The tall figure rose from the blood waves, standing atop them, and looked out towards the azure sea with a cold, sinister smile on its lips.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is said that above the Blood Children, there are Blood Spirits. Whether Blood Spirits, Blood Children, or Blood Slaves, they all belong to the mysterious and unknown Blood Lord of the Netherworld, and are all disciples or servants of the Blood Lord of the Netherworld..." </p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned the Blood Spirits, the Netherworld powerhouses above the level of Blood Children, Li Xuan raised an eyebrow, thinking of Blood Spirit Child!</p><p></p><p>Outside the flying ship, Wu Tiannan, who was also listening to Cheng Zhan's explanation, was startled. Ever since seeing the remnants left by Blood Spirit Child, he had known that Blood Spirit Child's demonic techniques came from a remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>All signs indicated that remnant soul came from the Netherworld. He had originally thought it was the remnant soul of a Netherworld Blood Disciple, but now it seemed very likely to be the remnant soul of a Blood Spirit level Netherworld powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>Blood Spirit Child's real name was not originally Blood Spirit Child - that was the name he took after becoming a blood demon.</p><p></p><p>Had a Blood Spirit level Netherworld powerhouse invaded that Heavenly Cave relic in the Spirit Realm? Yet who had killed him? Wu Tiannan was very curious about this.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan continued his explanation.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld exists outside of heaven and earth, and is the main enemy of the Qinghua Realm. All the Heavenly Caves that appear in the Qinghua Realm are Netherworld Heavenly Caves. Even great sects like the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect do not know how long ago the Heavenly Caves first appeared. </p><p></p><p>It seems the Heavenly Caves have existed since the Qinghua Realm came into being.</p><p></p><p>As the name implies, Heavenly Caves are holes in heaven and earth, connected to the Netherworld. Netherworld creatures invade through them, hence they are called Netherworld Heavenly Caves.</p><p></p><p>"...It's not that we don't want to counterattack the Netherworld and invade it. However, although the Heavenly Caves are holes in heaven and earth, they are still restricted. We creatures of this world cannot leave this realm.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Netherworld is indeed very powerful. Our Qinghua Realm alone is far from enough to invade the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>"Every realm in the Divine Realm has Heavenly Caves, but not every realm faces the same enemies. The enemy our Qinghua Realm faces from outside heaven and earth is the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>"The enemies faced by other realms may not necessarily come from the Netherworld."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan sighed, saying rather helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face remained impassive, but his mind was racing. The Taisang world faced external threats, and the appearance of Heavenly Caves was very likely due to some loopholes appearing in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only by thoroughly comprehending the principles in the Taisang Book, and then verifying the current principles of heaven and earth, can one know what these loopholes are.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Netherworld also a world? Are there other worlds outside the Taisang world? Is this a struggle between different worlds?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt his guesses were very close to the truth.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan continued explaining about the Netherworld Heavenly Caves. When he spoke of the Blood Shadow Tower of the Qinghua Realm, he gritted his teeth. They were degenerates, traitors, deserving execution by anyone! To become a Blood Shadow, one must perform blood sacrifices. Therefore, every Blood Shadow's hands were stained with blood from brutally slaughtering innocents.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others took the opportunity to ask about some of their confusions, inquiring about the situation in the Divine Realm and learning about common knowledge there.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Cheng Zhan respectfully bowed to Li Xuan and said, "I implore the senior to consider the people of our Divine Realm and take action to suppress the Blood Shadow Tower Master!"</p><p></p><p>Having one more Immortal Heavenly Venerable was enough to change the situation in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this person?" Li Xuan asked noncommittally. </p><p></p><p>If he encountered the Blood Shadow Tower Master, he would casually kill him.</p><p></p><p>What reason was there not to kill such a brutal villain?</p><p></p><p>"He should be in the Great Yue Kingdom!" Cheng Zhan said hurriedly and respectfully, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to the Great Yue Kingdom." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm's Great Yue Kingdom was currently in the most chaos. Many powerful experts were needed to guard the Heavenly Caves and fight against the invading Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves from the Netherworld, leaving no strong experts free to quell the unrest.</p><p></p><p>The Ten Thousand Thunder Sect and Heavenly Martial Gate also lacked the power to provide support.</p><p></p><p>Next, the Thunder Cloud Manor Lord and others came to pay their respects to Cheng Zhan. They all showed worried expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace belonged to the Heavenly Martial Gate, and Thunder Cloud Mountain Manor belonged to the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect. Both were now in the midst of chaos, and they were all worried about becoming cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Taming Prefecture Lord's face looked even worse. After all, the Spirit Taming Prefecture belonged to the Great Yue Kingdom, and the current situation in the Great Yue Kingdom was clearly very bad, facing the danger of destruction at any time.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Great Zhou Emperor, Fu Tianhai and Xin Mengrou were a bit more relaxed. Their upper sects were not in the Qinghua Realm. Perhaps the realms where their upper sects were located did not have such turmoil? However, to go to their upper sects, they needed to pass through the Qinghua Realm. Moreover, according to past practice, the three major forces of the Qinghua Realm would relay messages on their behalf. Otherwise, they would have to wait for someone from the upper sects to come on their own initiative.</p><p></p><p>As such, they needed to stay in the Qinghua Realm for a period of time. With their current strength, the chaotic Qinghua Realm was far too dangerous.</p><p></p><p>There was the danger of being blood sacrificed at any time.</p><p></p><p>"We must stay close to the expert!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone harbored this thought. Only by closely following the expert would they be safe. Even if they encountered a Blood Child, they would have no fear.</p><p></p><p>"All of you, come aboard," said Fang Hao, looking at the Great Zhou Emperor and the others after getting Li Xuan's permission.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!"</p><p>"Thank you, great one!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor and the others were overjoyed and extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>They all came aboard the Evergreen Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Evergreen Pavilion flying ship expanded once again, turning into a huge ship several hundred zhang long.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan and the others were shocked. What kind of divine artifact was this? It was too miraculous and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Great Yue Kingdom?" Fang Hao asked, looking at Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>"From here, in that direction is the Great Yue Kingdom!" Cheng Zhan hurriedly pointed in a direction.</p><p></p><p>"What about this city?" Xu Yan and the others looked down at Spirit Pass City, which was already dead and silent.</p><p></p><p>"After the Netherworld chaos is settled, we'll arrange for people to come here," Cheng Zhan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>This city was connected to the Spirit Realm, receiving geniuses and martial artists coming from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Those with superior talents would be taken back to the sects for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for the rest of the martial artists with average talent and strength, they would generally be granted cultivation techniques and some cultivation resources, and they would stay in Spirit Pass City.</p><p></p><p>More than half of the martial artists in Spirit Pass City were actually descendants of Spirit Realm martial artists, or martial artists who came from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, they had all been blood sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a streak of light, heading towards the Great Yue Kingdom. As the ship departed, Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed at the valley.</p><p></p><p>No one on the flying ship knew about this action of his, nor did anyone know that Li Xuan had closed off the path to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't completely closed off, but unless the Divine Bridge opened, it would be impossible to go to the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even Immortal Heavenly Venerables would find it difficult to cross over.</p><p></p><p>This way, there was no need to worry about traitors like the Blood Shadows secretly going to the Spirit Realm to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan had connected the Divine Bridge, after arriving in the Divine Realm, he had broken it again somewhat. Unless the Divine Bridge was restored, it could not be opened.</p><p></p><p>For the time being, there was no hope of opening the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>...Qiyun Prefecture, one of the ten prefectures of the Great Yue Kingdom</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Qiyun County was one of the strongest counties in the Great Yue Kingdom, with twenty-three True King Celestial Lords, and eighteen of them stationed in the county capital. </p><p></p><p>It had always been one of the safest counties in the Great Yue Kingdom. Even the Blood Shadow Tower did not dare to recklessly commit evil acts in Qiyun County.</p><p></p><p>Qiyun County also had an Underworld Celestial Cave, but due to Qiyun County's powerful strength, they could easily guard it. They even viewed this Celestial Cave as a place to obtain resources.</p><p></p><p>When the Underworld invaded, killing Underworld Blood Disciples allowed one to obtain items they carried. Among them, the Underworld Blood Pearls were treasures that greatly nourished one's essence and blood. They had excellent auxiliary effects for treating martial artists' injuries, recovering depleted essence and blood, or cultivating certain domineering martial arts methods.</p><p></p><p>In addition, one could also obtain treasures from the Underworld, which were things from outside the Divine Realm and had some extraordinary uses. With luck, killing a Blood Disciple could even yield Underworld divine objects they carried.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Celestial Cave had existed for a long time. Due to the erosion of Underworld blood energy and countless battles where many martial artists perished, some unique divine medicines and treasures were born there.</p><p></p><p>One could even obtain lost martial artist legacies. Someone once acquired an ancient martial artist's notes in the Celestial Cave, obtaining a powerful secret technique from it, as well as learning about some experiences from the ancient martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>This large-scale invasion of the Underworld Celestial Cave seemed to be a planned action by the Underworld. The leader of the Blood Shadow Tower unexpectedly broke through to the Immortal Celestial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, the Great Yue Kingdom immediately fell into chaos. Qiyun County managed to guard the Celestial Cave, suppressing the invading Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves back. They even had extra strength to support other places.</p><p></p><p>In Qiyun County, only eight of the eighteen True King Celestial Lords remained in the city to guard it. Even if the Blood Shadow Tower occasionally committed evil acts, they could still handle it.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Qiyun County remained on high alert. All martial artists were in a state of vigilance, ready to respond to any emerging crisis at any time.</p><p></p><p>Outside Qiyun County, several figures stood gazing at this great city.</p><p></p><p>The leader, a young man, had a mark on his brow. Unlike the bright red skin of Blood Disciples, his skin only had a faint red tinge.</p><p></p><p>Standing respectfully beside the young man were several people with light red skin, wearing blood-red robes. They were martial artists from the Blood Shadow Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this is Qiyun County. There are currently eight True Kings guarding it," one of the Blood Shadows said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good. Once I blood sacrifice this city, I can advance to become a Blood Child. Prepare to take action according to the plan," the young man's eyes revealed a bloodthirsty look.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!" the Blood Shadow responded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child! Once their lord became a Blood Child, his status would rise dramatically. He might even have a chance to break through to the Immortal Celestial Lord realm, becoming a powerhouse like the leader of the Blood Shadow Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Do well. Qiyun County will be the stepping stone for me to become a Blood Child, and the Great Yue Kingdom will be the opportunity for me to advance to Blood Spirit. We don't need to blood sacrifice the entire Great Yue Kingdom. Sacrificing one-third will be enough. Once I become a Blood Spirit, you will be a Blood Child under my command!" the young man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>Becoming a Blood Child meant surpassing the Immortal Celestial Lord in status and truly integrating into the Underworld. As long as they hadn't truly integrated into the Underworld, these Blood Shadows were all considered people without status.</p><p></p><p>The young man before them came from the Underworld and had some background there. The Blood Shadow Tower had plotted for a long time to successfully assist him in entering the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>This large-scale Underworld invasion seemed to be aimed at helping this lord advance to Blood Child, and then to Blood Spirit!</p><p></p><p>"Qinghua Realm should have called for outside help by now. We must act quickly and complete the plan before reinforcements arrive!" the young man instructed gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, sir. We can blood sacrifice Qiyun County in three days!" The Blood Shadow bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>The young man then began walking towards Qiyun County at a leisurely pace. At this speed, he would enter Qiyun County in three days.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in Qiyun County, the eight True King Celestial Lords gathered to discuss defense matters.</p><p></p><p>As the meeting ended, one True King Celestial Lord claimed to have urgent matters to report and approached the city lord of Qiyun County.</p><p></p><p>The city lord, unsuspecting, looked curiously at that True King Celestial Lord. The other True King Celestial Lords were preparing to leave to guard their respective areas.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the city lord of Qiyun County let out an angry roar, erupting with powerful momentum, but it weakened in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The other True King Celestial Lords immediately changed their expressions, turning back to look with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>That True King Celestial Lord who claimed to have urgent matters to report had actually ambushed the city lord, severely injuring him in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that the city lord was the strongest in Qiyun County, at the peak of the Refining Truth realm, known as Qiyun County's number one True King Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Traitor, kill him!" In an instant, the other True King Celestial Lords came to their senses and roared, preparing to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, blood light soared to the sky, and several blood shadows attacked. Each blood shadow had the strength of a True King Celestial Lord, and one of them was even comparable to the peak of the Refining Truth realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the city lord severely injured, no one was his match!</p><p></p><p>The city lord of Qiyun County suddenly roared, a large halberd in his hand crossing the sky, using his last remaining strength to severely injure the ambusher.</p><p></p><p>A nearby True King Celestial Lord seized the opportunity to strike, killing that traitorous True King Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>This was an unwritten rule in Qinghua Realm - enemies might be spared, but traitors must die! This served as a warning to anyone considering betrayal to think twice!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Qiyun County fell into chaos, with killing sounds shaking the heavens. Blood shadows appeared one after another.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Blood Shadow, kill them!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of Qiyun County were formidable. In an instant, many Condensing Law Celestial Lords and martial artists of various realms roared, joining forces to attack those blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly send a message, Qiyun County is under attack, traitors have appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! At this moment, a crimson blood light appeared over Qiyun County, like a cover enveloping the sky above the city.</p><p></p><p>Under the crimson blood light, streams of what looked like crimson flames coiled like giant pythons, sweeping towards the entire Qiyun County.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Those few True King Celestial Lords who were in battle suddenly contracted their pupils, revealing shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld Divine Artifact, the Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Cover!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the True King Celestial Lords and many well-informed martial artists turned pale, revealing fearful expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld Divine Artifact, the Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Cover, was renowned for its unparalleled killing power, a demonic divine artifact for blood sacrificing martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Only those at the level of Underworld Blood Disciple or above possessed such a killing artifact.</p><p></p><p>Once the Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Cover appeared, it meant that an Underworld Blood Disciple, or even a Blood Child, had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it certainly meant blood sacrificing a region.</p><p></p><p>The Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Cover was a blood sacrificing divine artifact that could instantly envelop an area. All living beings covered within would be blood sacrificed, becoming nourishment for Underworld martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Cover also varied in strength. One that could cover Qiyun County was so powerful that these True King Celestial Lords couldn't break it.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child! At this moment, the hearts of the few True King Celestial Lords sank.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 370</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It is said that above the Blood Disciples, there are also the Blood Spirits, and regardless of whether they are Blood Spirits, Blood Disciples, or Blood Slaves, they all belong to the mysterious and unknown Underworld Blood Lord, and they are all disciples or servants of the Underworld Blood Lord..."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan continued speaking.</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned the Underworld powerhouses above the Blood Disciples, the Blood Spirits level, Li Xuan couldn't help but furrow his brows. He thought of the Blood Spirit Disciple!</p><p></p><p>Outside the flying ship, Wu Tiannan, who was also listening to Cheng Zhan's explanation, was also startled. Ever since he saw the remnants left behind by the Blood Spirit Disciple, he already knew that the demonic cultivation of the Blood Spirit Disciple originally came from a remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>All the clues indicated that the remnant soul was from the Underworld. Originally, they thought it was the remnant soul of an Underworld Blood Disciple, but now it seems highly likely that it was the remnant soul of an Underworld powerhouse at the Blood Spirit level.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Disciple's real name was not actually "Blood Spirit Disciple", but he took on that name after becoming a Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>The relic of the Spiritual Realm's Sky Cave, was it once invaded by an Underworld powerhouse at the Blood Spirit level? But who killed it? Wu Tiannan was very curious about this.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan continued his explanation.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld is outside the Heavens and Earth, the main enemy of the Spiritual Realm, and all the Sky Caves that appeared in the Spiritual Realm were Underworld Sky Caves. Even a great sect like the Myriad Thunder Sect did not know how long the Sky Caves had existed.</p><p></p><p>It seems that the Spiritual Realm has existed since the Sky Caves were already there.</p><p></p><p>And as the name suggests, the Sky Caves are the holes in the Heavens and Earth, connected to the Underworld, and the Underworld creatures have invaded through them, hence the name "Underworld Sky Caves".</p><p></p><p>"...In fact, it's not that we don't want to counterattack the Underworld and occupy it, but the Sky Caves, although they are the holes in the Heavens and Earth, are still restricted. We, the creatures of the Heavens and Earth, cannot leave this realm.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Underworld is indeed very powerful, and the Spiritual Realm alone is far from enough to invade the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan sighed, expressing his helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"Each divine realm has Sky Caves, and the enemies they face are not necessarily the same. The enemy that the Spiritual Realm faces from outside the Heavens and Earth is the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"But the enemies faced by the other realms may not necessarily be from the Underworld."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan sighed again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face remained calm, but his heart was stirring. The Vast Heavens and Earth face external threats, and the appearance of the Sky Caves may be due to some loopholes in the Heavens and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps only by thoroughly comprehending the principles in the Vast Heavens Book and verifying the current principles of the Heavens and Earth, can we know the nature of these loopholes.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Underworld also a realm? Could it be that there are realms outside the Vast Heavens and Earth, and this is a struggle between realms?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that his guess was very close to the truth.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan continued to explain the Underworld Sky Caves, and when he mentioned the Blood Shadow Tower in the Spiritual Realm, he gritted his teeth, calling them scum and traitors, and that everyone should eliminate them. To become a Blood Shadow, one must perform a blood sacrifice, so every Blood Shadow has blood on their hands, ruthlessly slaughtering the innocent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others also took the opportunity to ask some questions and inquire about the situation in the divine realms, trying to understand the common knowledge of the divine realms.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Cheng Zhan respectfully bowed to Li Xuan and said, "Please, senior, with the welfare of our Spiritual Realm in mind, subdue the Blood Shadow Tower master!"</p><p></p><p>Having an Immortal Venerable would be enough to change the situation in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the person?" Li Xuan asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>If he encountered the Blood Shadow Tower master, he would just casually kill him.</p><p></p><p>Such a ruthless and cruel person, how could he be spared?</p><p></p><p>"He should be in the Great Yue Kingdom!" Cheng Zhan said excitedly and respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go to the Great Yue Kingdom," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm, especially the Great Yue Kingdom, is currently in great chaos, and many powerhouses are needed to guard the Sky Caves and fight against the Underworld Blood Disciples and Blood Slaves. The Myriad Thunder Sect and the Heaven Martial Gate do not have the strength to provide support.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the sect leaders like the Thundercloud Manor Lord came to see Cheng Zhan, their faces filled with worry.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall belongs to the Heaven Martial Gate, and the Thundercloud Mountain Manor belongs to the Myriad Thunder Sect. Now they are in great turmoil, and they are afraid of becoming cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>The御灵府 (Yù Líng Fǔ) Lord's expression was even more grim, as the Yù Líng Fǔ belongs to the Great Yue Kingdom, and the Great Yue Kingdom is obviously in a very precarious situation, facing the danger of annihilation at any time.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor, Fu Tianhai, and Xin Mengrou's expressions were a bit more relaxed. Their sect is not in the Spiritual Realm, so perhaps their sect's realm is not in such turmoil. However, to go to their sect, they need to pass through the Spiritual Realm, and according to past practice, the three major powers of the Spiritual Realm would be the ones to deliver the messages, otherwise they would have to wait for their sect master to come in person.</p><p></p><p>In this way, they would have to stay in the chaotic Spiritual Realm for a while, which is too dangerous for their current strength. They may be in danger of being blood sacrificed at any time.</p><p></p><p>"We must stick close to the senior!" This was the thought in everyone's mind. Only by closely following the senior would they not be in danger, even if they encountered Blood Disciples, they would not be afraid.</p><p></p><p>"Come up," Fang Hao looked at the Great Zhou Emperor and the others, and after getting Li Xuan's permission, he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" "Thank you, senior!" The Great Zhou Emperor and the others were overjoyed and extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>They all boarded the Changqing Pavilion's flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Changqing Pavilion's flying ship expanded again, becoming a giant ship hundreds of meters long.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan and the others were shocked and amazed, this was some kind of divine artifact, so miraculous and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Great Yue Kingdom?" Fang Hao asked Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>"From here, that is the direction of the Great Yue Kingdom!" Cheng Zhan hurriedly pointed in a direction.</p><p></p><p>"What about this city?" Xu Yan and the others looked down at the silent Linguan City.</p><p></p><p>"We'll arrange for people to come here after we've settled the Underworld's chaos," Cheng Zhan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This city is the connecting point to the Spiritual Realm, receiving geniuses and warriors from the Spiritual Realm. The talented ones are taken back to the sects for cultivation, while the average ones are given cultivation methods and resources, and they remain in Linguan City.</p><p></p><p>More than half of the warriors in Linguan City are actually from the Spiritual Realm or are Spiritual Realm warriors.</p><p></p><p>Now, they have all been blood sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a beam of light and headed towards the Great Yue Kingdom. As the flying ship departed, Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed towards the ravine.</p><p></p><p>No one on the flying ship knew about his action, nor did they know that Li Xuan had already closed the path to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was not a complete closure, but unless the Divine Bridge opened, no one could cross over, not even an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In this way, there would be no need to worry about traitors like the Blood Shadows sneaking into the Spiritual Realm to cause trouble.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan had connected the Divine Bridge, after arriving in the divine realm, he had also broken some parts of the Divine Bridge. Unless the Divine Bridge was restored, it could not be opened. In the short term, there was no way to open the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>...The Qiyun Prefecture, the 10th region of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>One of the prefectures of the Great Strong Kingdom, the True Monarch Celestial Lords in this prefecture number up to twenty-three, and there are even eighteen True Monarch Celestial Lords stationed in the prefecture capital.</p><p></p><p>This prefecture has always been one of the safest in the Great Yue Kingdom, even the Blood Shadow Tower did not dare to act recklessly here.</p><p></p><p>The Qiyu Prefecture also has an Underworld Prison Celestial Cave, but due to the formidable strength of the Qiyu Prefecture, it can be easily guarded.</p><p></p><p>They even treat this Celestial Cave as a place to obtain resources.</p><p></p><p>By invading the Underworld Prison, killing the Underworld Blood Acolytes, one can obtain the items they carry, including the Underworld Blood Pearls, which are precious treasures that can greatly replenish one's spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>They have excellent auxiliary effects for healing wounded martial artists, restoring depleted spiritual blood, or cultivating certain tyrannical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In addition, they can also obtain treasures from the Underworld, things from beyond the divine realm, which also have extraordinary uses.</p><p></p><p>If they are lucky, they can even obtain Underworld divine artifacts from the slain Blood Acolytes.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Celestial Cave has existed for a long time, and due to the erosion of Underworld blood qi and countless battles, many martial artists have perished, giving birth to some unique divine medicines and treasures.</p><p></p><p>They can even obtain the lost inheritances of these martial artists.</p><p></p><p>There have been those who, in the Celestial Cave, obtained the ancient manuscripts of martial artists, from which they learned powerful secret techniques and gained insights into the ancient martial dao.</p><p></p><p>This large-scale invasion of the Underworld Celestial Cave seems to be a planned action by the Underworld. The leader of the Blood Shadow Tower has even unexpectedly broken through to the Immortal Celestial Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>Caught off guard, the Great Yue Kingdom has fallen into great chaos, but the Qiyu Prefecture has managed to defend the Celestial Cave, suppressing the invading Blood Acolytes and Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>They even have the spare strength to support other places.</p><p></p><p>In the Qiyu Prefecture, of the eighteen True Monarch Celestial Lords, only eight are stationed in the city now. Even if the Blood Shadow Tower occasionally causes trouble, they can still handle it.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the Qiyu Prefecture city remains on high alert, with all martial artists on guard, ready to respond to any emerging crises.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Qiyu Prefecture city, several figures stand, gazing at the great city.</p><p></p><p>The leader, a young man with a mark between his brows, his skin faintly reddish, unlike the scarlet skin of the Blood Acolytes.</p><p></p><p>Beside the young man, a few people stand respectfully, their skin faintly red, wearing blood-red robes.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Blood Shadow Tower.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, this is the Qiyu Prefecture, which now has eight True Monarchs stationed here."</p><p></p><p>A Blood Shadow member said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, very good. By sacrificing this city, I will be able to ascend to become a Blood Child. Prepare to take action according to the plan."</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes revealed a bloodthirsty gleam.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow member responded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>To become a Blood Child! Once the lord becomes a Blood Child, his status will rise, and he may even have the chance to break through to the Immortal Celestial Lord realm, like the leader of the Blood Shadow Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Do a good job. The Qiyu Prefecture is the stepping stone for me to become a Blood Child, and the Great Yue Kingdom is the opportunity for me to ascend to become a Blood Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to sacrifice the entire Great Yue Kingdom, sacrificing a third of it will be enough. Once I enter the Blood Spirit realm, you will be a Blood Child under my command!"</p><p></p><p>The young man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>To become a Blood Child, to have a status surpassing the Immortal Celestial Lords, to truly integrate into the Underworld, as long as they have not fully integrated into the Underworld, these Blood Shadows are still people without identities.</p><p></p><p>The young man in front of them comes from the Underworld and has some background there. The Blood Shadow Tower has been planning for a long time to assist him in entering the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>This large-scale Underworld invasion seems to be aimed at helping this lord ascend to become a Blood Child, and then a Blood Spirit!</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm should seek outside aid, act quickly, before the reinforcements arrive, complete the plan!"</p><p></p><p>The young man gave the solemn order.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, rest assured, we will be able to sacrifice the Qiyu Prefecture city in three days!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Shadow member bowed and retreated.</p><p></p><p>The young man then stepped towards the Qiyu Prefecture city, his pace not too fast, at this speed he can reach the city in three days.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Qiyu Prefecture city, the eight True Monarch Celestial Lords have gathered to discuss defensive measures.</p><p></p><p>After the meeting, one True Monarch Celestial Lord claimed to have an important matter to report, approaching the Qiyu Prefecture lord.</p><p></p><p>The Qiyu Prefecture lord had no suspicions and looked at the True Monarch Celestial Lord curiously, while the other True Monarchs were preparing to leave and guard their respective areas.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Qiyu Prefecture lord let out a furious roar, unleashing a powerful aura, but it quickly weakened.</p><p></p><p>The other True Monarch Celestial Lords were stunned, turning back to look, disbelief on their faces.</p><p></p><p>The True Monarch Celestial Lord who had claimed to have an important matter had actually sneak-attacked the lord, instantly severely injuring him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the lord was the number one expert of the Qiyu Prefecture, at the peak of the Refine Reality realm, known as the number one True Monarch Celestial Lord of the Qiyu Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"Traitor, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the other True Monarch Celestial Lords regained their senses, roaring as they prepared to attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, a burst of blood light shot into the sky, several Blood Shadow figures rushed in, each one at the True Monarch Celestial Lord level, and one of them even rivaled the peak of the Refine Reality realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the lord severely injured, no one could match him.</p><p></p><p>The Qiyu Prefecture lord suddenly roared, wielding a great halberd with his last ounce of strength, heavily injuring the sneak-attacker.</p><p></p><p>A True Monarch Celestial Lord in the distance took the opportunity to strike, killing the traitorous True Monarch Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>This was an unwritten rule in the Qinghua Realm - enemies could be spared, but traitors must die! To serve as a warning, anyone who dared to betray would have to consider the consequences.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Qiyu Prefecture city descended into chaos, the sound of slaughter echoing. Blood Shadow figures emerged one after another.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Blood Shadows, kill them!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Qiyu Prefecture were not weak, in an instant, many Condensed Fa Celestial Lords and martial artists of various realms roared as they joined forces to attack the Blood Shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, send a message, the Qiyu Prefecture city has been attacked, there are traitors!"</p><p></p><p>Hum! At this moment, a scarlet blood light appeared in the sky above the Qiyu Prefecture city, like a dome covering the entire city.</p><p></p><p>Under the scarlet blood light, crimson flames, like giant serpents, coiled and swept towards the Qiyu Prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The True Monarch Celestial Lords fighting were startled, their pupils constricting, revealing fear on their faces.</p><p></p><p>"The Underworld divine artifact, the Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the True Monarch Celestial Lords and many knowledgeable martial artists turned deathly pale, their expressions filled with terror.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld divine artifact, the Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome, renowned for its unparalleled killing power, a demonic artifact that sacrifices martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Only Underworld Blood Acolytes and above can wield this terrifying killing artifact.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome meant that an Underworld Blood Acolyte, or even a Blood Child, had arrived.</p><p></p><p>And they would surely be sacrificing a region.</p><p></p><p>The Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome is a blood sacrifice artifact, instantly enveloping an area, and all living beings trapped within will be sacrificed, becoming nourishment for the Underworld martial artists.</p><p></p><p>And the Slaughter Life Blood Refining Dome has varying strengths, the one able to cover the Qiyu Prefecture city is so powerful that these True Monarch Celestial Lords cannot break it.</p><p></p><p>A Blood Child! At this moment, the hearts of the True Monarch Celestial Lords sank.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

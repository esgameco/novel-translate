        <h1>Chapter 153</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After leaving the spiritual medicine treasure land, due to concerns about the powerful experts from the black-robed person's faction, the three of them tried to move through the mountains and forests, hiding their tracks.</p><p></p><p>Arriving outside a city, Xu Yan and Meng Chong waited outside the city, while Meng Shushu disguised himself and went into the city to the Tianbao Pavilion to purchase spiritual medicine sealing talismans.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Shushu bought the sealing talismans and finished sealing the spiritual medicines, they set out to return to the territory of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Halfway there, a flying eagle descended.</p><p></p><p>It was the flying eagle from Sword Saint Cliff, following the flying eagle token on Xu Yan, carrying a letter from Xie Lingfeng inquiring if they needed any assistance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wrote a reply letter and had the eagle take it back.</p><p></p><p>"This is the flying eagle from Sword Saint Cliff?" Meng Shushu exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, you recognize it?" Xu Yan asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother Xu, as a spiritual medicine explorer, I naturally need to be familiar with and understand the major powers. We would sometimes use their flying eagles for communication when cooperating, so I can naturally recognize them," Meng Shushu explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan understood.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, can you cultivate and organize a flying eagle communication network?" Xu Yan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Since they needed to enter the inner domain, a convenient communication method like flying eagle transmission was indispensable. Relying on others' flying eagles was not a reliable long-term solution.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a spiritual medicine explorer, how would I know about that?" Meng Shushu hurriedly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianbao Pavilion can rent out flying eagle communication services. Many powers that can't build their own flying eagle network just rent from the Tianbao Pavilion, although the prices are quite high. Of course, you can also rent it for single-use temporary usage, and so far there haven't been any incidents of information leaks from the Tianbao Pavilion's flying eagle communication," Meng Shushu explained after thinking it over.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianbao Pavilion really is extraordinary, they have all kinds of businesses," Meng Chong sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out the jade token given by the woman in white clothes and asked, "Is this what you mean by renting the Tianbao Pavilion's flying eagle communication?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this jade token can only be used to obtain information from the Tianbao Pavilion, not to receive flying eagle transmissions. It's one of the cheaper options. Most powers use this, mainly to obtain news from the martial dao world, and it still costs over 100,000 spirit crystals per year," Meng Shushu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly astonished. The Tianbao Pavilion was really formidable, just to obtain information would cost over 100,000 spirit crystals per year. How many powers were there in the inner domain? Even just within the Great Yue Kingdom, the number of powers was staggering, not to mention the vast regions outside the three major kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that the Tianbao Pavilion's flying eagle information network was entirely funded by the various powers, without needing to invest their own resources.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Great Yue Kingdom, Xu Yan felt slightly relieved, as there were no peak Dao Ancestors chasing after them. It wasn't that he feared the Dao Ancestors, but he was worried that if a battle broke out, the heavenly drop marrow and several sixth-grade spiritual medicines could be damaged, which would be impossible to make up for, as fifth-grade spiritual medicines were unobtainable.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, for your safety, I will send you to Blue Peace Prefecture," Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't afraid of Dao Ancestor experts, as he could easily kill them with a single sword strike without damaging the spiritual medicines. But if half-step Dao Ancestors or even Dao Ancestors came, the situation would become dire.</p><p></p><p>The three of them headed straight for Blue Peace Prefecture. Blue Peace Prefecture was a border prefecture, extremely far from their current location. To reach Blue Peace Prefecture or Iron Mountain County would take a significant amount of time.</p><p></p><p>And to avoid any accidents, Xu Yan tried to remain as low-key as possible. Killing Dao Ancestors was not urgent, the spiritual medicines were the most important.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, Elder Brother Xu, I'll hide in Blue Peace Prefecture for a while until the storm blows over. Then I'll continue searching for spiritual medicines. How can I contact you two in the future?" Meng Shushu asked as they were about to enter the borders of Blue Peace Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "In the future, you can go to Iron Mountain County and contact my people, or you can contact Xie Lingfeng and have him relay the message."</p><p></p><p>Iron Mountain County was a border area, and after bringing the spiritual medicines back to the border region, the number of border cultivators would surely increase, and entering the inner domain was inevitable. Iron Mountain County would be the first stop for these border cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Meng Shushu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"My family member, work hard and try to earn a few storage pouches as soon as possible!" Meng Chong encouraged, patting Meng Shushu's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try my best," Meng Shushu said, on the verge of tears. How many spiritual medicines did he need to collect to afford a storage pouch?</p><p></p><p>Just as they entered the borders of Blue Peace Prefecture, Xu Yan suddenly stopped in his tracks, extending his arm to block Meng Chong and Meng Shushu. His gaze was grave as he looked ahead.</p><p></p><p>A figure was approaching, step by step, and wherever it passed, the ground seemed to be scorched black, as if burned by fire.</p><p></p><p>It was a person wearing a scarlet red robe, with a hooded head covering their face, which was deathly pale. In their hand was a skeletal staff, the top of which was a skull with red flames flickering in the eye sockets and mouth.</p><p></p><p>A Dao Ancestor expert! Xu Yan took out the spiritual medicines from his body and handed them to Meng Chong, saying, "Junior brother, be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, don't worry," Meng Chong replied solemnly, his hand resting on the hilt of his sword, vigilantly scanning the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu stared wide-eyed at the Dao Ancestor, his scalp tingling and his body trembling slightly.</p><p></p><p>"My family member, your courage is too small!" Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"He... he is the Demonic Butcher Sovereign!" Meng Shushu wailed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both taken aback. The Demonic Butcher Sovereign?</p><p></p><p>One of the nine Demonic Sovereigns of the Demon Sect, known as one of the three most infamous Demonic Sovereigns. He was extremely brutal, cultivating a killing technique, and upon breaking through to the Dao Ancestor realm, he had slaughtered hundreds of Origin Realm cultivators and dozens of Dao Realm experts, refining their essence blood to reach the Dao Ancestor realm.</p><p></p><p>He was the most brutal of the nine Demonic Sovereigns, and his whereabouts were hidden, precisely to avoid being hunted down by other Dao Ancestors.</p><p></p><p>"No, the Demonic Butcher Sovereign couldn't be this weak," Xu Yan suddenly shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Weak?" Meng Shushu was taken aback, swallowing hard. "Elder Brother Xu, the Demonic Butcher Sovereign is a peak Dao Ancestor, ranking among the top thirty in the inner domain."</p><p></p><p>"Then you must have mistaken him. He is only a mid-Dao Realm expert, not a peak Dao Ancestor. Although his strength is greater than the black-robed one I killed, he is still far from a peak Dao Ancestor," Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"So it's not the Demonic Butcher Sovereign, but one of his Dao Ancestor subordinates," Meng Shushu sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Dao Ancestor slowly approached, his aura clearly locking onto Xu Yan, but he was not hurrying, showing no fear of the three of them trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Black Robe is under the command of the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned.</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible. The Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign's character would not involve a group of people who are evasive. Then why has this great grandmaster come here?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu-shu asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered. He had escorted Du Yu-ying back home and killed several demonic sect grandmasters, including the Illusionary Demon Master. Could it be that they were all under the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign's command? Now, the opposing grandmaster has come to their doorstep.</p><p></p><p>The threat faced by the Du Marquis Mansion was not small at all, as the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign had intervened secretly. It is unknown what the inside story is.</p><p></p><p>However, everything has already become the past. He, under the name of Xie Ling-feng, had repelled Yin Hong and the threat from the Sword Saint Cliff. He was truly powerful, and the threat to the Du Marquis Mansion was immediately resolved.</p><p></p><p>In the Seven Star Academy, he had already reported his own name, clarifying that he was not Xie Ling-feng. So, is the powerful cultivator from the Fiery Demon Sovereign's faction coming to seek revenge on him?</p><p></p><p>"Are you Xu Yan?" The demonic grandmaster asked in a cold tone, his gaze fixed on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"It's me!" Xu Yan nodded directly.</p><p></p><p>"Since it's you, remember, I am the Killing Skeleton under the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign!" A crimson flame burst out from the Killing Skeleton's skull, burning fiercely. The Killing Skeleton now held a flaming staff.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Meng Shu-shu hurriedly retreated to a distance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze became slightly more serious. The flaming staff held by the Killing Skeleton was the manifestation of his power. There was no temperature, only a chilling aura. It seemed to be able to incinerate everything, corroding all living beings, even more terrifying than deadly poison.</p><p></p><p>The opponent cultivated the Killing Technique, and it was very likely the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign's infamous Infernal Blood Refinement Technique, refining the cultivators' blood and the blood of living beings into the Infernal Blood Flame!</p><p></p><p>"Your essence blood, I have taken it. Everything of yours, I have taken it. This time, the harvest seems quite good," the Killing Skeleton said in a sinister tone, his gaze lingering on the large bag in Meng Chong's hand, revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, be careful. The Killing Skeleton is one of the three strongest under the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign, having killed countless people. That Infernal Blood Flame is extremely terrifying. Once it touches you, it cannot be extinguished, and you will surely die!" Meng Shu-shu hurriedly warned.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, correct, so you know of my reputation!" The Killing Skeleton glanced at Meng Shu-shu, his icy cold gaze making Meng Shu-shu almost break out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Without Meng Shu-shu's reminder, Xu Yan also knew the Killing Skeleton's danger. However, the threat of the Infernal Blood Flame to him was not that great. At least, it could not burn his innate true qi.</p><p></p><p>"You are a powerful cultivator under the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign, and also a grandmaster. You must have done a lot of killing and robbing, right?" Xu Yan suddenly thought of something, his eyes shining as he asked.</p><p></p><p>The Killing Skeleton frowned, feeling that this young man's expression was a bit off. Shouldn't he be afraid or solemn?</p><p></p><p>Why was he asking about these things? "Of course, my name 'Killing Skeleton' is precisely because I have killed so many. Young man, don't even think about begging for mercy. I will not spare you."</p><p></p><p>The Killing Skeleton sneered.</p><p></p><p>"How much spiritual stones do you have on you?" Xu Yan asked excitedly. This Killing Skeleton was a grandmaster, a powerful cultivator under the Demon Sovereign. He had killed countless people, so he should be quite wealthy, right? This was a money bag coming to him!</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean?" The Killing Skeleton frowned, finding Xu Yan's attitude a bit problematic.</p><p></p><p>"I've killed several demonic sect grandmasters, but they all turned out to be paupers, embarrassing the demonic dao. I hope you won't disappoint me. Whenever I make a move, I must never leave empty-handed.</p><p></p><p>"As a demonic grandmaster, you should be quite rich, right? You're not a poor wretch, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" The Killing Skeleton was furious, feeling that Xu Yan was disrespecting him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Terrifying Infernal Blood Flame surged up, and he wielded the skeletal staff, whipping up a fearsome crimson flame that let out a hissing sound, fiercely attacking Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you be so arrogant!" Xu Yan slashed out with his sword, Mountain and River Dragon Roar!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of Mountain and River was majestic, the dragon's roar resounding. Immediately after, he struck out with a palm, a golden giant dragon wrapped in it, fierce and unmatched, with the most yang and robust energy, rushing into the Infernal Blood Flame.</p><p></p><p>Although the Infernal Blood Flame seemed powerful, it ultimately succumbed to the yin and evil technique. It was not an exaggeration to call it a sinister force.</p><p></p><p>But the Descending Dragon Palm technique, with its utmost yang and robust energy, was precisely what could suppress the Infernal Blood Flame.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon roared, its mighty power causing the Infernal Blood Flame to continuously dissipate, as if it could not corrode the golden giant dragon at all. Instead, under the bombardment of the golden dragon, the Infernal Blood Flame kept weakening.</p><p></p><p>"You!" The Killing Skeleton's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot let you live!" Xu Yan coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this, that could actually counter his technique? The skeletal staff emitting a sinister aura, the flames turning into countless skeletons that fell from the sky, seemingly wanting to bury and incinerate all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will slay you, and then I'll see how the Fiery Extermination Demon Sovereign will fare. Daring to offend me, Xu Yan, just wait for me to come knocking on his door."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon circled, and his long sword struck down.</p><p></p><p>Sword of the Myriad Worlds and All Beings!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Killing Skeleton's expression was horrified. Facing the crisis, a surge of blood energy erupted from his body, instantly forming a protective shield around him.</p><p></p><p>The Infernal Blood Flame gushing out from the skeletal staff converged into a giant blade, fiercely slashing out, trying to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he flickered and was about to flee.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength was far beyond his expectations, and that terrifying golden dragon, fierce and ardent, could actually suppress his Infernal Blood Flame. In this case, his powerful Killing Technique could not display its full might.</p><p></p><p>"You've come, so don't even think about escaping. No enemy can ever escape from me, Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed down with his sword again, and his palm struck out once more.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Eighteen golden dragons surged out, circling all around, converging from the outside inward, attacking.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" The Killing Skeleton's expression changed drastically, his face revealing a ferocious and malicious look.</p><p></p><p>Bang! His robe instantly exploded, and a blood-colored energy gushed out from his body, as if the entire heaven and earth were filled with a nauseating bloody scent.</p><p></p><p>The massive blood-colored energy erupted from the Killing Skeleton's body, surging into the skeletal staff, while his own body rapidly withered.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to kill me, then we'll die together!" The Killing Skeleton's face was hideous, and the skeletal staff had turned blood-red, emanating a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan was even angrier than him. "Give me back my spirit tickets!"</p><p></p><p>The Killing Skeleton's robe had exploded, and the money bags he was carrying were also shattered, with the spirit tickets and other items inside destroyed as well.</p><p></p><p>This meant that even if Xu Yan killed the opponent, he would not gain anything!</p><p></p><p>This made him so furious that he could not hold back. Since the spirit tickets were gone, he no longer needed to worry about damaging them when striking. His sword intent instantly surged, the aura of ruthless killing making the heavens and earth seem to change color.</p><p></p><p>The Killing Skeleton, who had already prepared to fight to the death, suddenly felt a chill run down his spine. That killing intent, that terrifying murderous aura, was even more frightening than his own as a demonic cultivator!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

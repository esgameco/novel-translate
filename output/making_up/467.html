        <h1>Chapter 467</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Dragon Abyss was said to have been formed by the fall of a true dragon, though the truth of this could not be verified.</p><p></p><p>But on this day, a flawless jade-white true dragon did indeed fall from the collapsing sky.</p><p></p><p>Within the Dragon Mountain realm, all spirit beasts trembled and prostrated themselves on the ground, not daring to make a sound. </p><p></p><p>At that moment, all martial artists seemed to hear a majestic roar that shook heaven and earth, and an inexplicable fear arose in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, almost instinctively, they raised their heads to look in the direction of Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Did that flood dragon find a true dragon treasure and transform into a true dragon?" some martial artists exclaimed in shock and doubt.</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible, right? Even if it found a true dragon treasure, it wouldn't necessarily be able to transform into a true dragon. What kind of power does it have anyway?"</p><p></p><p>"It couldn't be... a true dragon descending into the world, could it?"</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists with keen senses of danger had already frantically fled towards the realm gate, escaping from the Dragon Mountain realm.</p><p></p><p>Outside Dragon Abyss, Sky Seventeen, who had been guarding it all along, had already swiftly departed when the dragon's roar sounded and the dark clouds began to disperse.</p><p></p><p>"It has finally succeeded. Next, we just need to wait for the Heavenly Ladder in the Great Harmony Realm to open!"</p><p></p><p>"With the chaos of the true dragon and the calamity in the Divine Realm, if the Heavenly Ladder doesn't open now, when will it open?"</p><p></p><p>"I need to leave quickly, otherwise with my strength, I'll be the first target of the true dragon. It's a pity about the Wind Spirit Tiger, but it got its wish to enhance its bloodline. Though I never said it would survive after enhancing its bloodline!"</p><p></p><p>"The most crucial step of the Lord's mission has finally been completed. Next will be the descent of the Dao Realm to merge with the Divine Realm, the initial reunification of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>"When heaven and earth reunify, the Lord will surely seize the opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"As expected of the Lord, to actually trap a true dragon in this small space above Dragon Abyss, and then open a rift between the Divine Realm and Dao Realm, allowing the qi of the Dao Realm to pour down."</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen marveled inwardly at the Lord's brilliant methods and flawless planning.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's Xu Yan, Meng Chong, or even Jiang Buping, none of them are worth worrying about. Let them contribute themselves to the reunification of heaven and earth amidst the chaos of the true dragon and the calamity in the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Arriving at the realm gate, he didn't rush to leave, but silently looked towards the direction of Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, feeling the tremors of heaven and earth, hearing the dragon's roar drifting over, he smiled and stepped through the realm gate to depart.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above Dragon Abyss, a jade-white true dragon hundreds of zhang long, wrapped in lightning and blizzard, its eyes blood-red, its dragon might shaking heaven and earth, its frenzied killing intent completely unconcealed.</p><p></p><p>And beneath the true dragon was the trembling Wind Spirit Tiger. That dragon claw was about to crush and tear the Wind Spirit Tiger to pieces! At this life-or-death moment, the Wind Spirit Tiger saw that jade talisman! This jade talisman was something Red Cat had specially requested from Li Xuan for the Wind Spirit Tiger, with the purpose of saving the Wind Spirit Tiger's life. It was precisely for this reason that the jade talisman quietly emerged at the most critical moment, allowing the Wind Spirit Tiger to notice it.</p><p></p><p>If the Wind Spirit Tiger didn't activate the jade talisman, it would have activated automatically at the last moment. </p><p></p><p>After all, it was just meant to save the Wind Spirit Tiger from danger.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The jade talisman was activated. In an instant, the Wind Spirit Tiger felt an immense power acting on its body. Before it could even react, the entire tiger escaped from under the dragon claw at an extremely fast speed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The speed was so fast that the Wind Spirit Tiger couldn't even sense its own existence, and didn't even know how far it had flown.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly it was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>It couldn't help but shed tears.</p><p></p><p>It had survived, survived from under the claw of a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment it wanted to roar to the heavens. It had actually escaped from the claw of a true dragon, which was simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>That was a true dragon, and a true dragon far more powerful than itself. That it could escape was probably unprecedented in history for any tiger.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, it was brother who saved my life. To give me such a precious life-saving treasure, this kindness and favor is impossible to repay!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger was deeply moved.</p><p></p><p>The jade talisman emitted a glow, carrying it across the sky. The Wind Spirit Tiger didn't even know how far it had fled or when it would stop.</p><p></p><p>In the sky above Dragon Abyss, the flawless jade-white true dragon swiped down with its claw but caught nothing. Its blood-red eyes became even more frenzied.</p><p></p><p>Roar! It let out an angry howl. The true dragon coiled, its bone-chilling dragon might surging through heaven and earth, as crystalline snowflakes began to fall.</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>Dragon Abyss collapsed, the mountain peaks crumbled! The true dragon roared, wind and snow swept out. A jade-white true dragon flew out from Dragon Abyss, sweeping across the Dragon Mountain realm. Countless spirit beasts prostrated themselves in terror. Even Undying Realm spirit beasts were frightened and trembling, shaking in their blood and souls.</p><p></p><p>"You all deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Amidst the dragon might, a violent thought resounded.</p><p></p><p>"Is that... a true dragon?!"</p><p></p><p>In a great city in the Dragon Mountain realm, everyone watched as a jade-white true dragon hundreds of zhang long coiled and roared amidst the scene of rolling clouds and spreading cold in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, someone cried out in alarm. Everyone leapt up and fled in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the true dragon's intentions, that surging dragon might and the turbulent winds and clouds were not something they could withstand.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the Undying Realm Heavenly Venerable experts? Hurry and stop it!"</p><p></p><p>Someone shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist fleeing at the very front had an extremely ugly expression, inwardly cursing. What use was being in the Undying Realm? Go up there to die?</p><p></p><p>"You all deserve to die! Kill kill kill!"</p><p></p><p>The dragon's mighty thoughts shook out, full of violent intent.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, hide on the ground!"</p><p></p><p>Before the true dragon arrived, the group of True Monarch and Heavenly Venerable experts fleeing through the air all spat blood and fell from midair. The dragon might shook their souls, and their physical bodies couldn't withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the true dragon's speed was far beyond what they could escape from.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the people who fell to the ground but luckily didn't die, and that the true dragon didn't pursue to kill them, the martial artists fleeing in front hurriedly came down from midair and lay prone on the ground, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>It felt like a heavy mountain pressing down, even rolling over them. Feeling the terrifying dragon might above, the people lying on the ground all trembled in fear. Some were even so scared they wet themselves.</p><p></p><p>As the dragon might passed into the distance, everyone breathed a sigh of relief. The true dragon hadn't killed those lying on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the true dragon felt they had submitted, and thus disdained to kill them? Whatever the reason, they had escaped with their lives.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon, how terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>"How could there be a true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, let's hide. This Divine Realm is going to descend into chaos!"</p><p></p><p>These martial artists hurriedly scattered in all directions to find places to hide.</p><p></p><p>The fleeing Undying Realm Heavenly Venerable experts, seeing the true dragon pursuing to kill them, hurriedly descended to the ground and lay prone like the other martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Face and dignity were worthless. After all, what they faced was the legendary true dragon!</p><p></p><p>However! The true dragon did not spare them. Its dragon claw reached down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Seeing there was no escape, this Undying Realm Heavenly Venerable could only erupt with power.</p><p></p><p>"True dragon, I have no grudge with you. Why do you strike to kill me? I have already submitted!"</p><p></p><p>"Die! You all deserve to die, every last one of you!"</p><p></p><p>In response, he received only the true dragon's frenzied thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This Undying Realm Heavenly Venerable's heart sank. The true dragon seemed to have lost its reason, becoming extremely violent and frenzied. Moreover...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Targeting cultivators above the Immortal realm? Pah! The dragon claw tore through all his defenses, carrying bone-chilling cold that pierced into his soul.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>With one swipe of its claw, an Immortal Lord was instantly shattered to pieces, his soul utterly destroyed! Where the true dragon passed, thunder turned to ice and snow, bone-chilling cold spread, and the dragon's might raged. In just a few short days, all the Immortal Lords of Dragon Mountain Realm had perished!</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts of the Immortal realm either fled or successfully avoided disaster, while the rest were all torn apart!</p><p></p><p>The true dragon roared, its might sweeping through. The great city where Dragon Mountain Realm's gate was located had long since been abandoned. The jade-white true dragon, hundreds of zhang long, destroyed the city and roared as it entered the realm gate.</p><p></p><p>Fuzheng Realm fell into chaos. Many Immortal Lords joined forces, wanting to hunt and kill the true dragon, but they all perished without a single survivor.</p><p></p><p>The three Immortal realm Lords of the Hundred Battles Hall pushed their refined battle intent to the limit, wanting to resist the dragon's might and even confront the true dragon to temper their battle intent.</p><p></p><p>But they were hunted and killed in just one encounter! Wherever the true dragon passed, the strong were annihilated, great cities collapsed, leaving devastation in its wake.</p><p></p><p>The news spread at an extremely rapid pace to all realms of the Divine Domain. All who heard were shocked, their faces filled with disbelief. A true dragon had descended upon the Divine Domain?</p><p></p><p>It was slaughtering the powerful cultivators of the Divine Domain? The calamity of the true dragon was a great disaster for the Divine Domain! The powerful experts of the various major factions were instantly shocked upon hearing the news.</p><p></p><p>In Taikun Realm, the battle between the Spear Demon and the Celestial God was nearing its end. All the powerful observers were inwardly shaken - did this still count as the Immortal realm? How could Immortal realm cultivators possess such terrifying strength?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what kind of terrifying martial arts were those? The Celestial God transformed into a giant, his blade raising wind and thunder, stars glittering. The fierceness and dominance of his physical body was actually able to resist the Spear Demon's soul-killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, everyone could see that the Spear Demon was at a slight disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"Exhilarating!" Meng Chong laughed heartily.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping withdrew his spear and said with a smile, "This battle is over. I have completed the transaction with the Myriad Treasures Alliance!"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts from the Myriad Treasures Alliance in the distance felt a sense of unease in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Especially Hong Yi and Hong Er, who instinctively felt like they had been tricked.</p><p></p><p>The battle between Jiang Buping and Meng Chong, while seemingly intense and appearing to be fought with all their might, did not have the feeling of a life-and-death struggle.</p><p></p><p>It seemed more like a sparring match!</p><p></p><p>"Could these two actually know each other?" At this moment, the powerful experts of the Myriad Treasures Alliance couldn't help but have this thought.</p><p></p><p>As soon as this thought emerged, they immediately felt things were not right.</p><p></p><p>"Myriad Treasures Alliance, you've been hunting me for so long. It's time to give me an explanation, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong's aura surged like a rainbow as he instantly appeared before the group of Myriad Treasures Alliance experts.</p><p></p><p>The other Immortal Lords near the Myriad Treasures Alliance group were so frightened they hurriedly distanced themselves, afraid of being mistaken for members of the alliance.</p><p></p><p>"It was our Myriad Treasures Alliance who was in the wrong first. We were mistaken. Young Master Meng, let's talk this over calmly. We're willing to compensate and apologize!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi and the other Myriad Treasures Alliance experts promptly backed down.</p><p></p><p>They had no choice but to back down, as the might of the Celestial God was too overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>"Willing to compensate and apologize? Well then, we can discuss this."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned.</p><p></p><p>The other powerful experts looked at the Myriad Treasures Alliance with strange expressions. Having many of their branches plundered by Meng Chong, and now bowing their heads to admit fault and offer compensation and apologies, the deterrent power of the Myriad Treasures Alliance instantly plummeted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this time they would certainly have to pay a great price to appease Meng Chong's anger.</p><p></p><p>The storm in Taikun Realm had ended. As for how the Myriad Treasures Alliance compensated Meng Chong, outsiders did not know. They only knew that the powerful experts of the Myriad Treasures Alliance looked as if their homes had been ransacked.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from other realms began to leave successively. At this moment, news that shook the entire Divine Domain arrived!</p><p></p><p>In Dragon Mountain Realm, a true dragon had descended, wreaking havoc in the Divine Domain! In Fuzheng Realm, almost all Immortal Lords had perished!</p><p></p><p>The calamity of the true dragon was sweeping across the entire Divine Domain. Everywhere it went was devastated. Moreover, it was rumored that this true dragon seemed to have fallen into a state of frenzy, having lost its reason.</p><p></p><p>What shocked the powerful experts even more was that cultivators below the True King Celestial Lord level could survive if they managed to avoid the dragon and prostrate themselves on the ground, escaping death from the aftershocks.</p><p></p><p>But for Immortal Lords, there was no escape. Whether they surrendered or prostrated themselves in submission, they would all be killed by the true dragon!</p><p></p><p>A great calamity had descended upon the Divine Domain!</p><p></p><p>Not only that, but under the true dragon's rampage, even the Heavenly Abyss had been trampled flat. All the otherworldly beings had been completely annihilated. Wherever the true dragon passed, it stirred up the winds and clouds of heaven and earth, causing the energy of the Divine Domain to become turbulent.</p><p></p><p>"How did the true dragon come here?"</p><p></p><p>"This is terrible! How can we resist such a powerful true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a true dragon! And it's lost its reason, only knowing frenzy and slaughter. What should we do now?"</p><p></p><p>"It's said that the true dragon is heading towards the Great Realm!"</p><p></p><p>As news continued to arrive, all the powerful experts were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, news came from Tahe Realm that the powerful experts of the Divine Domain's Great Realm had all gathered in Tahe Realm to discuss how to subdue the true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon! Second Senior Brother, should we go meet this true dragon?" Jiang Buping asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was solemn. "The descent of this true dragon doesn't seem right. There's likely a hidden plot. Let's wait and see how the Divine Domain responds."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping nodded. True dragons had always been the stuff of legend, incredibly powerful. Now, for a true dragon to fall into the Divine Domain, frenzied and having lost its reason, slaughtering in all directions...</p><p></p><p>Even more strange was that it only killed cultivators of the Immortal realm and above, which was very targeted.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, some people were plotting something.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother is in Bihai Realm and couldn't come. With the appearance of this true dragon calamity, Big Senior Brother should quickly come from Bihai Realm."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought of Big Senior Brother's Dragon Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>Big Senior Brother would probably want to try the power of his Dragon Subduing Palm to see if he could subdue the dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Tahe Realm and see how they deal with the true dragon calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping instantly vanished from where they stood.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how strong is a true dragon?" Wu Tiannan asked the scruffy old man with a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>The scruffy old man had a strange look in his eyes. After hearing the question, he smiled and said, "That's hard to say. Young dragons are relatively weak, and the strength varies between true dragons. Of course, generally speaking, true dragons are at the top tier among living beings in terms of strength.</p><p></p><p>"True dragons are born with great might and innate dragon techniques. Even the weakest adult true dragon would be no weaker than the Divine Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"As for powerful true dragons, their strength is at the absolute pinnacle, beyond measure."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was inwardly shocked upon hearing this. He asked again, "Senior, what is the Divine Lord realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Above the Immortal realm is the Heaven Union realm, and above the Heaven Union realm is the Divine Lord realm. Divine Lord cultivators are like gods of heaven and earth, far beyond what those in the Immortal realm can imagine."</p><p></p><p>The scruffy old man said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>As he looked at Wu Tiannan, he felt increasingly that something was unusual. With such strong fortune, he had no doubt that even if Wu Tiannan encountered the true dragon, he would be able to escape danger and survive.</p><p></p><p>"How strange, this fortune seems to be uniquely favored by heaven and earth," the old man thought to himself, puzzled. By now, there were three people he couldn't see through: Jiang Buping, Meng Chong, and Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>For Jiang Buping and Meng Chong, what he couldn't see through was their inconceivable martial arts. For Wu Tiannan, what he couldn't see through was his unusual fortune, though it also gave him a sense of familiarity.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

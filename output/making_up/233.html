        <h1>Chapter 233</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Amidst the thorns and weeds, Xu Yan had mastered the art of blending in with his surroundings, his body concealed by the entangling vegetation.</p><p></p><p>His breath merged with the thorns and weeds.</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon coiled around his wrist was being squeezed so tightly that its eyes were bulging, its body instinctively trying to twist free, but suddenly becoming rigid.</p><p></p><p>Its subconscious told it that if it moved, it might be strangled to death! In the sky, an elderly man approached from the distance, his spiritual power sweeping across the area, not missing even the smallest blade of grass! He carefully searched the thicket of thorns and weeds, confirming that the person he was looking for was not there, before swiftly departing. A Cultivator of the Xian Realm!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave. To have a Cultivator of the Xian Realm pursuing him, the Blue Heavenly Flood Dragon must be of great importance? "Perhaps it is related to the arrangements I made for my body to become a corpse-devouring monster after my death. Could it be that these Xian Realm Cultivators all want to become such monsters after death?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>If even the powerful Blue Heavenly Flood Dragon could not fully succeed, how many of these Xian Realm Cultivators would be able to achieve it?</p><p></p><p>In the end, they would only become bloodthirsty and savage corpse-devouring monsters.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether these Xian Realm Cultivators had this plan in mind was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan lay motionless in the thicket of thorns, not immediately getting up to leave.</p><p></p><p>In less than half an hour, another wave of spiritual power swept through the area.</p><p></p><p>The Xian Realm Cultivator who had just left had returned.</p><p></p><p>He hovered in the air for a moment, then continued searching in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>After the night fell and the Xian Realm Cultivator no longer appeared, Xu Yan finally emerged from the thicket, quickly determining the direction and hurriedly leaving the place.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he released his grip on the jade dragon's neck.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough... You almost strangled me to death!"</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon hissed.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to doubt me. If you were discovered, I wouldn't be able to escape either. I'm a spirit beast with the bloodline of the Flood Dragon. They wouldn't spare me if I was with you."</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon was very frustrated. Doesn't he have any trust at all? Xu Yan calmly said, "Better safe than sorry."</p><p></p><p>"You are the hope for me to realize my dream. I won't harm you, you have to trust me."</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon poked its head out, looking very aggrieved.</p><p></p><p>"We'll talk about it later. With the Xian Realm Cultivators appearing, I can't let my guard down."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the jade dragon's gaze also became serious. "If the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family have dispatched Xian Realm Cultivators, could it be that the people you killed were of great importance?"</p><p></p><p>It then dismissed this possibility. "No, they were just ordinary servants. Could it be because of the Blue Heavenly Flood Dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"Most likely."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible. The Blue Heavenly Flood Dragon becoming a corpse-devouring monster is not enough to make the Xian Realm Cultivators personally come to capture you. Those Xian Realm Cultivators are high and mighty, there are many great Xian Realm experts in the sects, they wouldn't need to come themselves."</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon refuted.</p><p></p><p>"But the fact is, the Xian Realm Cultivators have appeared!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon fell silent, although it was puzzled, the appearance of the Xian Realm Cultivators was an undeniable reality.</p><p></p><p>"How far is the location of the Earth Dragon Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Very far."</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon hissed, "Now there is only one path left. It is hidden, but not an easy one to take. There may be some dangers lurking."</p><p></p><p>"How dangerous?"</p><p></p><p>"If we're unlucky, the dangers would be equivalent to encountering several late-stage Xian Realm spirit beasts, or even poisonous gas..."</p><p></p><p>"That's not a danger. As long as we can avoid the Xian Realm Cultivators, it's fine."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, from here, go a hundred miles to a large mountain, there is a deep pool. Dive into it and there is an underground channel, stretching for thousands of miles... It was dug out by a powerful spirit beast, very hidden, and should be unknown to anyone."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not hesitate upon hearing this, quickly arriving at the deep pool mentioned by the jade dragon, and diving into the water, entering the underground channel.</p><p></p><p>The passage was dark, and embedded in the rock wall at a distance was a moonstone.</p><p></p><p>From the shape and traces of the passage, it seemed to be a channel dug out by a snake-like creature.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, there may be some spirit beasts living underground, and occasionally poisonous gas may seep out."</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon warned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword intent manifested, enveloping him as he swiftly advanced.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong leaned against the damp and dark rock wall, panting heavily, blood trickling from the corners of his mouth, his face deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>He trembled as he took out a few medicinal pills from his storage pouch and swallowed them.</p><p></p><p>"Who killed Dai Yingying? Isn't this framing me?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong's eyes were moist, he deeply regretted his impulsive outburst back then. Dai Yingying had been so overbearing, and in a fit of righteous indignation, he couldn't hold back.</p><p></p><p>Being hunted by the Dai family was within his expectations. After all, the great families were high and mighty, how could they tolerate a scattered cultivator who dared to threaten them.</p><p></p><p>But Wen Yong was not too worried about this, as he was a member of the Myriad World Alliance, the Dai family would not easily be able to kill him. At most, he could fake his own death to escape.</p><p></p><p>The Alliance had already prepared countermeasures for him.</p><p></p><p>But he never imagined that Dai Yingying would be killed, and he would become the prime suspect!</p><p></p><p>The Dai family had also determined that he was the murderer.</p><p></p><p>Not only had the great Xian Realm experts been dispatched, even the Xian Realm ancestor of the Dai family had personally taken action.</p><p></p><p>"I almost got caught!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong had a look of great fear.</p><p></p><p>"Why are the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family pursuing this person?"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong puzzledly took out a portrait.</p><p></p><p>This was an image he had snatched from a scattered cultivator who had almost mistaken him for the one being pursued.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Wen Yong reacted swiftly, striking the other down and taking the portrait.</p><p></p><p>"This brother is more capable than me. I'm only being hunted by the Dai family, but you are being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family. I hope you can escape."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the portrait of the young man, Wen Yong felt a sense of kinship as a fellow wanderer.</p><p></p><p>Gazing into the dark passage, Wen Yong's expression gradually became more determined.</p><p></p><p>"Dai family, I, Wen Yong, will return to kill you."</p><p></p><p>His face was grave, this underground passage stretched for thousands of miles, and there were hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>With his injuries, his strength was only at five or six tenths of his full power. Whether he could safely pass through this passage would depend on his luck.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong coughed a few times, the sound echoing in the passage.</p><p></p><p>Leaning on a sword, he stood up and casually crushed the portrait, looking into the deep passage with a determined gaze and a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"I, Wen Yong, will not die here."</p><p></p><p>Successfully entering this passage was his only hope of escape. Otherwise, with the Xian Realm Cultivators in pursuit, he would have almost no chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong proceeded cautiously, step by step, maintaining a vigilant state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say this passage was very hidden?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the figure of Wen Yong ahead and transmitted a question.</p><p></p><p>The jade dragon was also puzzled. "It should be, I only discovered this passage by chance. How does he know about it?"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from his pitiful appearance, he seemed to be on the run.</p><p></p><p>"Another scattered cultivator who has offended a sect or a great family?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently followed behind Wen Yong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After confirming that this person was not dangerous and his strength was not too strong, just at the middle stage of the Xiao Tianren (Lesser Celestial Being), Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"We are both fugitives, but my troubles are much bigger than his. Even the Lian Shen Tianren (Refining Spirit Celestial Beings) are coming to hunt me down."</p><p></p><p>As he had encountered a fellow traveler, and the other party's strength was inferior to his own, and he was also seriously injured, having a companion on the long, dark and deep passage would be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>So, he stepped forward and slapped Wang Yong's shoulder with a "bang".</p><p></p><p>Wang Yong was almost scared out of his wits, a sudden hand slapping his shoulder, and he hadn't sensed it at all. Could it be one of the Dai family's Lian Shen Tianren?</p><p></p><p>"Dai family, I'll fight you to the death!" Wang Yong roared, his aura surging, unleashing his full power and swinging a knife back.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The attack was easily blocked, and a voice sounded, "Brother, are you fleeing?"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yong was stunned, in the dim light, he saw the person behind him, a young man, who looked somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." </p><p></p><p>At that moment, Wang Yong started coughing, blood seeping from the corners of his mouth. The sudden burst of energy had aggravated his injuries further.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong, having regained his senses, his face darkened. The other party had slapped his shoulder so silently, telling him that the other's strength was superior to his own, and he shouldn't have any dangerous thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"I'm being hunted by the Lingzong and the aristocratic families," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's you?" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong suddenly remembered, wasn't this the young man in the portrait? "Do you know me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"The portrait!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>He wiped the fresh blood from the corner of his mouth, his complexion growing even paler.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, your injuries are not light," Xu Yan pondered, whether he should give the other party a healing elixir? But they were not familiar with each other, and the elixir was precious. Moreover, although the other party was seriously injured, his life was not in danger.</p><p></p><p>So, he gave up the idea of giving the other party a healing elixir.</p><p></p><p>Thereafter, the two traveled together in the passage, although both were being hunted, they kept a wary eye on each other.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, why are you being hunted?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Wang Yong looked aggrieved, as if he had found someone to confide in. "You know the genius of the Dai family? She's dead!" Everyone thinks I killed her, but I didn't kill her!</p><p></p><p>"I was just angry and spoke rashly, but who knew she would really be killed. Now everyone thinks I did it. Even my friends don't believe me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his shoulder and comforted him, "Killing the genius of an aristocratic family, no wonder you are being hunted. Brother Wang, that you can escape here is already fortunate."</p><p></p><p>"But she's not just any genius, she's Dai Yingying, the unmarried fiancée of the Second Prince of Zheng Kingdom! Everyone thinks I killed her, but I really didn't!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong was so aggrieved that he grabbed Xu Yan's arm, "You have to believe me, Dai Yingying was not killed by me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a bit dazed.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying? Wasn't that the one he had killed? How did it become Wang Yong's fault?</p><p></p><p>Ah, he remembered, this unlucky fellow had once made a ruthless remark, saying that he would kill Dai Yingying for the sake of the lower-level cultivators, even if it cost him his life.</p><p></p><p>That's why he had taken the blame!</p><p></p><p>He solemnly patted Wang Yong's shoulder and said sincerely, "Brother Wang, I believe you. Dai Yingying was definitely not killed by you. Even if the whole world doesn't believe you, I believe you!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yong was so moved that tears were about to flow. Finally, there was someone who believed him! "Thank you, thank you Brother Xu, you are the only one who believes me!"</p><p></p><p>Knowing each other so well! At this moment, Wang Yong felt that he had found a lifelong sworn brother!</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I can see that Brother Wang is an honest person, he would never lie," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He felt a little guilty, since he was the one who had killed Dai Yingying, and Wang Yong had taken the blame.</p><p></p><p>So, Xu Yan took out a small bottle and decided to give Wang Yong a healing elixir. "Brother Wang, you are truly a person of true character. I see that your injuries are not light, here is a healing elixir that can help you recover quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Wang Yong said solemnly, "Brother Xu, you are the first true friend I've had in my life!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his shoulder and sighed, "Brother Wang, you are indeed a person of true sincerity. I have a few healing elixirs here, please take them to use when needed."</p><p></p><p>He poured two healing elixirs into Wang Yong's palm.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Xu!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong popped one of the elixirs into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>The elixir melted instantly, and a warm flow spread through his body.</p><p></p><p>His injuries began to slowly heal.</p><p></p><p>"This... this!" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong stared wide-eyed, amazed, "What kind of healing medicine is this? It's so miraculous!"</p><p></p><p>"It's just a common elixir. Brother Wang, you should carry a few with you for emergencies," Xu Yan said, placing a jade bottle containing several healing elixirs into Wang Yong's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This is too precious, I can't take it!" Wang Yong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Such a miraculous healing elixir must be invaluable. As fellow cultivators, for Xu Yan to have obtained such a powerful healing elixir must have been extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, please don't be polite, take them," Xu Yan insisted, pushing the elixirs into Wang Yong's hand.</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong steeled himself: "Brother Xu has been so generous, giving me these precious healing elixirs and trusting me so much, we are such good friends. How can I be stingy?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it, Wang Yong said solemnly, "Brother Xu, I have no way to repay your kindness, but at the end of this passage, there is a secret place that contains Earth Essence Jade Marrow. I will give it to you!"</p><p></p><p>"Earth Essence Jade Marrow?" </p><p></p><p>Jade Xiaolongexcitedly poked his head out from Xu Yan's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" </p><p></p><p>Wang Yong was startled to see a fourth-stage spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Jade Xiaolong's head and said, "It's a small snake I've tamed, Brother Wang need not worry."</p><p></p><p>Wang Yong heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"How do you know there's Earth Essence Jade Marrow at the end of the passage? I didn't even know about it!" Jade Xiaolong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It was recorded by a fallen warrior," Wang Yong replied without hiding anything.</p><p></p><p>"The Earth Essence Jade Marrow is too precious!" Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No matter how precious, it cannot compare to our friendship, Brother Xu. I will give you this treasure," Wang Yong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This... thank you, Brother Wang!" Xu Yan cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, you're too polite. The Lian Shen Tianren of the Dai family are chasing me. Whether I can escape from Yuzhou, and even if I do, whether I can evade their pursuit, is unknown.</p><p></p><p>"If I use this treasure, it would be a waste," Wang Yong sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood, the Lian Shen Tianren he had encountered were not chasing him, but were pursuing Wang Yong from the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit awkward. Dai Yingying was the one he had killed, but Wang Yong had taken the blame. </p><p></p><p>Even if he told Wang Yong the truth, it wouldn't change Wang Yong's predicament. The Dai family, with their tyrannical power, would not allow Wang Yong to live, even if they knew the truth.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Wang, I have a technique of concealment and hiding. Perhaps it can be of help to you," </p><p></p><p>Since Wang Yong was giving him the Earth Essence Jade Marrow, he might as well teach him the Blending into the Surroundings Technique to help him escape and avoid danger.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

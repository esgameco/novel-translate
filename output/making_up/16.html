        <h1>Chapter 16</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 16 They are too weak, one punch can kill one</p><p></p><p>"My dear, Yan'er has been out of touch for a month, I'm really worried."</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu said with a worried look on her face.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, the richest man in Donghe Prefecture, is nearly forty years old, but one can still see the handsome appearance of his youth. He also had a headache-ridden look on his face right now.</p><p></p><p>"My lady, Yan'er must be strictly disciplined, we can't indulge him anymore. You, you can't spoil him like this!"</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying, my dear? He's my only son, if I don't spoil him, who else would I spoil?" </p><p></p><p>Lady Xu said dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe sighed.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a maid rushed in: "Master, Madam, the young master is back!"</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er is back?" </p><p></p><p>Lady Xu's face lit up with joy, and she hurried out, muttering, "Is he thinner or darker? Is he hurt?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe sighed and followed with a stern face.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Physician Pan? You all be careful, carry it in, I want to operate on it myself."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was directing the servants to carry the Crimson-Eyed Tiger into the slaughterhouse, preparing to skin the tiger himself.</p><p></p><p>He also had the servants go find the family's revered Physician Pan.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of tiger is this? How can it be so big?"</p><p></p><p>"Even though it's dead, I still feel my legs shaking when I stand in front of it!"</p><p></p><p>The few Xu family guards and servants, looking at the Crimson-Eyed Tiger's corpse, were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Even though it was already dead, they still felt a sense of fear and weakness in their legs when standing in front of the Crimson-Eyed Tiger.</p><p></p><p>Even the few skilled guards who practiced martial arts and had hunted fierce tigers before, still felt an innate unease when facing this giant tiger.</p><p></p><p>The guards lifted the stretcher and carried the Crimson-Eyed Tiger towards the slaughterhouse.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, come let mother see, have you lost weight?"</p><p></p><p>The indulgent voice of Lady Xu came.</p><p></p><p>"Mother!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing his mother, Xu Yan immediately became obedient.</p><p></p><p>"Father!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe had a stern face: "So you finally came back, huh?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he opened his mouth, ready to scold him, Lady Xu immediately became dissatisfied and said, "My dear, Yan'er just got back, you should calm down a bit."</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe swallowed the words in his heart, unable to say them.</p><p></p><p>He could only glare at Xu Yan with a fierce gaze to reprimand him.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu held Xu Yan's hand, looking him up and down, he wasn't thinner or darker, but rather more robust, seeing that her son had not suffered outside, her heart finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, you..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly seeing the Crimson-Eyed Tiger on the stretcher, she exclaimed in surprise, "Yan'er, this giant tiger, did you hunt it?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu's face was full of anxiety at the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, I bought this!" </p><p></p><p>To avoid worrying his mother, Xu Yan could only lie.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare say that he had killed this Crimson-Eyed Tiger with his own hands.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, you bought it, that's good, that's good!"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>As long as it's a problem that can be solved with money, there's no danger, as long as her precious son doesn't take risks, spending any amount of money is worth it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looked at the Crimson-Eyed Tiger, his heart trembling, this giant tiger was too terrifying, even though it was dead, it still gave a sense of oppression.</p><p></p><p>He's not someone who hasn't seen fierce tigers before!</p><p></p><p>He had even hunted them before.</p><p></p><p>However, this giant tiger was extraordinary, even though it was dead, there was still an aura of intimidation.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of tiger is this? I've never seen it before!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we've never seen it either!"</p><p></p><p>The few guards also shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"Father, this is the king of tigers, the Crimson-Eyed Tiger!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Crimson-Eyed Tiger?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was puzzled, he had never heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the few guards, and they also shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>A servant spoke up, "Master, the Crimson-Eyed Tiger is..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson-Eyed Tiger is a legendary figure in storybooks, said to be the king of all tigers!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's face immediately darkened as he glared fiercely at Xu Yan, saying, "How can one believe the things in storybooks!"</p><p></p><p>Although this giant tiger was terrifying, he did not believe it was the legendary creature recorded in the storybooks, thinking it was simply a rare and ferocious tiger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not argue, knowing his father would not believe it.</p><p></p><p>The others would not believe it either, as they saw it as something from storybooks.</p><p></p><p>The gatekeeper carried the Crimson-Eyed Tiger into the slaughterhouse, and Xu Yan accompanied his mother for a while before going to the slaughterhouse to personally skin the tiger.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson-Eyed Tiger, truly the king of tigers, even an ordinary person wielding a sharp knife would find it difficult to pierce its hide!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan arrived and was also amazed at the sight of this massive old tiger.</p><p></p><p>At Xu Yan's request, he selected dozens of precious nourishing medicinal ingredients from the Xu family's medicinal warehouse, mostly tonics to enrich the blood and qi, to be decocted with the Crimson-Eyed Tiger's blood, flesh, and bones.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe strolled over casually and glanced at the nearly processed tiger carcass, then spoke indifferently, "Physician Pan, be sure to handle the tiger penis properly."</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan hurriedly put on a smile and nodded, "My lord, rest assured. I will use half of this tiger king's penis to brew a jar of Tiger King Wine, and the other half I will combine with precious medicines to concoct a Yang-Invigorating Pill. Even in old age, its potency will not diminish!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nodded in satisfaction and said, "Mm, Physician Pan, feel free to request any precious medicines you need."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but speak up, "Father, this tiger king's penis, I still have..."</p><p></p><p>He had planned to offer it to his teacher.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe glared at him and angrily said, "Do you think this is for your father? Your grandfather is getting on in years and has a heavy workload. He needs these tonics."</p><p></p><p>"Your grandfather dotes on you so much, and you can't even be filial?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his mouth but could only accept his father's decision regarding the tiger king's penis.</p><p></p><p>"With my teacher's cultivation level, he would not value the tiger king's penis, and this item is not very noble. If my teacher dislikes it, wouldn't that be a bad thing?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan felt it would be better to give the tiger skin to his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, seeing that he had scolded his son into submission, then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan hurried after him, "My lord, are you really not in need of it? I was planning to use the tiger king's penis to brew a weaker tonic more suitable for your age."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe patted Physician Pan's shoulder and said, "Old Pan, although I don't need it, it can be given as a gift. Some of my business associates around my age might have a use for it, so you can go ahead and do as you planned."</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan looked at him suspiciously but did not probe further, nodding and saying, "I understand, I know what to do!"</p><p></p><p>That night, the Xu mansion was filled with joy. The mistress was delighted and issued a monetary reward, even hosting a banquet. The servants were elated, eating to their heart's content.</p><p></p><p>Their young master, who had been away for a month, had finally returned. He had even brought back a giant tiger, said to be the Tiger King!</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard of the Xu mansion, a pot of Tiger King meat was cooked. Xu Junhe and his wife each ate a small bowl, unable to finish more.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan alone consumed most of the remaining Tiger King meat.</p><p></p><p>The leftovers were rewarded to the few elite bodyguards of the household.</p><p></p><p>These few elite bodyguards, who were also top-notch martial artists recruited from various sects, were no longer seen as impressive by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He felt they were too weak, and he could easily kill one with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when he was younger, he had trained with these bodyguards and had a good relationship with them.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the tiger meat, Xu Yan returned to his own residence, where no one was allowed to enter without his permission. This was his training ground.</p><p></p><p>Since his last return, he had renovated it, adding a secret chamber.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 261</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>But Yu Gao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>If he had the Mist Talisman back then, how could he have ended up in such a miserable state?</p><p></p><p>By activating the Mist Talisman, obstructing Zhu Liang for a moment, he would have long since fled. How could they have caught up to him?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the first time it is used, the effect is the strongest.</p><p></p><p>The other party does not know of the existence of the Mist Talisman, and is suddenly enveloped in the mist. Their perception is restricted, and their spiritual power cannot penetrate the mist. Their first reaction is not to chase and kill the enemy, but to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>"How many Refining Spirit Cultivators are there in the Alliance?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"There are a total of twelve, I am in the late Refining Spirit stage, the two protectors are in the middle Refining Spirit stage, and the rest are all in the early Refining Spirit stage," Yu Gao replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>An unaffiliated cultivation force possessing more than ten Refining Spirit Cultivators, with Yu Gao himself being in the late Refining Spirit stage, their strength is not inferior to the top-tier Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families. </p><p></p><p>Second only to the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>If Yu Gao's strength was a bit stronger, he could contend with Zhu Liang, and the strength of the Millennium Alliance would not be much inferior to the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when facing an unaffiliated cultivation force, the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families would unite to deal with them, just like the current action targeting the Millennium Alliance. </p><p></p><p>Although it was the Jade Spirit Sect and the Xiu Family taking the lead, the rest of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families all participated.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Millennium Alliance had been eking out an existence, only daring to act in the shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Twelve people, not a small number. Your task is to lure away the Refining Spirit Cultivators of the Jade Spirit Sect. Of course, the Jade Spirit Sect is not foolish, they will not all leave, but luring away the majority is sufficient.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Yu, you will lure away Zhu Liang," Xu Yan pondered for a moment before assigning the tasks to the Refining Spirit Cultivators of the Millennium Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then took out more than a dozen jade talismans and handed them to Yu Gao, saying, "These are Teleportation Talismans, they were difficult to refine and consumed many rare materials. One for each person, to be used as an escape in critical moments. They can teleport about a hundred miles, but the direction must be controlled by the user."</p><p></p><p>In order to refine the Teleportation Talismans, Fang Hao had pondered for a long time, wasting a large number of rare materials, and only after Li Xuan's guidance was he able to refine them.</p><p></p><p>They still appeared crude, with a limited teleportation range, but they would be useful nonetheless.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao was shocked again. Teleportation Talismans? </p><p></p><p>A hundred miles may not seem far for Refining Spirit Cultivators, but in a critical moment, it could be a lifesaving opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao had a feeling that letting Fang Hao take over was the most correct decision he had ever made in his life! "Keep the Communication Talisman for contact!"</p><p></p><p>After arranging the tasks, Xu Yan spoke up, "Brother Yu, you must ensure that this matter does not leak out, or there will be consequences. You should understand."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao spoke seriously, "I understand, not a single word will be leaked. They are all trustworthy people!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao nodded solemnly. Once the Mist Talisman, Communication Talisman, and Teleportation Talisman were leaked out, the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families would certainly be thrown into turmoil, with grave consequences, as the Millennium Alliance is not yet strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao left.</p><p></p><p>The three senior-junior brothers, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao, also bid farewell to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>After the three senior-junior brothers left, Li Xuan sighed inwardly, his disciples were truly capable of causing trouble. </p><p></p><p>This time, the Jade Spirit Sect would definitely go mad. </p><p></p><p>He had never underestimated the strength of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families, and in the end, it would be inevitable for him, as the teacher, to step in and suppress everything.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, with my current strength, I am unrivaled in the Spiritual Realm. I should be able to handle it."</p><p></p><p>Even if he faced a concerted attack from Refining Spirit Peaks, there would still be considerable pressure. Moreover, the powerful experts of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect would undoubtedly be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Although I am alone, if they come to attack me, I will set up a grand formation. Let's see who will kill whom!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not worried. With the grand formation in place, who could stand against him?</p><p></p><p>He stood up from the chair and with a wave of his hand, a grand formation was deployed throughout the manor. With this formation in place, even Refining Spirit Peaks would be unable to detect or penetrate it.</p><p></p><p>Then, he stepped out and disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, is this because you are worried that your senior and junior disciples have caused too much trouble, and powerful experts may come to hunt them down?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu saw her teacher leave and couldn't help but think to herself. </p><p></p><p>She regretted a bit that she didn't go join the commotion as well, since her teacher was secretly protecting them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's figure appeared at the entrance of the Spiritual Realm. The gate to the Spiritual Realm had already been completely closed, and the two guardians in the grand hall seemed bored, but they had to maintain their post, even with the gate closed.</p><p></p><p>Without alerting the two guardians, Li Xuan approached the gate of the Spiritual Realm and with a wave of his hand, arrays of formation artifacts flew out, layer upon layer of grand formations were deployed, enveloping the gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if the gate to the Spiritual Realm was opened, no one would be able to enter. They might even suspect that the gate had completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were about to do something big, and if news from the inner realm leaked out, there would certainly be people entering the inner realm. To ensure the safety of the inner realm, Li Xuan came to set up the grand formation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm really worrying myself to death over my disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>After all, his disciples were the pioneers of his unrivaled path in the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"With the nine-layered formation here, even if Refining Spirit Peaks come, they won't be able to enter."</p><p></p><p>Without understanding the intricacies of formations, relying on brute force to break through would not be easy at all. The strength must far surpass the one who set up the formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was confident that with his current strength, even if ten or eight Refining Spirit Peaks came, they would not be able to break through the formation he had set up.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these would be Refining Spirit Peaks from the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, not ordinary Refining Spirit Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Spiritual Realm, there was no sign of anything unusual. No one could tell that it had been enveloped by the formation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned and left, going to see how his disciples were causing trouble, and how they planned to take down the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Huh, Shen Daxiao?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was surprised to see Shen Haizhu, the information provider for his senior brother.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhu was also puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"You two know each other?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He then recalled that Shen Haizhu had mentioned having a friend who raised a Swallowing Mountain Toad, and Fang Hao also raised a Swallowing Mountain Toad, so that friend must be Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao chuckled, "Shen Daxiao is a big client of mine. I've been relying on Shen Daxiao's care to live comfortably all these years."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhu looked at Xu Yan and Meng Chong with suspicion, then stared at Fang Hao for a long time, feeling that Fang Hao seemed to have changed in a way he couldn't quite place.</p><p></p><p>"You know each other?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao put his arm around Shen Haizhu's shoulder and said cheerfully, "Of course we know each other, this is my senior brother and second junior brother."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao, I never expected you to be so well-hidden. No wonder you can forge such extraordinary things."</p><p></p><p>"Don't misunderstand, I only recently met my teacher and gained his favor, that's why I became his disciple."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao patted Shen Haizhu's shoulder. This Shen Family Young Master was quite different from the other disciples of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families, not having too much arrogance or oppressing the unaffiliated cultivators. He could be considered an exception among the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With an envious expression, it seemed like he had thought of something, and his face became sly. He took out the Spring Night Mirror from his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Fang, this Spring Night treasure has been improved a lot. I can try to make it even better. I've recently collected a batch of excellent beauty pictures, and the poses number in the dozens..."</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he activated the Spring Night Mirror, and beautiful women's images were revealed on it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Fang Hao hurriedly snatched the Spring Night Mirror from Shen Haizhou's hand and stuffed it back into his chest, saying, "Brother Shen, you are insulting me. I, Fang Hao, am an upright person. How could I engage in such improper things? Although this Spring Night Mirror is the forging method I gave you, this item has nothing to do with me. I, Fang Hao, disdain such vulgar things."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was stunned. When did he, a young master from a prominent family, end up discussing these things with Fang Hao, a small Scattered Cultivator? But now, Fang Hao was blatantly denying it. "Fang Hao, this is not being a good brother. Remember how I collected so many beauty albums and lent them to you for careful observation over several days and nights?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou looked displeased.</p><p></p><p>"Don't talk nonsense!" Fang Hao quickly covered his mouth.</p><p></p><p>His slightly chubby face flushed a bit as he looked at the two senior brothers with a serious expression. "Senior brothers, don't listen to his nonsense. Shen Haizhou has some strange hobbies and collects some vulgar things. He often forces people to watch them with him, which is very despicable!"</p><p></p><p>When I observed the beauty albums before, it was not out of my own will. As a humble Scattered Cultivator, how could I resist the coercion of Young Master Shen? That was forced upon me! Under Shen Haizhou's angry gaze, Fang Hao dragged him away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mouth twitched, recalling Shen Haizhou's collection. To retrieve those treasures, he had even paid a hundred million spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, even my junior brother has this hobby!" Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Fang Hao and Shen Haizhou huddled together, the two chubby fellows, it was clear they were kindred spirits, which was why they could become friends.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao promised to forge an even more mysterious and profound Spring Night Mirror for him, Shen Haizhou relented and came back, apologizing to Xu Yan and Meng Chong with a guilty expression, "It was all my fault. I used to coerce Fang Hao to watch those vulgar things with me. I'm sorry, I was wrong! Fang Hao is an upright person. Although I forced him, he always kept his eyes closed and didn't actually see anything."</p><p></p><p>"It was all because of my bad habit, and has nothing to do with Fang Hao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong: ...</p><p></p><p>The two looked at Shen Haizhou with a strange expression, wondering what Fang Hao had promised him that made him so willing to degrade himself. Fang Hao chuckled awkwardly, "Senior brothers, Shen Young Master has some strange hobbies, don't mind it. He's actually a good person."</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he cursed Shen Haizhou for making it sound even more outrageous.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, there's no need to be embarrassed. That's only human nature," Xu Yan said after a moment of silence.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, the four discussed their action plan and the latest intelligence on the Jade Divine Sect. Shen Haizhou relayed the newest information.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Divine Sect and the Shu Family are still not giving up on pursuing Brother Xu and Brother Meng, and they are also pursuing that mysterious Scattered Cultivator force."</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the Jade Divine Sect's spirit stone mines remained the same as before.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's make our move," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, just wait for the news."</p><p></p><p>This matter, Shen Haizhou was only responsible for providing intelligence, and would not participate.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, Xu Yan transmitted a message to Shen Haizhou, "Brother Shen, what did my junior brother promise you that made you act this way?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou chuckled awkwardly, "Brother Fang promised to forge an even more mysterious Spring Night Mirror for me, one that can reflect all my treasured collections."</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I wish you success. I still need to continue collecting treasures. This opportunity is rare, and in the future, Brother Fang may not be willing to forge the Spring Night Mirror anymore!" Shen Haizhou said with a look of regret.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mouth twitched, Shen Haizhou was a hopeless case.</p><p></p><p>Jade New Mountain was an obscure mountain peak in Jade State. The mountain was not high, with sparse vegetation and few people. However, beneath this seemingly desolate mountain lay a vast spirit stone mine, one of the two major spirit stone mines owned by the Jade Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>While the mountain appeared barren, it was secretly guarded by a powerful cultivator. A Jade Divine Sect Refining Immortal Elder was stationed here, overseeing the mining of the spirit stones. The mining was not done by captured Scattered Cultivators, but by the sect's own disciples, as a task for the lower-level disciples to cultivate and temper themselves.</p><p></p><p>This not only ensured secrecy, but also served to hone the disciples. For the Jade Divine Sect's lower-level disciples, mining spirit stones was not an arduous task, as they only needed to complete the assignment, and would even receive spirit crystals as a reward afterwards. This was why the lower-level disciples were eager to participate in the mining.</p><p></p><p>On Jade New Mountain, there were spirit hawks that were used for communication. These agile and fast spirit birds also served as a form of sentry.</p><p></p><p>However, the sentry duty was not entirely entrusted to the spirit hawks, as there were ways to bypass their detection.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, how long will it take to set up the formation to completely seal off Jade New Mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"Fifteen minutes!" Fang Hao said after a moment of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Jade New Mountain was not small, so he could not instantly deploy the formation.</p><p></p><p>"I'll take care of the sentries," Meng Chong said.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit hawks are mine. Junior brother, you prepare the formation," Xu Yan said, taking out a small bottle. He silently went around Jade New Mountain, spreading the disorienting spirit medicine that Xu Ling had refined, which only affected the spirit hawks and would not be detected.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stealthily incapacitated the hidden sentry cultivators one by one.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao moved around Jade New Mountain, placing formation artifacts at regular intervals. Silently and without a trace, he had completed the deployment of the formation.</p><p></p><p>"The formation is set up, with three layers of grand formations. Once activated, it won't be detected. The outside won't notice anything unusual, and even if those inside discover something, they won't be able to get out. It can obstruct Refining Immortal Cultivators for an hour without any issues."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was inwardly excited. This was the first time he was taking action against a Sect, and it was the number one Sect in Jade State. He was both nervous and thrilled.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, the grand formation he had set up could easily confine Refining Immortal Cultivators for an hour without any problems.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go and kill that Refining Immortal Cultivator," Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Once the Refining Immortal Cultivator was dead, the remaining Jade Divine Sect disciples would be no threat, and they could completely seal them inside the formation.</p><p></p><p>The three changed into the garments of the Jade Divine Sect's sentry cultivators, concealed their auras, and altered their appearances before entering through a hidden cave entrance on Jade New Mountain.</p><p></p><p>As they went deeper, a dense spiritual energy gushed out from the cave.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder even Scattered Cultivators are willing to toil here, the spiritual energy in this place of the spirit stone mine is truly remarkable," Fang Hao sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

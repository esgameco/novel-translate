        <h1>Chapter 488</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>The Ethereal Dream Path and the Supreme Path, one illusory and one real, can also be seen as one soft and one hard. They appear independent but should actually be unified.</p><p></p><p>"The Dream Path and Supreme Path both originated from Taicang. It seems Taicang had new ideas about martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had to admit that Taicang was indeed formidable. </p><p></p><p>However, since Taimiao had fallen into the contradiction between the Dream Path and Supreme Path, it was clear that Taicang only had new ideas but hadn't perfected them. Perhaps due to other reasons, they didn't have time to perfect it before perishing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xin Mengrou and said with a smile: "Why be in contradiction with yourself? Whether Dream or Supreme, it's ultimately one method of martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"The Dream Path and Supreme Path can exist independently, but can naturally also be unified.</p><p></p><p>"Dream is illusory, Supreme is real; illusory is soft, real is hard; soft is yin, hard is yang - this is the endless cycle of yin and yang..."</p><p></p><p>After imbuing the Dream Path and Supreme Path with the concept of yin and yang and giving some guidance, Li Xuan then looked at everyone present and said: "The Way of Yin and Yang aligns with all things in heaven and earth. Yin alone cannot grow, yang alone cannot give birth. Heaven and earth naturally have yin and yang, thus giving endless birth. But in this world, yin and yang are disordered, and there is no way of reincarnation..."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao and the others listened respectfully with solemn expressions. This was the Ancestor of the Dao lecturing on the great Way of Yin and Yang. If they could gain even a bit of insight, it would be a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>After expounding on the Way of Yin and Yang, Li Xuan smiled and said: "The Way of Yin and Yang may be too profound for you. But knowing the concept of yin and yang will ultimately be beneficial."</p><p></p><p>Finally, he looked at Xin Mengrou and said: "If you want to unify Dream and Supreme, in terms of yin and yang, the distance is too far and cannot be understood in a short time. </p><p></p><p>"Just tell that little girl, the heart is Supreme, the mind is Dream; there is both Supreme intent and Dream heart..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou muttered to herself, "The heart is Supreme, the mind is Dream? There is both Supreme intent and Dream heart..." </p><p></p><p>In a daze, she seemed to have some insight, yet didn't fully understand.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for your guidance!" Xin Mengrou bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao sighed in admiration. As expected of the Ancestor of the Dao - in just a few words, he had expounded on the profundities of a great Way, and directly pointed out the path for Taimiao to resolve her contradictions.</p><p></p><p>"If Taimiao can unify Dream and Supreme, her strength will advance further," Old Man Xiao mused with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was his turn. What question should he ask? Old Man Xiao pondered. The lecture on yin and yang had already cleared up some of his confusion about the world, leaving him without questions.</p><p></p><p>However, he still hadn't found his path forward.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Old Man Xiao was about to respectfully ask the Ancestor for guidance when he saw Ao Yuxue timidly emerge from behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Se-senior, may I ask a question?" Ao Yuxue asked timidly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled. In human form, Ao Yuxue was delicate and adorable, quite likable.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want to ask?" Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>This girl, surely she wouldn't ask how to avoid being subdued? Or how to break free from the control of the Dragon Subduing Seal?</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue was a bit nervous, her small hands fidgeting with her clothes. She glanced at Xu Yan and asked timidly: "He used a martial art called Dragon Subduing Palm to defeat me despite being weaker. I want to ask, can I also cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. He never expected Ao Yuxue to ask such a question.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were also stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Palm was one of Xu Yan's ultimate skills. </p><p></p><p>It was his strongest martial art besides swordsmanship. Although its foundation was subduing dragons, the power of the Dragon Subduing Palm was immense.</p><p></p><p>Yet this true dragon Ao Yuxue was actually asking if she could cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>This was for subduing true dragons! You're a true dragon yourself, yet you want to cultivate it?</p><p></p><p>Feeling everyone's surprised and shocked gazes, Ao Yuxue became even more nervous. Her jade face flushed slightly as she fidgeted with her clothes, looking weak and timid.</p><p></p><p>She had pondered long and hard before finally deciding what to ask.</p><p></p><p>"The Dragon Subduing Palm is for subduing us true dragons. If I cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm, with my identity as a true dragon, wouldn't I be invincible within the true dragon clan if I use this palm technique to subdue dragons?"</p><p></p><p>The more she thought about it, the more excited Ao Yuxue became. She immediately decided to ask this question.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a strange expression. What was going on with this girl's thought process?</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Yan, then at Ao Yuxue, he couldn't help but laugh and say: "Why did you have this idea?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue glanced at Xu Yan again. Seeing no anger on his face, she relaxed slightly and said timidly: "This junior thinks, since the Dragon Subduing Palm can subdue dragons, if I as a true dragon can also use it, wouldn't I be invincible within the true dragon clan? Able to suppress all disobedient dragons?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's jade face flushed as she fidgeted with her clothes, full of expectation: "Senior, I'm a true dragon. Can I also cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm?"</p><p></p><p>This question, Li Xuan had never considered before.</p><p></p><p>Originally, the Dragon Subduing Palm was just made up. He hadn't thought so much about it.</p><p></p><p>He also fell into contemplation. Could true dragons cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm? After a moment's thought, he had an answer in mind.</p><p></p><p>After all, he had already obtained the Way of Dragon Subduing, which coiled like a giant dragon in his primordial spirit.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan smiled and said: "The Dragon Subduing Palm is a palm technique for subduing dragons, using dragons to subdue dragons. Can true dragons cultivate it? Theoretically yes, especially since you true dragons can take human form, so you can naturally cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"However, being able to cultivate doesn't mean you'll be able to cultivate it successfully, comprehend it fully, or use it effectively. </p><p></p><p>"Ultimately it depends on talent and insight."</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's eyes lit up with joy as she nodded: "Thank you senior, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had thought this girl would then ask him to teach her how to cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm, but she didn't. Instead, she timidly retreated back behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!" Li Xuan chuckled inwardly. This girl had clearly become more clever after experiencing that vicious beating.</p><p></p><p>Judging by her expression, she probably wanted to ask Xu Yan to teach her the Dragon Subduing Palm. As for whether Xu Yan would teach her or not, Li Xuan wouldn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>His disciple had already grown strong and was no longer a martial arts novice. It was time for him to be independent, so as his master, Li Xuan wouldn't interfere.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at Ao Yuxue with strange expressions. The question she asked was beyond everyone's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao had an odd look. Surely this girl didn't want to become the leader of the true dragon clan? Was she planning to force her grandfather Ao Lie to abdicate? This was the internal affairs of the true dragon clan, so Old Man Xiao naturally didn't care to worry about it.</p><p></p><p>He excitedly bowed respectfully and said: "Ancestor, this junior has a martial arts question. I humbly request your guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said: "Go ahead and ask."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan already had some guesses about what Old Man Xiao wanted to ask. Old Man Xiao was a Realm Lord with extremely strong power, but ultimately not the lord of a small world, and his strength had reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>The lord of a small world was created by receiving the purple light of creation...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao had reached the theoretical limit of cultivation at this stage. Unless he could obtain the purple light of creation like Tai Cang and others did back then, it would be impossible to advance further and become a master of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But clearly, that purple light seemed to have only appeared once. In their long lives, Tai Cang and the others had only experienced it that one time, only witnessing that single purple light.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable one, I have cultivated to this point but can no longer see the path forward. Not just me, but the other realm lords are in the same situation. Breaking through our constraints and reaching Master Tai Cang's level seems impossible now.</p><p></p><p>"Master Tai Cang and the other six obtained the purple light in the primordial chaos, using it to open up heaven and earth and become masters of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>"For us juniors to advance further, is finding that mysterious purple light the only chance?" Old Man Xiao asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The others listened silently. This involved the secrets of heaven and earth's existence.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Old Man Xiao's question, Xu Yan pondered thoughtfully. He began to understand the fundamental difference between the martial arts passed down by his master and the martial arts of Tai Cang's world.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao had cultivated to his current level but could hardly advance further. More accurately, there was no path forward! "Master repeatedly emphasized that martial arts have no limits. If there are no limits, how could there be no path forward? So Tai Cang's martial arts must be flawed. When I called it pseudo-martial arts before, I wasn't entirely wrong.</p><p></p><p>"According to Old Man Xiao, one needs the purple light to open up heaven and earth. Without the purple light, his cultivation has stagnated with no way forward.</p><p></p><p>"But the martial arts my master taught me don't have these limitations. The path forward is always there, depending only on talent and effort to continue advancing."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of the Heaven and Earth realm, where one's body becomes heaven and earth. Isn't that opening up heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Xu Yan knew that once he broke through to the Heaven and Earth realm, he would completely surpass Tai Cang's martial arts. This also explained why breaking through even a small level in the Heaven and Earth realm led to such a huge increase in power.</p><p></p><p>At the great completion stage of the Heaven and Earth realm, one was already comparable to the Supreme realm of Tai Cang's martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the Heaven and Earth realm, the two systems were no longer comparable. Tai Cang's martial arts were nearing their end, while the Heaven and Earth realm was just truly beginning to embark on the martial path.</p><p></p><p>After all, only at the Establishing the Way realm could one qualify to establish and pass on one's own school of martial arts, truly comprehending the martial way! Thinking of this, Xu Yan felt secretly excited. He wasn't far from the Heaven and Earth realm and could break through within 3-5 years. Once he broke through, he would truly be standing firmly on the martial path.</p><p></p><p>A halo of the Dao Ancestor flickered around Li Xuan, as if the great Dao was converging. His voice was calm but resonated like the sound of the great Dao itself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had anticipated Old Man Xiao's question long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang's path was groped out from primordial chaos, then obtained the purple light's creation to open up heaven and earth. You latecomers all take Tai Cang as the peak, so how could you surpass Tai Cang?</p><p></p><p>"The martial way has no limits. How could the path forward ever be cut off?</p><p></p><p>"You feel the path is cut off simply because your talent and insight are lacking, leaving you confused.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this isn't the most crucial point. What's most crucial is that Tai Cang's martial arts haven't continued to advance, so naturally you have no path forward."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's expression turned desolate. He understood the Dao Ancestor's meaning. Because Tai Cang was dead, their martial arts hadn't continued to grow stronger. So naturally, they couldn't break through their constraints.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cang was the peak of this martial path. For latecomers to surpass the peak, they would need talent and wisdom exceeding Tai Cang's.</p><p></p><p>But who could achieve that?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued: "The purple light is not unique. Becoming a master of heaven and earth is not the only way to advance. Masters of heaven and earth may have considerable power, but they are also constrained by heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"By making oneself heaven and earth, making one's heart heaven and earth, making oneself heaven and earth, one can transcend the heaven and earth of this world, becoming oneself, unbound and unrestricted..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gave a profound and mysterious explanation, then added: "Of course, for you to take this path is nearly impossible now. Your foundation is already set, too deeply influenced by Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>"However, it's not that you can't continue to break through. There is still a path forward!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Old Man Xiao became extremely excited. He bowed respectfully and said: "Please, Dao Ancestor, show us the way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan twirled the jade ruyi scepter in his hand and looked up at the sky. "Whether heaven and earth or the primordial chaos, all things in the world are governed by the great Dao. Heaven and earth should have the Dao of Heaven to be complete. Without establishing the Dao, heaven and earth are ultimately rootless duckweed, ultimately weak and unsupported, ultimately like bubbles.</p><p></p><p>"Your path forward lies in comprehending the Dao of heaven and earth, in cultivating the Dao of Heaven!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's heart trembled, but he was still confused. Comprehend the Dao of heaven and earth? Cultivate the Dao of Heaven? "Venerable one, we cultivate Tai Cang's martial arts. Tai Cang's heaven and earth were opened up by Master Tai Cang. At our level, we've long since comprehended the Dao of heaven and earth. How can we further comprehend it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled slightly and said: "The Dao of heaven and earth I speak of is not the Dao of heaven and earth you have comprehended. What you have comprehended is illusory, merely like bubbles.</p><p></p><p>"Look at this tree. It grows in heaven and earth. What is its Dao? Since you have comprehended the Dao of heaven and earth, and this tree grows in heaven and earth, you should be able to control this tree with your comprehension of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Can you make this tree transform into a sword, a knife, or a spear?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao frowned in thought, then hesitantly said: "That doesn't seem difficult?"</p><p></p><p>"Then try it," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao didn't understand the Dao Ancestor's deeper meaning. He took a deep breath, raised his hand to grab, and instantly uprooted the tree, condensing it into a sword in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable one, see?"</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan shook his head and said: "The sword in your hand only has form without Dao."</p><p></p><p>Saying this, he looked at his eldest disciple Xu Yan and said: "Disciple, transform that tree into a sword."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and with a mere thought, instantly transformed another tree into a sharp sword. It radiated a fierce aura, and one could sense the tree's original vitality and characteristics from the sword.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao stood there stunned. He knew Xu Yan's sword techniques were profound, but only now did he truly realize how terrifying these profound sword techniques were.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sword in his hand, then at the sword in Xu Yan's hand, he became dejected. He tossed away his sword and prostrated himself, saying: "Please, Dao Ancestor, show us the way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled warmly. The Dao Ancestor's halo emanated the rhythm of the great Dao, his voice resonating like the sound of the great Dao itself.</p><p></p><p>"This heaven and earth is incomplete. How can you comprehend the true Dao of heaven and earth? And if you enter the primordial chaos, you will lose yourself and be even less able to find the path forward.</p><p></p><p>"Only by comprehending the Dao of Heaven and cultivating the Dao of Heaven can you have a path forward."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's heart trembled. The Dao Ancestor's meaning was clear - Tai Cang's heaven and earth had no Dao of Heaven, and without the Dao of Heaven, it was naturally an incomplete heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>For him to advance further, he could only comprehend and cultivate the Dao of Heaven. And the prerequisite for this was that Tai Cang's heaven and earth needed to have a Dao of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable one, where is the Dao of Heaven? How can we comprehend it?" Old Man Xiao asked devoutly and respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Behind the Dao Ancestor's halo, Li Xuan smiled brightly. The time was ripe. It was time to let Old Man Xiao, as a realm lord, lend his strength to make Tian Zi operate throughout heaven and earth more quickly, allowing all martial artists to comprehend and cultivate the Dao of Heaven.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 447</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Void-Breaking realm and transforming into a Mountain River Dao Body, Xu Yan's strength increased dramatically, giving him great confidence.</p><p></p><p>"With my current power, I can easily control ordinary Immortal Lords with Divine Intent. It's time to investigate the lair of the Heavenly Fiends and Earth Shadows."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold. </p><p></p><p>He took out a communication talisman to contact Luo Zhan and inquire if he had any leads on the whereabouts of the Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend.</p><p></p><p>"This jade bamboo from Mei Wu is truly a treasure. It seems to contain some kind of pattern that has given me some insights."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the jade bamboo in his hand, Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The jade bamboo contained a certain Dao rhythm. Those profound patterns seemed to follow some kind of rule, which reminded Xu Yan of the laws governing the operation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"It can help me comprehend the Dao Establishment realm sooner."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Establishment realm was extremely profound, as it involved establishing one's own Dao within heaven and earth. After his breakthrough and transformation into a Mountain River Dao Body, Xu Yan had gained some insights into the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>He had formed some vague concepts in his mind, as if he was about to understand how to establish his own Dao and the Dao of heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>He was not far from comprehending the Dao Establishment realm. With this jade bamboo, Xu Yan believed he could greatly shorten the time needed to gain enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"I'll set out from here and continue to explore the Divine Realm, all the way to the Taikun Realm to meet up with Fifth Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked ahead and took a step forward. With a thunderous sound, the void of heaven and earth shattered. He directly crossed through space, instantly traversing a distance of ten thousand miles.</p><p></p><p>"So this is shattering the void of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"However, my strength is still a bit weak. There's too much commotion when I cross through the void. When I can do it silently, I'll have truly mastered the Void-Breaking realm."</p><p></p><p>Traveling by shattering the void of heaven and earth was an ability of the Void-Breaking realm. It involved using the laws of heaven and earth as a spear, with void-breaking power to pierce through the void.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this ability of the Void-Breaking realm that, in a sense, it could counter Immortal Lords who controlled the power of a region of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, I can roam freely in the Divine Realm. I can destroy Immortal Lords with a wave of my hand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"My next goal is the Heaven and Earth realm. I'll strive to perfect my Void-Breaking realm in ten years and break through to the Heaven and Earth realm as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan set his next goal for himself.</p><p></p><p>"I'm much closer to transcending heaven and earth now, and not far from my original hundred-year goal.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also one step closer to matching or surpassing that towering figure."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hadn't forgotten the small goal he had set originally - to transcend heaven and earth within a hundred years, as well as the goal he had set in recent years to match or surpass that towering figure.</p><p></p><p>That towering figure's strength was far beyond ordinary transcendents of heaven and earth, after all. Both Ming Wu and Shan Gu, who had perished together in battle, were transcendents of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"There is no end to the martial path. I must follow in Master's footsteps step by step!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with passion and fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"It's time for my name as the Sword God to resound throughout the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"I'll start by slaying the Immortal Lords of the Heavenly Fiends and Earth Shadows."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan set off on his journey to slay a Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiend.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan broke through, Li Xuan was also extremely excited. His grand martial endeavor was finally about to take another step forward.</p><p></p><p>In his excitement, his fingers couldn't help but start moving, using the Thousand Machinations technique to control the sword inside Mei Wu's body.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, Mei Wu's aura is fluctuating violently. Is she about to go mad with rage?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan clicked his tongue.</p><p></p><p>"Your anger is useless. You can't enter this world, you can't find me, and you can't remove this sword."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>After tormenting Mei Wu for a while, Li Xuan went back to guiding Shi Er and the others in their martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao are also about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain an Immortal realm martial artist with one sword strike. You have gained martial experience."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Are Immortal Lords so insignificant now? Killing an Immortal Lord only gives martial experience."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head helplessly.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan's strength increased, killing True Monarch Lords no longer provided any feedback at all.</p><p></p><p>Killing Immortal Lords only provided feedback in the form of martial experience.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is going to go on a killing spree."</p><p></p><p>From the moment Xu Yan broke through to the Void-Breaking realm, it was destined that he would become famous throughout the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is also about to break through. Let's see how the Myriad Treasures Alliance handles it after his breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Treasures Alliance had been hunting Meng Chong everywhere, putting considerable pressure on him. Wherever he went, if he showed even a slight trace of his presence, Immortal Lords would soon come to hunt him down.</p><p></p><p>He even faced encirclements by Immortal Lords. Several times, Meng Chong had narrowly escaped being surrounded and killed by Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>By now, Meng Chong didn't dare to go to the Heavenly Pit, fearing he would be trapped there.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong was skilled in changing his appearance and concealing his aura, once he used his martial arts, he would inevitably leave traces that could be detected.</p><p></p><p>The physical martial arts that Meng Chong practiced were very different from those of other martial artists in the Divine Realm. Even if he deliberately imitated other martial paths, he could still be recognized.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Treasures Alliance was clearly getting anxious. They were trying to figure out Meng Chong's escape routes and methods, preparing to trap him in one place and then join forces to suppress him.</p><p></p><p>"Once Meng Chong breaks through, he'll go on another killing spree."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Meng Chong, Jiang Buping was much more low-key, trying his best to avoid pursuit from the Taikun Realm. On the rare occasions when his traces were exposed, he easily managed to hide.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was quite familiar with the strength of the Taikun Realm. Before breaking through, he was extremely cautious, afraid of being cornered.</p><p></p><p>"This Taisang Book can be considered the number one treasure of the Taisang Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Taisang Book in his hand. Whoever possessed the Taisang Book and fully comprehended it could become the master of the Taisang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Without a doubt, this was the supreme treasure of the Taisang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"I have my own martial path. This Taisang Book can only serve as a reference. Since I've already mastered it and comprehended the essence of the Taisang Heaven and Earth, I should make use of it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan had some plans.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was founded by Fang Hao, so he might as well give some guidance to Da Yue Huang and the others.</p><p></p><p>With his understanding of the essence of the Taisang Heaven and Earth and his insights into martial arts, he had more than enough to guide Da Yue Huang and the others.</p><p></p><p>Cai Linger was now his maid, practicing the heritage of the Sea Spirit Clan, which also belonged to the Taisang lineage. Li Xuan took some time to give her focused guidance, especially on the laws of heaven and earth and the principles of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>With his guidance, when Cai Linger broke through to the Immortal realm, there would be no bottlenecks. As long as her cultivation reached the required level, she would naturally and smoothly break through.</p><p></p><p>Next were Yue Changming and Yue'er.</p><p></p><p>With his guidance, the martial path ahead for the grandfather and granddaughter would be smooth sailing. At the very least, breaking through to the Immortal realm and beyond would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>As for higher realms, it would depend on their individual talents and comprehension abilities.</p><p></p><p>On this day, news reached the ears of the elders of the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious and unfathomable senior expert who was Master Fang Hao's teacher would be giving a lecture on the Dao in three days.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't quite understand what "lecturing on the Dao" meant, since it was a lecture by a senior expert, it must be a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>So, all the Immortal Lords of the entire Qinghua Sect hurriedly returned, afraid of missing out.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Missing the sage's lecture.</p><p></p><p>A group of Immortal Celestial Lords stood respectfully in the square, waiting for the sage to give a lecture. Everyone was fully focused, not daring to be distracted in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to show off again." </p><p></p><p>Looking at the group of Immortal Celestial Lords, so respectful and solemn, he couldn't help but nod.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghua Sect already has so many Immortal Realm martial artists now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, the assistance of pills was indeed powerful.</p><p></p><p>There were originally many martial artists in Qinghua Realm who were stuck just below the Immortal Realm. After all, they had accumulated over long years. Although unable to break through to the Immortal Realm, they had honed their martial arts for years and had extremely solid foundations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those who could cultivate to this level, which of them wasn't once a genius in their own right? But the Immortal Realm was like an insurmountable barrier, always difficult to cross. The appearance of pills was like placing an iron chain across that barrier, allowing some to cross over.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the number of Immortal Celestial Lords had increased sharply in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, Li Xuan held a jade ruyi scepter in his hand. The Great Wilderness Divine Image appeared, like a scene from the beginning of ancient times, the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's figure could no longer be seen. One could only see that primordial chaos, an image that could not be directly gazed upon.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious aura made this scene even more profound and unfathomable, as if even heaven and earth had become as small as ants.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Celestial Lords all felt their hearts tremble, and they bowed down respectfully and devoutly.</p><p></p><p>"I observe that your martial paths have many setbacks, and you feel confused about the road ahead in your martial arts. Today I will lecture to you all on the Dao of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"How much you can comprehend and understand depends on each of your own opportunities and enlightenment."</p><p></p><p>The voice that entered their ears seemed to come from ancient times, and also seemed to be the sound of heaven and earth. It even seemed to contain the sound of the supreme Dao.</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Celestial Lords bowed even lower, becoming even more devout and solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slowly began to speak. He directly used the principles of heaven and earth to form his voice, which spread out as he began his first lecture.</p><p></p><p>To the group of Immortal Celestial Lords listening, it sounded profound and unfathomable, like the sound of heaven and earth, difficult to understand, yet giving a sense of sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Some martial arts doubts they originally had were instantly clarified.</p><p></p><p>Some martial arts techniques they had not yet successfully cultivated or understood were also comprehended in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even divine abilities they had been struggling to cultivate without any progress suddenly became clear in this moment, as if they had found the direction for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the lecture had long ended. Li Xuan had also returned to his own courtyard, leisurely enjoying tea and tasting the spirit cakes made by Cai Ling'er.</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Celestial Lords were still prostrated on the ground, immersed in the profundity of the lecture, not yet having come to their senses.</p><p></p><p>At some point, someone's aura fluctuated - they had broken through!</p><p></p><p>A moment later, three powerful auras emerged in succession.</p><p></p><p>It was Da Yue Huang and the other two.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Da Yue Huang and the other two opened their eyes, their faces showing excitement - they had finally broken through!</p><p></p><p>They had reached the peak of the Immortal Realm!</p><p></p><p>The three of them had been stuck at the late stage peak of the Immortal Realm for a very long time, always unable to reach perfection.</p><p></p><p>Today, they suddenly gained enlightenment during the lecture, broke through their bottleneck, and perfected their Immortal Realm! They had truly broken through to the peak of martial arts in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, once the Qinghua Sect's grand formation was completed, the perfected Immortal Realm may not necessarily be the peak anymore, as further breakthroughs would become possible.</p><p></p><p>Among the many Immortal Celestial Lords, everyone had gained something, but only they themselves knew how much they had gained.</p><p></p><p>For them, this was a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"So this is what a lecture is!"</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Huang and the other two looked at each other, all having the same tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>They had heard of lectures for the first time, and had gained tremendously from this lecture. This was truly a great master.</p><p></p><p>And this great master was the teacher of Fang Hao, the founding sect master of Qinghua Sect. As the first great master to give a lecture, it wouldn't be excessive to call him the Dao Ancestor, would it? The Qinghua Dao Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>"We thank the Dao Ancestor for the lecture!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Da Yue Huang and the other two kowtowed and called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the other Immortal Celestial Lords also followed suit, kowtowing and calling out.</p><p></p><p>Their voices resounded, spreading out.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. It was just a spur of the moment lecture on the Dao of Heaven and Earth, how had he suddenly been honored with the title of Dao Ancestor?</p><p></p><p>He knew that in the Tai Cang world, there was no such thing as a Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>In fact, before him, there wasn't even the concept of giving lectures.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, and golden light poured forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed. Could it be that giving the lecture had also triggered feedback?</p><p></p><p>"You lectured and enlightened the sect's martial artists, and were honored as the Dao Ancestor. You have obtained the Dao Ancestor Halo."</p><p></p><p>Dao Ancestor Halo!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pleasantly surprised. This was truly an unexpected gain.</p><p></p><p>A profound and mysterious halo appeared behind his head, enveloping him. The misty radiance was like the Dao reflected within, like the Dao permeating it.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, truly wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>With this Dao Ancestor Halo, deceiving and intimidating people would be even easier.</p><p></p><p>Even those stronger than himself would be fooled into kneeling directly upon seeing him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the uses of the Dao Ancestor Halo were not limited to just showing off.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghua Sect was founded by Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu, it belongs to my disciples, so I naturally became the sect's ancestor. So this lecture, which improved the strength of the sect's elders, could naturally receive feedback."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected that a spur of the moment lecture would bring such great gains.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor Halo was put away, and the Golden Book of the Great Dao actually gave feedback again.</p><p></p><p>"You have been honored as the Qinghua Dao Ancestor and obtained the Qinghua Meditation Mat."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the meditation mat, Li Xuan couldn't help but marvel. He had gained another tool for showing off.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Meditation Mat was woven and intertwined with Dao principles, permeated with the rhyme of the Dao. Moreover, sitting on this mat to give lectures could make the listeners more focused and enhance their enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"From now on, I am the Great Wilderness Dao Ancestor, and also the Qinghua Dao Ancestor..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through to the Dao Establishment Realm as soon as possible is the beginning of being a Dao Ancestor. Without establishing the Dao, how can one establish a Dao lineage?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>After all, according to his own words, only after establishing the Dao would one be qualified to establish a Dao lineage.</p><p></p><p>Without establishing a Dao lineage, the title of Dao Ancestor would be too empty.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Establishment Realm is just the beginning. I want to be a true Dao Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's blood suddenly surged with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I can't slack off. From now on, I'll devote myself wholeheartedly to the great cause of martial arts. I should also come up with realms beyond the Dao Establishment Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I am the ancestor of martial arts, an existence on par with the great Dao, a true Dao Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the Golden Book of the Great Dao. It was time to carefully ponder the wonders of the Golden Book of the Great Dao, to add bricks and tiles to his great cause of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>To strive to become a worthy ancestor of martial arts in name and reality!</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Huang and the other Immortal Celestial Lords, after kowtowing and calling out nine times, respectfully departed. Each of them had an excited expression, feeling that the road ahead in their martial arts was broad.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 114: Spiritual Medicines Divided into Nine Grades, the Inner Domain's Heavenly Treasure Pavilion</p><p></p><p>In the East River Prefecture, Xu Yan taught his father and Physician Pan's sword techniques, including the basic Subduing the Dragon Palm technique, and also taught the family's bodyguards.</p><p></p><p>However, the sword techniques cultivated by the bodyguards were a different set.</p><p></p><p>He did not teach the Subduing the Dragon Palm technique, but rather a different palm technique.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, who had reached the Innate Realm, after comprehending the Dao of the Sword and the meaning of the Subduing the Dragon Palm, and having seen the cultivation methods of the Inner Domain, ordinary martial arts techniques were naturally easy for him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the bodyguards were all skilled in martial arts, proficient in the ways of the rivers and lakes. It was just a matter of applying the martial dao's qi and blood to these martial arts, elevating them beyond the mundane.</p><p></p><p>This posed no great difficulty for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It took him half a month to finish the instruction, especially after teaching his own parents the Light Goose Body Technique, before Xu Yan returned to Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready, it was time to venture into the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was filled with excitement, the prosperous martial dao world of the Inner Domain was where true martial artists should go.</p><p></p><p>Back in Cloud Mountain County, the Master was still sitting calmly in the chair in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the cultivation methods I taught may be leaked out."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mentioned the possibility of the cultivation methods being leaked to his Master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was unconcerned. He had already anticipated the possibility of the techniques being leaked when Xu Yan taught his family members. Moreover, he had the intention of spreading martial dao cultivation methods to the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>As the number of cultivators increased, the accumulation would eventually bring him benefits.</p><p></p><p>As long as the martial dao cultivation methods were spread, it was just a matter of balancing the safety of Xu Yan's family. Now that Xu Yan's family members had entered the path of martial cultivation, and were supported by medicinal pills, they were already a step ahead.</p><p></p><p>For later martial cultivators to catch up would not be an easy task. Moreover, with Xu Yan as the towering mountain, they would not dare to target Xu Yan's family.</p><p></p><p>If there were any cultivators who could catch up to Xu Yan's family, their martial talent must be exceptional, and they might even bring some unexpected benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Let it be leaked, martial dao techniques are nothing special. There are countless martial artists in the world, but only a few can truly comprehend the Dao and continuously progress on the martial path."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. Should Master take the initiative to publicly release the cultivation methods?" Xu Yan asked after thinking it over.</p><p></p><p>"Let it be as it will." Li Xuan replied.</p><p></p><p>If they were publicly released, there would be fewer people who would cherish the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, "Seniors always speak of destiny and causality, but I cannot do nothing. The martial dao was passed down by Master, and it was because of Master that the Borderlands now have martial dao."</p><p></p><p>"The martial artists of the Borderlands should know the origin of the martial dao, that Master is the Patriarch of the martial dao. It would not be an exaggeration, would it?"</p><p></p><p>He had some ideas in mind.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu came over and said, "Master, that Kou Ruozhi's ability to handle matters is not bad. May I take him in and teach him the martial dao techniques? In the future when I return to the Inner Domain, he can be of use to me."</p><p></p><p>She could not stay in the Borderlands forever, and one day she would return to the Inner Domain, facing those people. She needed someone capable to handle matters for her.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's ability to regroup the scattered Sky Mother Sect and secretly control Cloud Mountain County and plan in the East River Prefecture showed his extraordinary skills. Su Lingxiu felt that what she lacked upon returning to the Inner Domain was precisely such a cunning and treacherous person who could be used for her own purposes.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could be of use to her.</p><p></p><p>And Kou Ruozhi, though cunning and treacherous, was not a person without principles, he also had his own ambitions.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Li Xuan said indifferently, since the techniques had already been spread, who he taught them to did not matter.</p><p></p><p>"You are the Sky Mother of the Sky Mother Sect, you handle it as you see fit."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I know what to do." Su Lingxiu said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>When she returned to the Inner Domain, she wanted to bring a group of people with her, the more the stronger, so that she could obtain more spiritual medicines and alchemical resources.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, Master is the one who brought the martial dao to the Borderlands, the martial cultivators should know of Master's existence as a Martial Dao Patriarch and Sage." Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes lit up, and she narrowed her eyes and said, "No problem, I'll leave it to Kou Ruozhi to handle. Master is the Patriarch of the Borderlands' martial dao, the Martial Dao Sage..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, his disciples really had some ideas. Him becoming the Patriarch of the Borderlands' martial dao, the Martial Dao Sage? </p><p></p><p>The titles sounded quite impressive.</p><p></p><p>He no longer cared, if the titles of Martial Dao Sage and Patriarch of the Borderlands' martial dao became renowned, it might bring some unexpected benefits.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the martial dao he had established, distinct from the martial dao of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to go to the Inner Domain." Xu Yan said with an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this, and he nodded, "Go then, it's time for you to venture into the martial dao world."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had returned.</p><p></p><p>The eldest disciple was going to the Inner Domain, and he was also very excited. He just awaited his own breakthrough to the Innate Realm, then he would follow the eldest disciple's footsteps and go to the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>With all three disciples here, and Su Lingxiu being from the Inner Domain, naturally she understood the Inner Domain the best.</p><p></p><p>As the disciples were about to venture into the martial dao world, as their Master, Li Xuan should impart some experience to them.</p><p></p><p>Although Li Xuan had not personally ventured into the martial dao world, that did not prevent him from passing on experiences to his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao world is complex, with treacherous human hearts. As you go to the Inner Domain, remember to be vigilant, for countless strong figures have fallen due to carelessness, underestimation, and arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Do not fully reveal your strength before others, do not underestimate any martial artist, even if their strength is far inferior to yours. As long as they are enemies, you must kill them without mercy. </p><p></p><p>If the enemy has backers, powerful figures supporting them, then be more low-key, find an opportunity to quietly eliminate them and their backers, leaving no traces. Or wait until your strength is sufficient, then strike with thunderous force to wipe them out.</p><p></p><p>When you first enter the martial dao world, you are like a fledgling entering the forest, you must be low-key and cautious. If necessary, put on a disguise to not expose your true identity..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke with a stern expression, imparting the experiences he had seen in novels from his previous life, passing them all on to his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Lingxiu, who had fled from the Inner Domain, listened with rapt attention. Master's experiences in navigating the martial dao world were truly rich and valuable.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was also filled with admiration, no wonder he was a high-level expert, having weathered countless vicissitudes and dangers, these were priceless experiences.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the high-level expert, her own experience in the martial dao world seemed so lacking.</p><p></p><p>After imparting the experiences, Li Xuan added, "Experiences are dead, people are alive. The world is ever-changing, you must understand flexibility and adaptability. This is the true essence of martial dao world experience.</p><p></p><p>Do not rigidly follow the experiences I have passed on, they are merely for your reference. You must learn to be flexible and adaptable, understand?"</p><p></p><p>He was afraid that the disciples would follow his experiences to the letter, and if they differed too greatly from the actual situation in the Inner Domain martial dao world, it would lead to unnecessary conflicts and complications.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>So, I must advise my disciples that this is just for reference. The true experience of venturing into the martial arts world lies in flexible adaptation!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I understand, disciple!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, as he was quite at ease with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Having reached the realm of a grandmaster, even if he were to encounter a great grandmaster, he would still be able to escape, even if he couldn't defeat them.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts in the inner realm are diverse. Do not be arrogant or look down on the martial arts of the inner realm just because you have cultivated the martial arts passed down by your master. You must observe more, learn more, understand the essence and grasp the true meaning.</p><p></p><p>"I hope that you all can integrate the myriad of techniques into your own path, and forge your own martial arts journey.</p><p></p><p>"Rather than step-by-step following in my footsteps, walking the path I have walked."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully bowed and felt admiration, this was a true master!</p><p></p><p>Not one to have his disciples follow in his exact footsteps, but one who guides them to blaze their own trail.</p><p></p><p>"I hope that one day, you will walk your own path, surpassing even me. I will be delighted to see you surpass the one who taught you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expression of high hopes for his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"My disciples, expand your horizons, create more martial arts techniques for your master. As for surpassing me, don't even hope for that, I'm just trying to pump you up."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master, we will not disappoint you!" </p><p></p><p>The eyes of Xu Yan and the others were glistening. Their master was truly great, his lifelong wish was for his disciples to surpass him and forge new paths.</p><p></p><p>Deducing from this, their master's realm must be unfathomably high, could it be that he has reached the pinnacle of the martial arts?</p><p></p><p>No!</p><p></p><p>Impossible, for the master had said that the martial arts are boundless.</p><p></p><p>After instructing his disciples, Li Xuan fell silent, allowing Xu Yan and the others to discuss amongst themselves. Moreover, Su Ling Xiu still needed to introduce the inner realm to the eldest disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, let me introduce the spirit herbs. Before going to the inner realm, I will definitely bring back spirit herbs for you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of going to the inner realm was none other than the spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>To refine the Longevity Elixir and various other pills for his parents' cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Before going to the inner realm, he had to make preparations in advance.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also had an excited expression, it wouldn't be long before he too would go to the inner realm, one of his purposes being to find spirit herbs for his shijie.</p><p></p><p>And the pills refined from spirit herbs were the true elixirs!</p><p></p><p>Shi Er squatted beside them, with the Red Cat lying next to him.</p><p></p><p>He was also listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was also delighted, if her shixiong could bring back spirit herbs, she would be able to refine more elixirs, and her elixir refinement skills could also improve further.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, let me introduce the spirit herbs to you. Since ancient times, spirit herbs are divided into nine grades, like this Water Spirit Grass, it is a grade nine spirit herb, belonging to the lowest level. However, its environmental requirements are not high, so it is relatively common, but also inexpensive..."</p><p></p><p>Spirit herbs are divided into nine grades, with grade one being the highest. However, the inner realm does not have any grade one spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>"So far, the highest grade spirit herb in the inner realm is grade six. I have never heard of grade seven or above, whether they exist or not, I do not know."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan puzzled, "If the inner realm doesn't have grade one spirit herbs, how do they know there are grade one spirit herbs?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"It has been categorized this way since ancient times, presumably they have appeared before, and they may not necessarily not exist, it's just that they are too rare. If someone discovers them, they won't spread the news, afraid of inviting trouble, and they definitely won't sell them externally."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"I see."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"Currently in the inner realm, grade six spirit herbs are almost the highest grade herbs available, they are almost impossible to obtain..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu continued to introduce.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, when you go to the inner realm, besides trading with others or finding them yourself, the most convenient way to obtain spirit herbs is to go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion is a powerful force in the inner realm, each city has a branch of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu introduced the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion is a commercial alliance force in the inner realm, no one knows how terrifying its foundations are. It is rumored that the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has a mysterious place where it possesses spirit herb fields and masters the techniques of cultivating spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has the ability to explore spirit crystal mines, controlling a huge number of spirit crystal mines, making it the number one commercial force in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Each city's branch has a grandmaster cultivator stationed.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has excellent reputation, never heard of any internal strife. Moreover, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion also purchases various treasures, whether it's spirit herbs, martial arts techniques, spirit crystals, etc., you can obtain them from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"If you have a large number of spirit crystals and are worried about storing them at home, you can store them at the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, although they will charge a storage fee, but it is worth it for the safety.</p><p></p><p>"The inner realm also circulates spirit tickets, which are spirit crystal vouchers, introduced by the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Cultivators only need to carry the spirit tickets, without having to carry numerous spirit crystals on them.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit tickets can be exchanged for an equal amount of spirit crystals at any Heavenly Treasure Pavilion branch in the inner realm cities..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu emphasized the introduction of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Any inner realm cultivator cannot avoid dealing with the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong listened with great admiration, the inner realm is truly prosperous, actually having such a powerful commercial force as the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The reason why the Borderlands is called the Borderlands is not without reason.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been silently listening the whole time, inwardly admiring, this Heavenly Treasure Pavilion is truly formidable, even creating something like spirit tickets.</p><p></p><p>It has also opened up services similar to a bank, allowing cultivators to store spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Of course, unlike a bank that gives interest to depositors, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion charges a storage fee.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, if you want to conveniently obtain spirit herbs and various treasures, you can go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, there you can find everything a cultivator needs, as long as you can afford the price.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, there are also other shops in the inner realm, but they are far inferior to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Some of these shops engage in shady dealings, although certain treasures may be cheaper than the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, you must be cautious."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu continued to introduce.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, when you first go to the inner realm, it's best not to go to those small shops, choose the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion first, after all, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has a good reputation, they won't cheat or deceive customers."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu thought, her eldest shixiong has no spirit crystals, when he goes to the inner realm, he will be penniless.</p><p></p><p>Maybe she should bring some elixirs to sell to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, in exchange for spirit crystals or directly for spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan spoke: "Any force has its unsavory side, no matter how good their reputation is, it's just that they haven't found anything valuable enough to go after. </p><p></p><p>"Even if they have done some shady dealings in the past, as long as they covered their tracks well and killed anyone who knew, naturally their reputation would remain intact."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was startled, "Master is right, the elixirs are unprecedented in value in the inner realm, if shixiong takes them to sell, what if the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion takes an interest?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, she abandoned the idea of giving her eldest shixiong elixirs to exchange for spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

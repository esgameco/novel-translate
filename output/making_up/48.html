            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 48: In My Eyes, They Are All Insignificant</p><p></p><p>The sky was just starting to brighten, with the sun not yet risen. In the city of Donghe Prefecture, influential figures and well-connected powers were all waiting for news from the government office.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the common people and small merchants had already begun preparing for the new day's livelihood.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sound of hurried footsteps echoed through the streets and alleys.</p><p></p><p>"The imperial court has issued an order to apprehend the heretical followers of the Tianmu Sect. All are to remain indoors. Any who dare to go out will be treated as rebels of the Tianmu Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The people of Donghe Prefecture were immediately gripped with fear. The citizens all locked their doors and, peering through the cracks in the windows, watched as squad after squad of armed soldiers marched by, their hearts filled with trepidation.</p><p></p><p>Was the world about to descend into chaos again?</p><p></p><p>The heavy footsteps resounded on the streets as soldiers in armor and wielding weapons surrounded the prefecture government office, sealing it off completely.</p><p></p><p>The battle had already begun. Inside the office, Kou Ruozhi and the Twelve Peaks, along with the county magistrate, looked at the army outside with grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Military Strategist Kou, it seems that Jiang Pingshan had already set an ambush to capture us all!"</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate's face was heavy with worry.</p><p></p><p>"There must be a traitor within our sect, and the news has leaked out. Look, those are the Shenwei troops!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi, however, did not appear panicked. He pointed his feather fan at the underground passage.</p><p></p><p>On the main street of the prefecture, a line of heavily armored soldiers, carrying long spears and swords, and riding armored war horses, came thundering in. The Tianmu Sect followers, even the top-tier experts, were no match for this mighty army and were easily pierced by the long spears.</p><p></p><p>This was the fearsome Shenwei Army of the Qi Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>The county magistrate drew in a sharp breath, exclaiming in shock, "They've even deployed the Shenwei Army to Donghe Prefecture. Surely the Qi court must have known of our sect's schemes long ago? This is merely a pretext to eliminate the Xu family, luring us into a trap!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi let out a cold laugh. "The foolish old Qi Emperor may have a few capable subordinates, but to think they can surround and kill us is just a pipe dream. Let's go and see how the Xu family will respond."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi turned and left, the others quickly following behind him.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenwei Army, let's see if Xu Yan will prevail, or if the Shenwei Army is stronger!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi muttered as he led the group into the underground passage, escaping from the government office.</p><p></p><p>The battle at the office was now nearing its end, with the Tianmu Sect followers being defeated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Xu family estate, Physician Pan had returned with over a dozen people.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly unbelievable that the young master has cultivated the supreme martial arts! The Xu family is now safe!"</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Pan, with Xu Yan gone, the safety of the Xu family now rests on your shoulders," Xu Junhe sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe had already dismissed the bodyguards and enforcers. The dozen or so experts Physician Pan had brought were his trusted confidants, who could be considered his personal death squad, carefully cultivated over time.</p><p></p><p>They were originally meant to help Xu Yan escape from the Qi Kingdom, but now they would be used to protect Xu Junhe and his wife.</p><p></p><p>"Rest assured, sir!" Physician Pan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Rumble, rumble!</p><p></p><p>The ground shook as a line of cavalry, carrying long spears and swords, charged towards them.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a voice called out.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Junhe, do not resist in vain. Surrender, and perhaps your life can be spared."</p><p></p><p>It was Jiang Pingshan's voice.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Xu family gates, Xu Junhe and his group stepped out.</p><p></p><p>"The Shenwei Army!" Physician Pan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe took a deep breath and looked at Xu Yan. "Yan'er, do you have the confidence? If not, then flee, no need to fight to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes gleamed with excitement, his fighting spirit soaring. Since cultivating the martial arts, he had never encountered a true challenge. Now, he finally had the chance to unleash his full might!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Qi Kingdom's Shenwei Army, renowned for its might, would now face off against the elite troops of the worldly dynasty.</p><p></p><p>"Father, don't worry, these are mere chickens and dogs in my eyes!" he said, and with a movement, he soared into the air, drifting like a falling leaf carried by the wind.</p><p></p><p>"The old Qi Emperor's family affairs have implicated the innocent. Is it so hard for the Xu family to do some business? They actually dared to fantasize about raiding my home and slapping me with the charge of rebellion. Today, I, Xu Yan, will teach this so-called Shenwei Army a lesson on their combat prowess!"</p><p></p><p>His voice boomed like thunderous roars on the street.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family's residence was located in the core of the county city, where only the wealthy and noble resided.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the windows of the pavilions opened a crack, and the onlookers observed the Shenwei Army on the street below.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's words reverberated, shocking many.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Xu was wise all his life, but he ended up with a foolish son. Now he's done for!"</p><p></p><p>"They say Xu Yan is not right in the head, and now it seems he's not just that, but utterly reckless!"</p><p></p><p>Those secretly observing the scene sighed in dismay.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" a furious roar came from behind the army.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" With the order given, a thunderous rumble shook the ground as the Shenwei Army, their long spears erect and armor gleaming with a cold light, surged forward like a terrifying flood, charging straight at the Xu family's residence and Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Come then!" Xu Yan bellowed, his blood surging. A massive crimson dragon coiled around him, and he thrust out his palms, unleashing two gigantic dragon projections.</p><p></p><p>From the pavilions above, the onlookers were stunned. They saw the crimson dragon wrapped around Xu Yan, and then the two dragon projections he unleashed, directly towards the charging Shenwei Army.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The powerful Descending Dragon Palm technique sent the soldiers flying, horses and men tumbling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan advanced, not retreating, his palms swinging as he unleashed wave after wave of Descending Dragon Palms. The crimson dragons surged and struck, instantly shattering the Shenwei Army's charge.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The shops on the sides of the street were smashed by the flying horses and soldiers.</p><p></p><p>One Shenwei soldier after another, clad in armor, was flung into the air, crashing into the shops, utterly helpless.</p><p></p><p>"This... this..." </p><p></p><p>"Impossible! It must be an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Lord Xu's foolish son has found a supreme martial art?"</p><p></p><p>"But aren't those tales just fiction?"</p><p></p><p>All who witnessed this were shocked beyond belief. That crimson dragon's terrifying power was clearly superhuman.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan alone had broken the charge of the vaunted Shenwei Army, the elite of the elite, the army that could be considered the kingdom's pillar.</p><p></p><p>The "foolish son" of the Xu family, once the laughingstock for his obsession with seeking out hidden masters, had now proven himself beyond doubt.</p><p></p><p>Those who had secretly mocked him were now the ones left dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A shop was smashed open, and terrified screams rang out. Xu Yan retracted his Descending Dragon Palm, surveying the devastated street and the fallen Shenwei soldiers.</p><p></p><p>Coldly, he said, "Jiang Pingshan, your Shenwei Army cannot unleash its full might within the city. If you refuse to accept defeat, then let's take this outside, and I'll see it through to the end!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 228</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure flashed as he teleported in front of the giant dragon, as if it was already within Yuqing Snake's expectations. Yuqing Snake's enraged strike, its massive tail burning with white flames, came down like a thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>However, to its astonishment, Xu Yan suddenly teleported away again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Yuqing Snake tried to retract its attack, but it was too late. The massive tail still struck the giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! </p><p></p><p>The tomb chamber shook, and the coiled dragon was shattered by the blow.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of its destruction, a spiritual wave rippled out.</p><p></p><p>Faintly, a roar seemed to echo through the chamber.</p><p></p><p>At this instant, the young geniuses of the Yushan Sect were all struck with terror.</p><p></p><p>The shattered dragon's head revealed an opening, and ripples emanated from within, the roar coming from there as well.</p><p></p><p>Plop! The moonstone on the tomb's ceiling fell down, like a falling star, towards the opening.</p><p></p><p>As the moonstone fell, its light illuminated the entrance, revealing the dark cavern within.</p><p></p><p>Crack! The moonstone fell into the cavern, lighting up a small area and dimly revealing a massive head with a single horn raised.</p><p></p><p>A faint spiritual wave emanated from the cavern.</p><p></p><p>"Is that the Azure Sky Flood Dragon?" </p><p></p><p>One of the geniuses exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>The tomb chamber had now fallen into complete darkness, and Yuqing Snake had shrunk its size, disappearing into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly. He had just sensed the faint spiritual wave and teleported to avoid Yuqing Snake's attack. After evading several attacks, he found that the spiritual wave did not pursue him, but seemed to linger around the dragon, luring Yuqing Snake to shatter it.</p><p></p><p>"Go in!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the young Yushan Sect disciples gestured, grabbing one of the scouts and throwing him into the opening.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" </p><p></p><p>The scout was terrified, unable to stop his descent. He was only at the peak of the Grand Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Everyone looked into the opening, and under the moonstone's light, they saw the scout struggling to get up from the ground, right beneath the massive head.</p><p></p><p>"It's dead, it's already dead!" </p><p></p><p>The scout's voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"You all go down." </p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciple frowned, pushing all the remaining scouts down into the cavern.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Sky Flood Dragon is dead, my lords!" </p><p></p><p>The voices of the scouts echoed up.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, enter!" </p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciple moved, stepping into the opening and descending into the cavern.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already taken the Emerald Viper Tree and Dragon's Eye Fruit. The geniuses were furious, but could do nothing about it. They had realized how profound and elusive Xu Yan's movement techniques were, surpassing even Yuqing Snake's.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the geniuses entered the cavern.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood still, his gaze fixed on a certain spot as a dark shadow flashed and disappeared into the darkness.</p><p></p><p>Looking down into the cavern, the gathered geniuses had brought out illumination, lighting up the space.</p><p></p><p>Though they could not see the full form of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, they could clearly make out its massive serpentine head.</p><p></p><p>After a moment of contemplation, Xu Yan also entered the cavern.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body was surprisingly well-preserved. If they could obtain its blood and essence, Mengchong could use it to rapidly accumulate physical foundation and break through to the Great Day Unbreakable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan entered, the Yushan Sect disciples glared at him angrily.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual herbs above were all picked by you. The ones here don't belong to you. If you dare to fight for them, we will kill you!"</p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciple said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan swept his gaze across the gathered people, revealing a disdainful smile. "The weak have no right to dictate to me."</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciples were furious.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan paid them no mind, his gaze examining the cavern.</p><p></p><p>A massive azure-backed, white-bellied flood dragon lay coiled within, and around it and beneath it was a layer of pale green sand.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the dragon's body were dozens of spiritual herbs, emanating a faint icy, yin aura that permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal power of these herbs was nourishing the dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>"Grade One spiritual herbs?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was shocked. Though he did not recognize these herbs, he could tell they were all Grade One.</p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciples took a deep breath, also observing the cavern. Now was not the time to fight.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Verdant Deathly Sand?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the green sand around and under the dragon's body, the Yushan Sect disciple's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Can it preserve the body from decay and has yin energy?" </p><p></p><p>Dai Jun exclaimed in astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The thick layer of Verdant Deathly Sand here was puzzling - its yin energy seemed to have been greatly diminished. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that after so much time, the energy had been absorbed by the dragon's body?</p><p></p><p>To prevent decay, a body would need to absorb yin energy.</p><p></p><p>As the top genius of Yuzhou's number one spiritual sect, the Yushan Sect disciple had seen many spiritual treasures. He recognized the herbs around them.</p><p></p><p>"Yin Darkness Flower, Poisonous Soul Grass, Earthly Yin Vine..."</p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciple said, his face filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>These were all rare Grade One spiritual herbs, with rather esoteric effects, and without exception, they contained yin-type medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>"The Earthly Yin Vine and Yin Darkness Flower were likely not just Grade One originally, but their grade had fallen due to the loss of too much of their medicinal power..."</p><p></p><p>The Yushan Sect disciple grew more and more uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it's the Azure Sky Flood Dragon. It actually managed to gather so many rare spiritual treasures as its burial offerings!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Even though the dragon had been dead for countless years, its mere corpse exuded an overwhelming pressure, instilling a sense of danger.</p><p></p><p>No wonder it was a peak Sixth-Rank Spiritual Beast that had once devoured Refining God Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stared intently at the dragon's corpse, feeling that something was off. Though this was a flood dragon's body, the faint spiritual wave was undoubtedly emanating from it.</p><p></p><p>How could a dead dragon's body have a spiritual wave? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Verdant Deathly Sand, Yin Darkness Flower, and Earthly Yin Vine had all lost their medicinal power, especially the Verdant Deathly Sand, whose yin energy had nearly vanished, seemingly absorbed by the body.</p><p></p><p>The massive azure dragon lay coiled, its head slightly raised, the single horn now turned black.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were tightly closed, with no sign of life.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan's pupils contracted.</p><p></p><p>He had just realized that something was wrong!</p><p></p><p>Between the dragon's scales, fine fuzz had grown, covering the entire body, as if it had sprouted after death.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan recalled something he had read in a certain book - a special demonic entity.</p><p></p><p>The Corpse Fiend!</p><p></p><p>"Has the Azure Sky Flood Dragon become a Corpse Fiend?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought, his heart racing with shock.</p><p></p><p>"No, judging from the setup here, could it be that the Azure Sky Flood Dragon prepared for its transformation into a Corpse Fiend?"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xu Yan felt a chill run down his spine.</p><p></p><p>If a Refining God Celestial-level Azure Sky Flood Dragon became a Corpse Fiend, how terrifying would that be? His gaze then fell to the white belly of the dragon, where it seemed two...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The claws were slightly exposed! "This is what just emerged!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was secretly alarmed. The Azure Sky Flood Dragon, either it didn't die, or it had truly transformed into a corpse ghoul as speculated.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a beam of light shot down from the entrance of the cave, heading straight for the corpse of the Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Stop him!"</p><p></p><p>A youth from the Jade Spirit Sect swung his sword, trying to block the Jade Crystal Snake.</p><p></p><p>However, the Jade Crystal Snake seized this opportunity and suddenly attacked, and with its extreme speed, the young cultivators from the Jade Spirit Sect were unable to stop it in time.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Jade Crystal Snake instantly landed on the head of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, hissing angrily, "This is mine, all mine, you thieves!"</p><p></p><p>It raised its head and suddenly dove down, burrowing into the Flood Dragon's nostril.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A ripple of energy spread out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved swiftly, quickly rushing out of the cave entrance.</p><p></p><p>A sense of oppression suddenly appeared when the Jade Crystal Snake burrowed into the Flood Dragon's nostril.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, flee!"</p><p></p><p>The group of talented cultivators in the cave also sensed that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>Achoo!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sneeze erupted, and the coiled Azure Sky Flood Dragon shook its head, the sneeze expelling the Jade Crystal Snake.</p><p></p><p>Its tightly closed eyes suddenly snapped open.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The fierce gaze swept across the group of cultivators, and it suddenly opened its massive jaws, biting towards a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The cave entrance was too small for them to all escape together, the cultivators were scrambling at the entrance, while the Jade Spirit Sect youth and Dai Jun, being closest to the entrance, had already fled inside first.</p><p></p><p>The ominous giant fangs, exhaling a gray mist with a foul, rotten stench, caused the cultivator's expression to change drastically. He hastily grabbed a scout warrior and flung him into the gaping maw.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's mouth closed, instantly swallowing the warrior.</p><p></p><p>Newly awakened, still seemingly in a daze, but after swallowing the flesh and blood, it was as if stimulated, a bloodthirsty light surging in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to have become energized.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!"</p><p></p><p>The group of cultivators were horrified, and they launched their attacks, a thunderous boom as the cave entrance was shattered.</p><p></p><p>They began to flee!</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon was actually alive?!</p><p></p><p>Roar! A roar echoed, the Flood Dragon's massive body moved, and with its movement, the tomb chamber began to collapse, the Black Rock Mountain shaking.</p><p></p><p>Outside, the Black Mist Swamp was boiling, the poisonous miasma beginning to surge out.</p><p></p><p>"This is too terrifying, let's hurry and escape!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Rock Mountain, Shen Haizhou's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>He was the only one who had not entered the cave, and after sensing something was amiss, he was the first to flee.</p><p></p><p>That faint spiritual fluctuation, in addition to Xu Yan, he had also detected it.</p><p></p><p>Shifting his body, he quickly departed.</p><p></p><p>The Black Mist Swamp was boiling, the Black Rock Mountain was shaking, the poisonous miasma spreading once more.</p><p></p><p>Bang! At a certain moment, the entire Black Rock Mountain exploded.</p><p></p><p>A giant azure-backed, white-bellied flood dragon soared into the sky, circling in the air.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of figures were fleeing in a disheveled manner towards the outer edge of the Black Mist Swamp.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, a powerful spiritual pressure descended, causing the fleeing cultivators to instantly stiffen, feeling as if a great mountain was pressing down on them.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou had already fled far away, almost out of the Black Mist Swamp, and when he looked back, he saw the surging black mist, the Black Mist Swamp bubbling with massive air pockets.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of foul energy, wave after wave of poisonous miasma, were all converging towards the giant flood dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Sky Flood Dragon didn't die? How is that possible!" </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's fearsome reputation was from a time long ago, a peak sixth-rank spirit beast, there was no way it could still be alive now!</p><p></p><p>"Something seems off!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was alarmed, the poisonous miasma and foul energy were all converging towards the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, as if the Flood Dragon was absorbing these toxic and polluted energies.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Mist Swamp, it was set up by the Azure Sky Flood Dragon."</p><p></p><p>The entire Black Mist Swamp, and the Black Rock Mountain, were all created by the Flood Dragon, in order for it to survive? "That brother, he couldn't have died, right?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou had reached the edge of the Black Mist Swamp, sighing inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The original location of the Black Rock Mountain had already collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Wave after wave of toxic gas continuously flowed into the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>And in the distance, the group of cultivators were stiff, as if a great mountain was pressing down on them, their consciousness becoming heavy.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Suppression! </p><p></p><p>This was a powerful ability possessed by cultivators who had reached the Forged Spirit Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>And the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, a peak sixth-rank spirit beast, its spiritual might was naturally extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect youth's face flushed red, constantly activating his cultivation techniques, and at a certain moment, he finally reached into his storage pouch, taking out a short dagger.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Pouring all his strength into it, constantly infusing the dagger with energy.</p><p></p><p>The dagger began to glow with a faint light, and at a certain moment, he unleashed it.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! A beam of light erupted from in front of him, a fierce blade light flashing, and the short dagger suddenly shattered.</p><p></p><p>In the moment of shattering, it released a burst of icy, sharp blade light.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Jade Spirit Sect youth only felt his body loosen, escaping the oppressive mountain-like pressure, coughing up blood as he frantically fled.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Azure Sky Flood Dragon let out a roar, opening its mouth to shoot out a black beam towards the Jade Spirit Sect youth.</p><p></p><p>This attack on its part caused its spiritual pressure to momentarily slacken.</p><p></p><p>Seizing the opportunity, Dai Jun grabbed a nearby cultivator, taking advantage of the other's inability to react in time, and flung him towards the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, then frantically fled.</p><p></p><p>"Dai Jun, you..." </p><p></p><p>The cultivator was furious and aghast.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The foul, rotten-smelling giant maw viciously clamped down, swallowing him.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The fleeing Jade Spirit Sect youth turned and slashed out with his sword, the long blade shattering but releasing a powerful attack to block the black beam for a moment.</p><p></p><p>But his body then plummeted into the Black Mist Swamp.</p><p></p><p>When the black beam dissipated, he burst out from the swamp, the sound of sizzling constantly ringing out as he hastily removed all his clothes, also stuffing spirit medicines into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun had blood trickling from the corner of his mouth, a black beam shot towards him from behind, and despite his desperate resistance, the black beam still pierced through his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Instantly, half his body turned gray.</p><p></p><p>While continuously shoving spirit medicines into his mouth, he stumbled towards the shore of the Black Mist Swamp, fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Suddenly, a knife stabbed into his back from behind, piercing through his chest, Dai Jun turned to look, seeing a chubby face smiling benevolently.</p><p></p><p>"You... I lent you money before!"</p><p></p><p>It was Shen Haizhou, taking advantage of the situation!</p><p></p><p>"Brother Dai, you are an upright person, you lent me money to buy back my treasured possession, so seeing you in such agony, I couldn't bear it, and have thus ended your suffering."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou sighed.</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun's features were twisted in rage.</p><p></p><p>"Believe me, you're beyond saving, the poison has seeped too deep, half your body has turned black, it's best to find peace now."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou had a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Shen Haizhou, I'll f*ck your mother..."</p><p></p><p>Dai Jun uttered the last profanity of his life.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the corpse on the ground, Shen Haizhou sighed, "Why didn't you believe me? I was truly doing this for your own good, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon has become a corpse ghoul, you were poisoned by it, you would have turned into a corpse puppet."</p><p></p><p>The blade flashed, completely crushing Dai Jun's corpse.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 287</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A golden-horned, purple-spotted deer was walking through the sky, radiating a magnificent aura, as if it was wrapped in a layer of purple light. Sitting on the deer's back was a young man.</p><p></p><p>He had a round, chubby face with a silly smile.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was riding his spiritual beast, muttering to himself, "The Yuzhou Alliance is too weak. That guy Yu Gao is quite useless. The Grand Alliance actually sent me to intimidate the geniuses of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"What geniuses could this declining place of Yuzhou have? My opponent is Cui Huayu.</p><p></p><p>"The old fellows of the Grand Alliance don't even know who the true geniuses are. I, Zhu Xingzheng, will definitely rank among the top geniuses, but they sent me to Yuzhou - they must have gone blind."</p><p></p><p>Although he had a silly smile on his face, Zhu Xingzheng was cursing and complaining about the old fellows of the Grand Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Zhu Xingzheng was startled as he noticed someone waving at him from below.</p><p></p><p>"Doesn't he realize I'm riding a sixth-rank spiritual beast? And he still dares to wave at me?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, those two young ladies are so beautiful. Could they be in trouble? I should go help them."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng rode the golden-horned, purple-spotted deer down to where Li Xuanand the others were.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly got off the deer's back and ran up to Su Lingxiu and Yue'er, his round face beaming with an even sillier smile. "Young ladies, are you in any trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Yue'er looked at him with strange expressions. If he had ill intentions, his honest and enthusiastic demeanor didn't seem to match that.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already circled the golden-horned, purple-spotted deer, and the more he looked at it, the more satisfied he became. The deer had golden horns and purple spots on its body, faintly emanating a purple glow.</p><p></p><p>Another sixth-rank spiritual beast. Riding this beast would barely maintain his identity as an extraordinary expert.</p><p></p><p>"Little fatty, how much do you want for this spiritual beast?" Li Xuan pulled the fawning Zhu Xingzheng towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Not for sale!" Zhu Xingzheng became alert immediately.</p><p></p><p>"This is the spiritual beast I painstakingly subdued and tamed. You can't even think about taking it away from me, no matter how many spirit stones you offer!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng stood protectively in front of the golden deer, speaking firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Little fatty, just give us a price. My master is in need of a mount," Su Lingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>Since her master was an extraordinary expert, he wouldn't do anything like forcibly seizing someone's mount. Buying it would be the proper way.</p><p></p><p>And if they could afford it, that would be even better.</p><p></p><p>"Yeah, give us a price, little fatty!" Yue'er also chimed in.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng looked at Li Xuan, realizing that these two young ladies' master was this man. He was now in a dilemma, his face full of conflict as he said, "It's not that I don't want to sell, but you two young ladies don't know - Little Gold and I have been inseparable for ten years.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years, even a mosquito would have feelings. How can I just sell him like that? This is not just about the spirit stones..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took out a bottle of medicinal pills and said, "These are pills refined from rare spiritual herbs like Divineheart Flowers. Their miraculous effects..."</p><p></p><p>After explaining the amazing effects of the pills, she asked, "So, how about it? Will you sell?"</p><p></p><p>"These pills are truly that miraculous?" Zhu Xingzheng was still skeptical.</p><p></p><p>"Try one, and you'll know." Su Lingxiu tossed a pill to him.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng took the pill, examining it carefully. His expression became serious as he felt the extraordinary power contained within. He quickly turned and fed the pill to the golden deer, saying, "Little Gold, quickly eat it, don't let it go to waste!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found this little fatty quite amusing.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's face darkened a bit. This jerk was afraid it might be poisonous, and yet he claimed to have such deep feelings for his spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>After eating the pill, the golden-horned, purple-spotted deer's spiritual energy became much more vibrant, and it exclaimed excitedly, "Delicious, delicious! I feel my spiritual sense has been nourished and enhanced!"</p><p></p><p>The purple spots on its body began to glow even brighter.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Zhu Xingzheng's eyes lit up. "Young lady, this bottle of pills doesn't seem enough. My spiritual beast is a sixth-rank one, look at its coloring and bearing - riding it would be so impressive and powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu couldn't help but smile. "A bottle has twelve pills, which is not little. These are extremely rare, even with spiritual herbs, it would take years to refine just a few."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zhu Xingzheng felt it made sense. Such miraculous pills must be difficult to refine. Twelve pills in a bottle should be enough to strengthen his spiritual sense and maybe even break through to a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, deal!" Zhu Xingzheng agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>With the pills in hand, Zhu Xingzheng was overjoyed. But the golden-horned, purple-spotted deer was dumbfounded, its spiritual energy fluctuating as it let out a wail, "You're just selling me off? I've been with you for ten years, ten years!"</p><p></p><p>It stomped its hooves on the ground, clearly agitated and feeling betrayed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan and the others watched this with bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng patted the deer's head solemnly, "Little Gold, I'm doing this for your own good. How is this selling you? This is letting you live a better life!"</p><p></p><p>The deer's spiritual energy was in turmoil as it roared, "Was my father also sold by you? You lied to me, saying my father went to seek opportunities, but actually you sold him, didn't you?</p><p></p><p>"I thought you were generously letting my father go, and I was so grateful to you. But now I realize, you were just selling him!"</p><p></p><p>The deer raged, its hooves stomping the ground as the purple light on its body grew even brighter.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan and the others looked at Zhu Xingzheng with strange expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Little Gold, don't be angry, listen to me," Zhu Xingzheng stroked the deer's head, speaking seriously. "I'm truly doing this for your own good. Think about it, the effects of these pills are amazing, right? If you follow this young lady's master, you'll be able to eat such pills in the future, and your strength will grow, maybe even becoming a supreme spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>"But if you stay with me, what can I give you? Rather than let you suffer and struggle with me, it's better for you to follow this beautiful young lady. I, Zhu Xingzheng, truly see you as a brother. If I wasn't trying to do this for your benefit, would I be half-selling, half-gifting you to this young lady?"</p><p></p><p>The golden deer stared with wide eyes, feeling that Zhu Xingzheng's words made some sense, but still sensing something was off.</p><p></p><p>"What about my father then?" The deer thought of its father, remembering that Zhu Xingzheng had said its father had encountered a great opportunity and was allowed to leave.</p><p></p><p>"An extraordinary expert was in need of a companion, so I arranged for your father to be by his side. Isn't that a great opportunity?" Zhu Xingzheng shed a few tears, wiping them as he said, "When we parted ways with your father, I cried for a long time. Little Gold, how could you misunderstand me like this!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer looked a bit ashamed and lowered its head, saying, "I'm sorry, I misunderstood you!"</p><p></p><p>The more it thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed. Being able to follow the powerful one was indeed a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Little Jin, you must follow this young lady well, be diligent, and the medicinal pills will surely come. You will definitely have the chance to become a super sixth-grade spiritual beast."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng heaved a sigh of relief, having pacified the golden-horned deer, and his heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>He had sold another spiritual beast, and this time he made even more profit! In his view, such precious medicinal pills would not be casually given to a mount - he was just deceiving the golden-horned deer.</p><p></p><p>"Young lady, I've entrusted Little Jin to you, and this is its control token!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng secretly rejoiced in his heart as he took out a green token from his storage bag, on which was imprinted a wisp of the golden-horned deer's spiritual aura.</p><p></p><p>This was the control token. If the golden-horned deer lost control, he could use this token to forcefully suppress its spiritual will and compel it to obey.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, to control a spiritual beast, one must either raise it from a young age and have the beast willingly recognize its master, or forcefully subdue it and forge a control token to dominate the beast.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng had taken the third path - relying on deception and trickery...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand and took the golden-horned deer's control token. With a glance, he immediately understood that the token was crudely made and did not have strong control over the spiritual beast.</p><p></p><p>However, the spiritual beasts in the Spirit Realm, due to their lack of cultivation methods, relied solely on their bloodline to grow. Once their wisp of spiritual will was captured in the control token, they would be subject to control and unable to break free.</p><p></p><p>For spiritual beasts below the sixth grade, who had not yet refined their spiritual will, their spiritual consciousness could be captured and contained within the control token.</p><p></p><p>This control token's ability to dominate spiritual beasts depended on the special material inside that could absorb the spiritual consciousness or spiritual will, not on the forging technique.</p><p></p><p>Such a control token would be utterly useless against the Scarlet Cat, but it could still exert a certain degree of restraint over the spiritual beasts of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>While Li Xuan was examining the spiritual beast's control token, Zhu Xingzheng continued to flatter Su Lingxiu and Yue'er, also training the golden-horned deer, claiming he was teaching it how to please its new master and earn the reward of medicinal pills...</p><p></p><p>Under Zhu Xingzheng's guidance, the golden-horned deer became more obsequious, looking around, lowering its head, and sticking out its tongue, displaying a fawning demeanor.</p><p></p><p>"Young ladies, I haven't asked for your esteemed names yet?" Zhu Xingzheng asked with a silly smile.</p><p></p><p>"Su Lingxiu."</p><p>"Yue'er."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was overjoyed. He took out a rein and put it on the golden-horned deer, then handed the rein to Su Lingxiu, saying joyfully, "So you are Miss Su and Miss Yue'er. I am Zhu Xingzheng, the upright and righteous Zhu Xingzheng."</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer was a bit dumbfounded, wondering why it had been put on a rein. It glared at Zhu Xingzheng, suspecting it had been deceived!</p><p></p><p>"Young ladies, where are you going? The Spirit Realm is not very peaceful these days, and Little Jin has a bit of a temper. Young ladies should be more tolerant."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng then took out a whip and handed it to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Next, he kicked the golden-horned deer's leg and said, "What are you standing there for? Quickly change to a larger body form, how can you carry people like this? Be smart, don't be foolish."</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer snorted, and Zhu Xingzheng slapped its head, angrily saying, "With this attitude, how can you get the medicinal pills? I'm doing this for your own good, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Under Zhu Xingzheng's coercion, the golden-horned deer no longer felt angry, thinking it made sense - if it didn't please the new master, how would it get the medicinal pills?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, thinking Zhu Xingzheng was quite skilled at deceiving spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but wonder, were all the spiritual beasts in Tian Ling State so gullible and easy to trick? If so, once the Scarlet Cat arrived, wouldn't it be able to deceive them all?</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Cat was no ordinary tiger, after all.</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer's body grew larger, and Li Xuan took out a chair and placed it on its back, finally having a mount. The journey ahead could now be taken at ease.</p><p></p><p>Stone Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu also heaved a sigh of relief, no longer needing to walk arduously and becoming a burden. They all climbed onto the golden-horned deer's back.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is so pleasant!" Zhu Xingzheng, who had not left, said respectfully and enthusiastically as he served tea and water to Li Xuan, addressing him as "senior" repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Xingzheng, you can continue with your own affairs. We no longer need you here!" Su Lingxiu said.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have anything else to do. Young lady, you don't know, the Spirit Realm is not very peaceful these days, and I can resolve many dangers. Moreover, Little Jin and I have a deep bond, and it's about to leave me, so I should at least see it off."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was thick-skinned.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu rolled her eyes, not wanting to bother with him.</p><p></p><p>The golden-horned deer took to the skies, heading towards Luo State, and Zhu Xingzheng joined the group, showing no intention of leaving.</p><p></p><p>Under the pretext of having a deep bond with the golden-horned deer and wanting to see it off, he had joined the group.</p><p></p><p>As for the task assigned to him by the Myriad Worlds Alliance, he had long since forgotten about it.</p><p></p><p>That small place called Yu State held no interest for him.</p><p></p><p>"Little fatty, you're a genius of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, aren't you?" Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Zhu Xingzheng nodded. "Senior, what sect of immortal cultivator are you from?"</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, since Su Lingxiu and Yue'er's strength did not seem too impressive, their master must be a Refining Spirit Celestial, with power no weaker than his own.</p><p></p><p>As for Stone Er and the others, their strength was even lower, appearing to be mere followers.</p><p></p><p>Little did he know that Su Lingxiu and Yue'er were concealing their true power, which was why he couldn't see through it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and did not answer, instead asking, "Among the geniuses in the Myriad Worlds Alliance, how many are there like you?"</p><p></p><p>"Not too many. After all, I, Zhu Xingzheng, have extraordinary talent. I can easily go to the great mountains of Tian Ling State and trick a spiritual beast to fight for me.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Spirit Governorate like to use spiritual beasts to assist themselves, thinking it's only natural. I, Zhu Xingzheng, also know this skill.</p><p></p><p>"As for the most powerful ones in the Myriad Worlds Alliance, there are only two. They've already reached the late Refining Spirit realm, their strength is terrifying, especially that cold-hearted little girl, she's so arrogant..."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng didn't know why, but he ended up spilling out all the information he knew about the geniuses in the Myriad Worlds Alliance, including how many there were and their cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>Among them, two individuals were the strongest, already reaching the late Refining Spirit realm before the age of thirty.</p><p></p><p>Those two claimed they would seize the top two spots on the Genius Ranking, and the competition for the first place could only be between them!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded frequently as he listened. The Myriad Worlds Alliance indeed had some capable geniuses.</p><p></p><p>As for the top two spots on the Genius Ranking, that was not something they could dream of. The first and second places would undoubtedly be occupied by Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>If Su Lingxiu also participated, the top four spots would all be taken by his own disciples.</p><p></p><p>By the time Li Xuan's group entered Luo State, Xu Yan had already gone to challenge Sword Pavilion's Yu Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

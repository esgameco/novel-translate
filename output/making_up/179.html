        <h1>Chapter 179</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In addition to the Yun Qi Dan, a batch of Qi Blood Dan was also refined, all of which were taken by Xu Junhe and Kou Ruozhi to cultivate the Great Wilderness warriors, as well as the warriors around Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>The legend of the Great Wilderness has gradually spread among the mountain villages and gradually spread throughout Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Later on, there even appeared some slogans about restoring the glory of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>This was the handiwork of the experienced rebel Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>"It's not far from breaking through a hundred warriors."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan secretly looked forward to what feedback he would get when he cultivated the martial arts he had created to break through a hundred. Now, the cultivation of the Great Wilderness martial arts has entered a stage of rapid development.</p><p></p><p>With sufficient supply of elixirs, as long as the talent is not too poor, the cultivation speed will be rapid.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu has broken through to the small success of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's strength has been further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>And for the Elixir Medical Martial Arts, Su Lingxiu has gained some new insights, and believes that it won't be long before an even higher level of Elixir Medical Martial Arts will emerge.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also has some comprehension of the Void Refining Elixir Art, and the only thing lacking is the strength to unleash it.</p><p></p><p>"The wind and rain are about to come!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed as he stood in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbao Pavilion has been replaced by a peak Sect Master warrior.</p><p></p><p>And he told Xu Junhe that the Tianbao Pavilion would take some time to get the spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>He also revealed that the Changqing Pavilion might have the idea of joining the Tianbao Pavilion and becoming a member of the Tianbao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>And some people have secretly contacted the elixir disciples, trying to win them over.</p><p></p><p>However, the elixir disciples are all loyal, and they immediately reported it to Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>Under Kou Ruozhi's ideological indoctrination, these elixir disciples all have the lofty ideal of reviving the Great Wilderness, and moreover, they are well-treated and never worry about the elixirs needed for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>How could they join other forces?</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe has started to slow down the expansion, and the elixirs have also begun to be limited in supply, with the excuse that there is a shortage of spiritual herbs and insufficient elixir refining, unable to meet the demand.</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion has not taken any further action, nor has it shown any signs of using force, which is somewhat unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu came back with a big bag on his back.</p><p></p><p>He is now very diligent, searching for spiritual herbs everywhere, and they are all of a higher grade.</p><p></p><p>"It would be great if there was a storage bag."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu put down the spiritual herbs and sighed.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why Xu Yan and Meng Chong were so envious of the storage bag. If there was a storage bag, he wouldn't have to carry a big bag.</p><p></p><p>It's too conspicuous.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Meng."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thanked him gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"It's not tiring at all, I'm the best at finding spiritual herbs as the spiritual herb scout."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>His strength has already improved a lot, breaking through to the Great Success Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu has also taught him the method of refining true qi, and he has already begun to refine his internal qi into Innate True Qi.</p><p></p><p>Once he succeeds in refining the Innate True Qi, his strength will be further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>The future is bright, and he is full of fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan looked up at a certain place.</p><p></p><p>"They're here."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu asked puzzledly, "Master, what's here?"</p><p></p><p>"The trouble from the Changqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Su Lingxiu and Meng Shushu looked up.</p><p></p><p>More than a dozen figures flew in from the sky, dressed in black Xuanyi robes, with long sabers hanging at their waists. The leader was a Great Sect Master! The group came to the sky above the Changqing Pavilion, swept their gaze, and then the leading Great Sect Master took out an imperial edict and opened it.</p><p></p><p>"The Changqing Pavilion accepts the edict, the Changqing Pavilion has created the Yun Qi Dan and glorified the martial arts of our Great Yue Kingdom, with outstanding achievements, and is specially rewarded by the Changqing Pavilion, appointed as the Elixir Department of the Great Yue Kingdom, the Marquis of the Changqing Pavilion, accept the edict."</p><p></p><p>The leading Great Sect Master finished the proclamation and looked down.</p><p></p><p>His aura surged, with an implicit warning.</p><p></p><p>Either accept the edict, go to the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom amicably, and gain an honorable position to serve the emperor of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Or resist, and they will become prisoners, entering the Great Yue Kingdom and becoming slaves!</p><p></p><p>"The Great Yue Kingdom has no right to interfere with our Changqing Pavilion, where did you come from, go back where you came from!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous, is the Changqing Pavilion going to rebel?" </p><p></p><p>The leading Great Sect Master roared angrily, his aura bursting forth.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was furious, grabbing an iron shovel, and the fine golden needles burst out, directly attacking.</p><p></p><p>Although she was only at the small success of the Innate Realm, and a Elixir Medical Martial Artist, not known for her combat prowess, the opponent was only an entry-level Great Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Lingxiu was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>It was a good opportunity to hone her combat experience.</p><p></p><p>With the master here, there was no need to worry about any danger.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The battle erupted, Su Lingxiu's Xun Wind Divine Needles were already hidden and swift, and the Great Sect Master was careless and underestimated her, instantly being pierced by the golden needles in his arm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, he only felt his arm go numb, and the muscles around the needle piercing were withering, as if losing their vitality.</p><p></p><p>He was horrified. This girl was not to be underestimated! In a moment of carelessness, his arm suffered a heavy blow, his combat power plummeted instantly, and the strange and treacherous golden needles made him cautious. After exchanging blows with Su Lingxiu for a while, he was unable to subdue her.</p><p></p><p>"Attack together!"</p><p></p><p>Those who followed him were the elite of the Tianyiwai, Sect Master warriors.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of Sect Master warriors instantly surrounded them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu held a pen-like treasure weapon and charged forward, angrily saying, "The Tianyiwai is so impressive, who are you trying to scare?"</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how strong he was, holding back two or three Sect Masters was about his limit.</p><p></p><p>Below, Zhou Ying became anxious.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sword light flashed across.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The majestic sword light directly killed a Sect Master warrior.</p><p></p><p>The Tianyiwai Great Sect Master fighting with Su Lingxiu suddenly changed color, and said in a deep voice, "Great Yue Kingdom Tianyiwai, do you want to interfere in the affairs of our Great Yue Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Kingdom was the strongest of the three major internal domain countries, and there were few forces in the entire internal domain that dared to offend the might of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, a cold voice came, "What is the Tianyiwai? Let the Great Yue Emperor come, what can he do?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianyiwai Great Sect Master's face changed, hastily retreating from the battle, looking gloomy as he looked over.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you, daring to interfere in the affairs of our Great Yue Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>"Jianxun Cliff, Hu Shan!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, Hu Hai just looked at the Tianyiwai Great Sect Master, and the other party was immediately terrified! A peak Great Sect Master, and moreover a powerful figure from the Jianxun Cliff! "The Changqing Pavilion is under the jurisdiction of our Great Yue Kingdom, the hand of the Jianxun Cliff..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, a sword light slashed over, instantly killing him.</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai sneered, "The Jianxun Cliff acts, how dare you, a running dog, speak up!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu swallowed hard, this was the power and tyranny of the Jianxun Cliff.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, do you want to kill them all?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan looked at the remaining Tianyiwai.</p><p></p><p>Before Su Lingxiu could answer, Hu Shan saw the corpse of the slain Tianyiwai Great Sect Master, as well as the other Sect Master warriors...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a flash, it was reduced to ashes and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Gu dong!</p><p></p><p>Was this the work of the senior? Hu Hai was covered in cold sweat, there was a great terror in this Qingqing Hall.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he seemed to have felt the true might of the heavens!</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu knew that her master had acted, and she immediately felt relieved. She looked at Hu Shan and said, "Why did you come?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan chuckled and said, "I came to buy some elixirs. Young Master Xu has already made the arrangements, representing Sword Saint Cliff."</p><p></p><p>He then introduced, "This is my father, Hu Hai!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Cliff, Grand Master Hu Hai! Greetings to Grand Master Hu Hai!"</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su is too polite!" Hu Hai hurriedly cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>This time, Hu Shan came representing Sword Saint Cliff to purchase elixirs, and Su Ling Xiu naturally agreed.</p><p></p><p>The stored elixirs were all sold to Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan and his son did not linger for long, but they also revealed that Sword Saint Cliff would help block some troubles for Qingqing Hall, but they could not stop everything.</p><p></p><p>There were too many forces in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>And this time, by killing the Heavenly Garment Guard, the imperial family of the Great Yue Kingdom would certainly not let it go easily. Tieshan County was ultimately part of the Great Yue Kingdom, so they had the justification to act.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Cliff going to war with the Great Yue Kingdom, Xie Lingfeng could not decide on his own.</p><p></p><p>And the Sword Master Xie Tiangheng was in seclusion and had not come out, so he could only resist part of the threat from the Great Yue Kingdom, but could not stop it all.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was not surprised by this, Xie Lingfeng's support was already enough.</p><p></p><p>Qingqing Hall was in the midst of a turbulent situation, Xu Yan and Meng Chong should also come back to take charge, it couldn't be that the master had to act for every matter, right?</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan and his son left.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi angrily said, "Rebellion, we must rebel, and drag down that old emperor of the Great Yue Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu glanced at him and said, "Is Qingqing Hall suitable for rebellion?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi paused, then suddenly had a thought and said, "I'll go to the Great Wilderness and discuss with Emperor Qi and Emperor Wu, those two emperors should also know how to rebel, right? In the future, there will be no more Great Yue Kingdom, only my Great Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>Rebellion was his specialty, but his strength was too weak, no matter how good he was at rebelling, he could not succeed.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu couldn't be bothered with him, she didn't care about these matters.</p><p></p><p>Back in the small courtyard, she apologetically massaged her master's shoulders, "Master, I've caused you trouble."</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing." Li Xuan sipped his spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>A mere Sect Master-level martial artist, with just a thought, he could control the spiritual energy of heaven and earth and turn it into an attack, crushing it in an instant without any effort.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're the best." Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted her hand and said, "Your troubles, I'm afraid, are about to come."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>She had just acted, exposing herself, and the Black Robe faction's forces would likely soon know that she was in Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>Qingqing Hall was something she had founded.</p><p></p><p>"With Master here, how could your disciple have any troubles?" Su Ling Xiu smiled coquettishly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had successfully recruited several martial arts scholars, who agreed to come to Qingqing Hall as guest officials, and at the same time research the martial arts, while he had reached a simple agreement with the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>He would hold the honorary title of Grand Martial Arts Scholar at the Seven Star Academy, but he did not have to follow any of the Seven Star Academy's rules, it was just a nominal title.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that the Seven Star Academy was taking advantage of him, and in the future, as his strength increased, the reputation of the Seven Star Academy would also rise, and he didn't want to be taken advantage of in this way.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was speechless, you've already taken away several of my martial arts scholars, and you still feel you're being taken advantage of just by letting you hold a title?</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Seven Star Academy agreed to pay Xu Yan an annual stipend of 300,000 spiritual crystals as a hiring fee, and the agreement was formally reached.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts scholars could leave with Xu Yan, but the rules of the Seven Star Academy would not change, they would not get involved in the disputes of the martial arts world, nor would they send powerful experts to assist Xu Yan in confronting other forces.</p><p></p><p>Unless Xu Yan truly became a member of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Since he became a member of the Seven Star Academy, he must abide by the principles of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Although the Seven Star Academy would not take action, the martial arts scholars who followed Xu Yan had their own things to protect, and in order to protect their own things, they would take action, but it would not violate the principles of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had no objections to this.</p><p></p><p>He never intended to have the Seven Star Academy provide support, he just came to recruit some martial arts scholars.</p><p></p><p>These single-minded people, in order to protect the beliefs in their hearts, would certainly be willing to risk their lives, as long as they came to Qingqing Hall, experienced true martial arts, and experienced elixirs.</p><p></p><p>They would certainly become obsessed and never want to leave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that among the martial arts scholars, the deeper the dark circles under their eyes, the purer they were, indicating that from a young age, they had focused all their thoughts on researching martial arts, neglecting even their rest, causing them to develop dark circles.</p><p></p><p>Even after becoming Sect Masters or Grand Sect Masters, these dark circles would not disappear.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Supervisor Fang once said that the Seven Star Academy has some things I want to know, I wonder if it is as I guessed?" Xu Yan asked Bai Yunkong.</p><p></p><p>If the guess was correct, the thing Fang Yuntian mentioned that he wanted to know was likely the Black Robe faction.</p><p></p><p>"The Black Robe faction comes from the Hidden Palace, one of the most mysterious of the three major dark forces in the inner domain, with perhaps not less than ten peak Grand Sect Masters." Bai Yunkong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Peak Grand Sect Masters, although rare in the martial arts world, in the vast inner domain with countless forces, the number of peak Grand Sect Masters is actually not small.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Palace's Pavilion Master is mysterious and powerful, even a peak Grand Sect Master would feel a chill at the thought, and even I do not have the confidence to defeat him."</p><p></p><p>The inner domain was vast, with numerous forces, and the top major forces had double-digit numbers of peak Grand Sect Masters, after all, cultivation resources were abundant, the martial arts techniques were powerful, and the lineages were long-lasting.</p><p></p><p>Even if a peak Grand Sect Master only appeared once every few decades, the accumulated number over the long years would not be small.</p><p></p><p>The outside world rarely saw the presence of a peak Grand Sect Master, because at that level, there were not many things that could attract their attention. They were mostly focused on cultivating their own perfection and exploring the martial arts path beyond Grand Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not surprised by this, it was natural that the inner domain's martial arts world would have accumulated many peak Grand Sect Masters, but what surprised him was that the strength of the faction the Black Robe faction belonged to, the Hidden Palace, was unexpectedly strong.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Palace's Pavilion Master was actually so powerful? </p><p></p><p>Even Bai Yunkong, the Sect Master of the Seven Star Academy, did not have the confidence to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>He felt that Bai Yunkong's strength was even greater than what he could perceive.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Hidden Palace located?" Xu Yan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Although the Hidden Palace's Pavilion Master was very strong, at his current stage, he might not be able to defeat him, but after breaking through to the Profound Enlightenment Realm, he would be able to slay the other party.</p><p></p><p>At that time, he could directly go and destroy the other party's stronghold.</p><p></p><p>He would definitely be able to get a real big fortune, right?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know." Bai Yunkong shook his head. "The three mysterious dark forces, not even our Seven Star Academy, perhaps not even the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, knows where they are located."</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Palace has always been very mysterious, even if you encountered them face to face, if they were not wearing the signature black robes, no one would think they were from the Hidden Palace.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

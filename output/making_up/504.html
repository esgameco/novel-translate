        <h1>Chapter 504</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Every realm is the foundation for the next realm, so when creating a realm, one must first determine the general ideas and direction of the next realm in order to connect them and make the entire cultivation path smooth.</p><p></p><p>After all, it's no longer the early days when one could just make things up carelessly. Having transcended heaven and earth, one is now truly a powerful expert, a true master of martial arts. So the creation of each subsequent realm and cultivation method must be well-reasoned and justified.</p><p></p><p>They must conform to cultivation principles and connect properly between realms. Only in this way can one successfully comprehend and cultivate them. </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if one gets stuck at a certain realm unable to comprehend or continue cultivating, wouldn't that block one's martial path? Therefore, Li Xuan put a great deal of effort into creating the cultivation beyond the Establishing the Dao realm, ensuring the realms connected while maintaining consistently powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond Establishing the Dao is Creation!"</p><p></p><p>The Creation Realm! A faint halo of the Dao Ancestor flickered around Li Xuan as he gazed deeply and said, "Create heaven and earth to understand all living things, to perceive the Great Dao, to connect with the Great Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled. Beyond Establishing the Dao was Creation - what did Creation mean?</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the mountains, rivers, plants, insects and birds below, he seemed to gain some vague understanding of what Creation was in that moment.</p><p></p><p>But he still didn't understand how to create heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued speaking: "Creation is generating all things from nothingness, creating all things to know heaven and earth, to give birth to wisdom...</p><p></p><p>"Everything in the world originates from creation, and creation originates from the vast and profound Great Dao. Only by creating one's own heaven and earth, creating one's own Dao, can one resonate with the Great Dao and understand its meaning..."</p><p></p><p>Beyond Establishing the Dao was Creation.</p><p></p><p>After establishing one's own Dao and the Dao of heaven and earth, the next step was Creation.</p><p></p><p>Creating heaven and earth, creating oneself, to understand all living things and perceive the vast and profound Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>This was the future cultivation path Li Xuan had determined after repeated contemplation. It connected well with the Establishing the Dao realm while maintaining mysteriousness and power.</p><p></p><p>To create this Creation realm, Li Xuan had put in no small amount of thought. Even with the assistance of the Golden Book of the Great Dao, it still wracked his brains to fully develop this realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Li Xuan had a feeling that the Creation realm was an extremely profound realm that could align with the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>After all, wasn't the feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao also a kind of creation?</p><p></p><p>As for the realms beyond the Creation realm, Li Xuan also had some concepts and was in the process of refining them.</p><p></p><p>"The Creation realm, ah! Once I enter the Creation realm, I'll be able to destroy powerful experts like Tai Cang with a wave of my hand. The Immutable Temple will no longer be a threat, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought excitedly. </p><p></p><p>The Creation realm was an extremely profound realm with the ability to create all things from nothingness.</p><p></p><p>The seven of Tai Cang used a mysterious purple light to create heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But if he broke through to the Creation realm, he would be able to create a heaven and earth in the immutable lands without relying on any treasures.</p><p></p><p>How could Tai Cang match such powerful strength?</p><p></p><p>Even that person from the Immutable Temple couldn't match it. So after breaking through to the Creation realm, Li Xuan felt he would truly have enough confidence.</p><p></p><p>"With the power of creation, I'll be a Dao Ancestor worthy of the name!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Creation realm was a profound realm with extremely abstruse cultivation methods that relied entirely on self-enlightenment. However, Li Xuan had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the theory and cultivation methods of the Creation realm once, Li Xuan let Xu Yan continue contemplating silently.</p><p></p><p>When explaining the Creation realm, Li Xuan's Dao Ancestor halo glowed with light, enveloping Xu Yan to enhance the power of transmitting the Dao and increase the listener's comprehension.</p><p></p><p>This was another wonderful use of the Dao Ancestor halo besides showing off.</p><p></p><p>"The mysteries of Creation cannot be memorized in a short time. Disciple, you must remember them well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the Creation realm once again.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, he asked Xu Yan if there was anything he didn't understand and explained those points in detail.</p><p></p><p>Even for a genius like Xu Yan, Li Xuan had to explain the Creation realm several times before he could fully memorize it.</p><p></p><p>As for when he would be able to understand the mysteries of Creation, Li Xuan couldn't predict.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, you must remember the key points of the Creation realm. Understanding these key points means understanding the mysteries of Creation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this disciple will not disappoint you and will certainly comprehend the key points of Creation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, listen carefully then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held a jade ruyi scepter behind his back and looked up slightly at the sky, his Dao Ancestor halo glowing, fully displaying the demeanor of a Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao generates one qi from nothingness, from one qi produces yin and yang; yin and yang combine to give birth to all things, a single thought can sustain heaven and earth... These are the key points of Creation, contemplate them well."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Li Xuan's form disappeared from the spot and returned to the courtyard, sitting leisurely in a chair.</p><p></p><p>"The Creation realm, ah, I've finally passed it on to Xu Yan. I hope he comprehends it soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Without realizing it, he had gone from making up techniques carelessly to becoming a true Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"I should find time to guide Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping as well. Being a master isn't so easy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help sighing again.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his disciples' cultivation, he as their master had really put in a lot of effort.</p><p></p><p>"But it's all worth it."</p><p></p><p>In high spirits, Li Xuan guided the cultivation of Shi Er, Meng Shushu and the others, and also guided the cultivation of his maid Cai Ling'er.</p><p></p><p>Since awakening her Sea Spirit Clan royal bloodline, obtaining the Sea Spirit Clan royal legacy, and under Li Xuan's guidance, Cai Ling'er's cultivation speed had become faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>Now she was already at the Heaven Unity realm.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a Realm Lord shouldn't be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made this judgment.</p><p></p><p>As for strength beyond the Realm Lord level, it would depend on Cai Ling'er's own fortune.</p><p></p><p>However, staying by the side of a Dao Ancestor like himself, breaking through the bottleneck of the Realm Lord realm was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it would just take a longer time.</p><p></p><p>Surpassing the Sea Spirit Clan royalty was also not a problem.</p><p></p><p>"This girl has really grasped a great opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Opportunities all lie in a single thought, and Cai Ling'er had grasped the opportunity by choosing to stay by his side as a maid.</p><p></p><p>This was the greatest opportunity of her life.</p><p></p><p>"That fellow Feng Yan also knows how to grasp opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled to himself.</p><p></p><p>He liked these kinds of clever people who could see the path ahead clearly and knew how to seize opportunities.</p><p></p><p>"But has Blood Extreme, that half-crippled minor realm lord, also grasped his opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a strange expression.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme had become completely submissive, very cooperative with Su Lingxiu's research, seemingly determined to be Su Lingxiu's research subject. He even willingly endured excruciating soul pain to please Su Lingxiu, allowing her to observe the changes in his soul under extreme agony...</p><p></p><p>"What a ruthless person!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. For such a ruthless person to not grasp an opportunity seemed unreasonable.</p><p></p><p>Being able to stay by Su Lingxiu's side was also a kind of opportunity.</p><p></p><p>After all, Su Lingxiu would surely surpass Tai Cang in the future.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Indeed, he is after all the disciple of this Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged in the clouds, carefully contemplating the techniques of the Creation realm. The more he pondered, the more he marveled at the profound mysteries of the Creation realm.</p><p></p><p>"Creating heaven and earth, to resonate with the great Dao... Creation is truly too difficult." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but sigh. Understanding the Creation realm was not something that could be achieved overnight.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Domain is the core region of heaven and earth, as well as the place of origin. I should go to the Dao Domain to take a look and contemplate the origins of the Cang Heaven and Earth, and how all living things came into being."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already formed an idea.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Domain, before the great war of heaven and earth, before heaven and earth were divided into several regions, belonged to the place of origin.</p><p></p><p>The core of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"It's perfect to prepare to go to the Dao Domain. It will be easier to comprehend the Creation realm there. Moreover, with the great changes in heaven and earth now, I may gain some insights during this process."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned from the clouds, preparing to head to the Dao Domain.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a message came through the communication talisman, from the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>"A Divine Venerable is pressuring the Sea Spirit Clan, wanting to seize their treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. This was a distress message from the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>He had taken some of the Sea Spirit Clan's treasures, and among them was an item coveted by this Divine Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Now, the other party had come to the Sea Spirit Clan for this treasure.</p><p></p><p>When the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan mentioned this before, Xu Yan didn't care, so he took the treasure away.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan was asking for help, Xu Yan naturally couldn't stand idly by.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had made a promise to the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan back then.</p><p></p><p>"Perfect, I've broken through to the Heaven and Earth realm. I'll go test the might of that Divine Venerable. The Divine Venerables coming from the Dao Domain are not lacking those who are coming for me. It's a good chance to meet them."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He sent a message back to the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan, telling him to remain calm and to stall that Divine Venerable, saying he would be there soon.</p><p></p><p>In the Blue Sea Realm, inside the palace of the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>A beautiful woman with a cold and proud expression looked at the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan and others with murderous intent in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, your Sea Spirit Clan clearly hasn't taken my words to heart, daring to give away the treasure?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan and others wore expressions of terror.</p><p></p><p>Although they had broken through to the Heaven Unity realm, they had no power of resistance at all when facing a Divine Venerable realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>If the other party became angry, it would be easy for them to annihilate the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan, weakened to this extent, no longer had any Divine Venerable realm powerhouses and was completely unable to resist the person before them.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sea Spirit Clan once belonged to the True Dragon lineage, they had long since lost contact with the True Dragon Clan. There was little connection between them now, so they couldn't use the deterrence of the True Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, the Sea Spirit Clan has always been safeguarding the treasure. But Xu Yan, Young Master Xu, resolved the crisis in the Blue Sea Realm. To thank him, our Sea Spirit Clan promised to let him choose any treasure. Young Master Xu took a liking to that treasure, so he took it away.</p><p></p><p>"This old one did remind Young Master Xu, but he said he would handle the matter, so..."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said fearfully.</p><p></p><p>After receiving Xu Yan's reply, the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan tried his best to stall the other party, avoiding their anger that might lead to the annihilation of the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he could only try his best to delay, waiting for Xu Yan to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Xu Yan? That dragon-subduing youth?"</p><p></p><p>The cold and proud woman raised an eyebrow and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan hurriedly replied.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, does he really think he's invincible just because he subdued a young dragon? Daring to intercept my treasure, how can I let him off lightly? Tell Xu Yan to come see me, otherwise he will not only offend the True Dragon Clan but also offend my Cloud Luo Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The cold and proud woman said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency, we have already notified Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said respectfully with his head lowered.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, at least your Sea Spirit Clan knows what's good for you!"</p><p></p><p>The cold and proud woman's expression relaxed slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan inwardly breathed a sigh of relief. He had finally managed to stall the other party and could wait for Xu Yan to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Blue Sea Realm, deep under the sea.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle slightly raised its head, its eyes somewhat helpless, "Even Divine Venerables have come, Supreme Beings must not be far behind, right? Maybe even Small World Lords? I can't be exposed, even if it's an acquaintance, it could easily lead to ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"When will Xu Yan be able to bring the Dao Rhyme of Heaven and Earth to help me recover?"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle felt a bit anxious inside. Its strength had not yet recovered, and great changes had occurred in the Cang Heaven and Earth. Crisis could descend at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Before Xu Yan finds the Dao Rhyme of Heaven and Earth, I'd better play dead as much as possible."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle was extremely helpless, sinking into silence once again, without sound or movement, even its life force undetectable.</p><p></p><p>On Cloud Sky Island, Xie Lingfeng emerged from his closed-door cultivation. He was not far from breaking through to the Void-breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>"Father, we should return to the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's time to return to the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng nodded.</p><p></p><p>With the Divine Realm in turmoil and great changes in heaven and earth, the Blue Sea Realm was no longer safe.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Sky Island was no longer suitable for bitter cultivation, so it was time to return to the Qinghua Realm, see old acquaintances, and incidentally ask for guidance from seniors.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that a Divine Venerable has descended upon the Sea Spirit Clan, coming for certain treasures. The Sea Spirit Clan is facing the danger of annihilation."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu should be coming to the Blue Sea Realm soon, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng raised an eyebrow and said upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Facing such a crisis, the Sea Spirit Clan would surely seek help from Xu Yan. Xie Lingfeng knew of Xu Yan's promise to the Sea Spirit Clan back then.</p><p></p><p>On the sea surface above the Sea Spirit Palace, Xu Yan's figure appeared, looking towards the Sea Spirit Clan's territory at the bottom of the sea. In an instant, he locked onto that Divine Venerable cultivator.</p><p></p><p>With a movement of his body, he entered the sea. The seawater automatically parted, revealing a waterless path.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked step by step towards the Sea Spirit Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Young in age, yet quite arrogant."</p><p></p><p>Inside the Sea Spirit Palace, the cold and proud woman looked outside and smiled coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Xu Yan had finally come, and since Xu Yan dared to come, it meant he was no longer afraid of Divine Venerable cultivators.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but be greatly shocked. In such a short time, Xu Yan's strength had greatly increased again, to the point where he wasn't afraid of Divine Venerable cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped into the hall of the Sea Spirit Palace, his gaze sweeping over the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan and others. They didn't seem to have suffered torture or serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>"The treasures of the Sea Spirit Clan, I, Xu Yan, have taken them. You've come too late."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the cold and proud woman, Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"The dragon-subduing youth Xu Yan? Don't think that just because you subdued a young dragon, you can disregard Divine Venerables?"</p><p></p><p>The cold and proud woman's cool gaze examined Xu Yan. She raised a delicate white hand, a cold intent emerging, and a powerful aura suddenly surged forth. The might of a Divine Venerable was fully revealed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Crack! Crack!</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Palace made sounds of being unable to withstand the pressure, about to collapse in the next moment, and the powerful Divine Venerable might was also about to sweep across in all directions.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

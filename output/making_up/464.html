        <h1>Chapter 464</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So what do you suggest we do now? Should we go kneel before Jiang Buping, admit our mistakes and beg for mercy?" </p><p></p><p>Cloud Smoke's demeanor had become somewhat manic.</p><p></p><p>"If it wasn't for your instigation back then, how would I have ever harmed Jiang Buping? As a result, you were worried that the clan elders would blame you for being too ruthless towards your own clan members, hindering your path to becoming the clan leader. So you didn't directly kill Jiang Buping. Now look what's happened - he's coming to kill us both!"</p><p></p><p>Cloud Smoke shouted with reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's breathing became heavy, his eyes revealing a chilling light. But after a long while, he took a deep breath and said: "This divine realm doesn't only have Jiang Buping as such a powerful figure. The Immortal realm is not the end either. There will always be a way. Just stay calm and wait for my news.</p><p></p><p>"That bastard Jiang Buping, if he wants to kill me, he's still too green!"</p><p></p><p>In the Taikun realm, a figure walked slowly through the wilderness. </p><p></p><p>The sky had started to darken, and the silent wilderness was pitch black. Walking in the desolate and quiet wilderness gave a sense of oppression, with feelings of fear and tension constantly arising from deep within one's heart.</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness, there was a pile of stones, like a lonely grave.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming stood still in front of the stone pile, took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and his eyes revealed a hint of resolute and vicious intent.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward and moved aside a large stone from the pile. The mottled boulder, weathered by the years, still retained a mysterious aura.</p><p></p><p>One stone after another was moved aside, finally revealing an opening.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming stepped into the opening, reaching back to block the entrance with a stone. He walked forward in the darkness, and after just a few steps, arrived at a slightly more spacious area.</p><p></p><p>This was already the center of the stone pile. A chilly aura permeated the air - even as an Immortal realm martial artist, he felt a slight chill.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you've finally come."</p><p></p><p>In the darkness, a faint brownish-red light appeared. It was a flickering flame that emerged from the ground, gradually taking human form.</p><p></p><p>"I can't accept this. I want to kill him. Whatever conditions you have, I'll agree to them all. I only have one request - I want to kill him!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming growled.</p><p></p><p>"You've encountered an enemy? And one that even your Jiang family can't help you deal with? Very good, very good indeed!"</p><p></p><p>The brownish-red figure nodded and smiled.</p><p></p><p>"You can help me, right?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's eyes were full of hope.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how strong he is?"</p><p></p><p>"For you to lose composure like this, and for the Jiang family to not intervene - could it be someone at the Heaven Union realm?"</p><p></p><p>The brownish-red flame person guessed.</p><p></p><p>"He should still be at the Immortal realm, but his strength is too great, too terrifying. He kills Immortal realm experts as easily as killing chickens."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming had somewhat lost his composure.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?" </p><p></p><p>The brownish-red figure showed slight surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming took a deep breath and recounted Jiang Buping's battle achievements in detail, including the matter of killing divine souls.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, very interesting!"</p><p></p><p>The brownish-red figure listened and revealed a look of astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Can you help me?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming asked hopefully.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I can!"</p><p></p><p>"But, you seem to be just a remnant soul, and that bastard Jiang Buping is most skilled at killing divine souls..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming suddenly said with some lack of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, there are differences between divine souls too. No matter how strong his divine soul techniques are, they still rely on his own soul power to be used, so there's ultimately a limit. A mere Immortal realm cultivator, no matter how strong his divine soul, is not enough to threaten me.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, how could I be as simple as just a divine soul?"</p><p></p><p>The brownish-red figure smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"That's good then!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever conditions you have, just say them directly. I'll definitely agree!"</p><p></p><p>The brownish-red figure smiled and said: "First, you need to release a part of my power. Do as follows...</p><p></p><p>"The subsequent conditions naturally involve your Jiang family, but that's for after you become powerful. For now, gather these things for me..."</p><p></p><p>Then, the brownish-red figure gave Jiang Tianming a list.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll gather the items and bring them tomorrow!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming looked at the list and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Very well."</p><p></p><p>The brownish-red figure nodded.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming turned to leave. He had to prepare everything as quickly as possible - Jiang Buping would arrive in the Taikun realm soon.</p><p></p><p>After Jiang Tianming left, the brownish-red figure's eyes revealed an excited look. He muttered softly: "Taikun, you never expected I'd still be alive, did you?</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Feng, you little brat, let your descendant provide assistance for my revival. We'll settle our score slowly!"</p><p></p><p>The next day, in the pitch-black night again, Jiang Tianming returned.</p><p></p><p>"I've prepared all the items!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming took out a storage bag and said.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. Put all the items into the large cauldron..."</p><p></p><p>Under the brownish-red figure's instructions, Jiang Tianming complied one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Enter the cauldron. I will infuse my power into your body and emerge through you."</p><p></p><p>When Jiang Tianming heard this, he hesitated for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't occupy your physical body. I can swear an oath!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the brownish-red figure immediately swore an oath.</p><p></p><p>"By borrowing my body, you can really help me kill that bastard Jiang Buping?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Of course. I can elevate your strength to the Heaven Union realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible. The upper limit of the divine realm is the Immortal realm..."</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you understand too little about this world. Your strength is too weak. Besides, you're not breaking through on your own, but borrowing my power. Limits and such naturally can't constrain you."</p><p></p><p>After some bargaining, Jiang Tianming took a deep breath and stepped into the large cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, you forced me to this. You must die!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming said with a vicious look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! More brownish-red flames surged up from underground, enveloping the cauldron and beginning to seep into Jiang Tianming's body.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Veins bulged on Jiang Tianming's forehead, blood-red vessels popped out all over his body, and a faint brownish-red light permeated him. His expression was ferocious and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, bear with it. It will hurt a bit at first, but once I'm fully inside, you'll experience the joy of being powerful!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what should I call you?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, at this point, there's no harm in telling you. You wouldn't have heard of my name anyway. I am Blood Extreme!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme! Jiang Tianming couldn't help but think of the Blood Children of the Netherworld. He asked in a deep voice: "Senior, are you a powerful figure from the Netherworld?"</p><p></p><p>"Kekeke, you could say that!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme gave a sinister laugh.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming felt as if his body was about to explode. His whole body felt painfully swollen, yet filled with a sense of wild power.</p><p></p><p>At some point, his divine soul shook, and his consciousness became somewhat hazy. He didn't know how long had passed when he suddenly discovered that in his sea of consciousness, next to his divine soul, another figure had appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was a man in a brown robe, with a gloomy countenance, but his eyes held a bloodthirsty light, as if thirsting for blood.</p><p></p><p>All over his body, traces of blood energy could be faintly seen flowing.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Blood Extreme?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's divine soul moved aside slightly, saying in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Kekeke, kid, it's me!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme smiled brightly. He had finally emerged.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't been active for a long time. Kid, lend me your body to play with for a few days."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Despite Jiang Tianming's opposition, in an instant, he found that he had lost control of his physical body. Only his sensory awareness remained normal. The movement of his body was no longer under his control, which made him feel uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Tianming felt like he had boarded a pirate ship.</p><p></p><p>"It's all because of that bastard Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming blamed everything on Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can kill that bastard, everything is worth it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming thought frantically.</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out of the pile of stones, out of the wilderness, and back into the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Tianming, Jiang Buping is about to arrive at the Taikun Realm. We should flee quickly, escape while we still can!" </p><p></p><p>Yun Yan'er anxiously greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Flee?"</p><p></p><p>"Hehehe, cough cough, no need to flee. That mere bastard Jiang Buping is nothing to fear. Today's me is no longer the me of the past!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming reached out and grabbed, and in Yun Yan'er's shocked gaze, with a ripping sound, her clothes were torn off.</p><p></p><p>Then, she was picked up and thrown into a room.</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's soul roared.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, I'm just borrowing your body for a bit. What are you so nervous about? This is your body, you can feel it too. Let me teach you youngsters some tricks..."</p><p></p><p>"You... you... you..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming's soul was so angry he was dumbfounded. He raged: "We had an agreement, you promised to meet my conditions..."</p><p></p><p>"You young people, why so nervous? I told you this is your body. I'm just tagging along to experience it. The one truly enjoying it is still you!"</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Jiang Tianming's soul turned green.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, Yun Yan'er nestled in Jiang Tianming's arms. She was a bit confused, not understanding how in such a short time, Tianming had learned so many new tricks...</p><p></p><p>In the Taikun Realm, powerful experts gathered in the great city where the realm gate was located, waiting for Jiang Buping's arrival.</p><p></p><p>The story of an abandoned son seeking revenge and justice made people's blood boil with excitement. Moreover, the name "Spear Demon" had already resounded throughout the Divine Realm - who didn't know of it?</p><p></p><p>The details of Jiang Buping's past experiences had also spread. Born of a concubine in a great clan, neglected, then cultivated by the family due to his exceptional talent, only to be ambushed and crippled, then banished. Now he was returning with overwhelming power. What a grand drama!</p><p></p><p>Throughout the Divine Realm, any Immortal Realm expert who could travel came rushing to the Taikun Realm, all waiting for the great battle, waiting to see the Jiang clan crushed.</p><p></p><p>The intentions of these experts were obvious - the Jiang clan had a long heritage, perhaps this time they could take advantage and plunder some treasures.</p><p></p><p>"How lively!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan exclaimed as he came out of the realm gate.</p><p></p><p>He was already at the Immortal Realm now.</p><p></p><p>Even Wu Tiannan himself felt a bit dazed, feeling that his cultivation had been too smooth, and his luck exceptionally good, continuously obtaining treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Senior?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Wu Tiannan saw the unkempt old man he had met before.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's you!" </p><p></p><p>The old man glanced at Wu Tiannan, his eyes lighting up slightly, but also looking a bit puzzled. This kid's luck was truly strange to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"It's me. Senior, are you also here to watch the excitement?"</p><p></p><p>"I suppose so."</p><p></p><p>As the two were chatting, the clamorous noise in the great city suddenly fell silent, then erupted into even more heated discussion.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>"It's the Divine God Meng Chong, he actually came too!"</p><p></p><p>"What do you think, is Jiang Buping stronger, or is Meng Chong superior?"</p><p></p><p>"Hard to say, they're both monstrous talents."</p><p></p><p>"I think Jiang Buping is stronger. That soul-killing attack is too hard to defend against."</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily true. The title of Divine God isn't given lightly."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong came?</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was startled. He looked in the direction of the voices and indeed saw Meng Chong's figure, striding towards the outskirts of the great city.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly halted his steps, turned his head to look at Wu Tiannan, and nodded slightly in greeting.</p><p></p><p>To unexpectedly meet an acquaintance in the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan has actually reached the Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was a bit surprised. Wu Tiannan's cultivation speed seemed too fast.</p><p></p><p>Among the Spirit Realm experts who came with Wu Tiannan, not a single one had broken through to the Immortal Realm. Many hadn't even entered the Tempering Reality Realm.</p><p></p><p>In one fell swoop, Wu Tiannan had left them far behind.</p><p></p><p>"Young Wu, you know him?" </p><p></p><p>The old man asked with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Yes." </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That big fellow has quite a reputation. An extraordinary young man indeed."</p><p></p><p>The old man sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Naturally!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"This Divine Realm is getting more and more interesting."</p><p></p><p>The old man said with a smile, then waved goodbye to Wu Tiannan and left.</p><p></p><p>The great city suddenly fell silent again. Jiang Buping entered the Taikun Realm, his expression cold, but his eyes held some reminiscence and complexity.</p><p></p><p>Without stopping, he left the great city directly, striding towards the Jiang clan. Today he came to demand an explanation and kill some people. Whoever stood in his way would be killed!</p><p></p><p>Boom! As Jiang Buping continued walking towards the Jiang clan's ancestral grounds, his aura grew stronger and stronger, not concealed at all.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts who had come to the Taikun Realm were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Jiang clan's ancestral grounds, a crowd of Jiang clan experts all appeared. Everyone's gaze turned to the clan leader, Jiang Buping's father.</p><p></p><p>That aura, sharp and prominent, shot straight to the sky. Even separated by a vast distance, they could still feel that overwhelmingly powerful presence that made their souls tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang! Tian! Ming!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's deep voice came, each word distinct.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Jiang Tianming?" </p><p></p><p>The great clan elder asked sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't know!"</p><p></p><p>The other clan elders all shook their heads.</p><p></p><p>"He didn't run away, did he?"</p><p></p><p>One clan elder asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice came from far away: "Jiang Buping, you bastard, you dare think of killing me? I'm waiting for you here!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was startled.</p><p></p><p>"Why is Jiang Tianming's power so strong? He seems to have surpassed the Immortal Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Jiang clan used some hidden trump card to let him temporarily break through his limits?"</p><p></p><p>The great clan elder and others were all shocked. Even the Jiang clan leader looked uncertain.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping paused his steps, raised his head to look in Jiang Tianming's direction, killing intent fierce in his eyes. With the Soul Extreme Divine Weapon in hand, he took one step and arrived where Jiang Tianming was.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say who will emerge victorious this time!"</p><p></p><p>"Unexpected, to think Jiang Tianming was such a monstrous talent?"</p><p></p><p>"What method did he use to break through the limits in the Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of experts rushed over, watching from afar the two figures whose auras clashed in the sky. The great battle was about to begin! The fight that all eyes were on was about to start.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood in midair, his eyes rotating like great suns as he looked at Jiang Tianming. He couldn't help but frown slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant soul of a Netherworld expert? If it were some other method it would be fine, but a mere remnant soul, even if it's the remnant of a powerful expert, is destined to be annihilated under my fifth junior brother's Soul Extreme martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked towards the Jiang clan experts, ready to make a move at any time to block all the Jiang clan experts outside.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 499</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Someone from the Jiang family?"</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the first thought was of the Jiang family.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping immediately denied it, saying there were no more enemies from the Jiang family, and no one left to seek revenge for Jiang Tianming.</p><p></p><p>"A powerful figure from the Netherworld Prison? The same one as Jiang Tianming's - could all the attacks against me be orchestrated by that person behind the scenes?"</p><p></p><p>"When did I incur such a great enmity with the Netherworld Prison, for them to target me like this?"</p><p></p><p>A flash of light gleamed in Jiang Buping's eyes, and his brows furrowed. Within the young man's soul was hidden a remnant soul, and this remnant soul was the same as Jiang Tianming's.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming had targeted him, and his final reliance was on the owner of this remnant soul. Now, this person filled with hatred, acting as if they had an irreconcilable feud with him, also had a remnant soul hidden in their spirit.</p><p></p><p>This made Jiang Buping think - could it be coincidence both times? How could there be such coincidences in the world?</p><p></p><p>Both happened to target him, and those targeting him all had the other's remnant soul within them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Jiang Buping's expression turned cold, his eyes flashing with anger. Today he would drag out this person and demand to know why they were targeting him so.</p><p></p><p>What grudge did they have against him! Blood Extreme was unaware of Jiang Buping's thoughts at this moment. Otherwise, he would certainly cry out in injustice - this was not his targeting at all, but merely the person targeting him happened to encounter Jiang Buping, just a coincidence.</p><p></p><p>He, Blood Extreme, was merely going along with the situation, seeking a chance for recovery!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, the young man had drawn a blood-red, translucent long saber. Blood energy soared to the sky, turning the world crimson. Where the long saber shone, the image of a blood prison hell appeared between heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>The young man flickered in and out of visibility within the blood prison, his form appearing fierce and evil. A murderous aura surged in all directions, emitting hissing sounds.</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Venerable realm experts were all shocked at this moment, retreating one after another.</p><p></p><p>Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Especially those Immortal Venerable realm experts who had been standing with the young man earlier - their faces were now covered in cold sweat, unable to help feeling afraid.</p><p></p><p>To think such a vicious person had been standing right beside them - it was truly dangerous.</p><p></p><p>And some Immortal Venerable realm experts, thinking of those other Immortal Venerable realm experts who had suddenly disappeared along the way, looked again at that terrifying image of the blood prison hell. Their faces turned pale, feeling a sense of having narrowly escaped disaster.</p><p></p><p>The blood prison energy stirred up the winds and clouds of heaven and earth, as if turning this entire area into part of the blood prison. Within the blood prison stood a demon wielding a saber.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you? What great enmity do you have with me, Jiang Buping?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression was cold as the Extreme Soul Divine Spear appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Although the young man's strength was formidable, Jiang Buping's power was no longer comparable to when he was at the Tai Kun realm.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping seemed to be questioning the young man, but was actually asking Blood Extreme. However, Blood Extreme did not know this, thinking that by having the young man unleash the blood prison hell and the Netherworld Prison's blood energy, he could completely conceal himself.</p><p></p><p>He thought he would not be discovered by Jiang Buping like last time.</p><p></p><p>But Blood Extreme did not know that Jiang Buping had already discovered his presence.</p><p></p><p>"It's that remnant soul from last time," Meng Chong said with some surprise.</p><p></p><p>In the battle at the Tai Kun realm, the remnant soul had been completely destroyed. But today they encountered this remnant soul again - the two were of the same origin, remnant souls of the same powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the remnant soul destroyed back then was only a part of it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, even this remnant soul may not be all that remained of this person.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's thoughts were similar to Jiang Buping's. He also suspected this remnant soul was controlling everything behind the scenes, targeting Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>However, like Jiang Buping, he was also puzzled. This remnant soul seemed to be left behind by some supreme expert - there should not be any enmity with Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"A remnant soul from the Netherworld Prison, and even stronger than the Blood King!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment. "Could it be the remnant soul of a Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>A Blood Lord of the Netherworld Prison was a Realm Lord level expert. Was there a Blood Lord's remnant soul existing within the Tai Cang world? Had it barely survived the great battle back then, clinging to life?</p><p></p><p>"A Blood Lord's remnant soul?" Su Lingxiu's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>The remnant soul of a Realm Lord level expert - if it could be captured, it would be worth studying carefully. Perhaps they could understand what was special about the souls of Realm Lord level experts, how they were superior to the souls of martial artists below the Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was the remnant soul of an expert from another world, which made it even more worth studying. Su Lingxiu became even more interested.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, how strong is this remnant soul? Can it be captured?" Su Lingxiu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment before saying, "That depends on Fifth Junior Brother. If Fifth Junior Brother doesn't hold back, with his current strength, he should be able to completely annihilate that soul."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, if it really is a Blood Lord's remnant soul, it likely possesses some unusual secret techniques. Destroying it might be possible, but capturing it would be somewhat difficult."</p><p></p><p>A Netherworld Prison Blood Lord was a Realm Lord level expert. Experts at this level were all extremely decisive and had extraordinary methods. Destroying them was relatively easy, but trying to capture them would be more difficult.</p><p></p><p>After all, how could such experts be willing to fall into the hands of those they saw as weaker, suffering humiliation? They would certainly choose to self-destruct in critical moments.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if they had other remnant souls surviving elsewhere, they would be even more decisive and quick to self-destruct this part of the remnant soul, rather than let it fall into others' hands.</p><p></p><p>"As long as there's a chance to capture it, that's fine!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes shone brightly as she took out some instruments, preparing for the upcoming attempt to capture the Blood Lord's remnant soul. Of course, capturing the remnant soul would require Jiang Buping's assistance.</p><p></p><p>When it came to understanding souls and techniques for dealing with souls, Jiang Buping was naturally the foremost expert.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the Extreme Soul martial way, and Jiang Buping himself was a kind of ultimate soul body, not a flesh and blood body.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Junior Brother, prepare the formations and restrictions to capture this remnant soul, and prevent it from self-destructing," Su Lingxiu said, looking at Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Sister. I can deploy soul-binding formations at any time. However, since it's a Blood Lord after all, it may have some methods to temporarily break free from the bindings," Fang Hao said, a small disc appearing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother, remember to lend a hand," Su Lingxiu said, looking at Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then," Meng Chong said, rubbing his head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "Blood Lords are all old foxes and will certainly be on guard. However, it's ultimately just a remnant soul and has to face Fifth Junior Brother. The chances of successfully capturing it are still quite high."</p><p></p><p>With a thought, silently, this area had already undergone some changes. The surroundings had actually been sealed off by an invisible sword intent.</p><p></p><p>However, this sword intent had no sharpness at all. It had completely merged with the world, fused into the spiritual energy, integrated into every blade of grass and tree. Under the turbulence of the blood prison hell, no one could detect it.</p><p></p><p>Even Blood Extreme's remnant soul was the same. After all, it was just a remnant soul residing in the young man's body. How could it detect anything unusual?</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, don't destroy the remnant soul. I want to capture it for study."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu transmitted a message to Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping nodded. He also wanted to know why the other party was targeting him like this, and what grudge they had against him.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, my hatred for you is as deep as the sea. We cannot coexist under the same sky. Do you dare to fight me?" </p><p></p><p>The young man roared with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Why wouldn't I dare? If you're seeking death, I, Jiang Buping, will grant your wish!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression remained calm as he stepped forward, holding the Extreme Soul Divine Spear.</p><p></p><p>"But I'm very curious, what exactly is the grudge between us? How did we come to have such an irreconcilable feud?"</p><p></p><p>The young man gripped a bright crimson long blade, his aura becoming increasingly violent. A bloody scent began to spread, and gradually, rolling waves of blood appeared around him.</p><p></p><p>He seemed to be standing amidst turbulent waves of blood, with a blood hell above his head. The surrounding world appeared to have become part of this blood hell.</p><p></p><p>"Do you remember Yun Yan'er?" </p><p></p><p>The young man's expression was ferocious, filled with pain and hatred.</p><p></p><p>"Yun Yan'er?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping raised an eyebrow. "You can't be here for her, can you? I'm curious, that woman Yun Yan'er was involved with Jiang Tianming. I never heard of her having any other men, nor did I hear of her admiring anyone else."</p><p></p><p>"It's all your fault!" </p><p></p><p>The young man's face became distorted and frenzied. "Yan'er was originally with me, but then your Jiang family wanted an arranged marriage, and she became your fiancée. Then Jiang Tianming interfered, causing Yan'er to drift away from me!" If it weren't for you, Jiang Buping, Yan'er would have eventually seen me differently under my attentive care and discovered my good qualities.</p><p></p><p>"You killed Jiang Tianming, which is one thing, but Yan'er was kind and so beautiful. How could you bear to kill her? If you hadn't killed her, under my care, she would have come to know my good qualities..."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was slightly stunned. Looking at the young man's frenzied expression and irrational state, he couldn't help but sigh inwardly, "Is this what Master called a 'simp'? The most extreme kind?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others also had expressions of surprise. So this was a madman.</p><p></p><p>That remnant soul was using this madman, helping him enhance his strength, and targeting Jiang Buping through this madman's hand. The remnant soul thought it could deceive everyone, hiding behind the scenes to manipulate.</p><p></p><p>Little did it know, its existence had already been seen through.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme furrowed his brow at this moment, not knowing why, but he vaguely had a feeling that something was terribly wrong, as if some crisis was waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>"No one should have discovered me. I've already activated the Blood Hell Demon Abyss, which should be enough to conceal my presence. So why do I have this sense of crisis?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme didn't dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>He was the Blood Lord, a formidable figure in the Blood Demon Path who had been through life-and-death battles. His sense for danger was extremely keen. This sudden sense of crisis must have its reasons.</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Extreme couldn't figure out what the source of this crisis was, and moreover, this crisis felt somewhat different from the life-and-death dangers he had faced before.</p><p></p><p>"Better to be cautious!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's expression was solemn. At the same time, he cursed inwardly, wondering why he had chosen such an idiot.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, die!"</p><p></p><p>The young man charged forward with his blade. Waves of blood surged, the Blood Hell Demon Abyss engulfed everything, and the world turned a bloody red. The crimson long blade emitted an evil aura.</p><p></p><p>This evil aura seemed capable of corroding the soul, polluting soul power. It could both attack the soul and resist or confuse soul secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, it's targeting me!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's eyes turned cold, emitting a chilling light.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming didn't possess such secret techniques and was easily killed under his Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The opponent had learned from the previous lesson, mistakenly believing that he practiced powerful soul secret techniques. Therefore, they had taught this person methods to counter soul secret techniques, intending to use this to restrain him.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, you've guessed wrong. What I practice isn't soul secret techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping raised the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon in his hand. In an instant, an extreme sharpness emerged, and a pressure of Extreme Soul suddenly descended! Even the Immortal Heavenly Venerable experts far away suddenly seemed to see a divine spear radiating sharpness!</p><p></p><p>What terrified them was that this divine spear wasn't seen with their eyes, but perceived by their souls, and their souls felt an extreme pressure.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that if they touched the divine spear, their souls would be annihilated!</p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heavenly Venerable experts retreated in shock.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this, what kind of soul secret technique could be so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The long spear radiated starlight, piercing through the rolling blood waves, penetrating the Blood Hell Demon Abyss, tearing open a sharp gap in the blood-red world.</p><p></p><p>The spear light was so sharp it seemed unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! I'll lend you soul power to resist this spear. He can only make this one strike. If you can withstand it, you'll have the chance to counterattack and kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's expression changed drastically. At this moment, he somewhat understood that what Jiang Buping was using didn't seem to be a simple soul secret technique!</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be a kind of martial way that even he had never heard of!</p><p></p><p>At this point, Blood Extreme knew he had to flee decisively. If he delayed even a moment, he would surely die! After all, he was in a remnant soul state. Facing this kind of martial way that seemed to specialize in killing souls, he was extremely vulnerable and in danger. Even though he was once the Blood Lord, and his remnant soul was far beyond ordinary martial artists, he still couldn't withstand it!</p><p></p><p>The young man also sensed the crisis at this moment, but his eyes became even more frenzied, showing no sign of retreat. As soon as Blood Extreme spoke, he immediately agreed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a powerful soul force filled his consciousness. He felt powerful and no longer had an intense sense of crisis towards this spear light.</p><p></p><p>"Burn!"</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a blood-colored flame erupted from Blood Extreme's soul. An overwhelming blood-colored light appeared, and the Blood Hell Demon Abyss condensed in this instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The young man felt as if all the blood in his body was boiling and burning, as if his physical body was melting, yet he felt a sense of power.</p><p></p><p>"We must burn blood and part of the soul to extremely enhance strength. This is your chance to kill Jiang Buping and get your revenge!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could get revenge, the young man didn't care at all, so without any resistance, his soul began to burn under Blood Extreme's secret technique.</p><p></p><p>There was no pain, only exhilaration and excitement, as if he was about to achieve his great revenge!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, the crimson long blade became thin, emitting an increasingly evil and powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"It's time!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme suddenly activated a secret method. The young man's body melted and fused with the crimson long blade. The burning soul seemed to become the source of power driving this attack!</p><p></p><p>Swish! The thin blood-colored blade seemed to tear through space. Amidst the converging blood waves and a chorus of vengeful, shrill screams, it slashed towards Jiang Buping, towards that piercing spear light.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

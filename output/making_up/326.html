        <h1>Chapter 326</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Small Star Lake was in an uproar. A supreme expert from the Great Zhou Imperial House had actually been killed by the Qingqing Pavilion, and the Great Zhou Imperial House's genius, the Purple Prince, had narrowly escaped with his life and fled in a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>The news spread, and all the major forces of Great Zhou were shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was a direct provocation of the Great Zhou Imperial House. The Qingqing Pavilion really had a lot of guts. Did they really have such confidence that they could withstand the retaliation of the Great Zhou Imperial House? The warriors who had originally planned to visit the Qingqing Pavilion, or even come to seek medical treatment, were suddenly too scared to go there anymore. They were all just observing the subsequent developments.</p><p></p><p>But neither Su Lingxiu, Xu Yan, nor Meng Chong cared about these upheavals at all. A supreme expert who had refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth was just another dead person. It's not like they hadn't killed supreme experts before.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun said with some concern, "The Great Zhou Imperial House is very powerful. Won't there be trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Of course, although she was a bit worried, she didn't feel that there was any real danger, but just that there might be some trouble.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter. He attacked first, and now he can't even fight back?" Su Lingxiu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. If the Great Zhou Imperial House is not satisfied, I'll go and block the gate of the Imperial Palace and fight until they submit," Xu Yan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was stunned, suddenly remembering that Xu Yan was the fierce man who had blockaded the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall a few years ago.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Pavilion was very lively. Xu Yan recounted his experiences in the Great River State and how he had slain the Chief Saber Elder of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Cold Absolute Saber from the Thousand Martial Hall and another divine artifact, and handed them to Meng Chong, saying, "Junior brother, take a look at whether this saber suits you."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong weighed it in his hand and said, "Although this saber looks good, I'm more comfortable with the one forged by my senior brother. But I can still use it. I'm thinking of creating a saber formation with it."</p><p></p><p>After witnessing his senior brother's sword formation, Meng Chong was also inspired and began to ponder over saber formations.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Pavilion was bustling with activity.</p><p></p><p>But on the Thousand Martial Hall mountain, the Thousand Martial Hall Master and the other elders had extremely grave expressions. Xu Yan came from the Inner Domain? And Meng Chong was also from the Inner Domain?</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, did Xu Yan and Meng Chong have connections to the Blood Demon? The calamity of the Blood Demon was a thorn in the heart of the Spiritual Sect. It had risen and fallen three times, as if it could not be killed. If the Blood Demon was indeed rising again, it would certainly be more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>They had learned to conceal their true selves and plan their moves carefully. They had actually cultivated such monstrous disciples.</p><p></p><p>"The Transcendent Spiritual Sect should gather together as well. Notify the Thundercloud Mountain Manor, the Imperial Spirit Palace, the Taimai Sect, and the Zhou Family of the Great Zhou, to discuss this major matter," the Thousand Martial Hall Master said with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The Chief Saber Elder had been out of contact for some time, and the Thousand Martial Hall Master was a bit uneasy. Had something happened to him? Was he killed by Xu Yan, or by the person behind Xu Yan? If the Chief Saber Elder had indeed perished, the Thousand Martial Hall Master was inclined to believe the latter. Xu Yan could not possibly have the strength to kill the Chief Saber Elder in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Spiritual Domain, high up in the clouds.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master had brought someone with him - the Manor Master of the Thundercloud Mountain Manor, the Palace Master of the Imperial Spirit Palace, the Sect Master of the Taimai Sect, and the Purple Prince from the Great Zhou Imperial House.</p><p></p><p>"You have summoned us here. For what purpose?" the Thundercloud Mountain Manor Master asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"As for the matter of the genius clash, it will proceed according to the rules. My Taimai Sect will not support any violation of the protocols," the Taimai Sect Master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"That is not the reason." The Thousand Martial Hall Master spoke in a deep voice, "I suspect the Blood Demon has returned!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone present changed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Is this true?" the Purple Prince asked with a startled look.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon could not possibly have returned. My senior uncle had killed it back then!" the Taimai Sect Master said coldly, glaring at the Thousand Martial Hall Master. "Do you have any evidence?"</p><p></p><p>"This person came from the Inner Domain during the last opening of the Spiritual Domain Gate. The current information is that Xu Yan comes from the Inner Domain, Meng Chong comes from the Inner Domain, and the Qingqing Pavilion also comes from the Inner Domain. They are fellow disciples!" The Thousand Martial Hall Master brought up the Purple Prince.</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Palace Master and the Purple Prince looked at the Purple Prince, asking sternly, "Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>The Purple Prince's face turned deathly pale, his heart trembling. Now that it had come to this, how could he still hide it?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan indeed comes from the Inner Domain, and Meng Chong also comes from the Inner Domain. They were geniuses in the Inner Domain, unrivaled geniuses. They are my teacher, mysterious and powerful experts."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master spoke in a deep voice, "The lower realms of the Inner Domain, you and I should both know, apart from the Blood Demon who retreated into the Inner Domain in the past, where could there be such powerful experts?</p><p></p><p>"The person behind Xu Yan must be the Blood Demon from the past!"</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Palace Master and the Purple Prince nodded, their expressions extremely grave. Apart from the Blood Demon, when had the Inner Domain ever produced such powerful experts?</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, the Blood Demon is already dead. My senior uncle personally buried it. Xu Yan and Meng Chong come from the Inner Domain, and my senior uncle has investigated this matter, they are definitely not the Blood Demon," the Taimai Sect Master shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The Thundercloud Mountain Manor Master spoke with a solemn expression, "My Thundercloud Mountain Manor has had some dealings with the Qingqing Pavilion. I have seen that person before.</p><p></p><p>"I agree with the Taimai Sect Master, he is not the Blood Demon, but... the Celestial Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, the Thundercloud Mountain Manor Master's voice became low, "The origins of the Celestial Venerable and his purpose are not something we can fathom. My Thundercloud Mountain Manor will not participate in this matter."</p><p></p><p>The Imperial Spirit Palace Master and the others changed expression, exclaiming in shock, "Is this true?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm 90% certain!" the Thundercloud Mountain Manor Master said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Not the Blood Demon?" The Thousand Martial Hall Master looked utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge is about to open. If it is truly the Celestial Venerable, you all should be more cautious. The wrath of the Celestial Venerable is something you cannot withstand," the Taimai Sect Master turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon is already dead, there is no doubt about that. As for the matter of the Celestial Venerable, caution is paramount," the Purple Prince pondered for a moment and then also turned and left.</p><p></p><p>If it was truly the Celestial Venerable, able to disregard certain rules and linger in the Inner Domain and Spiritual Domain, the power and identity of this Celestial Venerable were not simple.</p><p></p><p>"Let's leave this matter here," the Imperial Spirit Palace Master also turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master's expression was gloomy and unsatisfied. He grabbed the Purple Prince and threw him down on the way back. Then, with a dark expression, he returned to the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>But halfway, he suddenly turned back and, in the terrified gaze of the Purple Prince, completely annihilated him, leaving no trace of his remains. After killing the person, the Thousand Martial Hall Master returned to the sect.</p><p></p><p>The group of elders gathered around him.</p><p></p><p>"It has nothing to do with the Blood Demon, but..." The Thousand Martial Hall Master shared the speculation about the Celestial Venerable, and all the elders were secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Master, if it is truly the Celestial Venerable, what is he doing in the Inner Domain? And Xu Yan comes from the Inner Domain, is there any connection between him and the people there? We..."</p><p></p><p>One of the elders spoke in a sinister tone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that's exactly what I'm thinking." The Thousand Martial Hall Master nodded. "This matter must be kept secret. Act in secret. You two go and open the gate to the Spiritual Domain, and enter the Inner Domain."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" The two elders nodded.</p><p></p><p>"How should we deal with Tang Jinyan?"</p><p></p><p>The Chief Saber Elder asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Kill him," said an elder.</p><p></p><p>"Keep him, he may still be of some use," the Qianwu Hall Master said after a moment of contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He then instructed the two elders sent to the inner domain, "Remember, you are not going there to kill, but to seize his weakness. As long as we have his weakness in our hands, the more monstrous and powerful he becomes, the better!"</p><p></p><p>The two elders smiled and said, "The Hall Master's words are absolutely right!"</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Hall Master had someone bring Tang Jinyan and his servant. As soon as they entered the hall, the Hall Master waved his hand, and Tang Jinyan's maid was instantly blasted to oblivion, leaving no trace of her body. Tang Jinyan's face turned deathly pale, filled with fear, and he fell to his knees with a thud.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I won't kill you," the Qianwu Hall Master said calmly. "This matter must not be revealed to anyone, or you and the Xingxing Palace will be reduced to ashes!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Tang Jinyan frantically nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, the Xingxing Palace is under the Qianwu Hall, you can go back now and wait for my orders," the Hall Master waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, great lord of the upper sect!" Tang Jinyan was overjoyed. With the Qianwu Hall as their backer, who would dare offend the Xingxing Palace? As for the matter of the Changqing Pavilion and Suli, he didn't dare ask, as it was clearly related to the secrets of the Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial capital of the Great Zhou, after the Purple King reported the matter to the Great Zhou Emperor, he had just returned to the royal residence when he learned that Xiang Mingmao had narrowly escaped being killed, and the guard had been directly killed.</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao had fled back in a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>"Father, they are challenging my Great Zhou royal house, challenging my Purple King lineage. Use our Great Zhou experts to annihilate them!" Xiang Mingmao said with bloodshot eyes and resentment.</p><p></p><p>"Who?" the Purple King asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Changqing Pavilion!" Xiang Mingmao gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, the Changqing Pavilion, huh? You really think..." The Purple King was about to get angry, but suddenly he paused and asked in a deep voice, "The Changqing Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Father!" Xiang Mingmao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Purple King fell silent. The Changqing Pavilion seemed to have the backing of a Celestial Master. This was no longer something he could decide.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the Changqing Pavilion can only be decided by His Majesty, not by our Purple King lineage. You must not act rashly, or it will bring trouble to our Purple King lineage," the Purple King said sternly, staring at Xiang Mingmao.</p><p></p><p>"Father, could it be..." Xiang Mingmao was shocked. The depth of the Changqing Pavilion was so great? Could he have gotten himself into trouble?</p><p></p><p>"No need to say more. I will report this to His Majesty. How to deal with this matter will depend on His Majesty's decision, or even..." The Purple King stared at his son and said in a deep voice, "Or even whether an apology is needed, is still unknown!"</p><p></p><p>Xiang Mingmao's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>After the Purple King instructed him not to leave the Purple King Residence, he went to the imperial palace to report the matter to the Great Zhou Emperor.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Zhou royal house's retaliation did not come.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that the Great Zhou royal house was completely unaware that a powerful expert had fallen at the hands of the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Even the Purple King Residence remained quiet.</p><p></p><p>This made many Great Zhou forces and warriors sense something unusual.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion's background was not simple, even the Great Zhou royal house would not retaliate over a minor conflict.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, the miraculous medicinal arts, how could they not attract attention? How could the Lingzong Sect not be envious? This Changqing Pavilion is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, not to mention the other supreme Lingzong Sects, even the shameless Qianwu Hall should have made a move long ago, yet the Changqing Pavilion remains unperturbed, they must have formidable backing."</p><p></p><p>"The Changqing Pavilion possesses a divine artifact, which of the great Lingzong Sects has such an incredible divine artifact?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou warriors discussed animatedly. Some factions and warriors who had been observing now set out to the Changqing Pavilion to seek treatment or purchase medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion naturally became bustling again.</p><p></p><p>After a few days of catching up, Li Xuan took the opportunity to guide Xu Yan a little further, refining the cultivation method for breaking through the Void Realm in more detail. He also mentioned the Dao Principles, which were related to the next stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He even personally refined some spirit paper, engraving several Dao Principle diagrams on it, and gave it to Xu Yan to contemplate, laying the foundation for him to comprehend the Dao Principles in advance.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Principles were profoundly mysterious, and even just engraving a few diagrams required special spirit paper that could withstand the power.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only half a step away from reaching the Divine Origin Realm, and I should prepare to accumulate a foundation and break through to the Divine Dao Realm. I plan to go to the Qinghai Sea City, where I can pass on the cultivation method to Xie Lingfeng."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shared his next goal.</p><p></p><p>"There are rumors of divine treasures in the Qinghai Sea, and if I can obtain them, it will greatly simplify the accumulation of my foundation. I will return before the battle among the geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan knew that Xu Yan would not stay for long after returning. Having cultivated in the Spiritual Realm for several years, his martial dao had progressed rapidly, and his insights had also deepened. How could Xu Yan just sit idle and cultivate in one place? Although there were still several states in the Spiritual Realm he had not set foot in, he had decided to go to the Qinghai Sea, first to find Xie Lingfeng and pass on the cultivation method beyond the Divine Meaning Realm, and second, to seek the divine treasures of the Qinghai Sea to lay the foundation for his breakthrough to the Divine Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You can ask Caili about the Qinghai Sea, as she is from there and has a high status in the Sea Spirit Tribe."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Caili's knowledge would come in handy now.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand." Xu Yan couldn't wait to go to the Qinghai Sea and immediately went to ask Caili about the Qinghai Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghai Sea is vast, with countless islands. Currently, it is jointly ruled by the Qinghai Sea City and my Sea Spirit Tribe. There are many spiritual treasures in the Qinghai Sea, and there are also rumors of divine treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The most famous divine treasure is the Qinghai Sea Pearl. It is the hair ornament of the Qinghai Sea City Lord, and it is said to have some divine abilities that can nourish and strengthen the divine soul, enhancing one's martial dao insights.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I have never obtained it, so I'm not sure if it's truly as described."</p><p></p><p>Caili spoke in detail about the situation in the Qinghai Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghai Sea Abyss is a perilous place, and it is said that divine treasures are all produced there. I have seen it from afar, and it is truly too dangerous. My Sea Spirit Tribe can even control the water, but we still don't dare to venture in recklessly.</p><p></p><p>"I can't say for sure if there are divine treasures in other places, but the Abyss has a 90% chance of containing them.</p><p></p><p>"However, I advise you not to go near it. That is a true dead zone, even my Sea Spirit Tribe and the Qinghai Sea races don't dare to take the risk of entering..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, remembering the Qinghai Sea Abyss, which was likely to contain divine treasures. As for the dangers Caili mentioned, Xu Yan naturally would not rashly enter, as his methods were different from ordinary Spiritual Realm cultivators. He could send his divine incarnation to explore without risking his true body. Even if he encountered danger, it would only cost him a portion of his divine energy, a trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 112 The Second Sword Intent</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched as Physician Pan broke through the Blood Qi Realm and became a martial artist. Although his foundation was only of Copper Bone, his strength seemed weak to Xu Yan, but in the Borderland, he was incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The pinnacle masters of the jianghu could extinguish one with a snap of their fingers.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun was also in the midst of a breakthrough. With the aid of medicinal pills, he had already completed the refinement of his viscera and was about to enter the door of martial dao in just a day or two.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Qi Pill, just an ordinary medicinal pill, has such a miraculous effect. If it were a spiritual pill, how powerful would the effect be?"</p><p></p><p>"My grandfather is getting old, and his cultivation of the martial dao is slow. Moreover, my uncle and the others do not have good natural talents."</p><p></p><p>"As for my mother, even with the aid of medicinal pills, it will still take some time for her to enter the door. And the pills have already been consumed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan marveled at the effects of the medicinal pills and decided to take all the precious medicines at home to have his shijie refine them. He knew that refining pills consumed a lot of medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>Especially for new pills, they could not be successfully refined in a single attempt. </p><p></p><p>Failing once would mean wasting an entire furnace of materials.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual medicines, I lack spiritual medicines. When I go to the Inner Realm, the first goal will be to buy spiritual medicines. Only spiritual medicines are the true materials for refining pills."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, his determination to go to the Inner Realm growing stronger once again.</p><p></p><p>Now, Physician Pan had already entered the martial dao, and his father was about to break through as well. </p><p></p><p>The other elite guards at home also had decent talents and were about to enter the door as well. After returning, he would have his shijie refine a batch of pills to quickly assist their breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>The safety of the family had already been secured.</p><p></p><p>"When father breaks through, I'll go back and ask my shijie if she has any anti-aging pills or pills that can more gently and easily help mother break through the realm..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of his mother. </p><p></p><p>He did not expect his mother to fight and brawl, as long as she had a certain level of strength. The most important thing was that cultivation could prolong her lifespan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had surveyed the Endless Mountains and saw many groups of people entering the mountains to seek out immortals, but he did not discover any martial artists.</p><p></p><p>However, as he delved deeper into the Endless Mountains, closer to the Inner Realm area, he did discover fierce beasts like the Crimson-Eyed Tiger and the Fire-Maned Wolf.</p><p></p><p>"Were the Crimson-Eyed Tiger and Fire-Maned Wolf in the Evil Massacre Forest originally from the Endless Mountains? That Crimson-Eyed Tiger was a bit weak, not a pure breed?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've come this far, I can't return empty-handed."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Xuan descended.</p><p></p><p>By the stream, a spotted giant tiger was crouching, its massive body not much smaller than an ox.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be the Crimson-Eyed Tiger King from the vicinity?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself, this tiger was truly gigantic.</p><p></p><p>The Endless Mountains near the Inner Realm had a faint presence of heavenly and earthly spiritual energy, which allowed fierce beasts to exist there, and their strengths were not weak.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson-Eyed Tiger felt a weight on its back and realized someone had sat on it!</p><p></p><p>It roared in great anger and was about to flip over, but its neck was suddenly grasped, and the entire tiger was lifted into the air, as if a large cat had been picked up.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson-Eyed Tiger was terrified, curling up its tail and hind legs, letting out low growls, not daring to struggle or move, afraid of falling.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, this big cat is quite intelligent. Could it be that I randomly picked one of the smarter ones?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled in surprise.</p><p></p><p>He carried the Crimson-Eyed Tiger back to Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>Keeping a big cat as a pet wouldn't be bad. He didn't know if he could tame it, but if he could, he would keep it as a pet. If not, he could just cook and eat it.</p><p></p><p>The blood, flesh, bones, and even the tiger's penis could all be used for refining pills.</p><p></p><p>Back at the manor, Li Xuan put down the Crimson-Eyed Tiger, expecting it to roar in anger, but it simply rolled over on the ground, exposing its belly in surrender.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, this big cat is quite sensible."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was amused.</p><p></p><p>"Master, are you going to take its blood, flesh, and bones to refine pills?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu came running over, excited.</p><p></p><p>"Let's keep it for now. If I can't tame it, then I'll slaughter it for refining."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted the tiger's head.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Two, you're in charge of feeding it. If it doesn't obey, then slaughter it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two looked excited and said, "My lord, I've learned beast taming before. I'll try to tame it."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and try."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was a bit surprised. Stone Two knew beast taming?</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that Stone Two's beast taming skills were just some common martial arts techniques, nothing extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, if any failed pills are produced during pill refining, you can feed them to it, so as not to waste them. Whether it will be beneficial is up to the tiger itself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two heard this and hurriedly said, "My lord, I can eat the failed pills too."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said impatiently, "Not all failed pills are harmless to humans. If you eat them and end up with problems, don't come complaining to me."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Stone Two immediately shrank his neck, sheepishly saying, "Then I'll just let the tiger eat them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down in the chair, looking at the Crimson-Eyed Tiger rolling around and acting cute, and after a moment of contemplation, he said, "From now on, I'll call you Red Cat."</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat let out a low growl.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was amused, this old tiger seemed to have quite good intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two found a thick chain and put it around the Red Cat's neck, also bringing a whip for taming.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu used the Water Spirit Grass to refine a batch of pills, but two of them were failed pills, which she tossed to the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>After eating the failed pills, the Red Cat's eyes became bright and shiny, constantly rolling around and exposing its belly to Su Ling Xiu, clearly showing that the pills had a good effect on it.</p><p></p><p>After refining the pills, Su Ling Xiu began to help Zhou Ying with her martial dao cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's martial dao foundation was almost fixed, and the transition would take time. Without the aid of medicinal pills, the transition would be even more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, her realm was not too high. After consuming the pills and accumulating Qi and Blood, she finally managed to sense the Qi and Blood, entering the Refining Skin stage.</p><p></p><p>With her original martial dao strength and the aid of the pills, the Refining Skin process was very fast, and she successfully completed the transition.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu let out a sigh of relief and began to focus on her own cultivation and research into the Dao of Alchemy.</p><p></p><p>That day, Xu Yan returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan learned that Xu Yan's father had already broken through the Blood Qi Realm and entered the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because there are too few cultivators, and their realms are too low, while my realm is too high, so I'm not getting any feedback?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>After paying his respects to the master, Xu Yan handed over the medicinal materials he had brought back to Su Ling Xiu, as well as matters related to the pills.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie, do you have any anti-aging pills? I want to give them to my mother."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"Anti-aging pills?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu pondered, various spiritual herbs appearing in her mind, and she gradually assembled an immature pill formula.</p><p></p><p>"There should be some, but anti-aging pills require spiritual herbs as ingredients, and I only have Water Spirit Grass on hand, which is not suitable for refining anti-aging pills."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed. "Shidi, just give me the list of spiritual herbs, and when I go to the inner realm, I will definitely gather all of these spiritual herbs."</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, do you have spiritual herbs?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It was Second Shixiong who brought them back," Suling Xiu said solemnly, telling Xu Yan everything about Meng Chong's incident.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Demonic Sect again, this is outrageous!" Xu Yan exclaimed angrily. He secretly decided that when he went to the inner realm, he would settle the score with the Demonic Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi has comprehended the Dao of the Blade? That's great, I'll go find him!" Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's eyes lit up. Her eldest shixiong had comprehended the Dao of the Sword, and her second shixiong had comprehended the Dao of the Blade - they were about to have a friendly exchange.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly followed Xu Yan to the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Shi Er also took Chihu and went to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow, but he didn't go to watch, as he already knew the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Dao of the Blade was tyrannical and domineering, with the momentum to sever the heavens and extinguish the earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Dao of the Sword of the Rivers and Mountains seemed gentle and unassuming, but it secretly contained a ruthless and merciless killing intent. It could topple mountains and rivers, and extinguish all life.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you've comprehended the Dao of the Blade? Come, let's have a friendly exchange," Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Meng Chong also had an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu and Shi Er stood far away, watching the two on the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Chihu lay on the ground, his eyes darting around, seemingly wanting to find an opportunity to escape.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a tyrannical aura surged up, the Dao of the Blade rippling, filling the heavens and earth with a solemn killing intent, as if it could annihilate everything.</p><p></p><p>Chihu trembled in fear, his eyes filled with terror. It was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"Such a terrifying Dao of the Blade, is this the Dao of the Blade?" Shi Er was shocked and admiring.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu clenched her fists, watching the two shixiong on the hillside. This was the Dao of the Blade of her second shixiong, but how about the Dao of the Sword of her eldest shixiong?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a vast and endless Dao of the Sword surged forth, as if it encompassed all the rivers, mountains, and all living beings. Even the tyrannical Dao of the Blade was enveloped within it.</p><p></p><p>There was a thunderous roar as the Dao of the Blade and the Dao of the Sword clashed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was solemn. His tyrannical Dao of the Blade kept surging forth, as if it wanted to sever the mountains and rivers, but the vast and endless Dao of the Sword remained unshaken.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was inwardly shocked. "Shidi's Dao of the Blade is so domineering!"</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, I'm about to strike!" Meng Chong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A dazzling blade light erupted, tyrannical and unmatched, seemingly about to rend the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, a vast sword light surged forth, like the flowing of rivers and mountains. In an instant, the mountains and rivers collapsed, and all life was extinguished - ruthless and merciless!</p><p></p><p>The Dao of the Blade dissipated, leaving only the endless Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong's Dao of the Sword of the Rivers and Mountains is superior to mine," Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>His Dao of the Blade was already tyrannical and domineering, but he never expected that his shixiong's Dao of the Sword could actually suppress it so easily.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, your Dao of the Blade is already unparalleled in the world, and even my Dao of the Sword of the Rivers and Mountains would have a hard time withstanding it.</p><p></p><p>"Today's exchange has given me new insights and understandings regarding the Dao of the Sword," Xu Yan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered, also gaining some insights from the exchange, but he was still inferior to his shixiong.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Sect Master accepted Shixiong as a disciple first before continuing to accept other disciples. Shixiong's martial dao has already surpassed the ancient prodigies," Meng Chong sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The exchange of the Dao of the Sword and the Dao of the Blade allowed Xu Yan and Meng Chong to both gain insights and harvests.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu returned to the manor and continued to ponder and comprehend the Dao of Medicine and Martial Arts, also gaining some harvests.</p><p></p><p>Only Shi Er was completely dumbfounded, feeling that it was too powerful and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He felt ashamed, no wonder he could only be a servant, his talent was too far behind.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Zhou Ying who was diligently cultivating, he heaved a sigh of relief, at least there was someone to keep him company, making him feel better.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat on the hillside, immersed in his comprehension, with strands of sword intent swirling around him. At times, the sword intent seemed to want to advance to the next level, but then it would suddenly stagnate.</p><p></p><p>"My realm is not high enough, I cannot unleash the second layer of the Dao of the Sword," Xu Yan said, opening his eyes and sighing.</p><p></p><p>He had comprehended the second layer of the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also had some harvests. His tyrannical Dao of the Blade had become more contained, but it could now erupt in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The figure of Li Xuan appeared on the hillside, leisurely playing with a jade ruyi scepter, walking with a carefree and unhurried pace.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan comprehended the second layer of the Dao of the Sword, he had received feedback from the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the second layer of the Dao of the Sword, your second layer of the Dao of the Sword is complete," the Golden Finger had said.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the Dao of the Sword! Li Xuan was inwardly amazed. With Xu Yan as his disciple, his martial dao undertaking would surely flourish.</p><p></p><p>Walking with a leisurely pace, he arrived on the hillside. It was time to pass on the second level of the Dao of the Blade to Meng Chong, allowing him to ponder and comprehend it in advance.</p><p></p><p>"Shifu!" Meng Chong respectfully greeted.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded, his hands clasped behind his back, gazing into the distance, exuding the aura of a transcendent immortal.</p><p></p><p>"You have awakened the Dao of the Blade, and have entered the Dao of the Blade. Do you have any questions?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's spirit was lifted. "Shifu, should I cultivate a blade? Just like when I cultivated a blade and awakened the Dao of the Blade before."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered this. Cultivating a blade, huh? It could be used as a trump card, but it would also consume resources and hinder cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when Meng Chong previously cultivated a blade and drew it, the power of the Dao of the Blade was unleashed in an instant, because his Dao of the Blade had already awakened.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought of the Dao of the Blade levels he had created. Even if Meng Chong were to cultivate a blade, it shouldn't be an ordinary blade, as that would be too mundane and unworthy of the profound Dao of the Blade he had devised.</p><p></p><p>With this in mind, Li Xuan spoke, "How to cultivate a blade? You have already awakened the Dao of the Blade, you should not be obsessed with a physical blade. You should cultivate the blade in your heart, the blade in your Dao of the Blade.</p><p></p><p>"If you cultivate a treasured blade, and it is lost or stolen, wouldn't that be in vain?</p><p></p><p>"Don't say the blade will never leave your side, as that is just nonsense. You should cultivate the blade in your heart, the blade in your Dao of the Blade.</p><p></p><p>"A blade cultivated in this way will never be lost."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart trembled, and a flash of insight appeared in his mind, as if a window to the heavens had opened, and he suddenly gained some understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate the blade in my heart? The blade in my Dao of the Blade?" he murmured, as if he had found the direction for cultivating the blade.</p>

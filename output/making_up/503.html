        <h1>Chapter 503</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Near the Taihe Realm, where the Shadow Realm had fallen, many small stone houses had been built. In each stone house was a martial artist engaged in arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>To occupy the most advantageous cultivation spots, many conflicts had erupted. Those who managed to secure a place here were at minimum Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm cultivators at the peak stage, and among the elite of that level.</p><p></p><p>In the innermost circle closest to where the Shadow Realm had fallen, without the strength of the Taihe realm, one could not occupy a spot.</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity, so all martial artists were urgently cultivating, trying to gain insights from the great changes in heaven and earth. </p><p></p><p>Those who had been stuck at the Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm for ages had especially determined looks in their eyes, wanting to seize this chance to break through their bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>This was an enormous opportunity. If missed, who knew when there would be another chance to break through to the Taihe realm. Even if one could go to the Dao Realm, due to limitations in innate talent, breakthrough might still not be possible. Only by grasping this opportunity from the great changes in heaven and earth would there be a better chance of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>In front of one stone house, a great battle was erupting. </p><p></p><p>Two peak Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm martial artists were fiercely fighting to compete for this spot.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists paid no attention, and no one came out to mediate.</p><p></p><p>As for the Immortal Heavenly Venerable cultivators from major powers, they all had their own territories that outsiders could not and dared not try to seize.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable cultivators from major powers all had Taihe realm powerhouses backing them.</p><p></p><p>After all, the first martial artists to break through to the Taihe realm were all Immortal Heavenly Venerable cultivators from those major powers.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Battles were erupting in more than one place. The Immortal Heavenly Venerable cultivators engaged in these great battles were either powerful figures from minor factions or independent cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Dong! Suddenly, an extremely powerful aura surged out from within the Shadow Realm. All the martial artists in secluded cultivation were shocked and opened their eyes, walking out of their stone houses.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists in the midst of battle also changed expressions drastically. They hurriedly stopped fighting and retreated, looking towards the direction of the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>A figure walked out from within the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>His aura was extremely powerful, like a god of heaven and earth, shaking the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, stirring up the spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>Laws of heaven and earth coiled around his body, emanating divine might.</p><p></p><p>A Divine Venerable realm powerhouse! At this moment, everyone's breath caught in their throats. Seeing the newcomer, they immediately realized in their minds that this was a legendary Divine Venerable realm powerhouse!</p><p></p><p>The Divine Venerable who walked out from the Shadow Realm glanced at the crowd of martial artists. They all hurriedly averted their gazes, not daring to make eye contact.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, get lost!" The Divine Venerable spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable martial artists retreated one after another, fleeing far away.</p><p></p><p>However, the group of Taihe realm powerhouses in the innermost circle closest to the Shadow Realm did not move, but slightly furrowed their brows.</p><p></p><p>"Did you not hear what I said?" That Divine Venerable martial artist's gaze turned cold, and his powerful aura pressed down.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack!</p><p></p><p>The group of Taihe realm martial artists instantly turned red in the face. It was as if a great mountain was pressing down on them. Their bodies trembled, almost kneeling on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Just then, several more powerful auras transmitted from within the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>A cold voice rang out, "What right do you have to strut about and show off your martial prowess in our Taihe Realm's territory?"</p><p></p><p>"Who are you to give orders in our Great Yan Dynasty's subordinate kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>As the voices transmitted over, the Taihe Sect martial artists breathed sighs of relief - the powerhouses from the upper sects had finally arrived! The martial artists from the Great Yan Dynasty also relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Which of the martial artists who dared to remain in the face of a Divine Venerable's rebuke didn't have backing in the Dao Realm?</p><p></p><p>This Divine Venerable martial artist clearly didn't have much of a background, which was why they weren't afraid!</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, that Divine Venerable martial artist's expression changed several times. He hurriedly retracted his aura and said with a dry laugh, "I was merely curious about the willpower of martial artists from the Divine Realm, so I was just testing. As expected of martial artists from a great realm's subordinate kingdom, truly extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>After speaking, he sheepishly found an empty stone house and ducked inside. He was a martial artist who had come seeking an opportunity for breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>One figure after another walked out from the Shadow Realm. Each one had a powerful aura, all of them Divine Venerable realm martial artists without exception.</p><p></p><p>Then, some more Taihe realm martial artists walked out.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the Divine Venerables, Divine Venerables from various realms found their respective subordinate sects and began to understand the situation in the Divine Realm, starting to make some arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Most of these Divine Venerable powerhouses had come with missions.</p><p></p><p>Some Divine Venerable martial artists, after entering the Divine Realm, did not linger near the Shadow Realm but left directly.</p><p></p><p>"It's going to get lively again." Li Xuan looked up towards the Taihe Realm and sighed. Divine Venerables were arriving one after another. It wouldn't be long before Supreme realm powerhouses arrived as well.</p><p></p><p>This was truly getting lively. Among these powerhouses, not a few had come for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the True Dragon clan was also preparing to come to the Divine Realm to avenge their humiliation and restore the prestige of the True Dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>The tremors in the Divine Realm's heaven and earth were growing weaker. The distance between the Dao Realm and Divine Realm returning to unity would not be far off.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Xu Yan emerged from secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He had thoroughly comprehended the mysteries of the Heaven and Earth realm, improved various divine abilities, and even cultivated some powerful divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Palm had also had a huge improvement, now a divine ability palm technique.</p><p></p><p>The True Dragon Fury divine ability had also had a tremendous improvement. The defense and regenerative powers of the Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword had become even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's current foundation, and with a supreme treasure like the Primordial Turtle Shell in hand, even if he encountered a Supreme realm powerhouse, although he might not be able to defeat them, he could safely retreat.</p><p></p><p>It would not be easy for a Supreme realm martial artist to break through Xu Yan's defenses.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to visit Canglang Island," Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>From the Inner Realm to the Spirit Realm, and then to the Divine Realm, it had been a long time since he had parted from his parents. Xu Yan was missing them somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go ahead," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about the safety of Dahuang. That little friend Tianzi will take care of Canglang Island."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Xu Yan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Looking up towards the direction of the Taihe Realm, Xu Yan's heart was almost uncontainable. He wanted to go adventure in the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, before that, he needed to go back to see his parents and give them some guidance in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, we haven't returned to the Inner Realm for a long time either. We'd like to go back too," Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao said with some excitement in their expressions after learning of this.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then let's go back together," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Both women were already Immortal realm martial artists and had cultivated divine abilities. Their strength far surpassed ordinary Immortal realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because they had cultivated divine abilities, the martial arts of the two women had actually diverged somewhat from Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's current strength, he was capable of traversing space between realms without needing to descend to the Spirit Realm via the divine bridge and then return to Canglang Island from there.</p><p></p><p>Taking one step, Xu Yan brought the two women with him, instantly traversing the space between realms, leaving the Divine Realm and arriving in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping his gaze around, he noticed some changes in the Spirit Realm and also sensed that the current Spirit Realm was completely different from the initial Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth had completely changed in appearance, and above the heavens and earth, there now existed supreme heavenly dao rules.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao," Xu Yan murmured thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm seems somewhat unusual..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Divine Realm, there is an even more majestic heavenly might..." Du Yuying said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"Because the Spirit Realm has the Heavenly Dao, it has a more complete form of heaven and earth, or rather, a more complete world.</p><p></p><p>"The world becomes stronger because of the Heavenly Dao. Martial artists who comprehend the Heavenly Dao have no upper limit in their cultivation. Even Realm Lords can find new paths by comprehending the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"You cultivate the Taicang martial way, which allows you to comprehend the Heavenly Dao and more easily reach the Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>"For future martial artists, cultivation will depend on enlightenment. Those with superior enlightenment who can comprehend the mysteries of the Heavenly Dao will surely have great opportunities." Xu Yan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Dao?" Du Yuying and the other woman murmured.</p><p></p><p>"My master's guidance has made this world more perfect."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step with the two women, instantly disappearing from their original location.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the figures of Xu Yan and the two women appeared. The current Canglan Island was no longer the small island it once was. </p><p></p><p>It now truly had the magnificence of a Great Wilderness holy land.</p><p></p><p>"Tianzi?"</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, a youth in purple robes looked at him cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"It's me!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi looked at Xu Yan, the senior disciple of the Dao Ancestor. Seeing him now, he couldn't help but sigh in admiration. He was indeed worthy of being the Dao Ancestor's disciple.</p><p></p><p>He was truly extraordinary, and his cultivation method was truly profound. Even he, as the Heavenly Dao, could not fathom its mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's return to Canglan Island naturally delighted Xu Junhe and his wife. The island became lively.</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother held the hands of Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao, liking them more and more as she looked at them.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan and Tianzi were playing chess.</p><p></p><p>"You're the first person to play chess with me, the Heavenly Dao," Tianzi said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>"To other martial artists, you as the Heavenly Dao are naturally supreme, but that has nothing to do with me. My Dao is not your Heavenly Dao," Xu Yan said with a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>"That's true," Tianzi nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although in terms of strength, Tianzi was above Xu Yan, Xu Yan's cultivation was indeed unrelated to his Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>The five disciples of the Dao Ancestor all cultivated martial arts unrelated to his Heavenly Dao. Or perhaps his Heavenly Dao was just one of the Daos passed down by the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang is dead, now it's the Great Wilderness. This world is the world of the Great Wilderness, and I am the Heavenly Dao of the Great Wilderness, responsible for the operation and strengthening of the world.</p><p></p><p>"I have a feeling that those from the Immortal Palace may be about to make a move, so I need to quickly operate the entire world and strengthen it.</p><p></p><p>"Only in this way can we resist the schemes of the Immortal Palace."</p><p></p><p>As they played chess, they chatted casually. Finally, Tianzi mentioned the schemes of the Immortal Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld and the Demon Realm still exist, and they both want to invade the Great Wilderness. Since that's the case, you as the Heavenly Dao can absorb these two realms, which will allow you to enhance the world more quickly," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I was just thinking about that," Tianzi said excitedly. "Although the Netherworld and Demon Realm are probably already broken, if they're incorporated into the Great Wilderness, they can still bring some improvement. Moreover, the lords of these small realms only have a future if they cultivate the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, help me think. Since they're cultivating the Heavenly Dao, whether they're Realm Lords or small realm lords, they should have a new name."</p><p></p><p>"Think of it yourself, it's your business," Xu Yan said as he placed a piece and stood up. "You lost!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was stunned. He stared at the chessboard for a long time, scratching his head in disbelief. He, the mighty Heavenly Dao, had lost at chess?!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked through the Great Wilderness, coming again to the small mountain village where he first met his master. He marveled at the wonder of fate that allowed him to meet his master! After staying on Canglan Island for a month, Xu Yan taught and guided his parents in martial arts, and also gave some guidance to others on the island in their martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Those who could live on Canglan Island, apart from old acquaintances, were geniuses who had been carefully selected from the Great Wilderness and had come to the holy land to cultivate after passing through layers of selection.</p><p></p><p>These geniuses included those from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Spirit Realm had already been incorporated into the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The name of Sword God Xu Yan was thunderous in the Great Wilderness. Which genius had not heard of him? He was a peak that countless geniuses of the Great Wilderness aspired to reach, wanting to use the Sword God as a model to reach the pinnacle of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>A month later, Xu Yan prepared to return to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao had no plans to return to the Divine Realm for the time being, choosing instead to stay on Canglan Island to keep Xu's mother company.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!" Xu Yan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Holding a jade ruyi scepter in his hand, he stepped into the clouds, overlooking the world of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed closely behind, silently accompanying him.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, how do you see this world of the Divine Realm?" Li Xuan asked with a smile, pointing at the mountains, rivers, and all living things.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment before saying, "It's full of vitality, with all things thriving."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, "The world is full of vitality, all things are thriving, living beings reside here and comprehend the mysteries of the world. But how did all things in the world come to be?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and grasped, gathering the Dao rhythms of the world into a cluster. Within the Dao rhythms, there seemed to be some divine mystery, as if it contained the origin of all things in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Establish the Dao of heaven and earth, so heaven and earth have Dao. With heaven and earth having Dao, the world operates, and all things grow..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the profundities of the Dao Establishment realm. Xu Yan listened respectfully. He had already comprehended the method of the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Once the World realm was perfected, one could begin to establish the Dao of heaven and earth, establish one's own Dao, and break through to the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>Those who establish Dao transcend heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"But Dao Establishment is only a beginning. Using one's own Dao and the Dao of heaven and earth to comprehend the infinite great Dao in the vast unknown. But with heaven and earth empty, even if one has established Dao, how can one comprehend the vast unknown great Dao to understand its meaning?" The reason Taicang fell and failed was that his world was external, and he did not understand his own Dao. All things thrived, but he did not know the creation within.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there was no interaction with the vast unknown great Dao to understand its meaning and obtain its creation..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened respectfully, secretly becoming excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He knew that his master was about to pass on the cultivation method beyond the Dao Establishment realm.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Establishment realm was already transcending heaven and earth, so how powerful must the realm beyond Dao Establishment be? It must surely surpass Taicang!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stopped his steps, looking down at the mountains and rivers below, and gazing towards where the Shadow Realm had fallen, as if seeing through everything.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will pass on to you the cultivation method beyond the Dao Establishment realm," Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan said respectfully and excitedly. Beyond the Dao Establishment realm, what kind of realm would that be? It must be even more profound and difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was confident that he would definitely be able to comprehend it, and it wouldn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>He was already at the World realm, and had understood the Dao Establishment realm. On the path of martial arts, he was no longer the confused youth just starting out.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

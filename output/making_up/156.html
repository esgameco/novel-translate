        <h1>Chapter 156</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This cultivation speed is not much slower than Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became increasingly suspicious that Su Ling Xiu might have a special physique that was highly compatible with the cultivation of the Dantian Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>After Su Ling Xiu's breakthrough, the Golden Finger feedback indicated that he had reached the Innate Realm of the Dantian Martial Dao, allowing the three martial arts to fuse into one, naturally enhancing his strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his palm, and a wisp of true qi emerged.</p><p></p><p>The pale blue true qi contained a continuous vitality, and with a thought, it transformed into a strand of Cinnabar Fire.</p><p></p><p>This was the Innate True Qi of the Dantian Martial Dao!</p><p></p><p>"To heal and save people, a single strand of true qi is sufficient," Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>After Zhou Ying entered the martial path, she went to spar with Shi Er, and the battle was extremely intense, even though Shi Er's Qi and Blood Realm was slightly inferior to Zhou Ying's.</p><p></p><p>However, Shi Er did not display the expected advantage in the battle.</p><p></p><p>This left Shi Er somewhat depressed.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so weak?" Zhou Ying asked dissatisfiedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I'm weak, but I cultivate Meng Chong's sword technique, and I'm afraid that if I unleash it, I won't be able to control it and end up hurting you!" Shi Er said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Once he hurt Zhou Ying, even if it was an accident, he was worried that it would displease Su Ling Xiu, and then how would he obtain medicinal pills to cultivate?</p><p></p><p>"Teach me the sword technique," Zhou Ying frowned.</p><p></p><p>She also understood Shi Er's concerns and had no intention of forcing him to go all out.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Shi Er nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Zhou Ying entered the martial path, Su Ling Xiu refined the medicinal materials again, producing a batch of medicinal pills in one go. Some of these were rewarded to Kou Ruozhi and the members of the Changqing Hall.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of Kou Ruozhi and Xu Junhe, the Changqing Hall was initially established, and there were a few people with decent talent who were cultivating the martial path, but they had not yet entered the path.</p><p></p><p>The remaining medicinal pills were partially sent to Xu Junhe, and the rest were for Zhou Ying and Shi Er's cultivation, as well as a share for the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu also looked forward to whether the Red Cat could truly cultivate into a great demon.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a while since I received any Golden Finger feedback. Could it be that Xu Yan has finished killing the Grand Masters?" Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without the feedback of Xu Yan killing Grand Masters, he felt a bit unaccustomed for the moment.</p><p></p><p>"Although there are many Grand Masters, Xu Yan can't be provoking them every day, right? Moreover, Xu Yan is not the type to actively stir up trouble, so it's normal that there has been no feedback for so many days," Li Xuan thought, and his mind was put at ease.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat, with a thick gold chain around its neck, came over and lay down on the ground, staring at Li Xuan with its eyes, as if wanting him to guide it.</p><p></p><p>"You, this big cat, are getting bigger and bigger. Soon, you won't even fit in a pot. If you keep growing, you'll become a fat tiger. You should contract your body and store your power in your acupoints, and then release the accumulated power to expand your body. This is the power of a great demon..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a bamboo stick and pointed it at the Red Cat, guiding and instructing it.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Red Cat's increasingly massive physique, its growing power and ferocious aura, as well as its seemingly enhanced intelligence, all signs indicated that it had indeed gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Of course, when it would truly become a great demon was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Since he was idle, Li Xuan didn't mind teaching the Red Cat more. As a supreme expert, the pet he raised naturally couldn't be ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's gaze seemed thoughtful, as if it understood but not fully. After Li Xuan finished instructing it, it got up and left, lying down and dozing off outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took out an ancient leather book and continued studying the first page when a golden light suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Grand Master, and your Annihilation Sword Intent has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had killed another Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Xu Yan and Meng Chong have provoked a major force?" Li Xuan speculated.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had returned. He had returned earlier than expected, with a small package hanging on his chest, and the usually reckless man was being unusually careful, as if afraid of damaging the contents.</p><p></p><p>He was carrying a large bag that was bulging, and Li Xuan was greatly surprised. Could it be filled with spiritual herbs? Where did he get so many spiritual herbs? Combining the facts that both Xu Yan and Meng Chong had killed Patriarchs and Grand Masters, could it be that they had gone to rob spiritual herbs? Yet Xu Yan had not returned.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!" Meng Chong said respectfully, carefully placing down the package.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "It's good that you're back."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu, who was contemplating the Bagua outside the manor, rushed in hurriedly. "Second Brother, you're back. Where's the eldest brother?"</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, the eldest brother still has some matters to attend to. The spiritual herbs on the list haven't been fully purchased yet. The eldest brother will be back within a month," Meng Chong said with a silly grin.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, look, these are all spiritual herbs!" Meng Chong opened the large bag, revealing it to be full of spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was greatly excited, her eyes even reddening. "Second brother, where did you get so many spiritual herbs? You didn't encounter any danger, did you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thumped his chest and said, "It's nothing, the eldest brother has already resolved any troubles."</p><p></p><p>He then opened the small package and said, "Shidi, look at this spiritual herb."</p><p></p><p>What caught Li Xuan's eye first was a small green tree hanging with nine dewdrop-like small fruits. This spiritual herb was clearly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying and Shi Er also came over to take a look.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is...?" Su Ling Xiu's eyes widened. Even though others might not recognize it, she knew it well. "This is a Fifth-Grade spiritual herb, the Heavenly Dew Marrow!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was utterly shocked. It was common knowledge that Sixth-Grade spiritual herbs were the highest grade in the Inner Realm, and they were already extremely rare. </p><p></p><p>Fifth-Grade spiritual herbs had never been heard of appearing in the Inner Realm before. Even if they did appear, they would be extremely secretive and unknown to the public.</p><p></p><p>In any case, a Fifth-Grade spiritual herb in the Inner Realm was something that was almost impossible to come by!</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, where did this come from?" Zhou Ying and Shi Er were also greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>When Su Ling Xiu had previously introduced spiritual herbs to her two senior brothers, Shi Er had also been listening, so he was not entirely ignorant about spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had returned from the Inner Realm and actually brought back a Fifth-Grade spiritual herb?!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Heavenly Dew Marrow and recalled the incidents of Xu Yan and Meng Chong killing Patriarchs and Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that they were targeted because of this Fifth-Grade spiritual herb? "Hehe, I dug it up from a spiritual herb treasure trove," Meng Chong said, scratching his head.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, look, there are also Sixth-Grade spiritual herbs," Meng Chong said, opening the small package to reveal several Sixth-Grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was greatly excited, her jade-like face flushing red. She gently took out the spiritual herbs, saying, "These spiritual herbs are too precious. The Heavenly Dew Marrow and the Sixth-Grade spiritual herbs, my current refinement skills are not strong enough to concoct pills with them. Any failed attempts would result in huge losses."</p><p></p><p>Although the spiritual herbs were sealed in spirit-sealing silk, the best storage method for the Sixth-Grade and Fifth-Grade spiritual herbs would be to store them in a spirit jade box.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There are no spirit stones in the border wilderness..." Suli Xiu carefully arranged the spirit medicines, her brow slightly furrowed as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, I'll go to Tianbao Pavilion in Tieshan County and buy some spirit stone boxes," Meng Chong said, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, don't rush. If you go buy spirit stone boxes, others will know you've obtained sixth or seventh-grade spirit medicines," Suli Xiu hurriedly stopped him.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, notify Kou Ruozhi to get some jade boxes. Although they're not spirit stone boxes, they can still be used for storage. The medicines have already been sealed, it's not like they need to be stored for decades, regular jade boxes will do."</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu turned and instructed Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll notify Kou Ruozhi," Shi Er immediately went to inform Kou Ruozhi, then quickly returned.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu carefully placed the heavenly dew marrow and a few sixth-grade spirit medicines on the table, waiting for the jade boxes to arrive.</p><p></p><p>She opened the large bag of spirit medicines, most of which were eighth-grade, with a smaller portion being seventh-grade, and very few ninth-grade.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, there are so many spirit medicines here, we can refine many elixirs!" Suli Xiu's eyes crinkled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Before the Elder Brother went to the inner realm, he said he would bring back a large bag of spirit medicines, and he really did! The Elder Brother still has more, all the spirit medicines on the list can be gathered. Sister, you can refine the elixirs with ease!" Meng Chong said, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, wasn't it very dangerous to obtain these spirit medicines?" Suli Xiu looked at him with slightly reddened eyes.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt a bit awkward under her gaze, scratching his head, "It wasn't that dangerous, and the Elder Brother has already dealt with it."</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, can you tell us about it?" Suli Xiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Zhou Ying also had curious expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, although also curious, as the master, naturally couldn't show it, so he remained calm, sitting in the chair and staring at the ancient leather book, as if he already knew everything.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, this story is quite thrilling!" Meng Chong became energetic, pulling over a stool to sit down.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, go brew some tea!" Zhou Ying kicked Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er hurriedly went to brew a large pot of tea, pouring it directly into bowls and handing one to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the inner realm, he also yearned for it.</p><p></p><p>"It all started with a coincidence..." Meng Chong drank a bowl of tea and began recounting from when he accepted Meng Shushu's commission.</p><p></p><p>When he mentioned Meng Shushu, Zhou Ying exclaimed in surprise, "Meng Shushu? The heir of the renowned spirit medicine exploration family, the Meng Clan?"</p><p></p><p>"Eh, you know him?" Meng Chong was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu also had a look of surprise on her face, "Aunt Zhou, do you know him?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying shook her head, "I wouldn't say I know him, but I'm familiar with him. Meng Shushu is quite renowned in the spirit medicine exploration world. He comes from the Meng Clan, a prominent spirit medicine exploration family, but the Meng Clan has fallen into decline..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, saying, "The clan elders mentioned that his parents died unexpectedly while exploring spirit medicines, and his grandfather also died while rescuing an old friend."</p><p></p><p>It seems the Meng Clan only has Meng Shushu left now.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying seemed to have thought of something, opening her mouth but not voicing it, instead saying, "I heard the Meng Clan patriarch was a great Grandmaster, it's unexpected that he has perished."</p><p></p><p>A Grandmaster! </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was no longer in awe of Grandmasters, it was just so-so. </p><p></p><p>The Elder Brother had already accomplished the feat of defeating a Grandmaster, now it was his turn, just waiting to see which unfortunate Grandmaster would be next.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, please continue!" Suli Xiu urged.</p><p></p><p>"...I saved the clan's person, he owes me a life debt, a storage bag, and eighteen sixth-grade spirit medicines. Then I went to the spirit medicine treasure ground, ready to harvest spirit medicines..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not hide anything, recounting how he went to the Tianhammer Mountain spirit medicine treasure ground, killed a Patriarch, fought a Half-step Grandmaster, until the Grandmaster arrived, forcing him to flee with Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>In the end, Xu Yan arrived and slew two Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>After going to the spirit medicine treasure ground and slaying another Grandmaster, harvesting the spirit medicines, he then returned to the border wilderness and encountered the Killing Skeleton, which Xu Yan also slew.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu, Zhou Ying, and Shi Er were already stunned by Meng Chong's account. According to him, after entering the inner realm, it was either killing Patriarchs or Grandmasters. Especially Xu Yan, who was so ferocious, slaying Grandmasters with a single sword strike!</p><p></p><p>"The Killing Skeleton is dead?" Zhou Ying was horrified.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the nine great Demon Overlords, the most brutal and bloodthirsty under the command of the Fiery Exterminator Demon Overlord. The three major nations had all issued bounties on him, but he had always lived freely, and the Grandmasters who tried to hunt him down were either killed or severely injured, deterring anyone from claiming the bounty.</p><p></p><p>Yet he was slain by Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, dead. The Elder Brother reduced him to ashes with a single sword strike," Meng Chong nodded, continuing, "The Elder Brother is already preparing to claim the bounty and take over Canglan Island, so we'll have a foothold in the inner realm now."</p><p></p><p>"Canglan Island?" Zhou Ying was somewhat surprised, "Did Young Master Xu subdue Yin Hong?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Hong was quite renowned, especially in the Great Yue Nation, known as the number one under the Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head, "Of course not, Yin Hong has already broken through to Grandmaster, and challenged the Elder Brother in the Seven Star Academy, only to be blown away by the Elder Brother's palm strike!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying: ...</p><p></p><p>A Grandmaster, blown away by a palm strike?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, after hearing Meng Chong's account, couldn't help but sigh. So that's how it was, quite an eventful tale.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Meng Chong's exploits, Xu Yan's deeds were likely even more thrilling and exciting.</p><p></p><p>He was truly not just killing Patriarchs, but preparing to kill Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>"The inner realm is so exciting!" Shi Er had an envious look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong glanced at him, "Shi Er, with your current strength, going to the inner realm would still be very dangerous, Patriarch-level experts are everywhere."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er smiled awkwardly, in Meng Chong's eyes, Patriarchs were like common cabbages, easily slain. "Actually, Patriarch-level experts aren't that many in the inner realm..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's confidence was waning.</p><p></p><p>She just couldn't understand how Patriarch-level experts, who were supposed to be the pinnacle of strength in the inner realm, were being killed one after another by Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan even started slaying Grandmasters, killing them one by one...</p><p></p><p>It was as if they were just common cabbages!</p><p></p><p>"Sister, who exactly are the enemies that have targeted you?" Meng Chong suddenly became serious, "The force that hired Meng Shushu, the Grandmasters pursuing us, their attire is exactly the same as the Grandmaster defeated by our Master, they must be from your enemy's faction!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu and Zhou Ying's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

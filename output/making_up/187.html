        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Hundred Martial Spirits Shadow, Li Xuan gained some new insights into his grand martial dao undertaking. It was not just the orthodox martial dao that could be promoted, but the physical martial dao and even the alchemical martial dao could also be promoted.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this martial dao system would require a relatively higher level of innate talent.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate the physical martial dao, one must have the innate talent in the physical aspect, just as the alchemical martial dao would require the corresponding innate talent. Only then could one more easily enter the path.</p><p></p><p>Promoting the physical martial dao and the alchemical martial dao was not an urgent matter for the time being, and Li Xuan did not intend to focus his efforts on it.</p><p></p><p>As the number of cultivators increased, it would not be long before there would be an explosive growth in the number of martial dao beginners, which would then gradually stabilize.</p><p></p><p>For the Great Wilderness Martial Dao to replace the Inner Domain Martial Dao and be widely disseminated, it would still require a long period of accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that by the time the Great Wilderness Martial Dao replaced the Inner Domain Martial Dao, his own realm would have advanced significantly.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, several Hundred Martial Spirits Shadows flashed out, silently and ethereally wandering through the city, not easily drawing attention.</p><p></p><p>A young man was troubled by his inability to sense his qi and blood after three days of trying. He was anxious and dejected.</p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, he stood in a horse stance to sense his qi and blood, when suddenly he seemed to see a fleeting shadow approaching, and a voice sounded in his ear.</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood move with the heart. Calm the heart, still the breath, and comprehend the self..."</p><p></p><p>The shadow extended a hand and tapped him, and in that instant, the young man felt a warm flow surge in his chest and abdomen. He was overjoyed, having sensed his qi and blood! "That must be the Martial Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The young man was filled with reverent admiration, having received the guidance of the Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>That day, many young cultivators in the city caught fleeting glimpses of the Martial Ancestor's figure, who had pointed the way for them, allowing them to make great breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. The Hundred Martial Spirits Shadows were similar to clones, and even stronger than clones, with no restrictions. But limited by his own strength, the range of activity of the Hundred Martial Spirits Shadows was still limited.</p><p></p><p>"As my cultivation advances, they should ultimately be able to move freely outside, engage in combat, and not be restricted by distance."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an inspiration flashed in Li Xuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"As my realm advances and my martial dao cultivation progresses, the ability to create martial dao clones should also be developed. But to obtain the ability to create clones is not easy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered deeply, trying to figure out at what realm he could theoretically develop the ability to create something akin to clones, such as imbuing power into an object that could be carried and activated in times of danger.</p><p></p><p>"How can I construct a coherent theory that is also practically feasible? I need to ponder this thoroughly, or else the theory will be too vague and lack cohesiveness. It may take a long time for me to truly comprehend and realize it."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan's gaze turned to his Golden Finger. It was emitting a faint golden glow, but the outline of the Golden Finger was not yet visible.</p><p></p><p>"When I can clearly see the Golden Finger, perhaps I can try to utilize it to help develop this ability."</p><p></p><p>If he could use the Golden Finger as an aid, it should become much easier.</p><p></p><p>Since obtaining the Hundred Martial Spirits Shadows, Li Xuan would occasionally deploy them to wander the city, occasionally pointing the way for the young cultivators practicing martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The rumor that worshipping the Martial Ancestor could bring martial dao fortune, and that the diligent cultivators had a chance to receive the Martial Ancestor's guidance, became increasingly widespread and believed.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yan was about to break through to the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had completely perfected himself, and was confident that upon breaking through, he would undergo another transformation.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Evergreen Pavilion, on a mountain peak, Wen Yan sat in meditation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not come in person, but sent a Hundred Martial Spirits Shadow to silently observe his disciple's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Wen Junhe, Shi Er, and Zhou Ying watched from the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"The Penetrating Profound Realm, does that mean our senior brother can easily defeat dozens of peak Grandmaster-level experts now?" Exclaimed the excited Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Although he may not reach the carefree and unrestrained level of the Master, he should be able to easily overcome dozens of peak Grandmaster-level experts," Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yan's breakthrough to the Penetrating Profound Realm did not involve any bottlenecks. If not for the need to consolidate his foundation and accumulate inner strength, he could have broken through to the Penetrating Profound Realm even when he perfected the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, his breakthrough was a natural progression.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth poured in, Wen Yan's true qi constantly refining within. The vast and boundless sea of qi in his dantian was swirling like a vortex.</p><p></p><p>As the sea of qi grew stronger, the first drop of true essence appeared.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Bridge was also undergoing a transformation, seeming to become a bridge to the heavens, with a golden dragon lying beneath, the mountains and rivers depicted upon it, as if the masses were walking within.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Wen Yan's entire being was in a state of sublimation. Although he did not cultivate the physical martial dao, his jade-like physique was the foundation, pure and flawless. When he broke through the Innate Realm, he had also transformed into an ethereal bone.</p><p></p><p>His physical body's strength and resilience was terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent surged around his body, the mountains and rivers depicted within. At this moment, Wen Yan seemed to be within a mountain and river, or the mountain and river were within his physical body, forming a profound state.</p><p></p><p>As Wen Yan continued to break through, he was also interweaving and transforming.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, above the sea of qi in his dantian, it was as if a torrential rain was falling, the raindrops constantly dripping, wanting to fill the dantian.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The sea of qi in the dantian became a vast and mighty ocean, the true essence surging and crashing, forming wave after wave. And above the true essence, clouds and mists gathered, the wind whirling and stirring the clouds, forming a vortex.</p><p></p><p>The vortex continuously dripped raindrops, which were the true qi that had not yet condensed into true essence, as well as the spiritual energy pouring in from heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yan's breakthrough was ongoing, constantly in a state of sublimation and transformation.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Meng Chong and the others watching Wen Yan's breakthrough were suddenly struck by an illusion - the one sitting in meditation was not Wen Yan, but a mountain and river.</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps the mountain and river were beneath Wen Yan, or Wen Yan was within the mountain and river.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Su Lingxiu shook her head, and when she looked again, everything was as it had been.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered, was this a phenomenon that occurred during the senior brother's sublimation and transformation?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the midst of the surging spiritual energy of heaven and earth, a mountain and river image coalesced, majestic and desolate, seemingly filled with a sense of destruction and ruthless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Any living being that entered this mountain and river would be annihilated within.</p><p></p><p>Harmonizing with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, penetrating the profundities of the cosmos! This was the Penetrating Profound Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother has broken through to the Penetrating Profound Realm," Su Lingxiu said excitedly and with reverence.</p><p></p><p>When would she be able to break through to the Penetrating Profound Realm? She must redouble her cultivation efforts to strive for an early breakthrough to the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through the Tong Xuan realm, he would be able to master the Void Refining Pill Art, right?</p><p></p><p>The mountain and river illusion in the mid-air was constantly growing and changing. At a certain moment, a small vortex seemed to appear within the mountain and river, but it did not take a concrete form. Moreover, it seemed rather unstable.</p><p></p><p>When Li Xuan saw this, he was startled. Was that the Taiji?</p><p></p><p>Taiji gives birth to the two principles, the two principles give birth to the four images, the four images give birth to the eight trigrams... He had taught all of these to Xu Yan when teaching the eight trigrams.</p><p></p><p>Now, with his breakthrough to the Tong Xuan realm, he had gained some new insights.</p><p></p><p>But it was still in its infancy, not yet fully comprehended. However, since he had already gained some enlightenment, the true comprehension would not be too far away.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The mountain and river illusion in the mid-air collapsed and then reappeared, repeating this cycle.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the mountain and river illusion suddenly fell from the mid-air and descended upon Xu Yan, gradually seeping into his body, as if merging with the mountain and river.</p><p></p><p>"I am the mountain and river, the mountain and river are me!" "Your disciple Xu Yan, cultivating the martial dao you created, has broken through the Tong Xuan realm. Your Tong Xuan realm has reached its pinnacle, with your strength a hundredfold of those at the same realm."</p><p></p><p>Golden light emerged, and Xu Yan had broken through the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile. His own strength had surged again. Even if a true Heavenly Warrior descended, he would be able to easily annihilate them.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of strength increasing was the greatest joy in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, upon breaking through the Tong Xuan realm, has transformed into a Mountain and River Spiritual Body. You have obtained the Innate Mountain and River Spiritual Body."</p><p></p><p>Golden light appeared once more.</p><p></p><p>As expected, when Xu Yan broke through the Tong Xuan realm, he had undergone a transformation and metamorphosis, becoming a Mountain and River Spiritual Body.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xu Yan possessed the Dragon Soaring Mountain and River Spiritual Bones and the Mountain and River Spiritual Body. His strength and foundation had further increased. Even facing a Half-Step Heavenly Warrior, although he could not easily defeat them in just a few strikes, overcoming a Half-Step Heavenly Warrior was no longer a problem.</p><p></p><p>"You truly are the pioneer of my martial dao." Li Xuan was deeply gratified.</p><p></p><p>He felt that the best decision he had made in his two lifetimes was to take Xu Yan as his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had broken through the Tong Xuan realm, the realms and techniques above the Tong Xuan realm should also be ready to be passed on to him.</p><p></p><p>"When Meng Chong breaks through, will he also be able to undergo a transformation and metamorphosis? Although the Great Sun Golden Body is already extremely powerful, if he could further transform and obtain a spiritual body, the Great Sun Golden Body would become even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to this.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's talent was not inferior, and after Xu Yan's breakthrough, he would also impart his experiences to Meng Chong. Therefore, it was possible for Meng Chong to undergo a transformation and metamorphosis upon his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The second layer of the Great Sun Golden Body corresponded to the Tong Xuan realm. Upon breaking through, he would also refine his true essence, but he would already possess the profound mysteries of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>For example, transforming into a thirty-foot-tall giant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already reached the pinnacle of the Innate Realm and would soon be able to break through the Innate Realm. It would not be long before he could break through the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Flesh Body cultivators at the Tong Xuan realm did not conform to the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, they could still absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth into their bodies and display the transformations of the Golden Body, such as transforming into a thirty-foot-tall giant. Their strength and ferocity would become even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared once again, and Li Xuan was overjoyed. Xu Yan's breakthrough to the Tong Xuan realm this time had brought him considerable gains.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, from the Taiji you taught him, has initially comprehended the Life and Death Sword Wheel. Your Life and Death Sword Wheel has reached its pinnacle."</p><p></p><p>The Life and Death Sword Wheel!</p><p></p><p>This was a new sword dao that Xu Yan had comprehended after the Mountain and River Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked after obtaining the Life and Death Sword Wheel. This sword dao was extremely powerful. If combined with the Mountain and River Sword Dao, it would be an unparalleled slaughter technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, two sword lights appeared before Li Xuan, rotating and transforming, sometimes separating, sometimes intertwining and rotating. Within the spinning sword wheel, life and death fluctuated.</p><p></p><p>The sword of life was for defense, the sword of death was for offense. But the swords of life and death could change instantly, the previous moment being the sword of life, and the next moment becoming the sword of death.</p><p></p><p>Cycling endlessly, changing unpredictably, undefeatable!</p><p></p><p>"The sword dao has become even stronger. With this Life and Death Sword Wheel, even slaying a Half-Step Heavenly Warrior would not be too difficult."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's comprehension of the Life and Death Sword Wheel, at the Tong Xuan entry level, slaying a Half-Step Heavenly Warrior would not be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Of course, at the moment, Xu Yan had only comprehended the initial form, and the power of the Life and Death Sword Wheel was far from this strong.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan believed that with Xu Yan's monstrous talent, it would not take long for the Life and Death Sword Wheel to reach the level of mastery, no longer just a rudimentary form.</p><p></p><p>"This Life and Death Sword Wheel is just a foundation. It can be continuously comprehended and improved. Let's consider this the first layer of the Life and Death Sword Wheel."</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuan's eyes, this was only the first layer. As Xu Yan continued to comprehend it, there would surely appear the second layer, the third layer, and so on. The Life and Death Sword Wheel would become increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Mountain and River Sword Dao, Xu Yan was also constantly perfecting and improving it.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Xuan thought that Xu Yan's breakthrough to the Tong Xuan realm had brought all the feedback to an end, the golden light appeared once again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the fourth layer of the Subduing Dragon Palm. Your Subduing Dragon Palm has reached the fourth layer."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: !!! This disciple was truly monstrous. He had managed to comprehend the fourth layer of the Subduing Dragon Palm. Since he had the fourth layer, the fifth layer and sixth layer would not be surprising in the future.</p><p></p><p>"In such a short time, his strength has surged again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Urging his disciple to cultivate and comprehend the martial dao was the right path. Being able to grow stronger while resting was truly a wonderful feeling.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through the Tong Xuan realm and was stabilizing and contemplating the realm he had broken through, still remaining on the mountain peak without returning.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had not returned either. He was preparing to break through to the Innate Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu and the others had returned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He was overjoyed, his mouth unable to close. His precious son had grown stronger again. The scene where dozens of peak Grand Sect Masters attacked him previously, now his son could easily overwhelm them.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was stimulated and began to cultivate diligently, striving to break through the Tong Xuan realm as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Zhou Ying were burning with passion, longing for the Tong Xuan realm, and began to cultivate tirelessly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's Qi and Blood had already reached perfection, but she still felt that the opportunity to break through the Innate Realm was not yet complete, so she continued to accumulate her own foundation.</p><p></p><p>She did not want to be a weak Innate Realm cultivator after breaking through, due to insufficient accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's Qi and Blood had also reached perfection. It was just that for the Innate Realm, he felt his accumulation was still insufficient, his realm a bit unstable, so he frantically trained himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he could now break through the Innate Realm, with the help of medicinal pills, he would still be a weak Innate Realm cultivator after the breakthrough, and would be beaten by Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling to accept this, so in order to temper himself, he even found the Crimson Cat to train with.</p><p></p><p>The result was that he was slapped away by the Crimson Cat, breaking a rib! When Su Ling Xiu was treating him, her expression was strange, feeling that the Crimson Cat had done it intentionally, perhaps to take revenge for when Shi Er had whipped it before. It seemed that Shi Er's method of "for your own good" did not work very well on the Crimson Cat.</p><p></p><p>Well, the Crimson Cat had seized the opportunity to take revenge!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 389</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This grudge must be avenged. Your people will not be able to walk in Tiankuang anymore. I, the Blood Son, will personally take action and exterminate them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Old man Wan, come and die!"</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Blood Son had gone mad! The Wan family elder desperately tried to resist and prevent the Snake Peak Blood Son from attacking the great city, while cursing loudly: "Stop talking nonsense! When did I ever kill your blood disciples?"</p><p></p><p>"Stop quibbling! Who else could it be besides you? Infiltrating my territory, assassinating my blood disciples, killing 70% of them! You despicable and shameless scoundrel! Ahhhh, I've got my eyes on you Wan family warriors now. I'm going to kill all of you!"</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Blood Son was in a state of frenzy! The Wan family elder was completely dumbfounded. 70% of the Snake Peak Blood Son's blood disciples had been killed? Damn! No wonder he was suspected. Besides him, an Immortal Venerable, who else could have done it?</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't have done it either. </p><p></p><p>As soon as he approached the territory of the Netherworld Prison, the Snake Peak Blood Son would have detected him immediately.</p><p></p><p>If he could infiltrate silently, why bother killing blood disciples? He would have assassinated the Snake Peak Blood Son directly!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the image of that young man from earlier flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Could it have been him? No, impossible. Who could infiltrate the Netherworld Prison territory to carry out assassinations? Even if someone could infiltrate, assassinating one or two blood disciples would be remarkable enough. How could 70% have been assassinated?" It's absolutely impossible. The Snake Peak Blood Son must be feigning madness as an excuse, trying to break the tacit understanding between us!"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder suddenly had a look of realization. Originally, there was a tacit understanding between them - the Snake Peak Blood Son would not attack any Divine Realm warriors other than him, and he would not attack anyone below the blood disciples.</p><p></p><p>In other words, they were each other's only opponents.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Snake Peak Blood Son clearly wanted to use this as an excuse to break that tacit understanding.</p><p></p><p>Believing he had figured out the reason, the Wan family elder also let out an angry roar and began frantically trading blows with the Snake Peak Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>"You treacherous scoundrel of the Netherworld Prison, if you want to fight then fight! Don't make excuses!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This battle was incredibly intense, the most fierce and brutal fight in all their countless encounters.</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Blood Son felt that the Wan family elder was looking down on him. How could he swallow this anger?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, the Wan family elder believed the Snake Peak Blood Son was making excuses. Since that was the case, he would let the other side know that he could go crazy too. How could he show weakness? And so, the two powerful experts engaged in an intense battle, fighting for a day and a night without stopping, as if determined to fight to the death!</p><p></p><p>The crowd of warriors in the city watched with their scalps tingling. It was the first time they had witnessed such a brutal battle between Immortal Venerables!</p><p></p><p>"Can Elder Wan win?"</p><p></p><p>"He should be able to, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Not good, look! Elder Wan is coughing up blood!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, the Snake Peak Blood Son is coughing up blood too."</p><p></p><p>The warriors in the city felt somewhat uneasy. If the Wan family elder was defeated, wouldn't this great city fall? Meanwhile, Xu Yan, the instigator of all this, watched the battle outside the city and sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of Immortal Venerables. When they go crazy, it's too terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>He secretly felt relieved that he had escaped quickly, otherwise he would have had to face the crazed Snake Peak Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>"If they keep fighting like this, won't they end up dying together?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clicked his tongue in secret.</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Blood Son seemed to have lost his rationality due to losing 70% of his blood disciples, determined to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>At this point, if the Wan family elder showed any weakness and his frenzy subsided, he would certainly fall into a disadvantage and end up in a passive state, inevitably leading to defeat.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad. This Wan family elder isn't cowering at all. He has the spirit of being willing to die together if necessary!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in approval. As expected of an old hand, he deeply understood the principle that he couldn't back down even in the face of death at this moment. With sheer determination, he fought more and more frantically.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family will soon learn about the Blood Heart Fruit. Then I can make a trade. But I can't trade here - after all, one must be cautious."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't continue watching the battle. He turned and left Snake Peak Tiankuang, waiting for the Wan family prodigy Wan Tianlin to seek him out.</p><p></p><p>The battle between Immortal Venerables in Snake Peak Tiankuang lasted for three days and three nights. The level of brutality exceeded imagination, arguably the most brutal Immortal Venerable battle in the history of Snake Peak Tiankuang.</p><p></p><p>"Old man Wan, this matter won't end here. You just wait!"</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Blood Son retreated in a flash of blood light while coughing up blood.</p><p></p><p>"You think I'm afraid of you?"</p><p></p><p>Although the Wan family elder was severely injured with blood constantly oozing from the corners of his mouth, he didn't cower at all.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat puzzled. Did the Snake Peak Blood Son suddenly go crazy because 70% of his blood disciples were really killed? "That doesn't make sense. Who could kill so many blood disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Unless he personally took action, but if he did, there's no way he could have hidden it from the Snake Peak Blood Son. And what warrior below the Immortal Venerable realm would have such capability?</p><p></p><p>Even with sneak attacks and assassinations, it shouldn't be possible.</p><p></p><p>"I need to heal quickly. The plan to attack the Netherworld Prison camp needs to be canceled. It's fortunate that someone picked the Blood Heart Fruit."</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elder immediately returned to the city to focus on healing his injuries. Who knows when the Snake Peak Blood Son might go crazy and attack again?</p><p></p><p>Plans can't keep up with changes. The plan to launch a surprise attack on the Netherworld Prison camp and pick the Blood Heart Fruit was canceled. The warriors who had come for this purpose were inevitably disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But they also knew this was an unavoidable decision.</p><p></p><p>After all, the battle that had just ended was too brutal. The Wan family elder's injuries were more severe than they could have imagined.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time they had seen an Immortal Venerable, who ruled over a realm, in such a miserable and sorry state.</p><p></p><p>"We watched the battle for three days and three nights. Such a fight between powerful experts was worth it. This trip wasn't in vain!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this trip wasn't in vain."</p><p></p><p>"Without becoming immortal, one will eventually turn to dust. How can one step into the Immortal realm?"</p><p></p><p>After witnessing the power of Immortal Venerables, the True Monarch Venerables all sighed with admiration and envy.</p><p></p><p>However, the Immortal realm seemed like a truly insurmountable gap. Those who could cross this gap and step into the Immortal realm were one in ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>How many once-famous prodigies had ultimately stopped at the threshold of the Immortal realm, never able to take that final step?</p><p></p><p>To enter the Immortal realm, besides talent, one also needed opportunity, great fortune, and great willpower.</p><p></p><p>"Someone obtained a Blood Heart Fruit?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master."</p><p></p><p>"Where is this person? What are their demands?"</p><p></p><p>"At Jade Bamboo Slope. It seems they want to exchange it for some heavenly and earthly treasures."</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Jade Bamboo Slope."</p><p></p><p>Upon learning about the Blood Heart Fruit, Wan Tianlin, the third young master of the Wan family, immediately set off for Jade Bamboo Slope.</p><p></p><p>Jade Bamboo Slope was somewhat famous in Mount Dagaishan. It got its name from a type of jade-like bamboo that grew there. With beautiful scenery, some warriors liked to cultivate there in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>After revealing information about the Blood Heart Fruit and his whereabouts to the Wan family, Xu Yan waited at Jade Bamboo Slope.</p><p></p><p>"Given the Wan family's resources and prestige, they shouldn't resort to robbing people's treasures. With one Blood Heart Fruit, I'll try to trade for as many needed heavenly and earthly treasures as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan intertwined several jade bamboos to make a simple chair. He sat on it leisurely, waiting for Wan Tianlin's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already listed out the treasures he needed. With the Wan family's resources, even if they couldn't gather everything, they should be able to get seven or eight tenths of it.</p><p></p><p>As for whether there were dangers in the trade, Xu Yan didn't take it to heart.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Wan family had decent resources and prestige, so they shouldn't</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For the sake of a Blood Heart Fruit, they directly moved to snatch it, after all this Blood Heart Fruit was prepared to be traded to them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they truly had evil intentions and wanted to rob the Blood Heart Fruit, Xu Yan was not afraid. As long as the Immortal Heavenly Venerable did not appear, those True King Heavenly Venerables could not do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't match them, he could easily retreat.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Wan Tianlin doesn't have any thoughts of oppressing independent cultivators," Xu Yan muttered to himself. If he could avoid offending the Wan family, he naturally wouldn't offend them, after all this was a powerful clan with more than one Immortal Heavenly Venerable expert.</p><p></p><p>But he also wouldn't fear the Wan family's strength. If killing was necessary, he would kill. Even if he couldn't match them now, once his strength increased, he would settle all accounts that needed to be settled.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan was confident that apart from Immortal Heavenly Venerables, no martial artist below the True King Heavenly Venerable level could pose any threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't match them, he could easily escape.</p><p></p><p>Every Immortal Heavenly Venerable in the Divine Realm would not easily leave their guarding post, for fear that enemies from the Heavenly Abyss would seize the opportunity to invade. This also meant that the probability of being hunted by an Immortal Heavenly Venerable was extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waited at Jade Bamboo Slope. A day later, three people arrived.</p><p></p><p>The leader was a young man with a scholarly appearance, but his eyes did not hide a hint of arrogance.</p><p></p><p>He had early-stage Refining Truth Realm strength.</p><p></p><p>The other two were late-stage Refining Truth Realm, serving as guards.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze fell on the scholarly young man. For someone his age to already be a True King Heavenly Venerable, his talent was indeed extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his aura was steady, as if concealing a powerful force. His strength could be considered top-tier among those of the same level.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin!</p><p></p><p>"Did you pick the Blood Heart Fruit?" Wan Tianlin asked impatiently as soon as he arrived.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it was me!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. What are your conditions? Do you want to join my Wan family, or follow me, or do you need cultivation techniques, or even the protection of the Wan family?" Wan Tianlin asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I neither want to follow you nor need the protection of your Wan family. I only need some treasures. As long as you have these treasures, the Blood Heart Fruit will be yours." Xu Yan handed over the prepared list.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin raised an eyebrow, quite surprised. How could mere treasures compare to the value of following him? How could they compare to the value of gaining the Wan family's protection? With the Wan family as a backer, why worry about lacking treasures?</p><p></p><p>However, since the other party needed treasures, it was actually a good thing. This transaction would be much simpler.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, no prob-" Wan Tianlin took the list and was about to agree, but when he saw the treasures on the list, he stopped.</p><p></p><p>His brows furrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want these treasures?" He looked up at Xu Yan with a frown.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Xu Yan nodded, but seeing that Wan Tianlin seemed to have some difficulty, he added, "They don't have to be complete. Even if you can gather 50%, that would be fine."</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin looked at the list and pondered for a while before saying, "To be honest, I can only gather about 10% of the treasures you need right now, as the treasures you require are somewhat special."</p><p></p><p>"10% is too little. 50%, no less than 50%, or no deal!" Xu Yan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>The value of the Blood Heart Fruit was higher than 50% of the treasures on his list. It's just that the treasures he needed were more focused on certain effects and might be relatively scarce in the Nine Mountains Realm, not that their value was too high.</p><p></p><p>"50% will take time to collect. Can other items be substituted? For example, an Immortal Realm cultivation technique," Wan Tianlin said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"No need for cultivation techniques. With your Wan family's capabilities, gathering 50% shouldn't be difficult, right?" Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin frowned and said, "Give me the Blood Heart Fruit. Once I gather the treasures, I'll have someone deliver them to you. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, "Face-to-face transaction, no debts owed either way. Otherwise, forget it."</p><p></p><p>"You don't trust me, Wan Tianlin? Or is it that you don't trust the credibility of my Wan family?" Wan Tianlin's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly, not minding the other's change in attitude at all. From the moment Wan Tianlin appeared, he noticed that this was a very proud person, even arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a transaction, what's trust got to do with it? If you can't produce the items, then this deal is off. I'll find someone who can bring out things to trade."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked directly at Wan Tianlin as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have people gather 80% of what you need, but I urgently need the Blood Heart Fruit now. Give me the Blood Heart Fruit first, and the items will definitely be delivered to you in full. How about that?" Wan Tianlin took a deep breath and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"That's not impossible. Make a martial oath then," Xu Yan said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"Never has anyone dared to ask me, Wan Tianlin, to swear an oath. You're testing my patience. Do you know the consequences?" Wan Tianlin's expression grew colder.</p><p></p><p>"Don't tell me you're planning to just take it by force?" Xu Yan took out a Blood Heart Fruit and held it in his hand, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin stared at the Blood Heart Fruit in his hand, seemingly afraid that he might destroy it in one move. He took a deep breath and said, "Three days later, I'll gather the items!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin turned and left. Xu Yan watched his departing figure, then looked up at the sky, muttering to himself: "Should I leave now, or wait to offend the Wan family?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was a bit hesitant.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Wan Tianlin's attitude, he probably wouldn't trade normally, but was preparing to make a dirty move.</p><p></p><p>However, fearing that he might destroy the Blood Heart Fruit, retreating now was just a delaying tactic.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan now needed to consider whether to leave directly, no longer thinking about trading with Wan Tianlin, thus avoiding conflict with the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>Or stay, and if Wan Tianlin really tried to snatch it, he naturally wouldn't take a beating without fighting back, which would inevitably offend the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>"Either don't make a move, or if I do, I'll definitely scatter my enemies to the winds. If I kill Wan Tianlin, how could the Wan family let it go?"</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, the Blood Heart Fruit isn't only tradeable with the Wan family. There's no need to invite unnecessary trouble."</p><p></p><p>After careful consideration, Xu Yan decided to leave, seeing no need to waste time on Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Thousand Fold Mountain. By the way, find a place to consume the Blood Heart Fruit and comprehend the Small Heavenly Eye."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wasn't afraid of offending the Wan family, but there was no need to waste time entangling with them. He finally decided to call off this transaction.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Jade Bamboo Slope, Xu Yan briefly oriented himself before setting off towards the Thousand Fold Mountain region.</p><p></p><p>"Strive to obtain enough treasures early, accumulate sufficient foundation, and break through to the Divine Phase Realm as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was full of anticipation. After this breakthrough and transformation, what special physique would he obtain? A Saint Body?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, two powerful auras descended, one on the left and one on the right, with cold light flashing, attacking him.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

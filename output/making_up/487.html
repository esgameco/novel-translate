        <h1>Chapter 487</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Since you've all come, today I'll explain some doubts about martial arts for you," Li Xuan said with a gentle smile, looking at everyone present.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior!" Everyone was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor had also just walked over with Wu Tiannan and the others. At this moment, he was extremely excited, having seized another opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was attending to Li Xuan by his side. As a maid, she naturally didn't need to ask about cultivation doubts at this time, since she had plenty of opportunities to ask. This was the advantage of being a personal maid! Cai Ling'er felt wise about her decision back then!</p><p></p><p>The happiest of all was old man Xiao. He actually had a chance to consult the Dao Ancestor! Of course, he didn't step forward to ask first. He decided to stay until the end to ask the Dao Ancestor about his martial arts doubts. After all, among those asking questions, he had the highest realm and strongest power.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue took small steps over and stood cutely behind Xu Yan, curiously and secretly observing Xu Yan's master. </p><p></p><p>Too powerful! She felt that even her grandfather might be far from a match.</p><p></p><p>This being the case, she would no longer be able to escape Xu Yan's control, truly becoming a dragon subdued by him.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue pondered what she should ask about. Her true dragon clan had innate dragon techniques, born with them rather than cultivating like martial artists. Even if they cultivated, the methods for strengthening the true dragon clan were different from humans.</p><p></p><p>"Should I ask how to avoid being subdued as a dragon?" Ao Yuxue felt that if she asked this question, she probably wouldn't get an answer. </p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Yan's dragon subduing technique was taught by his master. How could she ask his master how to avoid being subdued?</p><p></p><p>"So, what question should I seize the opportunity to ask?" Ao Yuxue frowned, racking her brains.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and asked, "Who has martial arts questions?"</p><p></p><p>"My strength is the weakest, so I'll ask the senior first," Yue Changming stepped forward and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Yue Changming was about to break through to the Immortal realm. His martial arts doubts could be easily answered.</p><p></p><p>Among those present, only old man Xiao's doubts had some depth, but Li Xuan could still answer them easily.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm, the more profound the answers should be, letting them comprehend on their own!</p><p></p><p>This was Li Xuan's thinking!</p><p></p><p>After instructing Yue Changming, it was Feng Yan's turn.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's doubts were about divine abilities. After Li Xuan's guidance, Feng Yan's divine ability that had long been unable to break through suddenly broke through. He was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor then raised his own confusion, and Li Xuan gave guidance one by one.</p><p></p><p>Among the crowd, Zi Yun, Du Yuying, and Yun Miaomiao didn't raise any doubts. Li Xuan wasn't surprised by this - they were saving their doubts to ask their love interests.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Wu Tiannan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I feel my luck is somewhat unusual, and I have some doubts!" Wu Tiannan asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Old man Xiao immediately became interested. He was also curious about Wu Tiannan's luck, suspecting it was related to the Dao Ancestor, since Wu Tiannan had received guidance from the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "You carry the luck of this world and are protected by it. Naturally you can turn danger into safety and cultivate with ease."</p><p></p><p>Carrying the luck of the world? Protected by the luck of the world?</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was surprised. How could Wu Tiannan be so favored by the world?</p><p></p><p>Weren't Xu Yan and the other four more likely to be favored by the world? After all, they were truly the world's prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what's going on?" Wu Tiannan was also puzzled and said, "Although I've turned danger into safety in the Inner Realm and Spirit Realm, I didn't feel such strong luck. Otherwise, the Martial Dao Academy wouldn't have fallen back then."</p><p></p><p>"Your inner luck was only truly activated after entering the Divine Realm, and your martial arts also improved. Naturally you have this luck now. In a sense, you can be considered a child of fortune.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the world is changing greatly, it's also your opportunity to rise. The Supreme realm is not out of reach for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present was surprised. Since the senior said so, it meant that Wu Tiannan cultivating to the Supreme realm was a certainty.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through the Supreme bottleneck to become a Realm Lord or Small World Lord is also a good opportunity for you, though of course this doesn't depend on you alone," Li Xuan added.</p><p></p><p>Old man Xiao was shocked. Wu Tiannan had a chance to become a Realm Lord or even a Small World Lord?</p><p></p><p>Was it because of the world's luck on him?</p><p></p><p>The Supreme realm was already truly top-tier in the Taicang world. Realm Lords were at the pinnacle of the world, and there weren't many in the entire Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>To break through to the Realm Lord level or even become a Small World Lord was not so simple. Without tremendous opportunity or prodigious talent, it was absolutely impossible to break through.</p><p></p><p>While Wu Tiannan's talent was not bad, it wasn't to the level of a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>In fact, if not for carrying the world's luck, based on talent alone, Wu Tiannan would probably peak at the Divine Sovereign realm.</p><p></p><p>Old man Xiao could hardly resist asking why Wu Tiannan had a good chance of breaking through to Realm Lord or even Small World Lord.</p><p></p><p>But in the end he held back, not wanting to leave even a slightly bad impression on the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>So even though he was as curious as a cat scratching, he could only silently endure.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where does my luck come from?" Wu Tiannan himself was also very surprised and said with an incredulous look.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled and said, "Your martial arts guide!"</p><p></p><p>When this was said, everyone became curious.</p><p></p><p>Old man Xiao also knew that Wu Tiannan had been looking for someone, his martial arts guide. He had wanted to ask about it, but old man Xiao thought how could the person Wu Tiannan was looking for possibly be someone he knew?</p><p></p><p>So he hadn't paid attention to it.</p><p></p><p>Now, he suddenly had a strong premonition that the person Wu Tiannan was looking for was likely someone from the Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>Who exactly had such ability? Some figures flashed through old man Xiao's mind, but none had the ability to bestow world luck on Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be him?" At one point, old man Xiao thought of that guy locked up somewhere by Master Taicang.</p><p></p><p>Besides him, there seemed to be no one else with such ability.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others knew that Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide was a woman. Wu Tiannan had been looking for her all along. They didn't expect his martial arts guide to have such ability. If she was so powerful, why was she injured and fell to the Inner Realm back then?</p><p></p><p>"Is it sister?" Wu Tiannan said with surprise and shock, then hurriedly added, "Senior, do you know where my sister is?"</p><p></p><p>When old man Xiao heard this, he became confused again.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide was female, so it obviously couldn't be that guy.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who could it be?" </p><p></p><p>Images of various powerful women flashed through his mind, but none seemed to possess this ability.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed up at the sky and said with a smile, "When the time is right, you'll naturally get to meet her!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was shocked. His martial arts guide and sister was actually in the Dao Realm?</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao's heart was racing. He wracked his brains but couldn't think of anyone who fit the description of Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide and had the ability to bestow heavenly fortune.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to speak up, but felt it would be impolite to interject and might displease the Dao Ancestor. He felt quite uncomfortable holding back.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked over at him and said with a light laugh, "Just say whatever you want to say."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao had been holding it in painfully.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior." </p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was extremely excited as he said, "This junior has some doubts. Within this world, and being a female martial artist, I don't know of anyone with such abilities. I'd like to ask the senior to enlighten me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "It's understandable you have such doubts. It's because his heavenly fortune was bestowed by a certain supreme treasure, not an ability the bestower inherently possesses."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Old Xiao was stunned for a moment, then two figures appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Only the ruler of heaven and earth could forge a treasure capable of bestowing heavenly fortune on others. Undoubtedly, whoever possessed such a treasure must have an intimate relationship with Master Tai Cang. </p><p></p><p>Among the many female martial artists, only two currently had this possibility.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be her?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao became lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"This junior understands now!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's heart was racing. Old Xiao was from the Dao Realm - did he know his sister?</p><p></p><p>However, now was not the time to ask. He could only temporarily suppress the urge in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan resolved Wu Tiannan's doubts, then gave him some guidance on martial arts cultivation, especially regarding divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Wu Tiannan, Xin Mengrou respectfully bowed and said, "Please give me some guidance as well, senior."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou practiced the Way of Dreams. Previously when he had given her some profound and mysterious guidance, Xin Mengrou had gained some insights. But now, Xin Mengrou had clearly received more instruction and obtained a more complete method of the Way of Dreams.</p><p></p><p>However, there were still some issues.</p><p></p><p>For example, the technique of "True as Illusion" was similar to an illusion technique, yet transcended illusions, forging a unique path of dreams.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was no longer the same as before. Now with just a glance, he could see through the problems within.</p><p></p><p>"The enemy is a dream, the self is a dream. One thought creates the dream, one thought destroys the dream. Transform the enemy into a dream - when the dream vanishes, the enemy naturally vanishes. Transform the self into a dream - intangible as a dream, naturally unaffected by the enemy's disturbance..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled lightly, and with his first words gave profound and meaningful guidance. Then he pointed out some deficiencies in her Way of Dreams, as well as methods to remedy and strengthen it.</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks to the senior for pointing out the way!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Then, she hesitated, as if she had something else to say.</p><p></p><p>"If you have any questions, feel free to ask!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this junior received guidance from Ancestor Tai Miao to truly enter the Way of Dreams, but Ancestor Tai Miao also has some troubles, and once asked this junior to seek advice from you on her behalf..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever questions there are, just speak plainly."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Tai Miao?</p><p></p><p>One of Tai Cang's followers, ruler of a minor world, with strength incomparable to ordinary realm lords.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao pondered. Tai Miao had fallen into self-contradiction and conflict, causing constant internal strife and even mutual killing within the Tai Miao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that she had emerged from her self-contradiction?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou took a deep breath and said, "Ancestor Tai Miao cultivates two great techniques - one called the Tai Miao Dream Way, and one called the Tai Miao Supreme Way. The Dream Way is ethereal and elusive, hard to grasp. The Supreme Way is domineering, looking down on all under heaven. But ever since experiencing a certain great battle, the Ancestor has fallen into conflict between the two..."</p><p></p><p>Tai Miao cultivated the Dream Way and the Supreme Way. One was dreamy and ethereal, illusory and changeable, difficult to capture. The other was unrivaled in its dominance, looking down on all under heaven, fully displaying the pride of a supreme being! The differences between these two martial paths caused her to fall into self-contradiction. Simply put, she had fallen into martial arts conflict, and could even be said to have gone astray!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the cause of all this was related to the great battle Tai Miao had experienced, creating this mental knot, or even a heart demon.</p><p></p><p>That battle was clearly the fight between Tai Cang and the strong cultivators of the Unmelting Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor said that during the great battle, she felt powerless, unable to save her friend, or even help her friend in any way. She felt that the Dream Way could create illusions to confuse the enemy - if it had been strong enough back then, perhaps she could have helped her friend."</p><p></p><p>"But the Ancestor also felt that the Supreme Way was unrivaled in killing power, with stronger combat ability. If the Supreme Way had been stronger, she should have been able to assist her friend and block many attacks..."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou said softly.</p><p></p><p>This was the source of Tai Miao's contradiction, and also her mental knot.</p><p></p><p>That battle back then caused her to fall into self-contradiction, feeling that if the Dream Way had been stronger, she could have created illusions to confuse the enemy, giving her friend a chance to counterattack or even escape.</p><p></p><p>But at the same time, she felt that if the Supreme Way had been strong enough, with its unrivaled combat power, she could have directly blocked more attacks for her friend, and they could have joined forces - perhaps even achieving final victory.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that she fell into self-contradiction between the Dream Way and the Supreme Way.</p><p></p><p>This was both a conflict in her martial arts and a mental knot. And that friend was likely Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao listened quietly, his expression rather complex.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is the Ancestor's problem. Please give some guidance."</p><p></p><p>After finishing her explanation, Xin Mengrou bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The reason Tai Miao made this request was because of what Xin Mengrou had said - that there was a profoundly mysterious senior who had once given her guidance, causing her Dream Way to change somewhat, taking a small step towards her own unique path of dreams.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Tai Miao asked her to seek advice on her behalf.</p><p></p><p>The root cause was that Tai Miao had been troubled for a long time, unable to resolve her mental knot. Although her self-contradiction had weakened and she had begun to smooth out the conflict between the Dream Way and the Supreme Way, she still hadn't solved this problem.</p><p></p><p>Given her level of power, the fact that she asked Xin Mengrou to seek advice on her behalf was, in a sense, an attitude of "trying anything, even if it seems hopeless."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't answer immediately, but looked at Old Xiao and said, "Do you have anything you want to say?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao sighed and said, "Senior, Tai Miao's contradiction stems from that battle back then, but the root cause still lies with Master Tai Cang."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, Old Xiao continued, "The Dream Way and the Supreme Way were both taught by Master Tai Cang. This is Tai Miao's path, and her feelings for Master Tai Cang are extremely deep..."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao sighed wistfully and said respectfully, "She has been trapped in self-contradiction for a very, very long time. I hope the Dao Ancestor can resolve her confusion."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

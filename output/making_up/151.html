        <h1>Chapter 151</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The originally severed place had been leveled, and a man in a black robe was sitting cross-legged on top of it.</p><p></p><p>Under the big tree, on both sides of the stone cave, six men in black robes stood, relaxed and without any vigilance. They seemed to be communicating with each other.</p><p></p><p>With a grand master sitting guard, it was not necessary for these master warriors to be on alert.</p><p></p><p>The grand master sitting cross-legged on the tree was a mid-level grand master, a powerful existence among the grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not defeat a grand master at the peak, he could still manage to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Without the lure of huge benefits, the other grand masters would not rashly make a move, as it would be unwise to become enemies with peers of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if there were huge benefits to be had, it would be different. And here at Iron Hammer Mountain, although it was a spiritual herb treasure land, outsiders did not know about it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, ordinary spiritual herb treasure lands were not worth becoming enemies with grand masters over.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe sitting cross-legged on the tree had the same attire as the previous two grand masters, the only difference being a white leaf embroidered on the chest of his robe.</p><p></p><p>A slender white leaf, like a willow leaf.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others did not conceal their tracks at all, flying directly over, completely unafraid of any powerful experts guarding the spiritual herb treasure land.</p><p></p><p>The grand master in the black robe opened his eyes and said in a deep voice, "Someone has come!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men on both sides of the stone cave suddenly became alert, gripping their curved knives and becoming vigilant.</p><p></p><p>If a grand master were to attack, the moment they could not resist, they would first break open the stone cave and forcefully enter the spiritual herb treasure land. Even if the spiritual herbs were damaged, it would be better than letting others have them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately saw the black-robed man standing on the half-broken tree.</p><p></p><p>A grand master expert! And an even stronger grand master at that! "Elder brother, that grand master seems to be even stronger!" Meng Shushu swallowed hard, nervously saying.</p><p></p><p>The strength of grand masters varies. Those who broke through to grand master in one go, relying solely on their own talent and foundation, are ultimately much stronger than those who slowly accumulated spiritual herbs and gradually broke through to become half-step grand masters.</p><p></p><p>And the grand master on the tree in front of them was obviously one who had broken through to grand master in one go, relying on his own talent and foundation. His strength was not something the two dead ones could compare to.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man standing there seemed to exude a powerful aura of authority.</p><p></p><p>Not an entry-level grand master, but a mid-level grand master! Xu Yan was not afraid at all, but instead showed an excited expression, praising, "How wonderful, the stronger the power, the higher the status, and the richer they are. This is another windfall!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu twitched at the corner of his mouth, he had worried in vain! In Xu Yan's eyes, that was just a walking money bag! "Shidi, after dealing with those few people, make sure they don't damage the spiritual herb treasure land."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked towards the six black-robed men on both sides of the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, one slash per person, just six slashes in total."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded excitedly. After being chased for so long, he could finally vent.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said nothing. These two master-disciple pairs were all ruthless people, and both were terrifyingly strong.</p><p></p><p>In their eyes, grand masters and masters were like big cabbages, which they could casually slay.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, who are you to interfere in this matter?" The black-robed man's aura surged, the might of a grand master like a heavenly power, rippling towards them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's dragon palm intent was activated, blocking the other's aura, and he calmly said, "I am the Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal Cliff?" The black-robed man frowned.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that he was a powerful practitioner of the Sword Dao, he immediately thought of Sword Immortal Cliff, but the name Sword God Xu Yan was completely unfamiliar to him.</p><p></p><p>And the title of "Sword God" was rather presumptuous, even Xie Tianheng did not dare to call himself that.</p><p></p><p>"Not at all!" Xu Yan shook his head, his gaze falling on the willow leaf-like white leaf embroidered on the other's chest, perhaps he could find the identity of the black-robed man's faction from this mark.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, which faction do you belong to? Reveal your name!" Xu Yan asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"If you wish to interfere in this matter, you may want to think twice about whether you can offend a peak grand master!" The black-robed man evaded the question and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Peak grand master? Xu Yan was not at all flustered. Even if he could not defeat a peak grand master, they could not harm him either. And when he broke through to the Transcendent Realm, what would a peak grand master be to him? A single sword strike would kill them.</p><p></p><p>Since the other party was unwilling to reveal their faction, there was no need to waste words.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drew his sword, saying, "Something that hides its head and shows its tail, not even daring to let people know its name, what right does it have to try to intimidate me with a peak grand master?" Today, I will slay you!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was enraged, holding a curved knife and flying up, "Let's see how you plan to kill me!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The moment Xu Yan and the black-robed man clashed, Meng Chong and Meng Shushu had already charged towards the stone cave.</p><p></p><p>The six master warriors in black robes had no intention of fleeing, after all, there were only two of them, while they were six, the advantage was on their side.</p><p></p><p>"Kill them!" The six black-robed men wielding curved knives charged forward.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's steps slowed down, following behind Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even need to get involved.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Blade light flashed, the tyrannical blade intent sweeping across the world.</p><p></p><p>One slash, and a black-robed man fell!</p><p></p><p>"No!" The remaining black-robed men were horrified.</p><p></p><p>This was too terrifying, one slash had killed one of their own, how could they withstand a few more slashes from him? Wanting to flee was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong slashed one after another, six slashes, and the six master warriors were all killed.</p><p></p><p>After killing them, Meng Chong excitedly searched the bodies, taking their money bags, and then his blade intent swept across, directly grinding the corpses into ash.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!" An angry roar came from the air.</p><p></p><p>The grand master was shocked, his six master warriors had been killed like big cabbages by that bald reckless man, one slash after another, without any resistance at all! Those were master warriors, and cultivating one required a lot of resources. Those who became masters must have extraordinary talents!</p><p></p><p>"How dare you be distracted in front of me?" Xu Yan sneered, the other party obviously thought the deaths were not fast enough. Roar! The mountain and river dragon roar, the sword intent enveloping, the mountains and rivers collapsing, the golden dragon coiling.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, it was another sword - the Sword of the Myriad Worlds and the Multitude of Lives!</p><p></p><p>"No!" The black-robed grand master was horrified, hastily gathering his focus. In his hand, the curved knife suddenly shattered, unleashing a terrifying light.</p><p></p><p>He must escape! He felt the terrifying death crisis descending!</p><p></p><p>He decisively unleashed a secret martial art, the knife shattering, triggering a powerful strike, trying to break through the other's attack and flee.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow raised, a martial art secret technique? This was the first time he had encountered a practitioner of martial art secret techniques, and a mid-level grand master at that.</p><p></p><p>Martial art secret techniques were extremely rare in the Inner Realm, only existing in some powerful factions with deep foundations.</p><p></p><p>Especially powerful martial art secret techniques...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The secret martial arts techniques can only be possessed by the top powerful forces. Although the Seven Star Academy seems to have many secret martial arts techniques, the ones that can truly be cultivated by martial artists are actually not that many.</p><p></p><p>Not all secret martial arts techniques can be cultivated, nor are all of them capable of unleashing powerful combat abilities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to successfully cultivate secret martial arts techniques, one needs to have the innate talent as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Even more, they need to be compatible with one's own cultivation technique, without any conflicts.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, secret martial arts techniques are inherited within the lineage of the force they belong to, so that there will be no conflicts or unsuitability for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The secret martial arts techniques of the Seven Star Academy are quite messy, with all kinds of them. Students who want to cultivate secret martial arts techniques need to find the ones that are compatible with their own techniques.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary martial arts students usually have no chance to get in touch with them.</p><p></p><p>"What about the secret martial arts techniques? Can you escape from them?" Xu Yan sneered. He did not think highly of the secret martial arts techniques in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Most secret martial arts techniques require harsh conditions to unleash, and they will also damage the cultivator's own body. The power they can unleash is not that impressive in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The enhancement is not that significant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out a sword, and in an instant, mountains and rivers overlapped, with a golden dragon coiling, as if eighteen golden giant dragons were wielding the mountains and rivers, instantly covering down.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe burst out with dazzling light and powerful aura, trying to shatter the sword intent of the mountains and rivers with a single strike. However, the mountains and rivers were overwhelming, and in an instant, multiple figures wielding swords slashed out, enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>"No..."</p><p></p><p>The grand master in the black robe looked terrified, unable to believe it, but he could no longer make a sound.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>His head cracked open, and his entire body began to disintegrate. The black robe shattered, and a bag fell down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed the bag, sneering, "If I didn't worry about damaging my money bag, you wouldn't have lived this long. Did you really think you could escape by using secret techniques?"</p><p></p><p>The figure in the black robe continued to disintegrate until it turned into ashes and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily opened the bag, and inside were a stack of spirit tickets, each worth ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>There were nearly thirty of them.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad, worthy of a grand master, another windfall!" Xu Yan said with a hint of regret.</p><p></p><p>The force the black-robed person belonged to seemed to be quite wealthy. Xu Yan didn't know where their headquarters were, and he really wanted to raid them and get a big fortune.</p><p></p><p>"This force has a peak grand master, and there might be more than one. With my current strength, it would be a bit difficult to raid their headquarters," Xu Yan thought.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, once I break through to the Innate Realm Perfection, or even the Profound Realm, I can go raid their headquarters. As long as my shijie (sworn sister) returns to the inner domain, I'm sure they won't stay hidden. Whenever they show up, I'll find their headquarters!"</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the stone cave, Xu Yan looked expectant, "Is this the entrance to the spiritual herb treasure ground?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Meng Shushu nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked in his heart. That was a mid-stage grand master, yet he was still easily defeated by a few sword strikes. Xu Yan's strength was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>But then he became joyful again. Although he owed a lot, having such a powerful backer seemed to be worth it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go in!" Xu Yan waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>Entering the stone cave, the walls were mottled, and there was no visible door. </p><p></p><p>There was only a small round hole on the side of the wall.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu took out a key, which was a small hammer, and inserted it into the round hole. He turned the handle, and with a click, the hammer head opened and seemed to be locked into a slot in the hole.</p><p></p><p>He turned it forcefully, and a series of clicking sounds could be heard. The stone wall shook, and dust kept falling. At one point, there was a thud, as if something had been moved.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu pushed the stone wall, and with a rumbling sound, it opened inward, with a faint light coming from inside.</p><p></p><p>"The door is open!" Meng Shushu flicked his fingers, and a few streams of force shot into the passage, seemingly probing something.</p><p></p><p>He then excitedly walked into the passage, with Xu Yan and Meng Chong following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>Looking up in the passage, Xu Yan noticed that the stone walls on the ceiling seemed to be pieced together. If they were to forcefully break through, the entire passage would instantly collapse.</p><p></p><p>"This construction is quite ingenious!" Xu Yan praised.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu excitedly said, "I can confirm that this used to be a spiritual herb sect, where they cultivated spiritual herbs!"</p><p></p><p>The faint light ahead grew brighter and brighter. As they walked out of the passage, the three were amazed by the sight before them.</p><p></p><p>Even after a long time, the divided herb fields were still visible, each one planted with spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>Just as Meng Shushu had said, this used to be the site of a spiritual herb sect.</p><p></p><p>Beams of light were shining in from all directions, as well as from the cracks in the ceiling above.</p><p></p><p>"This mountain was artificially constructed," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, there were no visible human traces, but inside, the piecing together could be clearly seen. The construction was very ingenious, making it difficult for weaker martial artists to forcefully break in.</p><p></p><p>If martial artists at the grand master level or above were to forcefully break in, it would trigger a chain reaction, causing the entire Iron Hammer Mountain to collapse and destroy the spiritual herbs, leaving them with nothing.</p><p></p><p>"The worst ones here are still eighth-grade spiritual herbs!" Meng Shushu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Although the remaining spiritual herbs in each field were not many, the total amount across all the fields was still considerable.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual herbs planted within the mountain are usually those that prefer dark and shady environments. These are typically rarer and more difficult to find," Meng Shushu explained as he started digging up the spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>"For example, this Moonlight Bamboo, it grows in dark and shady places, with slender bamboo stalks no taller than three feet..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu pointed to a small bamboo plant in front of him and quickly dug up the Moonlight Bamboo.</p><p></p><p>It was the size of a baby's fist, half a foot long, with a white bamboo sheath covering it. As soon as it was dug up, a faint fragrance of bamboo and wood filled the air.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, you are a spiritual herb explorer, so you know how to properly dig and preserve the spiritual herbs. Tell us how to dig and preserve them," Xu Yan and Meng Chong excitedly joined in the herb harvesting.</p><p></p><p>Most of these spiritual herbs were on Su Ling's spiritual herb list.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

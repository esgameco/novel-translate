        <h1>Chapter 162</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan has already comprehended the Tong Xuan technique, it's time for him to find an opportunity to pass on the techniques that are even higher than Tong Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Let him know in advance, perhaps he can comprehend them earlier?</p><p></p><p>The cultivation above Tong Xuan, the fourth realm of the Martial Dao, Li Xuan has almost finished compiling it, and it can be well connected to the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's prodigious talent, comprehending it should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes slightly, his consciousness sinking, he wanted to check the origin of the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>Now that he has reached the Tong Xuan realm, his strength has further improved, and he should try again to see if he can see his own Golden Finger and what it is.</p><p></p><p>As his consciousness sank, before the Innate Realm, the Golden Finger that he had no perception of, now he could actually see a faint golden light.</p><p></p><p>But that's all.</p><p></p><p>Apart from this faint golden light, he could not see any other outline.</p><p></p><p>He still could not see what the Golden Finger looked like.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a breath, this is a good sign.</p><p></p><p>The reason he cannot see the Golden Finger now is because his strength is still too low to use it efficiently.</p><p></p><p>As his realm improves, he believes he will soon be able to see the full appearance of the Golden Finger and how to use it efficiently.</p><p></p><p>"In the Tong Xuan realm, I cannot see the Golden Finger, but I have touched upon it and can see a little golden light, it seems my guess was correct.</p><p></p><p>"If this is truly the case, then in the realm above Tong Xuan, the fourth realm of the Martial Dao, I should be able to see the Golden Finger, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he also sighed, the triggering conditions for this Golden Finger are really too harsh.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even after triggering the Golden Finger, he still cannot see it, let alone use it.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for Xu Yan coming to the small village and becoming my disciple, and then cultivating the Martial Dao that I randomly made up, I might still be hiding in the small village now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed deeply in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This Golden Finger is a bit of a trap, the triggering conditions are so harsh, and there are also requirements for the cultivation realm to be able to see the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, everything is still going smoothly!</p><p></p><p>As long as he follows the plan and completes the fourth realm of the Martial Dao, when Xu Yan comprehends it and enters the fourth realm, he should be able to see the Golden Finger.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what uses this Golden Finger has, and what role it can play in creating the subsequent Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered secretly.</p><p></p><p>He can foresee that the Golden Finger must be related to the creation of the Martial Dao, but whether it can improve the efficiency of compiling the Martial Dao techniques is unknown.</p><p></p><p>"The fourth realm of the Martial Dao, it will still take some time. Even if I pass on the techniques I've compiled to Xu Yan, and he comprehends them, it will still take some time.</p><p></p><p>"I should wait until Xu Yan breaks through the Tong Xuan realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has already reached the peak of the Innate Realm, he's not far from perfection. With the help of the medicinal pills, he should be able to break through the Innate Realm soon, but..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of Meng Chong. Although he is taking the Golden Body Pill, Meng Chong is currently only using the Golden Body Pill to nourish the Golden Body Aperture, which is a process of consolidating the foundation.</p><p></p><p>He has not rushed to improve the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Even so, his strength has increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong does not rely on the medicinal pills, but uses them to nourish the Golden Body Aperture and continuously consolidate his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Since Meng Chong is like this, it seems Xu Yan will also be the same, these two will not try to quickly improve their cultivation through medicinal pills, but use the pills to consolidate their foundation, and then break through the realms naturally.</p><p></p><p>They are suppressing their own realms and accumulating their own foundation.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu cultivates the Pill Dao Martial Dao, taking medicinal pills will not affect her foundation, but will instead promote the improvement of her cultivation. The strength of the Long-Lived Bone is also revealed at this time.</p><p></p><p>However, the Pill Dao Martial Dao is ultimately not known for its powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's strength is not as strong as Xu Yan and Meng Chong, but it is still not weak, and it can still crush the inner domain martial artists of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>That guy Shi Er has taken too many medicinal pills, making his strength appear unstable, and he has been busy recently refining his own martial dao foundation.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Zhou Ying knows how to use medicinal pills reasonably, her foundation is solid, and she is not unstable at all. Her strength has also improved rapidly, and she has already caught up with Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>Even if Shi Er uses the saber technique that Meng Chong taught him, he still cannot defeat Zhou Ying, which makes him very helpless.</p><p></p><p>He can only temporarily stop taking medicinal pills and work hard to refine his own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The size of the Crimson Cat is visibly growing larger.</p><p></p><p>It hasn't had any problems from taking too many medicinal pills, but instead it is becoming more and more powerful, faintly showing signs of becoming a great demon.</p><p></p><p>That huge body contains extremely powerful vital energy, and its physical body is becoming stronger and stronger, its strength is almost comparable to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>The ordinary sect masters in the inner domain may not be able to subdue it.</p><p></p><p>"Could this big cat really be cultivating into a great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>This big Crimson Cat has even learned to act cute, often wandering around Su Ling Xiu, acting cute and begging, truly becoming a big cat.</p><p></p><p>Whenever Su Ling Xiu is happy, she rewards it with a complete medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Crimson Cat's size growing bigger and bigger every day, in the end the gates of the manor were not even big enough for it to go in and out, so it could only lie outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you think the Crimson Cat is really cultivating the way of the great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu asked, after feeding the Crimson Cat a medicinal pill and running over.</p><p></p><p>"Not yet!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>If the Crimson Cat had really succeeded in cultivating the way of the great demon, the Golden Finger should have given him some feedback.</p><p></p><p>Although the Crimson Cat's size is growing, it is still far from cultivating the way of the great demon.</p><p></p><p>"When the Crimson Cat can freely shrink its body size, it will be about to enter the realm of the great demon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you mean that when the Crimson Cat can shrink its body size, it will be about to enter the realm of the great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu found it unbelievable. The Crimson Cat's body size is already so huge, normally it should be able to unleash powerful strength by increasing its size, how could it also be able to shrink?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Does that mean the Crimson Cat can turn into the size of a small cat?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked expectant.</p><p></p><p>"If it has cultivated into a great demon, that would naturally not be a problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"That's great, if the Crimson Cat becomes small, it must be very cute!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Crimson Cat outside the manor, it's almost as big as a tiger now. If it can shrink its body size to the size of a cat, it would be a fat cat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan has returned.</p><p></p><p>Coming back with him are Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>The two large packages and one large box show that they have brought back a lot of things.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh, the storage bag is really precious, even the genius Xie Lingfeng from the Sword Saint Cliff doesn't have one.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan must have done quite well in the inner domain, but he still couldn't buy a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The idea of the fourth martial dao system surfaced in his mind again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put down the packages and respectfully greeted.</p><p></p><p>"Good, it's good that you're back!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very happy, his senior disciple is the core of his martial dao career after all.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan greeted.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan respectfully bowed and said, "It's Little Xie and Little Hu!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother!"Su Ling Xiu ran over excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The big brother has returned, and he's carrying a large bundle, which must be spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>With so many spiritual herbs, she really doesn't lack any medicinal materials or ingredients for refining pills.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sister!" Xu Yan showed a smile.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng looked at Su Ling Xiu, the graceful and extraordinary young lady, who had a pure and intelligent aura about her, and couldn't help but sigh, "She must be another prodigy." Otherwise, how could she have caught the eye of the senior?</p><p></p><p>"Little Sister, I've bought back all the spiritual herbs on your list."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan lightly patted the two large bags of spiritual herbs and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>When he went to the inner domain, he said he would bring back a large bag of spiritual herbs, and he finally fulfilled his promise.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Big Brother!" Su Ling Xiu's jade-like face blushed, and her eyes shone brightly like stars.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong has also returned.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Brother and Hu Shan have also come!" he greeted Xie Ling Feng and Hu Shan cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng, upon seeing him, couldn't help but recall the rumor that once circulated in the inner domain about him being bald...</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, who are these?" Su Ling Xiu looked at Xie Ling Feng and Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Little Sister, let me introduce them to you. This is Xie Ling Feng, and this is Hu Shan, the Sword Veneration Cliff's!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan introduced them to Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"So you are Xie Ling Feng?" Su Ling Xiu was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"This is my little sister, Su Ling Xiu!" Xu Yan introduced her to Xie Ling Feng and the others.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pleasure to meet Miss Su Ling Xiu. I am Xie Ling Feng," Xie Ling Feng said, somewhat surprised. Could it be that Su Ling Xiu actually knows about him?</p><p></p><p>It's impossible for there to be any rumors about him in the remote border region.</p><p></p><p>"The renowned Sword Veneration Cliff's number one sword dao prodigy, one of the three youngest grand masters in the inner domain, Xie Ling Feng, I didn't expect you to know my brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng's reputation as a prodigy was well-known throughout the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Upon meeting him today, he indeed proved to be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he was still far inferior to her own brother.</p><p></p><p>"You know me?" Xie Ling Feng was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Su Ling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng suddenly remembered, the person the black-robed man was looking for, wasn't it Su Ling Xiu?</p><p></p><p>"Are you from the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I fled to the border region, but fortunately I encountered my master. Hehe, I'm quite powerful now, it won't be long before you won't be my match!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu raised her little head proudly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng had an envious expression.</p><p></p><p>To be accepted as a disciple by a senior, that was such great fortune, such a huge opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is the Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea." Xu Yan opened the box and placed a jar of Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea on the table.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, not bad," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was greatly excited. Spiritual tea, he had never tasted it before.</p><p></p><p>Thanks to his disciple, he can finally savor the spiritual tea.</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea, isn't this a specialty of the Du Marquis Manor?" Su Ling Xiu was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Master, let me brew the tea for you!" Zhou Ying had already brought the teapot, cups, and water over to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu opened the jade jar, took out the Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea, and placed it in the teapot. Her palm's blood qi transformed into a cinnabar fire, boiling the water and then infusing it into the teapot.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, a pure fragrance permeated the air, sinking into one's heart and soul.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the tea is ready." Su Ling Xiu poured a cup of tea for Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a sip, and he immediately fell in love with this spiritual tea. Inwardly, he marveled, "It's truly a spiritual tea." After drinking it, ordinary tea would no longer be palatable.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad," Li Xuan said calmly on the surface, as if the spiritual tea was nothing extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was very happy to see that his master liked it.</p><p></p><p>"The Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea's production is still decent, in the future I should get some from Miss Du to offer to the master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng felt a bit ashamed, he actually forgot to bring some specialty products from Sword Veneration Cliff to offer to the senior, which was improper.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the box, the spiritual tea was not just one jar, he could drink it for a while.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, you've just returned from the inner domain, take some time to relax and spend time with your family, bring some inner domain specialties back for your parents."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed to the Cloud Mist Spiritual Tea and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master, I understand." Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although he was eager to go home and see his parents, he didn't immediately set out this time.</p><p></p><p>In the manor, the atmosphere was harmonious. After Xu Yan returned, the three siblings chatted for a long time, and Su Ling Xiu also became familiar with Xie Ling Feng.</p><p></p><p>As Hu Shan was no longer a young man, he mingled with Zhou Ying and Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>One day later.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu started refining pills in the furnace, preparing medicinal pills for Xu Yan to bring back home.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, you brought back sixth and seventh-grade spiritual herbs, I've improved the Rejuvenation Pill formula, this Rejuvenation Pill, after taking it, one's appearance will never age again."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu began refining the pills while speaking.</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful!" Xu Yan was delighted, his mother would surely love it.</p><p></p><p>"In addition to preventing aging, it can also improve one's constitution."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu carefully divided a sixth-grade spiritual herb into two halves, sealing the unused half again.</p><p></p><p>The Rejuvenation Pill being refined this time used higher-grade spiritual herbs, so the effect would naturally be stronger, and it would have additional effects beyond just preventing aging.</p><p></p><p>Xie Ling Feng and Hu Shan stared with wide eyes, watching from the side.</p><p></p><p>So this is the art of pill refining?</p><p></p><p>Medicinal pills, truly wondrous and miraculous, possessing the profound power to create heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The two of them had eaten a pill yesterday, and immediately realized the miraculous nature of medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Especially Hu Shan, he originally had a martial dao inner qi that had not yet fully condensed into true qi. After eating a Qi-Nourishing Pill yesterday, he quickly fully condensed it into true qi.</p><p></p><p>In the entire inner domain, there was no such miraculous medicine.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the inner domain's decoctions and pills, they were truly just trash!</p><p></p><p>They were completely wasting the spiritual herbs!</p><p></p><p>The two of them had their horizons greatly expanded, and they now looked down on the inner domain's decoctions and pills, even if they were made with sixth-grade spiritual herbs, they were considered trash.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's expression was serious, not daring to be distracted at all. This was the first time she was refining the Rejuvenation Pill, and the spiritual herbs used were not low-grade. If it failed, the loss would not be small.</p><p></p><p>Even though the spiritual herbs were plentiful, they couldn't be wasted like that.</p><p></p><p>After all, these were the spiritual herbs that Big Brother had painstakingly collected.</p><p></p><p>The pill furnace was rotating on Su Ling Xiu's palm, the blood qi transformed into a cinnabar fire, burning fiercely. As the refinement progressed, her spiritual energy and mental focus were being consumed, and fine beads of sweat appeared on her delicate white forehead.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others didn't dare to make a sound, afraid of disturbing her.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Finally, the cinnabar fire grew smaller and smaller, Su Ling Xiu struck the pill furnace, the lid opened, and twelve medicinal pills flew out.</p><p></p><p>Jade-white and glowing with a faint luster, the fragrance of the pills lingered in the air.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 90</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 90 The Old Fox, the Furious King of Wu</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, okay!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and then said, "You can find some books on topics like novels, miscellaneous records, and medical and mystical arts to pass the time."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, my fellow disciple has gone to the Wu Kingdom, and I'd also like to return to the Eastern River Prefecture for a while."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had gone to the Wu Kingdom to cause trouble for the King of Wu, so he could not continue verifying the insights of the Bagua with Xu Yan. Xu Yan planned to return home to use his sword intent to help his parents accelerate the bone refining process.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead," Li Xuan agreed with a nod.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Shi Er brought some books. These were treasured texts from the Heavenly Mother Sect, containing records of jianghu techniques, including some medical books.</p><p></p><p>In the afternoon, Xu Yan also had books delivered.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan first flipped through the medical books, trying to understand the medical systems of the border regions and the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"No acupuncture points, no sovereign-minister-assistant-envoy usage of medicines..." </p><p></p><p>After browsing a few medical books, Li Xuan felt that the new branch of the martial dao he had envisioned was increasingly feasible. Once successful, it would overturn the martial dao of this world.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I just need to continue perfecting the theory and find a disciple to comprehend it with me," Li Xuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Tianping Mountain was named for its broad and flat summit.</p><p></p><p>The top martial artists of the Wu Kingdom gathered for a jianghu conference, aiming to capture Meng Chong and claim the reward from the King of Wu.</p><p></p><p>The renowned jianghu experts all showed up, vying for the position of the alliance leader to lead the Wu Kingdom's martial artists to the Qi Kingdom and capture Meng Chong, earning the title of Jianghu Marquis.</p><p></p><p>From then on, these jianghu figures would have a respectable identity. Moreover, they would be granted a county as a fief, establishing a jianghu foundation.</p><p></p><p>Those who came to the Tianping Mountain conference were all top-tier jianghu experts. That day, the figures of the jianghu world kept appearing at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that Senior Iron? He's also here!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior Iron, the unparalleled expert of our Wu Kingdom twenty years ago, has long since retired. Unexpectedly, even he has come."</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this is the position of Jianghu Marquis. Who wouldn't be tempted?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, whoever seizes the position of alliance leader will become the leader of this generation of the jianghu world and be enfeoffed as Jianghu Marquis!"</p><p></p><p>Many jianghu figures sighed with envy, their faces full of admiration. They regretted that their own strength was insufficient to participate in the contest for the alliance leader.</p><p></p><p>Only the jianghu's supreme experts were qualified to compete for the position of alliance leader.</p><p></p><p>On the Tianping Mountain, the jianghu heroes gathered, hundreds of Wu Kingdom's renowned experts, all assembled here. Among them were those who were mutually hostile or had grudges. However, this time, they came for the position of the jianghu alliance leader. They did not immediately fight to the death, but were instead plotting that once they seized the position of alliance leader, they would be the first to order the jianghu crowd to eliminate their enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Please invite our Wu Kingdom's venerable Senior Wu to preside over the jianghu conference!"</p><p></p><p>A jianghu expert bellowed in a thunderous voice.</p><p></p><p>On the high platform, an old man with a hunched back, extremely aged, was assisted to sit on a chair.</p><p></p><p>"It's Senior Wu!" </p><p></p><p>The jianghu figures below the platform whispered to each other.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Wu must be close to a hundred years old, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, only Senior Wu has the qualifications to preside over this."</p><p></p><p>The jianghu figures sighed in admiration, not expecting that this jianghu conference would be presided over by Senior Wu.</p><p></p><p>He was a true jianghu elder. Although he was old and his strength was long gone, his prestige in the Wu Kingdom's jianghu was unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Senior Wu had five direct disciples, all of whom were supreme experts, and one of his disciples was even a high-ranking internal expert in the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace. In addition to his disciples, he also had three supreme expert granddisciples.</p><p></p><p>This showed Senior Wu's status in the Wu Kingdom's jianghu.</p><p></p><p>"The contest for the alliance leader position depends on both strength and moral character. Both are indispensable. Poor moral character will bring disaster to the jianghu, and insufficient strength cannot uphold the reputation of our Wu Kingdom's jianghu," Senior Wu said solemnly, laying down the conditions for the contest.</p><p></p><p>"I presume no one present objects to these conditions?" </p><p></p><p>The crowd of jianghu figures unanimously expressed their support for Senior Wu's rules.</p><p></p><p>"The contest for the alliance leader should be restrained, without damaging the harmony, lest it harm the strength of our Wu Kingdom's jianghu," Senior Wu continued.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a touch of mockery, he said, "This old man has recently heard that the jianghu fellows of the Qi Kingdom are busy looking for some expert to learn the true martial dao. What a joke.</p><p></p><p>"The fictional stories and the biographies written by sour scholars, some people even believe in them!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of jianghu figures burst into laughter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I've also heard about this. "</p><p></p><p>"The brains of the Qi people must not be working well. It's certainly some swindlers propagating this."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, after this conference is over, let's go and thoroughly despise the jianghu fellows of the Qi Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>On the Tianping Mountain, the jianghu figures were cheerful.</p><p></p><p>Senior Wu tapped his cane on the ground and said, "Now, the contest for the alliance leader begins. Who will be the first to step forward?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous voice resounded across the Tianping Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"I will!"</p><p></p><p>A figure, as if descending from the heavens, appeared on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong set out from Cloud Mountain County and finally arrived at the foot of the Tianping Mountain. He looked up at the Tianping Mountain, but could no longer see the jianghu figures at the foot of the mountain. The conference had probably already begun.</p><p></p><p>He got off his horse, about to climb the mountain, when he suddenly paused.</p><p></p><p>He looked around and then at the horse beside him.</p><p></p><p>"I'll tie the horse at the foot of the mountain, in case someone steals it while I'm up there. Although it's not valuable, it's my fellow disciple's horse."</p><p></p><p>There were many thieves and scoundrels in the jianghu, and if he went up the mountain and someone came and stole the horse, it would be embarrassing for Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the steep path up the mountain and felt that it would be difficult to ride the horse up.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head and suddenly had an idea. </p><p></p><p>He looked at the horse beside him, then bent down and hoisted the horse onto his shoulders, and began to climb the mountain.</p><p></p><p>The horse: How exciting, I'm being ridden by a person again!</p><p></p><p>On the Tianping Mountain, Meng Chong, carrying the horse, appeared on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Kingdom's jianghu experts all widened their eyes in astonishment, completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They saw the mighty and heroic young man on the high platform, carrying a horse as if descending from the heavens.</p><p></p><p>The Senior Wu sitting on the high platform was startled, almost losing his breath, his face flushed red, and the hand gripping his cane was trembling.</p><p></p><p>Where did this horse-carrying young man come from?</p><p></p><p>It scared the old man to death!</p><p></p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, Senior Wu angrily said, "Where did you come from, little fellow? Do you not know the rules? Announce your name!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked around and sneered, "I am Meng Chong, the one you all want to capture. I, Meng Chong, am right here. Whoever wants to capture me, come on up!"</p><p></p><p>"After I've beaten all you weaklings, I'll go find the King of Wu to claim the reward!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>The jianghu experts were all shocked. Many of them were having second thoughts.</p><p></p><p>This mighty and heroic horse-carrying young man clearly had formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Meng Chong!" Senior Wu exclaimed joyfully, "Whoever captures Meng Chong will be the alliance leader. Go get him!"</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and then, with his cane, quickly hobbled away, lest he get caught in the aftermath.</p><p></p><p>"Go!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A group of top experts looked at each other and stepped forward.</p><p></p><p>"I've got him!" </p><p></p><p>One expert quickly embraced Meng Chong, trying to subdue him, but it was as if he was hugging a huge mountain and couldn't budge him at all.</p><p></p><p>"Take this!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! </p><p></p><p>A meteor dart shot towards Meng Chong's shoulder armor, aiming to pierce through his shoulder blade and completely subdue him!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The meteor dart hit Meng Chong but just fell straight down without even leaving a scratch.</p><p></p><p>"Let's all attack together!"</p><p></p><p>The group of jianghu experts swarmed towards him. Meng Chong stood there holding the horse, letting the experts come at him with all their best techniques. In the end, some tried to grab his legs, others tried to pull his arms, their faces turning red from the effort, using all their strength.</p><p></p><p>They were like a human wall surrounding and engulfing Meng Chong. Even the horse he was holding was jumped on by someone, almost completely buried by the human wall.</p><p></p><p>From afar, Elder Wu, the old fox, was greatly shocked by this sight. This young man carrying the horse was truly majestic and powerful!</p><p></p><p>It's not safe to linger here! As an experienced jianghu person, how could he have lived to this age by being careless?</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, quickly leave!" He called out to his disciple beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" His disciple also sensed something was off, so he bent down and carried Elder Wu, quickly fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the high platform collapsed. </p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura of brilliant jade-like golden light erupted, sweeping in all directions.</p><p></p><p>One by one, figures were blasted away from the center of the platform, falling down from the sky like dumplings.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, how can he be so strong!" </p><p>"It's over, I think my ribs are broken!"</p><p>"What, your ribs are broken? Great, now I can finally get revenge, you old thief, bring it on!"</p><p>"..."</p><p></p><p>On Mount Tianping, the jianghu experts were scattered all over, and some even discovered their sworn enemies were severely injured, presenting a rare opportunity, so they pounced to kill their enemies.</p><p></p><p>More jianghu experts were shocked, staring at the young man carrying the horse, his terrifying aura like a divine being descended from the heavens. The brilliant jade-like golden light even made the horse look extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial arts is this?"</p><p>"How can there be such a powerful expert in this world?"</p><p>"Could it be the legendary high master from Qi?"</p><p>"Why doesn't my Wu Kingdom have one?"</p><p></p><p>The jianghu experts were stunned and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked down at the experts sprawled around, not even bothering with those trying to take revenge on their enemies. His gaze was cold and sharp as he said, "Anyone else who wants to capture me, Meng Chong, feel free to come at me!"</p><p></p><p>Silence. No one dared to speak up.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Alliance Master's token?" Meng Chong asked next.</p><p></p><p>With the token, he could naturally go to the Wu Emperor and claim the jianghu lordship.</p><p></p><p>He did things in a principled manner, needing to convince the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"It's... it's with Elder Wu!" Someone finally replied in a small voice.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong swept his gaze over - that old man had run away.</p><p></p><p>"That old fox!"</p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly, leapt up while carrying the horse, and swiftly departed down the mountain.</p><p></p><p>Halfway down, he saw a bronze token stuck in a large tree.</p><p></p><p>The corner of his mouth twitched - that old guy from Wu, to have lived this long, it was not without reason. Even when Meng Chong was learning martial arts in Wu, he knew of this renowned jianghu figure, truly an old fox with exceptional eyesight.</p><p></p><p>"That old guy!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong reached out and pulled the Alliance Master's token, then released the horse after descending the mountain. He then set off directly towards the capital of Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>On Mount Tianping, the group of jianghu experts painfully got up, still shaken.</p><p></p><p>They almost died!</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I finally got my revenge!"</p><p>"Meng Chong, what a good person!"</p><p>"Bastard, daring to kill my master, I'm not done with you!"</p><p></p><p>On Mount Tianping, it was a mess. More jianghu experts were deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Is there truly a high master in this world?</p><p></p><p>The unparalleled martial arts of the Qi people, were they real after all, not just fabricated by swindlers?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital of Wu Kingdom, the Wu Emperor was in a foul mood, cooped up in the palace, almost making himself sick.</p><p></p><p>However, every time he wanted to go on an inspection tour, he was blocked by the ministers.</p><p></p><p>The ministers weren't doing well either. They carefully selected the palace guards and servants, afraid of letting in people like Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Even relatives and clan members they were not on good terms with directly submitted memorials to the Emperor, declaring they were severing all ties.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, when traveling, the escorts and carriages or palanquins had to be made extra sturdy, lest they be pierced by arrows and the Emperor be killed.</p><p></p><p>Even in the capital, every time he attended court, he was filled with dread, afraid that an assassin would suddenly charge out and sacrifice themselves for revenge.</p><p></p><p>When did his days become so difficult?</p><p></p><p>It all started from that bastard Meng Chong's assassination attempt on the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>What's even more infuriating is how the Wu Emperor's own guards let Meng Chong escape!</p><p></p><p>Recently, there were rumors that something major had happened in Qi Kingdom. The new Grand Chancellor, the Crown Prince's teacher, the brother-sworn of the Qi Emperor, Guo Rongshan's external grandson, was a powerful martial arts expert. He single-handedly subdued the entire Qi army.</p><p></p><p>The ministers of Wu Kingdom naturally did not believe it.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that the Qi Emperor is incompetent, being manipulated by Guo Rongshan, using this as an excuse."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that Guo Rongshan's grandson, what's his name, has been obsessed with novels and biographies since he was young, wandering around looking for high masters, they say he even has a brain illness."</p><p></p><p>"Guo Rongshan is truly formidable, quietly taking control of the Qi court, even the Qi Emperor has to heed his words."</p><p></p><p>"Be careful what you say! If our Emperor becomes suspicious because of this, our days will be even harder!"</p><p></p><p>The ministers of Wu Kingdom were whispering among themselves before the court session began.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor ascended the throne with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Has Meng Chong been captured?"</p><p></p><p>This was the first thing he said at the court session.</p><p></p><p>The Minister of Justice reluctantly replied, "Your Majesty, the jianghu experts have gathered at Mount Tianping, hoping to capture Meng Chong soon."</p><p></p><p>"You are all useless! The reputation of my Wu Kingdom has been completely ruined!</p><p></p><p>"A reward of 100,000 taels of gold, a 3,000-year-old ginseng, and 10 precious herbs, such a generous reward, yet you still cannot capture Meng Chong! What use are you all to me!"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor erupted in rage.</p><p></p><p>The ministers lowered their heads, silent. This was a familiar scene at every court session - they would wait for the Emperor to vent before they could start the actual discussions.</p><p></p><p>They were used to it!</p><p></p><p>"Why aren't you all speaking? Have you all gone mute?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor roared.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please take care of your health!"</p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty, your health is the most important!"</p><p></p><p>The ministers hurriedly spoke up, their attitude somewhat perfunctory.</p><p></p><p>It was like going through the motions.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was not the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Other than this, you useless bunch, what else can you say? I want Meng Chong captured and brought back!"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor slammed the table and shouted.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Emperor, I'm here. Is the reward ready?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice came from outside the main hall.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

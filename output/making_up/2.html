        <h1>Chapter 2</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 2: Fabricating Cultivation Techniques on the Spot</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Xu Yan pays respects to the Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited and immediately knelt down with a thud, respectfully kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, you may rise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently reached out and closed the box containing the gifts for becoming a disciple, his expression solemn, putting on the air of a strict teacher.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to deceive anyone, but Xu Yan had given him too much.</p><p></p><p>He had accepted the disciple, but as for imparting cultivation techniques?</p><p></p><p>There were none!</p><p></p><p>But no matter, he would just fabricate some.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reckoned that in his previous life, he had also been a failed online novel author, so making up a set of cultivation techniques wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>Judging from Xu Yan's seemingly not-too-bright demeanor, he likely wouldn't be able to discern the authenticity of the techniques.</p><p></p><p>And as for not being able to cultivate and break through?</p><p></p><p>That would certainly not be an issue with the techniques, but rather an issue with his aptitude.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly stood up, eagerly looking at Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when will you impart the cultivation techniques to me?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's expectant gaze, Li Xuan clasped his hands behind his back, putting on an air of profundity as he slowly spoke, "I have provisionally accepted you as my disciple, but if within a year you are unable to make a breakthrough in cultivation, then it means we are not destined as master and disciple, and you must not bother me further in the future, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled, and he took a deep breath before solemnly replying, "I understand! Master, rest assured that if I am unable to make a breakthrough within a year, it is due to my own poor aptitude, and I will not blame the Master. I will then give up on this path and no longer disturb your secluded cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt quite pleased. His disciple had such understanding, which was truly wonderful.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention a year, even ten years or a hundred years, it would be impossible for him to make a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Before imparting the fabricated cultivation techniques to Xu Yan, Li Xuan needed to first understand the information about the outside world and the state of the martial arts in this world.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan mistakenly believed him to be a reclusive high-level expert who was unaware of the outside situation, it was only natural, so Li Xuan asked him directly.</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan appeared ignorant of the outside world, the more Xu Yan would believe that his master was an ancient reclusive monster with extraordinary cultivation, ageless and immortal. Of course, he would then tell Li Xuan everything without reservation.</p><p></p><p>After learning about the situation, Li Xuan had a general understanding.</p><p></p><p>The small mountain village was located within the Eastern River Commandery of the Qi Kingdom, which had been established for over a hundred years and was currently at the peak of its prosperity.</p><p></p><p>In the world, there were three major powers: the Qi Kingdom, the Wu Kingdom, and the Northern Barbarian Throne.</p><p></p><p>From Xu Yan's words, the martial arts in this world did not seem to be particularly advanced - there were no earth-shattering or sky-soaring abilities, and the strongest could only run along rooftops, leap several meters, and lift thousands of catties.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan himself, since childhood he had been obsessed with some fictional tales and legends, aspiring to seek out a high-level expert to learn unparalleled divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he had a bit of a reputation in the Eastern River Commandery, but not a good one - people said the young master of the Xu family was not too bright, actually believing in those fictional stories and seeking out reclusive experts to learn martial arts!</p><p></p><p>After understanding the information about the outside world, Li Xuan felt a bit disappointed - this world did not seem to be a high-level martial arts world? There were no overwhelmingly powerful martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was also possible that Xu Yan simply had not been exposed to them.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the situation, it was not something Li Xuan could explore at the moment. After learning about the martial arts level in this world, he had a general idea of how to fabricate cultivation techniques to deceive Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Actual cultivation would be impossible, so he might as well just muddle through it. If Xu Yan was unable to make a breakthrough, it would be due to his poor aptitude, not because the techniques were flawed.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, Li Xuan spoke, "The key to the cultivation technique I will impart to you is in the 'enlightenment' - whether you can make a breakthrough or not depends on your aptitude and talent."</p><p></p><p>"I will give you a year's time. If you are unable to make a breakthrough within that year, then it means we are not destined as master and disciple, and you must not bother me further."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was both excited and apprehensive in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fearing that he would be unable to cultivate and enter the path, he took a deep breath and respectfully said, "Please, Master, impart your cultivation techniques to me. If I am unable to enter the path, it is because my virtuous blessings are insufficient!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan clasped his hands behind his back, slightly tilting his head up to look at the sky, and said in a slow and steady tone, "The way of martial arts is endless, but the beginning of cultivation is none other than refining the skin, refining the bones, refining the organs..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes were filled with excitement as he listened intently, afraid of missing a single word.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was recalling the settings of cultivation realms that he had fabricated when writing online novels in his previous life, and proceeded to refine and organize a relatively complete cultivation outline.</p><p></p><p>"The beginning of martial arts starts with sensing the flow of qi and blood. Only by sensing the qi and blood can one enter the stage of refining the skin. If one cannot even sense the qi and blood, then all of this is mere talk..."</p><p></p><p>"Refining the skin, as the name suggests, is to temper the skin membrane. Once the skin refinement is perfected, it will be incredibly tough and resilient. Ordinary people's knives and swords will have difficulty harming it, and at most, they will only leave a faint white mark on the body..."</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to fabricate it, he naturally had to exaggerate the power of martial arts, making it seem extraordinary. After the skin refinement is perfected, ordinary people's knives and swords will have difficulty harming it - isn't this impressive?</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's excited expression, Li Xuan knew that he had already successfully deceived him.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true essence of martial arts! Just by refining the skin, it has already made ordinary people's knives and swords unable to harm it. If one were to refine the bones and organs, how powerful would they become?"</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have finally found a hidden immortal master and learned the true martial arts. Once I have entered the path, let's see who dares to mock me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes were burning with fervor, and his heart was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Master, once the skin refinement is complete, does that mean I have entered the path?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Well, about that..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was about to nod and tell Xu Yan that skin refinement meant entering the path.</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, that might seem a bit too simple.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to continue deceiving him anyway, he might as well exaggerate it even more.</p><p></p><p>So, he said solemnly, "Of course not, entering the path. Refining the skin, refining the bones, refining the organs - these are merely the foundations of martial arts, not even reaching the level of entering the path!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was shocked in his heart: "Refining the skin has already made knives and swords unable to harm me, then refining the bones and organs must be even more powerful beyond measure. This is not even considered entering the path, but only the foundations of martial arts? Then how powerful would one become after truly entering the path?"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xu Yan was filled with a burning desire and longing for entering the path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how does one achieve the level of entering the path?"</p><p></p><p>"To enter the path of martial arts, you must first perfect the refinement of your organs, have your qi and blood circulating through the entire body, and undergo a minor physical transformation, with your tendons and bones rumbling with thunder, and your qi and blood surging like a fierce storm. Only then can you be considered to have entered the path."</p><p></p><p>"Master, what about the levels of attainment after entering the path? How powerful would one become at the minor and grand accomplishments?"</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the path of martial arts is divided into realms. After entering the path, when your qi and blood soar high into the heavens, burning with the intensity of fire, able to repel evil spirits and boil the seas, that would be the grand accomplishment..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to fabricate on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened with growing excitement, eagerly waiting to ask more, but Li Xuan waved his hand to interrupt him, saying, "Enough, you haven't even entered the path yet. Don't ask too much. You must be patient and calm in your cultivation, for being impulsive and restless is detrimental to your progress!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan hurriedly responded with reverence.</p><p></p><p>"Good." Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction, not because he didn't want to continue talking, but because he hadn't finished fabricating the subsequent stages of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The three stages of refining the skin, bones, and organs that he had just made up were already sufficient to deceive Xu Yan. It wouldn't be possible for Xu Yan to truly cultivate to the level of skin refinement, let alone entering the path, even in ten or twenty years.</p>

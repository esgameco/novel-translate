        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The fifth martial art path, Li Xuan had no clue about it for now, so he had to put it aside for the time being. He looked at the 11th page of the Tao Cang Book and sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that after the 10th page of the Tao Cang Book, there would be even higher-level natural laws of the heavens and earth. But the result exceeded his expectations.</p><p></p><p>After memorizing the patterns on the 10th page, it took him five years to completely memorize the patterns on the 11th page.</p><p></p><p>The patterns were profound and difficult to memorize, as if they were constantly changing, yet also eternally constant.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know how long it would take to thoroughly comprehend the Tao Cang Book. The person who can depict and record it must be incredibly powerful."</p><p></p><p>Whenever Li Xuan thought of the owner of the Tao Cang Book, he was deeply shocked. The other's strength was far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>"But one day, I will surpass you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of confidence. </p><p></p><p>Using the Tao Cang Book as a reference, the martial arts he compiled would eventually surpass the book's owner. He also had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He opened the Dao Jing Book and looked at the information provided on the 10th page of the Tao Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>The Tao Cang Dao Principles (partial): Establish the principles of the heavens and earth, comprehend the origin of the great Dao! The Dao Principles!</p><p></p><p>Starting from the 10th page of the Tao Cang Book were the Tao Cang Dao Principles, the foundation of the heavens and earth!</p><p></p><p>That was why, even with Li Xuan's current realm, memorizing the patterns on the 11th page was so difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Above the natural laws of the heavens and earth lie the Dao Principles of the heavens and earth, which are the core foundation, the essence of the heavens and earth. Transcending the Void Realm means not being bound by the natural laws of the heavens and earth, surpassing them, and forging one's own martial arts prowess.</p><p></p><p>"Then, above the Transcending the Void Realm, one must prepare for the Dao Principles, in order to reach the root of the great Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>He already had a vague idea of the realms beyond Transcending the Void Realm, and had a general conception.</p><p></p><p>On the Jinhe Lake, the Changqing Pavilion's flying boat was drifting on the water.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, the news of the Changqing Pavilion's arrival at the Jinhe Lake in the Dazezhou spread.</p><p></p><p>The injured martial art prodigies, as well as those with old injuries, damaged cultivation foundations, or even injured spirits, began to come to seek medical treatment.</p><p></p><p>These injured ones had already prepared the treatment fees, waiting for the Changqing Pavilion to appear before rushing over.</p><p></p><p>After wandering the Spirit Realm for so long, no one dared to cause trouble at the Changqing Pavilion, nor defy the Pavilion's rules. Even those who considered themselves powerful.</p><p></p><p>With martial artists coming to the Changqing Pavilion for treatment, the Pavilion became lively, but this was unrelated to Li Xuan. He was still sitting in the pavilion, studying the Dao Principles of the Tao Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Changqing Pavilion would stay at the Jinhe Lake for more than half a month before leaving for the next place.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu rarely appeared in person to treat patients anymore, unless it was a strange or extremely severe case, and the patient was not weak in strength, would she personally intervene.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the patients were treated by Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu Shu, or sometimes by Yue Er.</p><p></p><p>The improved diagnostic spirit tools could detect even the most serious injuries or hidden old wounds. According to the diagnosis, the appropriate medicinal pills would be provided.</p><p></p><p>Yue Er had already reached the peak of the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm, and her spirit was stronger than other peak Refining Spirit Celestial Realm martial artists, thanks to Su Ling Xiu's research on the spirit and her mastery of more effective spirit enhancement methods.</p><p></p><p>Yue Er, with her innate spiritual talent, had begun to prepare to refine the spiritual mechanisms of the heavens and earth into her spirit, stepping into the realm of the strongest in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>An extremely old man, leaning on a cane, came to the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at him, his brow furrowing, but he did not pay any attention.</p><p></p><p>There was a death aura hidden within the old man's body, which had been refined through a special secret technique, combining with the death energy as his lifespan was about to end.</p><p></p><p>It could only be used once, and after that, he would perish completely.</p><p></p><p>His spirit had already condensed the death aura, so this old man was obviously one of the death envoys of a certain transcendent sect.</p><p></p><p>As for why he came to the Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan did not care, as it would not cause any waves.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, your condition is rather unusual," Shi Er said, examining the old man with surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Can it be treated?" the old man asked in a hoarse voice.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, and your situation is too special. Even the diagnostic spirit tools can't detect it. Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>This kind of special patient could only be treated by Su Ling Xiu herself.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying notified Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Doctor Su, can this old man's illness be cured?" the old man asked anxiously and expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Your condition is unusual. Your lifespan is running out, and you need a longevity pill to extend your life. Plus, the death aura condensed within you needs to be purged.</p><p></p><p>"The treatment cost will not be low. I'll give you a list of the required materials. As long as you can obtain the items on the list, the treatment can cure you and extend your lifespan by a hundred years."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Really?" the old man exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Can my lifespan really be extended by a hundred years?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu handed him the treatment list and said, "Of course, it's just a matter of refining a longevity pill. This is a small problem."</p><p></p><p>"Wonderful, wonderful, this old man can live on!" The old man was overjoyed. In his excitement, the suppressed death aura seemed to lose control, causing his hands to turn a grayish-black. As he reached out to take the list, the death aura suddenly burst forth.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the old man's gaze turned cold and ruthless. The terrifying death aura poured out, forming ghostly claws that attacked Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>At such close range, with a sudden assault, the old man was confident he could severely injure her. Once the death aura entered her body, even if she was a divine doctor, she would inevitably die, at most only lingering for a short time.</p><p></p><p>However, to his shock, a faint blue light appeared around Su Ling Xiu as she sat there calmly. The death aura attacks kept dissipating as if they had met their nemesis.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" the old man exclaimed in horror.</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Thousand Martial Hall, or the Leiyu Mountain Sect?" Su Ling Xiu asked, as if she had anticipated this. She then shook her head, "The Leiyu Mountain Sect is unlikely. Then it must be the Thousand Martial Hall. In the past, one of their elders was injured by my disciple's formation and had his cultivation base severely damaged. He asked me to treat him, but I refused."</p><p></p><p>The old man's expression changed. So Su Ling Xiu's disciple was the one who had injured that Thousand Martial Hall elder?</p><p></p><p>At that moment, he saw Su Ling Xiu reach out and grab his head.</p><p></p><p>Poof! He felt his consciousness being pulled away, as if his spirit was being extracted. The death aura was also being drawn into Su Ling Xiu's palm. In the next instant, his mind collapsed and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>In Su Ling Xiu's hand appeared a ball of death aura.</p><p></p><p>"What a nice thing, I'll have to research how this death aura was refined," Su Ling Xiu said with a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>She handed the treatment task back to Shi Er and the others, and hurried back to the pavilion to study the death aura.</p><p></p><p>This assassination attempt did not cause any commotion, and Shi Er and the others did not mind, as it was a minor matter.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Dajiang State, on a perilous high mountain, Xu Yan stood on a large boulder, as if waiting for someone.</p><p></p><p>"This Dajiang State seems to be the burial ground of many, those ancient tombs..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The remaining spiritual souls were somewhat unusual. During the years in Dajiang State, Xu Yan's footprints had spread across various dangerous places, exploring some ancient tombs.</p><p></p><p>In some tombs, there were hidden remnant souls, but those remnant souls were somewhat unusual, as if they were not the spiritual souls of martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They contained a gloomy and ferocious aura.</p><p></p><p>Dajiang State once had a prominent family that excavated a large tomb in a certain great mountain, only to find a powerful corpse-devil inside, which nearly led to the downfall of that family.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happened to encounter it, was greatly shocked, and personally slew that corpse-devil.</p><p></p><p>Half a year ago, he encountered an unusual martial cultivator who was extremely powerful and enigmatic. Xu Yan eventually killed him, only to discover that the martial cultivator had been possessed by an unknown remnant soul that had occupied his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Why does Dajiang State feel like it's filled with tombs everywhere? It seems every great mountain is a tomb, with martial cultivators buried underneath."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Dajiang was chaotic and treacherous, with endless ambushes and assassinations, and the great mountains concealed unknown dangers. But in these past few years, Xu Yan's cultivation had risen greatly, and his insights into the Dao had reaped tremendous harvests.</p><p></p><p>He had now reached the peak of the Spirit Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if there's also a tomb underneath this great mountain?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the towering mountain he was standing on and murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just a step away from fully comprehending the Martial Dao of the Spiritual Manifestation Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke softly, as he was waiting for someone.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, he should be able to completely master the Martial Dao of the Spiritual Manifestation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Young Xu Yan, I've finally found you!"</p><p></p><p>A cold and murderous voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, "I've been waiting for you for a long time."</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder of the Thousand Martial Hall was taken aback, "You deliberately left a trail for me?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Saber Elder, this supreme expert of the Thousand Martial Hall, who had condensed the aura of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws, and not just a single strand.</p><p></p><p>"Are you seeking death, or are you so confident that you can escape from me?"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder swept his gaze around, his spiritual sense meticulously searching, but found no ambush.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to kill you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the saber in the Saber Elder's hand, which, although considered a divine artifact, was obviously not as powerful as the Frigid Severance Saber.</p><p></p><p>So, he took out the Frigid Severance Saber.</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed it to the Saber Elder and said, "Here, take back this saber for now. Come, let me witness the strength of you, the supreme expert of the Thousand Martial Hall."</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder frowned. Xu Yan had actually returned the Frigid Severance Saber to him? "If you're seeking death, then I'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>He gripped the Frigid Severance Saber, and the saber's brilliance surged towards the heavens, the chilling saber qi rippling in all directions. The divine artifact's might was now undoubtedly far beyond what Wu Yuan had possessed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was so confident, so the Saber Elder couldn't afford to be careless. After all, back at the entrance of the Thousand Martial Hall, Xu Yan had seemed arrogant, but in the end, he had proven that he had the foundation to back up his boldness.</p><p></p><p>These past few years, Xu Yan's strength must have risen further, which was why he was so self-assured.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder sneered inwardly. Xu Yan was simply too arrogant, did he really think that just because he wielded the divine Frigid Severance Saber, he could be compared to ordinary supreme experts?</p><p></p><p>"Come, attack!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and his Spirit Origin transformed into a sword in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder brought down a bone-chilling, unparalleled and fierce slash.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan thrust out his sword, and though it only briefly touched the blade, he soared into the air, evading the edge of the strike.</p><p></p><p>He carefully contemplated the power of the Saber Elder's slash and the process of him condensing the Heavenly and Earthly Laws.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The perilous mountain peak was instantly split in two by the saber light!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder held the saber, his aura surging, his body shrouded by three profound auras, as if he had merged with the Heavens and Earth. The mighty power of the Heavens and Earth continuously converged and infused into the Frigid Severance Saber.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Saber Elder was displaying the true strength of a supreme expert of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The fierce battle raged on, with mountains constantly collapsing and even turning into dust.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, meanwhile, thrust out sword after sword, like a small boat drifting amidst the raging waves, seemingly on the verge of capsizing at any moment.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder's gaze sharpened, inwardly shocked. Xu Yan appeared to be on the defensive, even showing signs of being beaten, but he had never truly fallen into danger.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the battle was within Xu Yan's control.</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, the Saber Elder's expression grew colder. He also gripped another divine artifact, a long saber, that he had brought with him.</p><p></p><p>Wielding both sabers, the mighty power of the Heavens and Earth transformed into saber light, enveloping the battlefield and surrounding Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are indeed strong, but you are too arrogant. Do you really think I became the Saber Elder of the Thousand Martial Hall the same way as ordinary supreme experts?"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder sneered.</p><p></p><p>A radiant light surged from within him, merging into the divine artifacts. The three profound auras seemed to have completely fused with the Heavens and Earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an even more powerful force of the Heavens and Earth was continuously flowing into the two divine sabers, multiplying their divine might.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the method of condensing the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws. It can only condense a little bit, and it's rather crude. Even after breaking through to the next realm, it would only be refining the Heavenly and Earthly Laws into one's body.</p><p></p><p>"Although able to utilize the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws, one is still under the Laws, not controlling the Laws for one's own use.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Manifestation Realm is about mastering the Heavenly and Earthly Laws as one's Martial Dao Manifestation, surpassing and controlling the Heavenly and Earthly Laws. I seem to have gained some understanding."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not at all concerned about the Saber Elder's attacks becoming more ferocious.</p><p></p><p>The image of mountains and rivers appeared, encompassing all the attacks and allowing Xu Yan to carefully contemplate and discern the cultivation direction of the Spiritual Realm martial dao, observing how the Saber Elder condensed the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws.</p><p></p><p>The battle grew increasingly intense, and Xu Yan still appeared like a small boat on the verge of capsizing, with the mountain river image he had conjured shattering repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>But he was completely unfazed.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder's attacks continued to intensify, as if the more the battle dragged on, the more the condensed power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws accumulated, causing the divine artifacts' might to rise continuously.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that when the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws reached a peak, it would be the true explosion.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, die!"</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the Saber Elder's gaze was as sharp as saber light, and his two sabers merged into one, suddenly slashing down.</p><p></p><p>In mid-air, the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws had accumulated to the limit, and with the downward slash of the two sabers, a terrifying saber light descended from the sky, intent on completely annihilating Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exhaled, having nearly fully comprehended the Martial Dao of the Spiritual Manifestation Realm.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The formless sword intent possessed a destructive power, transforming the mountains and rivers into a thunderous sword, falling silently.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder was horrified. He sensed an overwhelming life-and-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>The saber light was shattered by this sword strike, and before he could react, a faint breeze suddenly swept over him.</p><p></p><p>In that instant the breeze passed, he felt a terrifying killing intent, his spiritual sense shattering, his physical body disintegrating into fragments, his consciousness dissipating.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder of the Thousand Martial Hall perished!

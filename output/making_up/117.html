        <h1>Chapter 117</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 117: Xu Yan: I'm Too Poor</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion was ten zhang (about 33 meters) tall, divided into five floors, magnificent in its golden and jade splendor. In contrast, the nearby county government office looked extremely shabby, like a slum.</p><p></p><p>The open doors had two graceful-looking maidservants on each side, greeting every guest who entered with a smile. What shocked Xu Yan even more was that all four maidservants were Seventh-Grade Martial Cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Just the county-level Tianbao Pavilion has such grandeur. I can only imagine how magnificent the Tianbao Pavilion in the prefecture capital must be," Xu Yan sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>He stepped into the Tianbao Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"This way, young master," a maidservant gestured politely.</p><p></p><p>Entering the Tianbao Pavilion, Xu Yan looked around. A maidservant approached him with a smile, "Young master, what do you need? Let me introduce you."</p><p></p><p>As an experienced Tianbao Pavilion attendant, she could tell at a glance that Xu Yan was a newcomer, fresh out of the backwoods, visiting the Tianbao Pavilion for the first time.</p><p></p><p>So she promptly asked, "What do you have here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not hide his inexperienced appearance.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please come this way. This is the inventory list for the first floor of our Tianbao Pavilion," the maidservant led him to a counter and handed him a booklet.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flipped through it - various medicines, elixirs, weapons, cultivation techniques, all the necessities for martial cultivators. Reaching the last page, he didn't see any storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan closed the booklet and asked, "Do you have any storage bags?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant was stunned, staring at him as if he were a monster. The surrounding martial cultivators also turned to look, expressions of utter disbelief on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Storage bags? This young man actually wanted to buy a storage bag?</p><p></p><p>Many powerful forces and grand masters couldn't even afford one!</p><p></p><p>This ignorant young man!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan completely ignored their gazes, not the least bit embarrassed. He knew that when out in the world, one could be penniless, but must have a thick skin.</p><p></p><p>"W-we don't have any storage bags here," the maidservant stammered.</p><p></p><p>The one asking wasn't embarrassed, but the one answering was.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, I see," Xu Yan said, disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Even though he couldn't afford one, he still wanted to take a look. But they didn't have any!</p><p></p><p>How disappointing!</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's smile was forced. "Young master, is there anything else you need?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out five Spiritual Crystals, his entire savings, which Xie Lingfeng had gifted him earlier.</p><p></p><p>"I want to buy some elixirs."</p><p></p><p>After some thought, he named a Sixth-Grade Elixir, one that was on Suling Xiu's required list.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's face darkened. "Young master, we don't have any Sixth-Grade Elixirs here!"</p><p></p><p>Sixth-Grade Elixirs, how could he even think of that? In this tiny Iron Mountain County branch, there was no way they would have any!</p><p></p><p>The entire Iron Mountain County couldn't even afford them.</p><p></p><p>And how dare he casually take out five Spiritual Crystals to buy a Sixth-Grade Elixir?</p><p></p><p>"Then what about Seventh-Grade Elixirs?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked, disappointment evident.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's face grew even darker.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial cultivators had strange expressions on their faces. This young man was not only ignorant, but also had an extremely thick skin!</p><p></p><p>"Surely you have Ninth-Grade Elixirs?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed helplessly. Iron Mountain County was truly an impoverished place. Even this Tianbao Pavilion branch didn't have Seventh-Grade Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"We do have Ninth-Grade Elixirs," the maidservant's expression improved slightly. "May I ask which one the young master needs?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment. Among the Ninth-Grade Elixirs, there was one that was particularly precious, a key ingredient for refining the Longevity Elixir. "The Qingyuan Fruit."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant glanced at the five Spiritual Crystals on the counter and smiled, "Young master, the Qingyuan Fruit is 100 Spiritual Crystals."</p><p></p><p>"That expensive?" Xu Yan's eyes widened. "You're not cheating me, are you?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu had told him a lot, but never mentioned the general prices of various elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant replied impatiently, "Our Tianbao Pavilion has an impeccable reputation. We never cheat our customers, young or old!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan scratched his head, realizing for the first time how poor he was.</p><p></p><p>In the remote border regions, he felt rich, but now that he was in the Inner Realm, he found himself so poor that he couldn't even afford a single Qingyuan Fruit!</p><p></p><p>"Then tell me, what can I buy with these five Spiritual Crystals?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant flipped through the inventory list and said, "Young master, with these five Spiritual Crystals, you can buy one stalk of Water Spirit Grass or one stalk of Strengthening Bone Flower. Water Spirit Grass is three Spiritual Crystals per stalk, and Strengthening Bone Flower is five Spiritual Crystals per stalk."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was dumbfounded. Five Spiritual Crystals could only buy those two low-grade elixirs?</p><p></p><p>"That's it? Just these two?"</p><p></p><p>He asked, somewhat unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"Ninth-Grade low-grade elixirs are not limited to just these two types, but our Iron Mountain County branch only has these two in stock. Would the young master like to purchase either of them?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant asked politely.</p><p></p><p>"No, I won't buy them!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grabbed the Spiritual Crystals back from the counter, feeling very frustrated. "I'm too poor. I have to find a way to earn more Spiritual Crystals, or how will I buy elixirs to bring back? Without elixirs, how will my sworn sister refine pills? How will my father and mother cultivate and improve their strength?"</p><p></p><p>As for going to find the elixirs himself in remote places, that was not why he had come to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>After much thought, the only solution was to find a way to earn more Spiritual Crystals and directly purchase them.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, what a young punk, just out of the backwoods, knows nothing. Thinking he's rich with just five Spiritual Crystals," a burly man by the counter sneered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave him a sidelong glance. He was a Fifth-Grade Martial Cultivator, so Xu Yan lifted his chin haughtily. "At your age, and you're only a Fifth-Grade? What a waste!"</p><p></p><p>He wasn't going to let someone mock him without retaliation.</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p></p><p>The burly man's aura surged, his eyes turning cold and murderous, as if he wanted to pounce.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, this is the Tianbao Pavilion," the maidservant nearby reminded him calmly.</p><p></p><p>The burly man's body shuddered, quickly suppressing his aura. He glared at Xu Yan hatefully, "Kid, you better not leave the Tianbao Pavilion, or else..."</p><p></p><p>He then turned and walked away, clearly not willing to let this go.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, it seems you've offended someone," the maidservant in front of Xu Yan smiled and warned him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? And what if I've offended someone?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered thoughtfully. Had he perhaps found a convenient way to earn Spiritual Crystals?</p><p></p><p>"It could get you killed. Although fighting is officially prohibited in the county, but..."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Can I kill him?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked up and asked.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant was taken aback, looking at the young man with suspicion. Did he really intend to kill that burly Fifth-Grade Martial Cultivator?</p><p></p><p>That man was already considered a powerful figure in the Iron Mountain County area.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The other party was also a notorious martial artist in Tieshan County, who had killed people in the county city more than once, especially the outsiders without any background, whom he had ambushed and robbed.</p><p></p><p>As a maid of the Tianbaoge, although her status was not high in the Tianbaoge, she knew more about these news than most martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Before she could answer, Xu Yan muttered, "I've already scattered the ashes, so no one will know it was me who killed him, and there won't be any traces left!"</p><p></p><p>Maid: ...</p><p></p><p>Did she hear something she shouldn't have heard?</p><p></p><p>"Later, I might be able to buy the Qingyuan fruit with the spirit stones, just wait a bit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked out excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Was someone going to deliver the spirit stones to him?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a group of people came down from the Tianbaoge building, led by a woman wearing a veil, her face obscured, and a maid carrying a sword closely following her. Behind the woman were two men with cold expressions, their gaze sweeping over all the martial artists present, causing them to shudder.</p><p></p><p>Strong experts!</p><p></p><p>"Miss Du, I'm truly sorry, but the Tianbaoge in our Tieshan County does not have the spiritual medicine you need!"</p><p></p><p>The Tianbaoge master apologized sincerely.</p><p></p><p>The woman did not speak, but left the Tianbaoge directly. As she stepped out the door, she happened to see Xu Yan and smiled, slipping into a small alley.</p><p></p><p>The fifth-grade martial artist followed her into the alley with a cold expression.</p><p></p><p>In the alley, Xu Yan looked expectant, asking the man, "Do you have a hundred spirit stones on you?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man sneered, "You're quite bold, coming here to seek death. I'll grant your wish!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly rushed forward and threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and poked, and the man's eyes widened in terror, his mind frantically screaming, "You're a Grandmaster? Bullying a fifth-grade martial artist? Do you have no shame?!"</p><p></p><p>Slap!</p><p></p><p>The man died without closing his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan searched him and found a small bag containing only thirty spirit stones, his face immediately falling with disappointment.</p><p></p><p>"What a pauper, can't even afford a single Qingyuan fruit!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flicked his finger, and a stream of true qi surged out, instantly crushing the body into ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Inner Domain martial artists, their killing intent is so strong. No wonder Brother Xie said that if we encounter ill-intentioned people with malicious motives in the Inner Domain, we must act decisively and not hold back."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Collecting the spirit stones, he wore a worried and pensive expression. "Not enough a hundred spirit stones to buy the Qingyuan fruit, and I need quite a lot of spiritual medicines."</p><p></p><p>"If I have this kind of person coming to kill me every day, won't I be able to accumulate spirit stones quickly?"</p><p></p><p>As he came out of the alley, Xu Yan pondered where he should go next and how to earn spirit stones. As a martial artist in the Inner Domain, without spirit stones, it was difficult to get by.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, how troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly. Since he could remember, he had never worried about money, but on his first day in the Inner Domain, he was already worrying about it.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my master said I was poor. He had already seen through everything. Wealth and treasures don't mean being rich. I can't even afford a few spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the Tianbaoge, Xu Yan decided to leave Tieshan County and head to Lanping Prefecture, where there would be more opportunities to earn spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>The big cities were the true prosperous lands of the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, there's no body in the alley."</p><p></p><p>As the group from the Tianbaoge passed by the alley, the maid looked inside and exclaimed in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying looked up, suddenly pausing, as if realizing something. She looked at the retreating figure of Xu Yan, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, she gritted her teeth and made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, go catch up to that young master and tell him I want to make a deal with him."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er hesitated for a moment but did not ask for the reason, nodding and saying, "Yes, Miss."</p><p></p><p>She quickly went after Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took another look at the alley, taking a deep breath, as if seeing a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's as I've imagined."</p><p></p><p>She stepped forward, and the two men behind her remained vigilant, escorting the lady into a residence next to the county government office.</p><p></p><p>Soon, two carriages drove out, the front one with two guards on horseback on either side, while the rear carriage only had a coachman.</p><p></p><p>The caravan headed out of Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked on the main street, looking around at the passing martial artists. "This one looks like he has no money, and this one is as poor as me. Most of the martial artists in the Inner Domain seem to be poor!"</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please wait!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a clear voice came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned back and saw a woman carrying a sword hurrying towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Are you calling me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master, my mistress wants to make a deal with you."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er stopped and said.</p><p></p><p>She also examined Xu Yan, finding his appearance handsome, but couldn't tell the level of his martial arts cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Likely stronger than her.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, who is your mistress, and what kind of deal does she want to make with me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, inwardly becoming more alert.</p><p></p><p>As a newcomer, he couldn't be careless and get tricked.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, I don't know the details. Please come with me to see my mistress, and you'll know then."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, but in his heart, he was thinking, "If her mistress has malicious intentions, I can earn a good amount of spirit stones. If it's a legitimate deal, I can also earn some spirit stones."</p><p></p><p>"This maid is a fifth-grade martial artist, so her mistress must be of extraordinary status. It's best if she has malicious intentions, then I can make a big profit in spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan became energetic, as if a pile of spirit stones was waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er led Xu Yan back, and on the way, they encountered the caravan. Cui'er went forward and said, "Miss, I've brought the person."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the caravan. The two martial artists in front were second-grade, the four guards on the sides were third-grade, and the coachman in the rear carriage was first-grade.</p><p></p><p>But the real expert was in the rear carriage - a Grandmaster!</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed the person was injured, and the injury was not light. Against a first-grade martial artist, they would still have the upper hand, but facing a Grandmaster in their current state, they would be unable to cope.</p><p></p><p>The young lady in the carriage was also a third-grade martial artist, which was considered a genius in the Inner Domain at her age.</p><p></p><p>"Their identities are not simple, with a Grandmaster protecting them. Are they here for my healing elixirs? Impossible. I've never taken out the elixirs, and even if I showed them, they wouldn't know it's an elixir.</p><p></p><p>"Since they're not here for the elixirs, then why did they come to me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered this inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how the young master is addressed?"</p><p></p><p>The clear and melodious voice came from the carriage.</p><p></p><p>"Address is not important. Just tell me what kind of deal you want to make."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

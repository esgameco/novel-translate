        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, everyone was in a state of shock, unable to come back to their senses for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping shook his head and opened his hazy eyes. He discovered that the injuries on his body had completely healed, and his physical form had even strengthened somewhat.</p><p></p><p>"Did someone save me?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled. With his injuries, who could have saved him? His physical body had almost collapsed, each piece of flesh and blood was only held together by the power of his spirit. Once the spirit power was withdrawn, it would immediately fall apart.</p><p></p><p>With such terrible injuries, who could have saved him? Who would be willing to use precious heavenly materials to help him recover?</p><p></p><p>Did an Immortal Venerable save him?</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and looked up with blurry vision. He was shocked.</p><p></p><p>What was that? A giant standing between heaven and earth? No! That was not an ordinary giant, but a divine demon as vast as heaven and earth?!</p><p></p><p>"My spirit must be damaged too, to have such hallucinations for the first time. Has the Undissipating Qi finally started affecting my consciousness? Will I become muddleheaded and lose my mind like an animal? I'd rather die than that. I should just keep sleeping, everything will be fine if I sleep!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Jiang Buping's head drooped to one side as he withdrew his spirit power and fell into a deep slumber. </p><p></p><p>Standing between heaven and earth like a divine demon, with majestic divine might shaking in all directions - how could such a powerful being possibly exist? It must be an illusion, seeing a martial artist in such a form.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping felt some sadness in his heart. The Undissipating Qi had finally started affecting his consciousness. He really couldn't hold on any longer! He felt some reluctance! With this slight reluctance, Jiang Buping no longer forced himself to stay awake, but followed the feeling of drowsiness and fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>After the initial shock, Sui Hongwu was the first to come back to his senses.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Filled with excitement, Sui Hongwu suddenly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Sui Hongwu begs the great expert to save our Great Yue Nation!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Chu was dead.</p><p></p><p>But the turmoil in Great Yue Nation had not ceased, especially in the Great Yue Abyss, which was in the midst of a great battle. The Great Yue Emperor was tied up there, along with many powerful experts of Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>The other smaller abysses were also in danger of falling at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only the great expert before them could turn the tide and save Great Yue Nation! The abyss in Qiyun Prefecture had already fallen, although the Netherworld army inside had been led out by Blood Child Chu and annihilated.</p><p></p><p>But people must be sent quickly to guard it, to prevent new Netherworld martial artists from entering and infiltrating Qiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"We beg the great expert to save our Great Yue!"</p><p></p><p>The other two True King Venerables from Great Yue also hurriedly knelt down and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked over. Since he had already intervened once, what harm was there in doing so again?</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the Divine Realm was still limited, while the powerful experts of Great Yue Nation, especially the Great Yue Emperor, were more familiar with the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan, Meng Chong and Fang Hao seemed eager to go fight a battle in the abyss.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also knew that only in battle could Xu Yan and the others improve their martial arts more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, there were treasures in the abyss, even items unique to the Netherworld. For Xu Yan and the others who needed to accumulate foundation for each breakthrough to a new realm, this was the perfect place to gather and accumulate foundational items.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go," Li Xuan said.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was immediately overjoyed. "Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The crisis in Qiyun Prefecture had ended, so there was no need to go to Qiyun City. The flying ship turned around and flew towards the capital of Great Yue Nation.</p><p></p><p>Due to the long distance, even at full speed it would take some time to arrive.</p><p></p><p>However, since the crisis in Qiyun Prefecture had been resolved and the Blood Shadow Tower Lord was dead, the Great Yue Emperor and other powerful experts were sufficient to guard the abyss and prevent any major disasters, so there was no need to rush.</p><p></p><p>Although Blood Child Chu and his army of blood slaves had been eliminated, the abyss in Qiyun Prefecture had fallen. Now people needed to be arranged to guard it again.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu immediately ordered the two True King Venerables from Qiyun Prefecture to be responsible for guarding the abyss, and at the same time to pass on the news to the remaining True King Venerables in Qiyun Prefecture to deal with the aftermath of the crisis.</p><p></p><p>The traitorous True King Venerables also needed to be killed one by one.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Sui Hongwu apologized to Li Xuan, saying he needed to handle these matters personally, and Feng Yan would guide them instead.</p><p></p><p>With an Immortal Venerable taking action, the turmoil in Qiyun Prefecture would soon be quelled.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a stream of light, flying towards the capital of Great Yue Nation where the Netherworld abyss was located.</p><p></p><p>"This flying ship is a bit slow, and somewhat lacking," Fang Hao remarked with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Limited by the materials obtained in the Spirit Realm, the Evergreen Pavilion flying ship was ultimately somewhat lacking and not quite matched to their strength. It needed to be upgraded.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had come to the Divine Realm, they could naturally obtain various divine objects and materials, enough to upgrade the flying ship to an extremely high level.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, with the Immortal Venerable Feng Yan present, Xu Yan and the others were all asking Feng Yan about matters of the Divine Realm, as well as the various heavenly materials and earthly treasures possessed by the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, breaking through from the Divine Power realm to the Divine Form realm required an even greater accumulation, and needed more treasures of even higher grades.</p><p></p><p>It was imaginable that the further one progressed in cultivation, the rarer and more numerous the items needed to accumulate foundation would become. Preparations had to be made early.</p><p></p><p>Besides these, there were also matters concerning the abyss, especially whether there were unique treasures inside.</p><p></p><p>The secrets mastered by an Immortal Venerable expert were naturally far beyond what a True King Venerable like Cheng Zhan could compare to.</p><p></p><p>For example, Feng Yan knew much more about the Undissipating Abyss and Undissipating Qi.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quietly paying attention, obtaining more information about the Divine Realm and the abyss from Feng Yan's mouth, while pondering the fifth martial art, compiling the theory and methods of the fifth martial art.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan naturally held nothing back, after all these were the disciples of a great expert, obviously new to the Divine Realm and knowing little about it. This was also his opportunity to get closer to Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Only those who had faced a great expert directly could know how unfathomably deep they were!</p><p></p><p>"In the three great Netherworld abysses of the Qinghua Realm, there is a unique divine material called Blood Cloud Gold, formed by the permeation of Netherworld blood energy over long years.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Cloud Gold can not only be forged into divine artifacts, but also has a special property - it can be integrated into one's essence blood. After being incorporated into the blood, it has the effect of replenishing essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"It can even be nurtured with essence blood to become a divine artifact exclusive to oneself. However, Blood Cloud Gold is not easy to obtain and is also extremely difficult to mine.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Cloud Gold is found near the main camp of the Netherworld. The closer to the core area, the higher the grade of Blood Cloud Gold produced. Since Blood Cloud Gold is not very useful for Netherworld martial artists, it is not mined..."</p><p></p><p>As Feng Yan introduced it, Xu Yan and the others became more and more interested as they listened.</p><p></p><p>Blood Cloud Gold was undoubtedly an extraordinary treasure, especially its property of being able to be incorporated into the blood for nurturing. If it was refined, or fused into weapons nurtured by oneself, it would certainly yield great benefits.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Blood Cloud Gold was also one of the treasures that could accumulate one's own foundation.</p><p></p><p>They learned from Feng Yan that Blood Cloud Gold was not scarce in the three great abysses, but it was located in areas guarded by Netherworld Blood Children, making it difficult to enter and mine.</p><p></p><p>Only Immortal Venerables dared to venture in and hastily mine a piece.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that Blood Cloud Gold was an extremely rare treasure in the Qinghua Realm, as even Immortal Venerables did not dare to linger for too long.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Each time, only a limited quantity could be obtained.</p><p></p><p>As Feng Yan explained, Xu Yan and the others sighed inwardly. These Realm warriors were always so wasteful. Such rare and extraordinary treasures, and this was how they used them? It was too crude and simplistic, failing to bring out the treasures' full potential.</p><p></p><p>Besides Blood Cloud Gold, the Netherworld Abyss naturally contained other treasures as well. However, most of them were deep in the core of the Abyss, under the control of Netherworld warriors, and not easy to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others became more and more interested in the Netherworld Abyss. It was truly a land of treasures. If they wanted to accumulate resources, they could easily gather enough treasures by raiding a few Abysses.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan and the others' interest in Realm treasures, Feng Yan became generous. He took out his storage bag and retrieved some divine materials and herbs he was carrying.</p><p></p><p>"Come, young brothers, take whatever you like. Don't be polite with me!" Feng Yan said magnanimously, patting his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you're a mighty Immortal Venerable, yet you still use a storage bag?" Method Hao said in surprise, looking at the storage bag in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"My storage bag is not comparable to those of True Kings and Venerables. It's made from a higher grade Mountain-Swallowing Toad, with a much larger internal space," Feng Yan explained. As an Immortal Venerable, the storage bag he used was naturally not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I'll give you this storage ring. Storage bags are outdated," Method Hao said, taking out a storage ring and handing it to him.</p><p></p><p>"Storage ring?" Feng Yan was stunned. He took the ring and looked at it, muttering to himself that storage bags were outdated - what a joke! </p><p></p><p>Method Hao explained the storage ring to him. Feng Yan was half-believing, half-doubting. He probed it with his soul force and was immediately shocked.</p><p></p><p>Such a small storage ring, yet its internal space was even larger than his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying that by dripping blood here, it forms a seal that only the owner can open? Unless the seal is forcibly broken?" Feng Yan asked with a look of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. It's a simple sealing technique. Not only does it prevent theft, but even if you lose it, you can quickly sense its location," Method Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was rummaging through the pile of divine materials and herbs Feng Yan had poured out. These were all good stuff.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu could hardly take her eyes off the divine herbs.</p><p></p><p>Then, she saw a few small bottles, picked them up and opened them to look.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan, who was still amazed by the wonders of the storage ring, said, "These are pills made by refining various divine herbs. Even Immortal Venerables can recover from injuries and replenish their energy by taking them."</p><p></p><p>However, Su Lingxiu had a look of disdain and pain on her face. The herbs used in these pills were too precious. If she were to refine them into dans, the effects would be unimaginable, surely able to rapidly increase cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"You're wasting heavenly treasures! Such rare divine herbs, and you just made them into a few pills? They're not even as good as the Rebirth Dans I refined using divine-grade spirit herbs!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said painfully as she gathered all the remaining divine herbs to herself.</p><p></p><p>She then took out two bottles of dans and handed them to Feng Yan, saying, "These are for you. They're Rebirth Dans. Even Immortal Venerables can quickly recover from injuries after taking them.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, these are just made from divine-grade spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was dumbfounded. Made from divine-grade spirit herbs? What were dans? He skeptically opened a bottle and poured a dan into his palm. As soon as he saw it, his heart trembled. His instincts told him this dan had extraordinary effects.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan couldn't help but swallow the dan in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>"This... this... is really made from divine-grade spirit herbs, not superior divine herbs?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would I lie to you?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Yue'er were sorting through Feng Yan's divine herbs. She continued, "It would be a waste to give these divine herbs to you. How about this - I'll use these divine herbs to refine some dans for you, and keep the rest as payment. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>"Alright! Alright!" Feng Yan nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>If dans made from divine-grade spirit herbs already had such effects, what kind of miraculous effects would dans made from divine herbs have?</p><p></p><p>The value was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Method Hao, rummaging through a pile of divine materials, said, "Brother Feng Yan, I'll forge an inner armor for you, and keep the remaining materials as payment. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>"Inner armor?" Feng Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It can be nurtured inside the body and provide instant defense from the inside out in a moment," Method Hao explained.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's heart trembled again. He nodded vigorously and said, "Alright, alright, take it all!"</p><p></p><p>An armor that could be nurtured inside the body - what kind of divine artifact was this?</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan, standing to the side, was itching with curiosity. Even an Immortal Venerable was so shocked, which showed how extraordinary those dans and such must be.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he couldn't hold back anymore.</p><p></p><p>He took out his storage bag and said with a fawning smile, "I have some too. Are they good enough?"</p><p></p><p>He poured everything out onto the deck of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>The things in Cheng Zhan's storage bag were naturally not as rare or high-grade as Feng Yan's, but they were much more numerous and varied.</p><p></p><p>After all, Feng Yan was an Immortal Venerable. Many treasures were no longer useful to him, so he only carried what he could use. Naturally, these were of higher grade, but relatively fewer in type and number.</p><p></p><p>"They'll do," Method Hao said, also giving him a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also promised him dans.</p><p></p><p>And so, on the flying ship, Method Hao prepared to forge while Su Lingxiu prepared to refine dans. Yun Miaomiao, Du Yuying, Yue'er and the others all got busy, sorting through Feng Yan and Cheng Zhan's things.</p><p></p><p>Watching Method Hao forge the inner armor, his techniques and mysterious forging methods left Feng Yan wide-eyed. He couldn't help but mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder they're disciples of a great master. These techniques are truly miraculous. Could this great master be from that rumored place?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan pondered, feeling that the great master was very likely from that place of legend.</p><p></p><p>Only that legendary place could have such wondrous methods.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that great changes are coming to the Divine Realm, so the great master has appeared to deal with the situation? Or even, is this world about to face upheaval?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's heart suddenly grew heavy.</p><p></p><p>If not for this, why would experts from the legendary place appear?</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, Xu Yan and the others were busy, while Wu Tiannan and his group felt rather uncomfortable, especially Emperor Dazhou and the others. After arriving in the Divine Realm, things had turned out like this.</p><p></p><p>Now, they didn't know where to go next.</p><p></p><p>Should they just stay at Changqing Pavilion? They wanted to, hoping to be close to the great master for a chance at good fortune. But clearly, this was unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>They could only move forward anxiously, one step at a time. People like the Leiyun Manor Lord were afraid of becoming cannon fodder after entering the upper sects of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were full of unease.</p><p></p><p>After forging the inner armor for Feng Yan, Method Hao began to ponder how to upgrade the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was entirely focused on the Golden Book of the Great Dao. The fifth gate of martial arts was finally about to be perfected, filling him with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

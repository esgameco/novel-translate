        <h1>Chapter 375</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>On the flying boat, everyone was in a state of shock and could not recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping shook his head, opened his blurry eyes, and found that his injuries had completely healed, and his physical body had even been strengthened a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Did someone save me?"</p><p></p><p>He was puzzled in his heart. Given his injuries, who could have saved him? His physical body had almost collapsed, and every piece of flesh and blood was relying on the power of the divine soul to heal. Once the power of the divine soul was withdrawn, it would immediately collapse.</p><p></p><p>With such a terrifying injury, who could have saved him? Who would have used heavenly materials and earthly treasures to help him recover?</p><p></p><p>Was it the Immortal Venerable who saved him?</p><p></p><p>Shaking his head and looking up, his blurry gaze saw something that shocked him.</p><p></p><p>What was that? A giant standing tall and towering? No! That was not an ordinary giant, but a divine monster as huge as the heavens and the earth?! "My divine soul is also problematic, and I'm actually having this kind of hallucination for the first time. Has the non-dissipating qi finally started to affect my consciousness? Will I become muddled and lose my mind like a beast?" If that's the case, it's better to just die and continue sleeping. When I'm asleep, it'll be fine!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Jiang Buping tilted his head, gathered his divine soul power, and fell into a deep slumber.</p><p></p><p>Towering in the heavens and the earth, like a divine monster, with majestic divine might shaking the four corners - how could such a powerful expert exist? It must be an illusion, mistaking a warrior for such a being.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping felt a bit sad. The non-dissipating qi had finally started to affect his consciousness, and he could no longer hold on. He felt a bit unwilling! With a touch of unwillingness, Jiang Buping no longer forced himself to stay awake, but succumbed to the feeling of fatigue and fell asleep.</p><p></p><p>After the shock, Sui Hongwu was the first to regain his senses.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Filled with excitement, Sui Hongwu suddenly knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Sui Hongwu begs the venerable one to save my Great Yue Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Zi Xu had died.</p><p></p><p>But the turmoil in the Great Yue Kingdom had not subsided, especially in the Great Yue Celestial Cave, where a great battle was raging, with the Great Yue Emperor being constrained there, and many of the Great Yue Kingdom's powerful experts being held back.</p><p></p><p>And the other smaller celestial caves also had the possibility of being conquered at any time.</p><p></p><p>The only one who could turn the tide and save the Great Yue Kingdom was the powerful expert in front of them! The celestial cave of Qi Yun Prefecture had already fallen, and although the army of the Underworld had been led out by Blood Zi Xu and annihilated, reinforcements must be sent to guard it quickly, lest new Underworld warriors enter and infiltrate Qi Yun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"I beg the venerable one to save my Great Yue!"</p><p></p><p>The other two True King Venerables of the Great Yue Kingdom also hurriedly knelt down and respectfully pleaded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze swept over them. Since he had already intervened, what was the harm in doing so again?</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the Divine Realm was still limited, and these immortal Venerables of the Great Yue Kingdom, especially the Great Yue Emperor, were more familiar with the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao seemed eager to go to the celestial cave and fight.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also knew that only in battle could Xu Yan and the others' martial dao progress more rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there were treasures in the celestial cave, even unique items of the Underworld, which were exactly the kind of accumulative foundation that Xu Yan and the others needed for their breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go there."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu was overjoyed, "Thank you, senior!"</p><p></p><p>The crisis in Qi Yun Prefecture was resolved, and there was no need to go to the city of Qi Yun Prefecture. The flying boat turned and headed towards the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom, where the Underworld celestial cave was located.</p><p></p><p>Due to the long distance, even with the flying boat at full speed, it would take a considerable amount of time to arrive.</p><p></p><p>However, the crisis in Qi Yun Prefecture had been resolved, and the Great Yue Emperor and other powerful experts were capable of guarding the celestial cave, so there was no need to hurry.</p><p></p><p>Although the Blood Slave Army led by Blood Zi Xu had been annihilated, the celestial cave of Qi Yun Prefecture had fallen, and it now needed to be re-garrisoned.</p><p></p><p>Sui Hongwu immediately instructed the two True King Venerables of Qi Yun Prefecture to guard the celestial cave, and at the same time, he would convey the news to the remaining True King Venerables in Qi Yun Prefecture to deal with the crisis there.</p><p></p><p>As for the True King Venerables who had betrayed, they also needed to be eliminated one by one.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, Sui Hongwu apologized to Li Xuan and needed to handle these matters personally, with Feng Yan leading the way.</p><p></p><p>With the intervention of an Immortal Venerable, the turmoil in Qi Yun Prefecture would soon be quelled.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat turned into a beam of light and flew towards the capital of the Great Yue Kingdom, where the Underworld celestial cave was located.</p><p></p><p>"This flying boat is a bit slow and lacking in some aspects," Fang Hao sighed.</p><p></p><p>Constrained by the materials obtained in the Spirit Realm, the Evergreen Pavilion's flying boat was ultimately a bit inferior and did not match their strength. It needed to be upgraded.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had arrived in the Divine Realm, they could naturally obtain various divine objects and materials, which would be sufficient to elevate the flying boat to an extremely high level.</p><p></p><p>On the flying boat, with Feng Yan, the Immortal Venerable, present, Xu Yan and the others were all asking Feng Yan about matters related to the Divine Realm and the various heavenly materials and earthly treasures it possessed.</p><p></p><p>After all, the accumulation needed to break through from the Divine Manifestation Realm to the Divine Sovereign Realm was more massive, and more precious treasures were required.</p><p></p><p>One could imagine that as the cultivation progressed, the treasures needed for the accumulative foundation would become rarer and more numerous, and preparations had to be made early on.</p><p></p><p>In addition to these, there were also matters related to the celestial caves, especially whether there were unique treasures in the celestial caves.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable expert would naturally possess more hidden knowledge than a True King Venerable like Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Non-Dissipating Celestial Cave and the non-dissipating qi, Feng Yan would know more about them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quietly observing and absorbing more information about the Divine Realm and the celestial caves from Feng Yan's mouth, while also pondering the creation of the fifth martial dao and its theoretical and martial dao laws.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan naturally knew everything, as he was the disciple of a powerful expert. It was evident that the disciples were still inexperienced and lacked knowledge about the Divine Realm, and this was an opportunity for Feng Yan to get closer to Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Only by directly facing the powerful expert could one know the depth of their profundity!</p><p></p><p>"The three major Underworld celestial caves in the Azure Flower Realm all have a unique divine material called Blood Cloud Gold, which is formed by the accumulation of Underworld blood qi over the years.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Cloud Gold can be forged into divine weapons, and it also has a special property of being able to be infused into one's blood essence, replenishing the blood essence. It can even be cultivated into a personal divine weapon through the nourishment of one's blood essence.</p><p></p><p>"However, Blood Cloud Gold is not easy to obtain, and it is also extremely difficult to extract. The closer it is to the core of the Underworld, the higher the grade of the Blood Cloud Gold produced. Since Blood Cloud Gold is not very useful for Underworld warriors, it is not actively mined..."</p><p></p><p>As Feng Yan introduced, Xu Yan and the others became increasingly interested.</p><p></p><p>Blood Cloud Gold was undoubtedly an extraordinary treasure, especially with its ability to be infused into the blood essence and nourished. If it could be refined or integrated into one's own cultivated weapon, it would certainly yield great benefits.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Blood Cloud Gold was also a treasure that could accumulate one's own foundation.</p><p></p><p>From Feng Yan's words, it seemed that there was a considerable amount of Blood Cloud Gold in the three celestial caves, but it was guarded by the Underworld's Blood Zi Xu, making it difficult to venture in and extract it.</p><p></p><p>Only an Immortal Venerable could dare to risk entering and hastily extract a piece.</p><p></p><p>This was why Blood Cloud Gold was an extremely rare treasure in the Azure Flower Realm, as even Immortal Venerables did not dare to linger for too long.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Each time, the quantity obtained was limited.</p><p></p><p>As Feng Yan explained, Xu Yan and the others all sighed inwardly. These divine realm cultivators really were wasteful of precious treasures. Such rare and extraordinary treasures were actually used in such a crude and simple manner, without fully unleashing the maximum value of the treasures.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the Blood Cloud Gold, the Underworld Heavenly Abyss naturally had other treasures as well, but most of them were deep within the core of the Heavenly Abyss, under the control of the Underworld cultivators, making them difficult to obtain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were becoming increasingly interested in the Underworld Heavenly Abyss, as it was a true treasure trove. If they could accumulate some foundation by conquering a few Heavenly Abysses, they could easily gather enough treasures.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan and the others were interested in the divine realm treasures, Feng Yan was not stingy either. He took out his storage bag and extracted some divine materials and divine medicines that he was carrying.</p><p></p><p>"Come, little brothers, take whatever you like, no need to be polite with your elder brother!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan said generously, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, you are an Immortal Sovereign, and you still use a storage bag?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao looked at the storage bag in his hand, surprised.</p><p></p><p>"My storage bag is not comparable to those of the True King Sovereigns. I use a higher-grade Swallowing Toad storage bag, with a much larger spatial capacity."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan explained that as an Immortal Sovereign, the storage bag he used was naturally not an ordinary one.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I'll give you this storage ring. The storage bag is outdated."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out a storage ring and handed it to him.</p><p></p><p>"A storage ring?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was taken aback, accepting the storage ring and looking at it. He muttered to himself, "The storage bag is outdated?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then explained the storage ring to him. Feng Yan was skeptical at first, but after probing it with his divine sense, he was immediately shocked.</p><p></p><p>This small storage ring actually had a larger spatial capacity than his storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"You mean, by dripping blood into it, it can form a seal that only the owner can open? Unless the seal is forcibly broken?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan looked utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is a simple sealing method. Not only can it prevent theft, but even if it's lost, you can quickly locate it by sensing the seal."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was rummaging through the pile of divine materials and divine medicines that Feng Yan had brought out. These were all good items.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu could hardly take her eyes off the divine medicines.</p><p></p><p>Soon, she picked up a few small bottles and opened them.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan, still marveling at the wonders of the storage ring, saw this and said, "Those are pill concoctions made by refining various divine medicines. Even an Immortal Sovereign can recover their injuries and replenish their consumption by taking them."</p><p></p><p>However, Su Ling Xiu had a look of disdain on her face, and she was pained at the sight. If these precious divine medicines were used to refine spirit medicines, the effects would be unimaginable, and could rapidly enhance her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"This is such a waste of heavenly treasures! Such rare divine medicines, and you've only made a few of these pill concoctions? They're not even as good as the Reviving Elixir I refined with divine spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu lamented as she gathered all the divine medicines to herself. She then took out two bottles of elixirs and handed them to Feng Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Here, these are Reviving Elixirs refined with divine spirit herbs. Even an Immortal Sovereign can quickly recover their injuries by taking them."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was dumbfounded. Divine spirit herbs refined? What were these elixirs?</p><p></p><p>He hesitantly opened one bottle, pouring out an elixir pill into his palm. One look at it, and he was immediately shaken, his intuition telling him that this elixir was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan couldn't help but swallow the elixir pill.</p><p></p><p>"This... This... is truly refined from divine spirit herbs, not just superior divine medicines?"</p><p></p><p>"Why would I lie to you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu and Yue Er were organizing Feng Yan's divine medicines, and then said, "These divine medicines are wasted on you. How about this, I'll refine some elixirs for you using these divine medicines, and the rest can be my reward, how's that?"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>If elixirs refined from divine spirit herbs had such effects, the ones made from divine medicines would be even more extraordinary in power. Their value was unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was rummaging through a pile of divine materials, saying, "Elder Brother Feng Yan, I'll refine an inner armor for you, and the remaining divine materials can be my reward, how's that?"</p><p></p><p>"Inner armor?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It can be absorbed into your body and nurtured, providing instant defense from the inside out."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao explained.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was shocked again, and quickly nodded, "Okay, okay, you can have all of them!"</p><p></p><p>To be able to be absorbed into the body and nurtured, this must be some kind of divine artifact. Nearby, Cheng Zhan was itching to try his luck as well, seeing how even the Immortal Sovereign was so amazed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't hold back any longer, taking out his storage bag and smiling obsequiously, "Do any of these catch your eye?"</p><p></p><p>He poured everything out, piling it on the deck of the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan's storage bag contained things that were not as rare or high-grade as Feng Yan's, but the quantity and variety were much more.</p><p></p><p>After all, Feng Yan was an Immortal Sovereign, so the treasures he carried were naturally of higher grade, while the quantity and variety were relatively less.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also gave him a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu also promised to refine elixirs for him.</p><p></p><p>And so, on the flying ship, Fang Hao prepared to refine the inner armor, while Su Ling Xiu prepared to refine the elixirs. Yun Cai Cai, Du Yu Ying, Yue Er, and the others were all busy sorting out the items for Feng Yan and Cheng Zhan.</p><p></p><p>Watching Fang Hao refine the inner armor, his extraordinary and mystical refining techniques, Feng Yan's eyes were wide open in amazement, and he couldn't help but mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is the disciple of a great expert. These techniques are truly remarkable. Could this expert be from the rumored place?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan pondered, feeling that the expert was most likely from the place mentioned in the rumors.</p><p></p><p>Only that rumored place could possibly possess such profound and mystical techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that something major is about to happen in the divine realm, which is why this expert has appeared to prepare for the impending changes? Or even, is this heaven and earth about to undergo a great transformation?"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's heart grew heavy with these thoughts.</p><p></p><p>If it were not for such a reason, why would an expert emerge from that rumored place?</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship, Xu Yan and the others were busy, while Wu Tian Nan's group were somewhat distressed, especially Da Zhou Emperor and the others. After arriving in the divine realm, they found themselves in this situation.</p><p></p><p>Now, they didn't know where to go next. Should they just stay at the Long Qing Pavilion? They wanted to, hoping to have a chance to get close to the expert, but that was clearly unrealistic.</p><p></p><p>They could only proceed cautiously, step by step. People like Lei Yun Zhuang Master were afraid of becoming cannon fodder after entering the domain of the upper sect.</p><p></p><p>They were filled with anxiety.</p><p></p><p>After finishing the inner armor for Feng Yan, Fang Hao began to ponder how to enhance the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was focused on the Dao Golden Book, the fifth door of the Martial Dao, which was finally nearing completion. He was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Demon Lord had once been so renowned and ambitious, but in the end, he was still betrayed. Eventually, he completely turned into a demon, slaughtering all the cultivators from the prominent sects and the scattered practitioners alike.</p><p></p><p>He summoned Fang Hao over.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan imparted some experiences to him. Of course, these experiences were all that Li Xuan had learned, seen, and heard in his previous life. How to apply them would depend on Fang Hao himself.</p><p></p><p>Given Fang Hao's acumen, Li Xuan believed he would be able to utilize them well.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's face was filled with excitement, and he sighed inwardly, "Truly a master, with just a few words, he has solved the problem that had been troubling me."</p><p></p><p>After imparting some experiences to Fang Hao, Li Xuan then pointed out the Qimen Martial Dao to him.</p><p></p><p>"You have already refined the communication talisman. What insights have you gained from it?" Li Xuan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was taken aback for a moment, then said, "I have gained some insights regarding the teleportation formation. I am confident that I can set up a formation that can teleport people thousands of miles away."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "What I mentioned was not a formation, but a talisman!"</p><p></p><p>The Qimen Martial Dao encompasses formations, weapon refinement, prohibitions, and the wondrous workings of heaven and earth. Thus, the way of talismans should also be included in it.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao refined the communication talisman, Li Xuan had an idea, and Fang Hao's potential in the way of talismans was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>"Talisman?" Fang Hao asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke, "Talismans, you can simply understand them as embedding the required prohibitions or even formations into the talisman, which can be instantly activated.</p><p></p><p>"Talismans are for single-use. For example, the teleportation formation, if you can refine it into a jade talisman, when the talisman is activated, it can teleport people away.</p><p></p><p>"Or the Phoenix Fire Deadly Formation, if you can refine it into a talisman, once activated, it can unleash the power of the Phoenix Fire Deadly Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Although this formation is only for single-use, and its power will not last long after activation, it can still turn the tide in a critical moment.</p><p></p><p>"You can also call this 'talisman formation'."</p><p></p><p>Under Li Xuan's explanation and guidance, Fang Hao's eyes grew brighter, and a flash of insight occurred in his mind. Formations and prohibitions can be utilized in such a way!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, I understand now!" Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao went to delve into the study of talisman formations, believing that it wouldn't be long before he could comprehend the way of talismans.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Fang Hao was very busy, on one hand researching the way of talisman formations, wasting a lot of materials, and on the other hand improving the communication talisman and exploring the development of various formations.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family's treasury and spiritual herbs were all in Su Lingxiu's hands, and the materials for weapon refinement were all given to Fang Hao. Such a vast family treasure could not be exhausted in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu didn't even know how many types of pill formulas she had researched, including the pill that could dissolve spiritual souls - a poison pill!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong naturally did not lack in pills, but the two of them did not spend much time cultivating with pills. Instead, it was Chicat, Jade Little Dragon, and Little Ha who were the most excited.</p><p></p><p>As the Great King, Chicat had to receive a thirty percent tribute of pills from Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha, so it had grown fatter recently and was not far from a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>In the secret realm of the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The various Refining Spirit Cultivators, the Left and Right Protectors, were all hidden in this place, never going out, not even to investigate the situation of the various strongholds and members of the Wanshi Alliance, to avoid exposing their own whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the stone door in the secret realm shook and was opened!</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Cultivators immediately became alert, though this place was secret, it was not necessarily unexposed.</p><p></p><p>A figure walked in.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Master? You're not dead?" The Right Protector exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>They had thought the Alliance Master had perished since he had not returned for a long time, and they were all grieving.</p><p></p><p>But now, the Alliance Master not only had not died, but also looked radiant, not at all like someone who had been injured.</p><p></p><p>The Right Protector knew that when he and the Left Protector fled, the Alliance Master had already sustained serious injuries. How could he have no injuries at all now?</p><p></p><p>The Left Protector's injuries were still severe, and even after resting, he had only recovered two or three tenths.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of talk is that? Wishing for my death?" Yu Gao said impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, Alliance Master, you were in such a bad state back then, even if you escaped, you shouldn't have recovered completely, right?" The Right Protector was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Another cultivator suddenly realized, "Alliance Master, could it be that you were hiding your true strength?"</p><p></p><p>"I almost died, but it also turned out to be a blessing. By the way, don't call me Alliance Master anymore, from today on, you shall address me as Grand Protector." Yu Gao sat down and spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Right Protector was shocked, "Alliance Master, you haven't done anything wrong or violated the rules of the Alliance. The Grand Alliance wouldn't remove your position as Alliance Master without notifying us. Moreover, you have backers in the Grand Alliance, so who stripped you of your position as Alliance Master?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao waved his hand and said, "It's not the Grand Alliance that stripped me of my position as Alliance Master, but I voluntarily gave up the position. Under my leadership, the Yuzhou Branch Alliance is bound to rise..."</p><p></p><p>The Right Protector and the others looked dazed and skeptical, voluntarily giving up the position?</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao stood up and looked solemnly at everyone, "Although Fang is young, you must remember that from now on, you only listen to Fang as the new Alliance Master. Whoever dares to be hypocritical, I won't be polite! This matter is a secret, and all of you must swear not to reveal a single word. There is a big plan ahead, which is the opportunity for our Wanshi Alliance to rise..."</p><p></p><p>After everyone had sworn, Yu Gao took out a medicinal pill and gave it to the Left Protector. After taking the pill, the Left Protector's injuries recovered quickly, reaching seven or eight tenths in less than an hour.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Cultivators of the Wanshi Alliance were all greatly shocked by this.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Fang Hao were planning an action against the Yushen Sect, but they needed to wait for Fang Hao to break through first. In the meantime, they would focus on cultivation and comprehending their own martial dao, trying to improve their strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Tranquil Spirit Sword, and you have obtained the Tranquil Spirit Art."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Dao suddenly provided this feedback.</p><p></p><p>"So Xu Yan has comprehended it." Li Xuan was inwardly delighted. This Tranquil Spirit Art was not just about calming the spirit and soul, but about controlling the life and death of others' spirits and souls.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, with his comprehension of the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, the Mountain and River Sword Dao, and the support of formations and prohibitions, had comprehended this secret art. When unleashed, it was like a sword, fixing the opponent's soul.</p><p></p><p>Life and death were in his hands with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Dao was the Tranquil Spirit Art, not limited to the sword dao, but a secret art of controlling and determining the life and death of others' spirits and souls.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's strength is rising quite quickly." Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Although Xu Yan had not yet broken through to the Dao Sense Realm Mastery, his strength was improving every day, with great advancements in his sword dao, sword intent, and sword formations.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was similar, though the rate of his improvement was not as dramatic as Xu Yan's, he was still advancing steadily every day.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was a bit slower, but not much.</p><p></p><p>"This girl, her thoughts are all focused on pills, prohibitions, and formations, not concentrating on improving her own strength."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, and he didn't have the idea of urging Su Lingxiu either.</p><p></p><p>It had been a month since Yu Gao left. During this period, they had communicated several times through the transmission talisman, and Fang Hao had conveyed some deployments, all of which were preparations for dealing with the Yushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>And it was confirmed that the transmission range of the transmission talisman was 30,000 li, which could allow smooth communication.</p><p></p><p>30,000 li is already quite far, but for the martial Dao celestials, this distance is not too far. Not to mention the vast spiritual domain, even just in the Yuzhou region, 30,000 li is only a small area.</p><p></p><p>But this transmission method is far ahead of the traditional transmission methods in the spiritual domain. Establishing a transmission relay station every 30,000 li can also quickly transmit messages.</p><p></p><p>This plays a crucial role in the establishment of the Wanshi Alliance's transmission network.</p><p></p><p>After this purge of the spiritual sects and aristocratic families, the members of the Wanshi Alliance did not suffer great losses, but the painstakingly established Feifeng transmission was destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was refining his first Qimen armory. After a month of refining, consuming many precious refining materials, he was finally about to succeed.</p><p></p><p>And his Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Patterns are also tending towards perfection, and he can refine the next Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Pattern to enhance his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the second layer of your Unbreakable Golden Body. Your Unbreakable Golden Body has broken through the second layer."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had comprehended the second layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body, which means the gate to the second layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body has been opened in advance.</p><p></p><p>As long as he perfects the first layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body, he can start to break through the second layer.</p><p></p><p>"His strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited in his heart. The second layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body corresponds to the Divine Element Realm, which has brought a huge boost to his Unbreakable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The pure martial Dao and physical martial Dao are both at the Divine Element Realm, and when combined, the strength has increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>"With my current Unbreakable Golden Body, crushing a late-stage Refiner would be as easy as crushing a grasshopper."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's sense of security increased greatly at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"The Invincible Spiritual Domain should be about ready."</p><p></p><p>A few days after Meng Chong comprehended the second layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body, Su Lingxiu also comprehended the Divine Element Realm cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended your Divine Element Realm Pill Dao Martial Dao cultivation method. Your Pill Dao Martial Dao has broken through the Divine Element Realm."</p><p></p><p>The three martial Dao have all advanced to the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of strength increasing is truly refreshing."</p><p></p><p>With the three martial Dao combined, the strength has increased significantly again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly looked at the Red Cat, and at this moment, a demonic aura surged out, and a demonic consciousness similar to a divine will appeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu also looked at the Red Cat one after another.</p><p></p><p>This fat cat has broken through!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's mouth twitched, he was actually surpassed by the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was very excited after the breakthrough, running to Li Xuan's feet, squatting on the ground, looking up at him, waiting to be praised.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised the jade scepter and tapped it on its head, saying, "This is just the beginning, you only have a demonic consciousness, and you are still far from being a true great demon."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was depressed and turned around to go find Su Lingxiu to act cute.</p><p></p><p>Having just broken through, its body is weak and needs some medicinal pills to replenish! Yuxiaolongand Xiaoha had an envious look on their faces. At the moment the Red Cat broke through, its demonic consciousness surged out, and they truly felt the presence of a demonic king!</p><p></p><p>On this day, a three-foot-long armory was born from Fang Hao's hands, the Qimen Armory was successfully refined.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others all curiously gathered around.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Qimen Armory."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu touched the dark golden armory with intricate patterns engraved on it, with a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, quickly demonstrate it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong urged.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also very excited. This is his first Qimen Armory, and also the beginning of the Qimen Martial Dao's grand display of power.</p><p></p><p>He slapped the armory, and a brilliant light burst forth. The armory opened, and sword light surged out like a torrent, and in an instant, a mighty formation descended.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the formation artifacts flew out and descended in all directions, instantly laying down layer upon layer of formations.</p><p></p><p>Then Fang Hao stepped forward, and the Qimen Heavenly Earth Formation was deployed. A tyrannical sword beam slashed out from the armory.</p><p></p><p>"The sword formation is something I comprehended from my eldest shixiong, this tyrannical sword beam is something I comprehended from my second shixiong, and the Great Marsh Formation is something I comprehended from my shijie.</p><p></p><p>"Formation, restriction, Qimen Heavenly Earth, and the inherent killing power of the armory, I can control them all.</p><p></p><p>"Combining killing, restraint, illusion, and defense."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao explained excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The armory's emergence was grand and imposing, especially the first sword formation's killing power. Although it was not as sharp as Xu Yan's sword Dao, it was still extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Combined with the formations, Qimen Heavenly Earth, and the armory's inherent attacks, the power of this Qimen Armory was quite formidable.</p><p></p><p>With Fang Hao's current strength, he would have no problem slaying great celestial martial artists. He could also delay and restrain Refiner celestial for some time.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, I'll teach you the Transposition technique. With this, you can instantly change your position, and you can also further comprehend the Bagua, I feel the Bagua can be perfectly integrated with your Qimen Heavenly Earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, eldest shixiong!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao thought about it, and the Bagua diagram appeared in his mind, and he seemed to have some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan taught Fang Hao the Transposition technique.</p><p></p><p>With the Transposition technique, Fang Hao can flexibly dodge the enemy's attacks, and slowly wear down powerful opponents with the Qimen Armory, formations, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"I don't need to worry too much about this disciple of mine, my eldest shixiong will guide him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand, and all the formations and sword formations returned to the armory. He put the armory on his back and came in front of his master, respectfully saying, "Master, I'm about to break through!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go find a place to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao's breakthrough, these three shixiong-shidi will go settle accounts with the Yushen Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you go break through first, I and second shidi will find an acquaintance to investigate the spiritual ores of the Yushen Sect, then we can take action."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan showed an excited expression.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and the Su family actually issued such a huge bounty to hunt them down. Since that's the case, he'll just take the Yushen Sect's resources for himself.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family is only a second-rate aristocratic family, and their treasury is already shockingly amazing. The Yushen Sect, which is known as the number one sect in Yuzhou, the resources and treasures it controls must be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong left the manor and went to find Shen Haizhou.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Hao also left the manor, looking for a suitable place to break through, drawing the momentum of heaven and earth into his body, and refining the next Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Pattern.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, the master, he naturally followed and protected him in the dark. After all, drawing the momentum of heaven and earth, if he encounters a Refiner martial artist, the clues will be easily discovered and he may be targeted.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

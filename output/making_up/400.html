        <h1>Chapter 400</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When he heard they were spies, the Great Yue Emperor's face changed dramatically. The people sent to the Qimen Institute and Danyi Institute were all supposed to be highly trusted individuals.</p><p></p><p>Yet such people turned out to be spies. How many more spies could there be within Great Yue? How many spies could be lurking even around himself? Just thinking about it made him feel a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, we are not spies! We..."</p><p></p><p>The hearts of several Shadow members sank. </p><p></p><p>Their infiltration skills were naturally excellent. To have infiltrated to this level took years of gradual progress step by step.</p><p></p><p>Once suspected, under careful scrutiny, there was no way they could hide from an Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Whether you are or not, we'll know very soon!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>He had absolute faith in the guidance of the esteemed expert.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan and the person in charge from Tianwu Gate felt their hearts sink. One of the sect members sent here to guard was a high-level figure in the sect. </p><p></p><p>If even such a person was a spy, it was unimaginable how deeply infiltrated the sect had become.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this matter is of utmost importance. I must report to the Sect Master. Before that, not a word can be leaked."</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," the Great Yue Emperor nodded.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Shadow members knew they could no longer remain hidden. And in front of the two Immortal Lords - the Great Yue Emperor and Feng Yan - they had no chance of escape.</p><p></p><p>Once thoroughly investigated, there was a possibility their affiliated forces would be exposed.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Suddenly, the auras of several people instantly withered, their souls dissipating into nothingness. They committed suicide decisively, so quickly that even the Great Yue Emperor, an Immortal Lord, had no time to stop them.</p><p></p><p>Their suicide method was extremely powerful. Once activated, it led to instant death and soul dissipation, with no way to reverse it.</p><p></p><p>Besides their souls dissipating and life force fading, the bodies of the several people also rapidly shriveled, as if wind-dried.</p><p></p><p>All traces of their auras vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>The goal was to leave behind not a single clue! At this point, their identities as spies were confirmed.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan and the person in charge from Tianwu Gate could no longer sit still. They personally set off to return to their sect, as a secret investigation of the sect was now necessary to root out any remaining hidden spies.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for your guidance, esteemed one!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor respectfully bowed with clasped hands towards Li Xuan's direction.</p><p></p><p>Next, he began investigating the capital of Great Yue. But before that, the Great Yue Emperor and Sui Hongwu personally screened each of their trusted imperial guards. Only after confirming there were no issues did they dispatch the imperial guards to begin a covert search.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how did you know they were spies?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also nodded, equally curious.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing can escape your master's eyes," Li Xuan smiled, then added: "If you cultivate the Minor Heavenly Dao Eye, you'll be able to detect it too."</p><p></p><p>"The Minor Heavenly Dao Eye is too profound. Although I have some understanding, I'm still just short of grasping it," Su Lingxiu said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>The Minor Heavenly Dao Eye was extremely mysterious. She still hadn't been able to fully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Then let your master give you some more guidance," Li Xuan said with a resigned expression.</p><p></p><p>By now, he had actually developed the Minor Heavenly Dao Eye, so it wasn't just making things up anymore. He knew clearly in his mind how to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan guided Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao on how to cultivate the Minor Heavenly Dao Eye.</p><p></p><p>However, he only provided guidance rather than teaching it exactly as is. After all, he wanted Su Lingxiu to gain her own insights. Perhaps the Minor Heavenly Dao Eye she comprehended would have some differences?</p><p></p><p>A Minor Heavenly Dao Eye unique to the Danyi martial arts.</p><p></p><p>After guiding Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao, the two went back to continue their contemplation. It was unknown for now when they would be able to fully comprehend it and successfully cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to memorize the Taisang Book's principles, while temporarily reducing the time spent on creating the Divine Ability Martial Classic. He allocated more time to perfecting the system of Extreme Soul martial arts, as well as refining martial methods beyond the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains realm, Meng Chong emerged from a celestial cave. After evading an encirclement, he hid in a concealed location to consolidate himself.</p><p></p><p>"It's not forces from the Qinghua realm, nor is it one of the major forces of the Nine Mountains realm. What force is targeting me?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong wondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Those masked people had diverse methods and were vicious and ruthless. Many of their people had infiltrated various forces in the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>After several encirclements, Meng Chong felt that next time, this masked force would likely try to trap him inside a celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"I can't go to celestial caves for now."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered. He had to find a way to investigate the identities of his attackers.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother appeared at Mount Dagai before. I'll go to Mount Dagai and see if I can encounter Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong made his decision. So he concealed himself and set off towards Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've finally broken through."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan emerged from his secluded cultivation place, looking relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He had broken through to the Divine Image realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Divine Image realm, his strength increased significantly again.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a divine image appeared, with the power of heaven and earth's laws transforming into a landscape of mountains and rivers. Within the landscape, a golden giant dragon coiled.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword emerged, as if enveloping the mountains and rivers. At this moment, Xu Yan's form was hidden within the divine image, with only the powerful divine image standing tall between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The fusion of divine image and divine abilities is truly marvelous. To harm me, one must first break through my divine image. Only after breaking the divine image can they truly face my real body."</p><p></p><p>"The power of the divine image, fused with the laws of heaven and earth, is in some sense similar to an Immortal Lord's unity with heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan assessed his current strength. The powerful defense formed by his divine image and the Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword meant that ordinary Immortal Lords could not harm him.</p><p></p><p>"However, if I encounter a powerful Immortal Lord like the Great Yue Emperor, I would still be shattered in one hit. But I no longer fear weaker Immortal Lords like Sui Hongwu or Feng Yan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan instantly felt much more confident.</p><p></p><p>He was now invincible below the Immortal Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>And this was just the entry level of the Divine Image realm.</p><p></p><p>Powerful Immortal Lords like the Great Yue Emperor were rare even in the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Immortal Lords weaker than the Great Yue Emperor but stronger than Feng Yan were still very dangerous to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>But having reached this level, even if he couldn't win, he truly had the ability to escape.</p><p></p><p>"When I reach the peak of the Divine Image realm, I'll be able to face even Immortal Lords like the Great Yue Emperor without fear. They won't be able to do anything to me."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was considered strong among Immortal Lords, but certainly not the most top-tier. The Great Yue Emperor himself understood this.</p><p></p><p>"Once I enter the Void-Breaking realm, Immortal Lords will truly no longer be a threat to me."</p><p></p><p>Only by breaking through to the Void-Breaking realm could one truly disregard the threat of Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>The void-breaking power of the Void-Breaking realm could pierce through the space of heaven and earth. In a sense, it was perfectly suited to break through an Immortal Lord's power of unity with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was like a counter to an Immortal Lord's control over the power of a region of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu is at Thousand Fold Mountain. Should I go see her? With my current strength, I should be able to handle it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he decided to go explore the situation at Thousand Fold Mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, before going to Thousand Fold Mountain, Xu Yan sent a message to Wan Tianlin, inquiring about the investigation into the mastermind behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>To Xu Yan's surprise, even the Wan family had not been able to uncover the forces behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>"They're hiding quite deep. Now that I've shown myself, let's see if you'll continue to target me," Xu Yan sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>As long as they came after him, it would be easy to deal with. He could directly use Heaven's Will to control their souls and consciousness, naturally allowing him to learn about the forces behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>"However, to use mind control on late-stage and peak True King Celestial Lords, I'll need to weaken them first," Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had broken through to the Divine Phase realm and the power of Heaven's Will had greatly increased, it was still somewhat difficult to control late-stage and peak True King Celestial Lords. They could easily break free from Heaven's Will's control.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven's Will divine ability is certainly extraordinary, but my cultivation of it is still not profound enough. I need to spend some time to improve this divine ability further."</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities involving soul and consciousness control were inherently difficult to use across realms.</p><p></p><p>"If Fifth Junior Brother entered the Extreme Soul martial way, with his extreme soul power, he would be much more formidable using these types of divine abilities!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of Jiang Buping, who cultivated the Extreme Soul martial way, the ultimate path of the soul. Naturally, he would be stronger in divine abilities and techniques related to the soul.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul martial way..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered thoughtfully. Could he also refer to the methods of the Extreme Soul martial way to transform his own primordial spirit, making it purer?</p><p></p><p>If his primordial spirit truly reached a state of pure flawlessness, impervious to all evils, it would certainly be another transformation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had some insights in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Still haven't found him?"</p><p></p><p>At the border between Big Canopy Mountain and Thousand Fold Mountain, two True King Celestial Lords met.</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>The one who answered had a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>This Xu Yan was truly good at hiding. Once he went into hiding, he couldn't be found anywhere.</p><p></p><p>How could they complete their mission if they couldn't find him? How could they lure him into the Celestial Abyss?</p><p></p><p>To lure Xu Yan into the Celestial Abyss, they had deliberately prepared a Seven Wonders Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>That was truly a heavenly treasure. Forget True King Celestial Lords, even Immortal Celestial Lords would covet it and try to seize it if they saw it.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't lure Xu Yan into the Celestial Abyss, they would have failed in their task and be considered useless. Forget about rewards, they might not even have a place to be buried!</p><p></p><p>"Should we release information about the treasure? If Xu Yan discovers it, he'll surely enter the Celestial Abyss."</p><p></p><p>"That treasure is so miraculous, once word gets out, even Immortal Celestial Lords will enter. How can we proceed with the plan then?"</p><p></p><p>The two True Kings had worried expressions.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the True King Celestial Lords' eyes lit up. "Is that Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed. He seems to be heading to Thousand Fold Mountain. Quick, let's go before he discovers anything amiss. Now that he's shown himself, things will be easier!"</p><p></p><p>The two True Kings were overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>They continued forward, pretending to be True King Celestial Lords just passing by, while conversing in low voices.</p><p></p><p>"I heard there might be a heavenly treasure in the Witch Demon Celestial Abyss. I wonder if it's true?"</p><p></p><p>"It is true. I heard it's a Seven Wonders Divine Flower. It's a heavenly treasure that can strengthen the soul, purify one's martial foundation, calm the mind, and allow one to comprehend the mysteries of martial arts. Even Immortal Celestial Lords would covet it."</p><p></p><p>"With such a divine object, we have a chance to break through to Immortal Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"That's right. This matter is secret and must not be leaked. This Celestial Abyss is just a small one, not many people pay attention to it..."</p><p></p><p>The two True King Celestial Lords, pretending not to have noticed Xu Yan's traces, continued forward while conversing in low voices.</p><p></p><p>Inadvertently, they leaked information about the existence of a Seven Wonders Divine Flower treasure in the Witch Demon Celestial Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Demon Celestial Abyss at Thousand Fold Mountain? Is Mei Wu there?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved forward silently. He had long discovered these two True King Celestial Lords and deliberately revealed his traces slightly to let them discover him, wanting to see how these two would react.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, these two leaked information about the treasure, trying to lure him into the Celestial Abyss.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Wonders Divine Flower..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was somewhat tempted. This Seven Wonders Divine Flower was clearly a good thing. Strengthening the soul was secondary; what he really cared about was that the Seven Wonders Divine Flower could allow martial artists to comprehend the mysteries of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The fact that even Immortal Celestial Lords were tempted showed that the Seven Wonders Divine Flower was of no low rank. For him at his current stage, it would also have considerable effectiveness.</p><p></p><p>Blood Heart Fruit could make people more easily comprehend techniques for a short time, while the Seven Wonders Divine Flower was of an even higher rank than Blood Heart Fruit. Perhaps it could truly help him understand Heaven and Earth realm martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I can't fully comprehend Heaven and Earth realm techniques, I can use it to organize my martial arts, gain insights into my martial way, and even cultivate more powerful divine abilities..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was tempted. He silently followed not far behind the two True Kings.</p><p></p><p>The two True Kings were conversing in low voices, their eyes secretly communicating, unsure if Xu Yan had already heard their "secret".</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Yan's traces were hidden. If not for the coincidental glimpse earlier, they wouldn't have been able to discover Xu Yan's figure either.</p><p></p><p>The two were using this point, letting Xu Yan think he hadn't been discovered, inadvertently overhearing such a secret.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful with your words, don't let anyone overhear."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end of their conversation, the two suddenly seemed to become vigilant, starting to check their surroundings, as if preventing anyone from eavesdropping.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, unless it's an Immortal Celestial Lord, who could escape our notice?"</p><p></p><p>"That's true!"</p><p></p><p>In secret, however, they communicated via voice transmission: "Where's Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen him. He couldn't have not heard our conversation, right?"</p><p></p><p>"That's impossible. We didn't discover him, but with Xu Yan's strength, he must have discovered us."</p><p></p><p>The two were somewhat uneasy. What if Xu Yan hadn't heard the secret? Or if he wasn't tempted by it?</p><p></p><p>The two True King Celestial Lords were worried but didn't dare to stop. They could only continue forward to avoid Xu Yan discovering any flaws.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? Something feels a bit off."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the True King Celestial Lords spoke with a start.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, he felt as if he had entered a new realm.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>His expression changed drastically in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late. Amidst rippling waves, a strand of heavenly law encircled him, and a mountain and river scene with coiling golden dragons obscured him.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a hand pressed onto his head.</p><p></p><p>Buzz! In a daze, his soul shook, and heaven's will became irresistible.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finally decided to make his move. Although Mei Wu posed a considerable threat, the Seven Wonders Divine Flower was too rare, and it was very likely an divine object from beyond this world.</p><p></p><p>Since Mei Wu wanted to give it to him, how could he not take it?</p><p></p><p>He would go meet Mei Wu! However, before that, he needed to make some preparations, such as controlling these two True King Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The strength of a late-stage True King Celestial Lord was not weak. To control them, he needed to use some techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan integrated his mountain and river sword intent into the environment. When the two True King Celestial Lords stepped in, he suddenly made his move, catching them off guard.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xu Yan used Heaven's Will to control one of the True King Celestial Lords. The other True King Celestial Lord, realizing something was wrong, roared in anger, his aura exploding as he tried to break free from the constraints of the mountain and river sword intent.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

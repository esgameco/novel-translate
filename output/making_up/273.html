        <h1>Chapter 273</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hum! The precious sword trembled and floated up.</p><p></p><p>The unparalleled sword intent radiated out from the blade.</p><p></p><p>Brilliant light surrounded it, the sword gleaming brightly and emitting a low sword hum.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the sword's brilliant light receded, the sword intent disappeared, as if all its sharp edges had been hidden away, becoming ordinary.</p><p></p><p>The sword grew larger, in an instant becoming a massive thirty-meter-long blade, then it began to shrink back down.</p><p></p><p>When it returned to its original size, it approached Meng Chong, the sword's form gradually becoming somewhat illusory, and as it touched Meng Chong's body, it slowly merged into his body.</p><p></p><p>"It succeeded!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the sword had been nurtured within one of the golden body acupoints in his body.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was greatly delighted, saying, "I finally know how to refine them. The refining materials are absolutely crucial - only materials with spiritual resonance can be used to refine spiritual weapons that can be absorbed into the body."</p><p></p><p>Glancing at his own Mysterious Gate armory, Fang Hao excitedly said, "I need to refine another Mysterious Gate armory to nurture within my body!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also greatly excited, as they had truly succeeded.</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong absorbed the sword into his body, Li Xuan also received the feedback.</p><p></p><p>Next, Fang Hao upgraded Xu Yan's Transparent Sword, while Meng Chong continued to nurture the precious sword, and ponder how to further cultivate the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>With a precious sword within his body, he also needed to have one in his hands for outward use.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Transparent Sword was also successfully nurtured within his body.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then refined another sword and saber as openly used weapons.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, his disciple truly had the aura of an old fox!</p><p></p><p>Refining the Mysterious Gate armory was not easy, involving too many weapons, and consuming a massive amount of materials.</p><p></p><p>Even Suli's iron shovel and golden needle needed to be refined.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, with the support of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu family's treasury, there was no shortage of rare materials, so they could be fully refined.</p><p></p><p>"This level of consumption, even top-tier spiritual sects would not be able to support it," Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, his disciple knew how to earn resources, so the master didn't have to worry.</p><p></p><p>The red cat ran up to Fang Hao, it also wanted such precious treasures, causing Li Xuan's mouth to twitch - the big cat he raised really went for anything beneficial, not willing to suffer any losses at all.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had no choice but to refine something for the red cat as well.</p><p></p><p>The red cat also wanted a large golden chain, the kind that could fit its size.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao refined one for it to wear around its neck, making it look quite domineering, and the red cat was greatly excited, its long-cherished desire for a large golden chain finally fulfilled.</p><p></p><p>In the future, even if its body grew larger, there would be no need to worry about the golden chain breaking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the large golden chain also had other functions, as it was a spiritual artifact after all.</p><p></p><p>All the people in the manor, including the snake Yuxiao Long, had obtained the weapons they desired.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er ultimately did not dare continue using the Blood Spirit Sword, so he asked Fang Hao to refine a new precious sword for him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had already absorbed the sword and saber into their bodies, nurturing them as their own spiritual weapons.</p><p></p><p>Their sword and saber arts had also advanced further.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan summoned Xu Yan over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who had already reached the initial stage of the Heart Sword Realm, had displayed the might of his sword art in the Prodigy Battle, casually turning mountains into swords and shocking all.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was time to pass on the sword realm above the Heart Sword Realm to him.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held the jade scepter and walked out of the manor towards a distant mountain peak, with Xu Yan following closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with excitement, knowing that his master was about to impart more martial dao teachings to him.</p><p></p><p>Although they had left the manor, the extraordinary formation still enveloped Li Xuan and Xu Yan, so outsiders could not detect their presence.</p><p></p><p>Standing atop the mountain peak, Li Xuan spoke, "Disciple, you have already reached the initial stage of the Heart Sword Realm, which is the second realm of the Sword Dao. What are your thoughts on the third realm of the Sword Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paused, pondering for a moment before saying, "Master, I have no idea what the realm beyond the Heart Sword Realm could be. Turning all things in heaven and earth into swords, this is already unfathomably profound and wondrous. Could there truly be an even more mysterious sword dao realm above this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this. Although Xu Yan had a monstrous talent, he had only reached the initial stage of the Heart Sword Realm, and it would be impossible for him to deduce the next sword dao realm from this foundation alone.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Third Realm, Li Xuan had already prepared it.</p><p></p><p>Now that the timing was right, it was time to pass it on to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when Xu Yan reaches the mastery stage of the Heart Sword Realm, he will be able to comprehend how to cultivate the Sword Dao Third Realm," Li Xuan thought expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited, "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Heart Sword Realm was already so powerful, what kind of formidable sword dao realm could exist above it?</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Dao Third Realm is called the Wisdom Sword Realm!" Li Xuan solemnly declared.</p><p></p><p>"Wisdom Sword Realm?" Xu Yan's expression was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"What is the Wisdom Sword Realm? To command all things as swords, where all swords have spirits, all swords understand the Dao, all swords know my intent, my intent is the sword heart and sword wisdom; 'the sword knows its own sword, the sword understands its own sword intent...' The swords can independently respond to enemies, the swords themselves know the Dao of the Sword;</p><p></p><p>"All swords are like me, all swords are me, all swords are imbued with wisdom - this is the Wisdom Sword Realm!" Li Xuan explained the profundity and principles of the Wisdom Sword Realm, word by word, to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's face was filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>This is the third realm of the Sword Dao? All swords have wisdom? The swords know their own Dao of the Sword, understand their own sword intent; with a single thought, myriad swords emerge, and the swords themselves know how to fight the enemy? Swords with their own intelligence? What kind of sword dao is this, that bestows wisdom upon the swords? When the swords are unleashed, one need not control them, as the swords will slay and defend on their own? The swords themselves know the principles of the Dao of the Sword?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was utterly shocked, the Wisdom Sword Realm was so profound, so wondrous, as if it was something beyond human cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the greatly shocked Xu Yan, inwardly nodding, the more shocked the disciple, the more powerful they would become once they comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the Great Dao Scriptures on the spiritual platform, the information on the Wisdom Sword Realm:</p><p></p><p>Completion Degree: Medium.</p><p>Realm Connection Degree: Medium-High.</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: Extremely High.</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High+.</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Sword Realm belonged to the extremely high comprehension difficulty category, as this realm represented a massive breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Even though Li Xuan had racked his brains, he could not lower the comprehension difficulty any further. It was simply too profound, too wondrous.</p><p></p><p>If he had made it less profound, it would not have seemed powerful enough, and Li Xuan was unwilling to do that.</p><p></p><p>Although the comprehension difficulty was extremely high, he had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The completely fabricated cultivation methods that Xu Yan had cultivated before, he had still managed to cultivate them. Now that his martial dao realm was not low, and he had broken through to the Heart Sword Realm, he had a foundation.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Wisdom Sword Realm was still doable, it would just require more time.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Disciple, this is the marvel of the Wisdom Sword Realm, and it is also a manifestation of the Wisdom Sword Realm, but the Wisdom Sword Realm is not limited to this. "The practitioner of the Sword Way must understand the Wisdom Sword, for it is said that the Wisdom Sword can slay the demons of the heart, slay the threads of emotion, slay the old self... All obstacles, all distractions, can all be slain.</p><p></p><p>"Slay the cage, slay all demonic obstacles, slay all the unknown... With the Wisdom Sword in the heart, purify the self, everything is me, not deluded, not confused, not dispirited, not self-deluded, not cowardly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression was solemn as he imparted the Wisdom Sword Realm one by one to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was shocked, yet also touched, as if a flash of inspiration had occurred to him. He felt that the more he contemplated, the more unfathomable the Wisdom Sword Realm became.</p><p></p><p>"...With the Wisdom Sword in the heart, purify the self, everything is me... not confused, not dispirited, not cowardly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke again, "Disciple, the marvel of the Wisdom Sword is not something that can be comprehended in a short time, nor should you get lost in it. Wait until your primordial spirit is consolidated, and you can understand the wonders of the laws of heaven and earth, perhaps then you can cultivate the Wisdom Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Understand by analogy, contemplate your own self, perhaps one day, when inspiration comes, you will also understand how to cultivate the Wisdom Sword Realm."</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Spiritual Realm martial arts, the comprehension of the Wisdom Sword Realm is much more difficult. Even if Xu Yan was a prodigy, he could not possibly comprehend it in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Rather than doing so, it would be better to first comprehend the Spiritual Realm martial arts. Perhaps once he understood the Spiritual Realm, he would have a clue to the Wisdom Sword Realm as well.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!" Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>The Wisdom Sword Realm was too profound. The master was right, perhaps after Xu Yan comprehended the Spiritual Realm, or after he had refined his primordial spirit and understood the wonders of the laws of heaven and earth, he would be able to cultivate the Wisdom Sword Realm. His Heart Sword Realm had only just reached the initial stage, and he was still far from perfecting it.</p><p></p><p>And perhaps one day, through analogy, he would suddenly understand.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, it's good that you have a grasp of it." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The master and disciple returned to the manor.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Li Xuan looked up and saw Yue and his grandfather searching for something. However, the extraordinary array of the heavens and earth shrouded the two, preventing them from discovering him.</p><p></p><p>He smiled, not interfering. That girl was rather interesting, and her talent was not bad. But it was a pity, she was not suitable to be his disciple.</p><p></p><p>And he had no new martial arts to impart either.</p><p></p><p>As for a daughter-in-law, Xu Yan already had two female admirers. As for the matter of affinity, it was up to the disciple himself. As the master, he would not get involved in such things.</p><p></p><p>Back at the manor, Xu Yan entered a state of seclusion, cultivating, contemplating his own sword dao, and comprehending the Spiritual Realm martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak, this time it was Meng Chong's turn.</p><p></p><p>The third realm of the Dao of the Sword, it was time to impart it to Meng Chong as well.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong's talent was not as monstrous as Xu Yan's, his talent in the Dao of the Sword was also monstrously extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"The beginning of the Dao of the Sword is the awakening of the Sword Soul. You have already awakened your Sword Soul, naturally understanding its profundity.</p><p></p><p>"And the second realm of the Dao of the Sword is the Concealing Sword Realm, which your elder brother's Heart Sword Realm is related to. You also know a thing or two about it. The Concealing Sword Realm is both concealing one's edge, and having the sword hidden everywhere in heaven and earth, sharing a similar principle with the Heart Sword Realm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slowly explained.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened respectfully.</p><p></p><p>As someone who had just entered the Concealing Sword Realm, he naturally understood the profundity of the Concealing Sword Realm. Although he could not achieve the level of his elder brother, where a single thought could turn all things into swords, he could still turn grass, trees, and stones into swords.</p><p></p><p>The meaning of Concealing the Sword was both concealing one's own sword and having the sword hidden everywhere in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The third realm of the Dao of the Sword is the Revealing Sword Realm; the sword reveals my heart, the sword reveals my will..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to impart the Revealing Sword Realm to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The Revealing Sword Realm! The sword reveals my will, the sword knows my will!</p><p></p><p>"...With the Revealing Sword in the heart, demonic obstacles will dissipate by themselves... The sword is the overlord of heaven and earth, the sword is the courage of heaven and earth... With the Revealing Sword in the heart, the overlord is mine, the fearless and valiant have no equal..."</p><p></p><p>The Revealing Sword Realm has similarities with the Wisdom Sword Realm, after all, Li Xuan had also used the Wisdom Sword Realm as a reference in compiling it.</p><p></p><p>But there are also significant differences, as it manifests the domineering and fearless nature of the sword.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the Golden Book of the Dao on the spiritual platform, regarding the information on the Revealing Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Completion degree: Medium-high.</p><p>Realm connection degree: Medium-high.</p><p>Comprehension difficulty: High+.</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: High.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension difficulty, although lower than the Wisdom Sword Realm, was not much lower.</p><p></p><p>To comprehend it would still not be an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Li Xuan was not concerned about this. Meng Chong's talent was not bad, in fact, it was also monstrous.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once Xu Yan comprehended the Wisdom Sword Realm, Meng Chong would also be able to gain insights from it and then comprehend the Revealing Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was only a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened with his blood boiling, stroking his bald head, his face filled with excitement and fervor.</p><p></p><p>The Revealing Sword Realm, it was so profound, so powerful.</p><p></p><p>"You have just entered the Concealing Sword Realm, the Revealing Sword Realm is still far from you. Take it step by step, cultivate steadily, and gradually comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"The third layer of the Indestructible Golden Body, ponder it well. The profundity of the martial dao is not just this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Meng Chong respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, cultivate well. This Spiritual Realm is about to be turbulent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up and returned to the manor, with Meng Chong following behind.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was a bit puzzled. Why did the master say the Spiritual Realm was about to be turbulent?</p><p></p><p>"Is the retaliation from the Crimson Abyss Sect coming?" Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It had been a long time since the Battle of the Prodigies, but the Crimson Abyss Sect had not made any moves, as if they were still abiding by the rules of the Prodigies' Confrontation, not retaliating.</p><p></p><p>But how could that be possible? With the tyrannical nature of the Spiritual Sect, they would definitely not let it go without retaliation. Moreover, the rules of the Prodigies' Confrontation had already been broken during the earlier conflict with the Myriad Stars Martial Dao Institute, they were no longer following them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down in the chair. He had imparted everything he needed to, now he just had to wait for the harvest.</p><p></p><p>As for the turbulence in the Spiritual Realm, that was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad World Alliance was lurking in the shadows, restless, wanting to carve out a place for themselves under the rule of the Spiritual Sect families.</p><p></p><p>And the Crimson Abyss Sect, silent for so long, this meant they were brewing a big move. He believed it would not be long before they made their move.</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect is still very strong, but I don't know if any of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect's experts have noticed this matter and will intervene."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he was not worried about dealing with the Transcendent Spiritual Sect's experts. However, the foundation of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect was still unknown.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if many of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect's experts ganged up to attack him, even though Li Xuan estimated he could still handle it without risking his life, he would not be able to swiftly and decisively defeat them.</p><p></p><p>This would tarnish his image as an unparalleled high-level expert.</p><p></p><p>Another shameless lie, not using his true realm to intimidate others?</p><p></p><p>Once or twice was fine, but if he continued to deceive his disciples, they would start to doubt the true realm of their master.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Li Xuan felt a bit uneasy. It would be better to stay low-key and just barely get by, without encountering a siege.</p><p></p><p>Unless he broke through to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>At that time, with the emergence of his Spiritual Realm, the entire Spiritual Realm would know what true invincibility was!

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If Weng Yong cultivated the Harmonize with Dust technique, his chances of escaping would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>However, to Xu Yan's regret, he only taught Weng Yong a little bit of the Harmonize with Dust technique, and Weng Yong was completely bewildered, not knowing how to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Yan realized that the martial dao he cultivated was different from Weng Yong's martial dao, and the Spiritual Domain martial dao might not be able to cultivate the Harmonize with Dust technique.</p><p></p><p>So, Xu Yan did not pass on the remaining Harmonize with Dust technique, but instead pondered on teaching Weng Yong a reduced or simplified version of the Harmonize with Dust technique.</p><p></p><p>Although not as powerful as the complete Harmonize with Dust technique, it was still an extremely strong technique for concealing one's presence and hiding one's aura. As long as it was used properly, with the help of the mountains and thickets, it might not be impossible to evade the spiritual search of the Refining Deity Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong had an ashamed expression on his face, "Brother Xu, your martial dao is profound, I am too stupid and failed to comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"No problem, I have a slightly simpler technique for concealing one's presence and aura, let me pass it on to you."</p><p></p><p>After some contemplation, Xu Yan devised a reduced version of the Harmonize with Dust technique.</p><p></p><p>If Weng Yong still could not cultivate this, Xu Yan would be at a loss.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Xu!" </p><p></p><p>Weng Yong expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>The two traveled together in the underground tunnel. Xu Yan imparted the technique for concealing one's presence and aura to Weng Yong. Since it was a reduced version, it was relatively easier to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>It took three days for Weng Yong to finally grasp it.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly excited. With this technique for concealing his presence and aura, he was confident that he could escape from Yuzhou and evade the pursuit of the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>This underground tunnel was thousands of miles long, and the two did not dare to be careless, after all, it was opened up by a certain spiritual beast, which might have already died.</p><p></p><p>But there could still be other spiritual beasts lurking.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a hissing sound came from the dim tunnel, and more than a dozen unknown spiritual beasts, as thick as barrels but shaped like earthworms, abruptly emerged.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword intent surged forth, and in an instant, he slew these spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent journey became turbulent. In one section of the tunnel, a dense poisonous mist gushed out, but fortunately Xu Yan had detoxifying pills and passed through it smoothly.</p><p></p><p>After an uneventful journey, they reached the end of the tunnel, where the location of the Earth Spirit Jade Essence was.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong took a deep breath and searched in the tunnel, finally finding a wall with more than a dozen protruding small stones.</p><p></p><p>"According to the records, the Earth Spirit Jade Essence is hidden behind these!"</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong struck the protruding stones one by one, pushing them into the wall. With a forceful push, the wall opened, and a dense spiritual energy gushed out, carrying a refreshing aroma.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, we part ways here. If you wish to contact me in the future, you can try to find the Eternal Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong solemnly clasped his fists.</p><p></p><p>"The Eternal Alliance?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was somewhat puzzled, as he had never heard of this force.</p><p></p><p>"It is an alliance formed by cultivators outside the sects. But it has not yet emerged into the world."</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong said in a deep voice, and then told Xu Yan the secret base of the Eternal Alliance in the Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Weng Yong's shoulder. The latter had trusted him so much that he even revealed the secret base of the Eternal Alliance, and also gifted him the Earth Spirit Jade Essence. Xu Yan felt a bit guilty about this, and sighed, saying, "Brother Weng, actually, I was the one who killed Dai Yingying."</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, you..."</p><p></p><p>"When I first arrived in Yuzhou, I encountered Dai Yingying trying to capture someone to explore the Azure Sky Serpent Tomb. She even wanted to enslave me, so I killed her. Of course, I didn't know that you had threatened her before!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>He did not intend to let Weng Yong take the blame.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong opened his mouth, no wonder Xu Yan believed in him, it turned out that he was the murderer! For a moment, Weng Yong's emotions were complex.</p><p></p><p>However, he also believed that Xu Yan did not intentionally let him take the blame.</p><p></p><p>From their interactions these days, Weng Yong felt that Xu Yan's understanding of the Spiritual Domain seemed rather limited, and he did not have the same sense of hardship as the cultivators outside the sects.</p><p></p><p>He should be a young prodigy who had just stepped into the Spiritual Domain and did not know much about the cultivation world.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Dai family has determined that I killed the person, then let Dai Yingying's death be on me. As for your act of killing, only you and I know about it!"</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>Even if the truth came out, his situation would not change.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family would certainly kill him, and it would not make much difference whether Xu Yan was also being pursued.</p><p></p><p>Since it was already like this, he would just take the blame himself! After all, he had already been framed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "It doesn't matter. The Dai family can't kill me. But Brother Weng has been bearing the name of a murderer for so long, he can't just let it go."</p><p></p><p>He then took out a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>This was Dai Yingying's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"This belongs to Dai Yingying, I'll give it to you."</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong did not hesitate to take the storage bag and put it away, cupping his fists and saying, "Brother Xu, farewell!"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Weng, take care!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clasped his fists.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong felt relieved at heart. Since he had already taken the blame, so be it. He turned and left gracefully, his figure disappearing at the end of the tunnel.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you afraid that he will betray you to the Dai family and bring people to capture you, the real murderer?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"He won't. I'm good at reading people."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>He silently added, "Even if Weng Yong really does that, I can always escape at any time. Then Weng Yong would be courting death."</p><p></p><p>"Weng Yong is a righteous person. He detests the Spiritual Sects and the aristocratic families, and he also knows that even if he betrays me, he will ultimately meet his demise."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped into the location of the Earth Spirit Jade Essence.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Perception Realm was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong looked around the tunnel, feeling that there seemed to be some changes, but couldn't figure out exactly what had changed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Sword Qi of Heaven and Earth had already covered this area of the tunnel.</p><p></p><p>The fresh and dense spiritual energy surged towards them. Xu Yan waved his hand to close the opened wall, looking at the small stone hollow in front of him, where a jade-white jade essence was shimmering. Suddenly, a faint yellow gas, resembling a python, began to circulate around the jade essence pool, occasionally diving into the pool and then coiling around the small stone cave.</p><p></p><p>"The Earth Spirit Dragon Qi? How can it be here?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>He could feel the extraordinary nature of the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi. If he could absorb it, he would be able to quickly accumulate a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, this is the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong came out excitedly from Xu Yan's wrist.</p><p></p><p>"How can it be here? Could it be that there is a second Earth Spirit Dragon Qi in Mount Mang?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan approached the Earth Spirit Jade Essence. His Sword Qi had already permeated the stone cave. The Earth Spirit Dragon Qi, as if startled, suddenly rushed towards the wall, trying to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Don't let the dragon qi escape!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong transformed into a beam of light, pouncing towards it, while opening his mouth to try and absorb the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi.</p><p></p><p>However, a mountain and river image appeared, and the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi circled within the mountain and river, which then suddenly contracted, enveloping the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi and entering Xu Yan's body.</p><p></p><p>"I will start cultivating now, you stay here and keep watch."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath and sat down in front of the Earth Spirit Jade Essence.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong swallowed hard and curled up at the entrance of the stone cave, not daring to move.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was too powerful. He had easily captured the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi, and that mountain and river image...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The essence of the river, what is it ultimately? The earthly spirit and dragon energy entered his body, and Xu Yan began to refine and nurture himself, accumulating a foundation, preparing for the breakthrough to the Divine Consciousness Realm. <div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div>Once the earthly spirit and dragon energy entered his body, it became gentle, like spiritual energy, being refined bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>This is a supreme spiritual object, encountering living beings and fleeing, this is just the nature of the earthly spirit and dragon energy, not possessing any spiritual intelligence or consciousness.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inner Domain, Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, continuing to study the Taicangshu, while trying his best to perfect the Qimen Martial Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>What disappointed him was that although the formation diagram had been circulated for a long time, no one had yet comprehended anything from it.</p><p></p><p>"Is it limited by the martial dao of the Inner Domain, without those with such talent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and the others were all diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was learning to read and write, while also observing the formation diagram.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was cultivating the Void Alchemy Technique, while also comprehending the Alchemist Martial Canon, especially the laws of the Divine Consciousness Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued his cultivation, striving to break through to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Lesser Celestial Warrior, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Dao opened, with golden light emerging.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>Killed another Lesser Celestial Warrior? What's going on with Xu Yan? As soon as he entered the Spiritual Realm, he killed a Lesser Celestial Warrior, and now he's killed another one? </p><p></p><p>At this rate, it won't be long before he provokes the Refining Celestial Cultivators. Li Xuan suddenly felt some pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Origin Realm is still a bit weak!"</p><p></p><p>Although, with his current strength, killing a Refining Celestial Cultivator should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>However, Refining Celestial Cultivators also have varying levels of strength, and whether he can slay the top-tier ones is an unknown.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Xu Yan can soon comprehend the Divine Technique Realm cultivation method, only with the Divine Technique Realm will he truly have the confidence."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Once he enters the Divine Technique Realm, killing Refining Celestial Cultivators will be as easy as crushing ants.</p><p></p><p>In that case, even if Xu Yan provokes many powerful factions and is hunted by a group of Refining Celestial Cultivators, as his teacher, Li Xuan would be able to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>With the Divine Technique unleashed, suppressing a group of Refining Celestial Cultivators should not be a problem.</p><p></p><p>"Qimen Martial Dao, where can I find the fourth disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>If he could comprehend the Qimen Martial Dao, master the formation techniques, then no matter how many Refining Celestial Cultivators came, he could bury them all.</p><p></p><p>"Qimen Martial Dao includes alchemy, formations, and restrictions. The formation diagram has already been compiled, I might as well take the time to summarize the formation techniques into a comprehensive Formations Canon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>Since the fourth disciple has not yet been found, he might as well take the time to organize and summarize the formation diagrams, compiling a comprehensive Formations Canon.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of it, he began to summarize and compile a Formations Canon.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland was developing rapidly, completely replacing the former Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked at the elderly visitor, secretly startled in his heart, this person was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, what brings you here?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's expression remained calm as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Guo, I have come to join the Great Wasteland, wishing to become a Suppliant of the Great Wasteland Cabinet, only obeying the commands of Elder Guo."</p><p></p><p>The visitor spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's brow raised, to become a Suppliant of the Great Wasteland Cabinet, and only obey the commands of the Cabinet Elder like himself, this meant the visitor's status in the Great Wasteland was extremely high.</p><p></p><p>It also meant that he could become a powerful force under Guo Rongshan's command.</p><p></p><p>So far, the Great Wasteland Cabinet had never had any Suppliants, the visitor's purpose was somewhat puzzling to Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>"I need to consider it."</p><p></p><p>The visitor nodded and said, "Elder Guo, I am a Half-Step Celestial, capable of serving as a Suppliant. The Great Wasteland needs powerful forces, and Elder Guo needs them as well!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was secretly startled, although a Half-Step Celestial could be easily slain by his own grandson, it did not mean that Half-Step Celestials were weak.</p><p></p><p>In the current Inner Domain, apart from Canglang Island, Half-Step Celestials were still the supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>"I will consider it carefully."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, in the following days, several more powerful experts came, all wanting to become Suppliants of the Great Wasteland Cabinet, and without exception, they were all Half-Step Celestial experts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these were hidden Patriarch-level figures from some top factions.</p><p></p><p>This matter was too big, Guo Rongshan was undecided, so he had someone send a message to Canglang Island, asking his son-in-law Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was also undecided, so he went to find Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"To become a Cabinet Suppliant is fine, but they must follow these Suppliant rules, and if stronger experts appear, they need to step down.</p><p></p><p>"At that time, we can give them the honor of retiring as a Suppliant."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>He roughly understood the intentions of these experts.</p><p></p><p>Essentially, the martial dao of the Inner Domain had no future, and entering the Spiritual Realm would make them inferior. As Patriarch-level figures, accustomed to being high and mighty, how could they tolerate this frustration?</p><p></p><p>If there was no other choice, for the sake of the martial dao, for the sake of becoming a Martial Dao Celestial, they might be able to force themselves to endure and become servants.</p><p></p><p>However, the martial dao of the Great Wasteland provided them with a second choice.</p><p></p><p>So they chose the Great Wasteland, and judging from the trend, they were preparing to completely transform the Inner Domain into the Great Wasteland, no longer subject to the oppression of the Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan separated a Divine Origin Realm divine sense, hid it in a spiritual jade, and sent it to Guo Rongshan as his protective talisman.</p><p></p><p>With this divine jade talisman, those Half-Step Celestials could only obediently listen.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he had someone convey a message to Bai Yunkong and Pang Yu, asking them to enter the Great Wasteland Cabinet as Suppliants to maintain the balance of the Great Wasteland Cabinet.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Domain was undergoing changes.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the increasing number of martial cultivators, already nearing ten thousand.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ponder deeply.</p><p></p><p>He should start thinking about how to convert the martial dao of the Inner Domain to the martial dao of the Great Wasteland, especially for the peak Grand Masters and Half-Step Celestials.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the method for Grand Masters to convert requires the assistance of medicinal pills, which has certain limitations.</p><p></p><p>If no medicinal pills were needed, he believed the number of Great Wasteland martial cultivators at the Innate Realm would greatly increase, rapidly enhancing the strength of the Inner Domain martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Once the Great Wasteland replaces the Inner Domain, it's time to optimize the conversion method."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>With the Golden Book of the Dao, optimizing the conversion method would not be too difficult, and since it was based on the existing cultivation methods, the comprehension difficulty would not be too high either.</p><p></p><p>He continued to perfect the Formations Canon, and had now summarized eighteen formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>The second page of the Taicangshu was still being diligently studied.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth were profoundly mysterious, to gain some insights would require a lot of time and accumulation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland Cabinet Suppliant Hall was established, Guo Rongshan sitting at the head, looking at these Half-Step Celestials, a jade talisman in his hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a trace of spiritual energy surged into the jade talisman, as if a vast and mighty aura was permeating the area.</p><p></p><p>"I hope you all can abide by the Suppliant rules!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked at the assembled Half-Step Celestials and spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Half-Step Celestials present all had their expressions tightening, feeling as if a great mountain was hanging over them, ready to crush down at any moment!

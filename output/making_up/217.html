        <h1>Chapter 217</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this point, the three disciples had all been taught martial arts techniques above the third realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he had comprehended the Shenyi Realm martial arts, while Meng Chong had not yet comprehended the first layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body. </p><p></p><p>As for Su Ling Xiu, she only needed to cultivate step-by-step. Xu Yan could explain the Shenyi Realm techniques he had comprehended to her, and once she reached the Tong Xuan realm, she could then prepare for her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The overall cultivation direction of the Danjia martial arts is roughly the same as pure martial arts, the only difference being the focus of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The medicines above the Shenyi Realm that Su Ling Xiu was researching, involving the Yuanshen, were quite profound, and the spiritual herbs required were also quite rare. </p><p></p><p>She had very few spiritual herbs, aside from the Shiyuocao, there were only the ones Xu Yan had brought back and the ones in Jiao Ming's storage bag.</p><p></p><p>With nothing else to do, Li Xuan also pointed out the cultivation of the others on Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>Aside from refining the Stone Dao foundation, the Red Cat would turn into a big fat cat every day and go in front of Su Ling Xiu to act cute and beg for pills.</p><p></p><p>As a result, it got a few pills, then it would go to Xu's mother and act cute again, and Xu's mother would be happy and feed it spiritual herbs...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, this fat tiger Red Cat was getting smarter and smarter.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both in seclusion, comprehending their techniques and cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was comprehending the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to compile the Qimen Martial Arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>A new martial art should be compiled.</p><p></p><p>With the Heaven and Earth Principles from the Taicangshu as a foundation, compiling formations, arrays, and other Qimen techniques, although not easy, at least there was a reference.</p><p></p><p>"Qimen Martial Arts, lies in the 'qi', in the sword going against the grain..."</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuan's mind, the dragon veins of heaven and earth, the overall situation of the terrain, the array formations and prohibitions emerged.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, he opened the Daojin Book and began to write the initial techniques of the Qimen Martial Arts into it, receiving feedback from the Daojin Book.</p><p></p><p>Writing while extracting what was needed, writing down a Heavenly Principle.</p><p></p><p>He could already skillfully write the Heavenly Principle on the first page of the Taicangshu, but the principles on the subsequent pages, he could not yet do so as skillfully.</p><p></p><p>But it was enough for him to compile the early realms and techniques of the Qimen Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"I've been in the Inner Domain for so long, I haven't had a chance to wander around. I should go for a walk, perhaps I can find a suitable new disciple."</p><p></p><p>Calm begets action, Li Xuan prepared to venture into the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Before going to the Spirit Realm, he should also tour the Inner Domain, otherwise wouldn't it be a wasted trip? And the Qimen Martial Arts he compiled also need a suitable disciple to comprehend it, the Inner Domain is so vast, perhaps he can find the right person.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan and Meng Chong on Canglang Island, even if a Heavenly Demon were to come, it would only be a one-way trip. </p><p></p><p>The strength of the Lesser Heavenly Demons is just that. </p><p></p><p>Losing the advantage of the Heavenly Demon's divine might, where else can they be strong?</p><p></p><p>Thinking and doing, Li Xuan was originally going to leave riding the Red Cat pet, but found this fat tiger lying at Xu's mother's feet, acting cute and flattering, without a trace of the majesty of a great demon.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, riding this big cat would be too eye-catching."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan abandoned the idea and stepped out, leaving Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak, Xu Yan saw his master walking leisurely on the Cangjiang River, a jade talisman in his hand, one hand behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Master has gone out to wander the world.</p><p></p><p>"I must hurry and improve my strength, so that Master doesn't have to silently protect my family for me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was determined.</p><p></p><p>"Heart Sword Realm, using all things as the sword, and Shenyi Realm, where the divine will goes, is the will of heaven... Divine Element, Divine Abilities..."</p><p></p><p>In his comprehension, Xu Yan was gradually gaining some insight.</p><p></p><p>He felt that he was about to comprehend how to cultivate to the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was perfecting himself, comprehending the Dao of the Sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword soul was growing stronger, the long sword resting on his knees slightly trembling, as if resonating with him.</p><p></p><p>Although it was just a sword, without any intelligence or spirituality, it was in a mysterious state of resonance with him.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent flowed, the domineering sword intent seemed to have become as light as the wind.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the Sword Saint Cliff, Xie Lingfeng was cultivating sword techniques. After being guided by Li Xuan, he realized that directly trying to reach sword heart enlightenment and enter the Sword Dao would be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>It would probably require an extremely long time.</p><p></p><p>But cultivating sword techniques, using them as a foundation to then enter the Sword Dao, would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>It's like breaking through one realm after another.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after cultivating sword techniques, although not as powerful as sword intent, the strength would still increase greatly.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun, a genius on par with him, had actually broken through to Great Grandmaster before him.</p><p></p><p>The Great Grandmasters on the Sword Saint Cliff had also started cultivating sword techniques day and night, this was the next level of the Sword Dao for the Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>And the Sword Master Xie Tiangheng, after Xie Lingfeng explained the Sword Dao, also fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Heart Enlightenment? Sword Intent?"</p><p></p><p>Standing on the peak of the Sword Saint Cliff, overlooking the sea of clouds, Xie Tiangheng's expression was calm, no longer showing dejection or having suffered setbacks.</p><p></p><p>Someone who could comprehend the Sword Technique Dao, unprecedented in history, would not be easily discouraged.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Spirit Realm have this Sword Dao as well?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tiangheng muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Most likely not, they don't even have the Sword Technique Dao!</p><p></p><p>This is precisely why Xie Tiangheng was so arrogant, not taking the world lightly.</p><p></p><p>Because he had pioneered an unprecedented Sword Dao! But the trip to Canglang Island made him realize his own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>He had not even entered the Sword Dao!</p><p></p><p>Xie Tiangheng took out a pink jade bracelet, silently gazing at it, a flash of memories in his eyes, then took a deep breath and murmured, "I, Xie Tiangheng, have never submitted to anyone in my life, and if I say I will go find you, then I will!"</p><p></p><p>Putting away the jade bracelet, he looked back towards where Xie Lingfeng was, a doting look in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Although his son was not as good as him, he was still an unparalleled genius in the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Heart Enlightenment, Sword Intent, I must comprehend them!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tiangheng's gaze was determined, if his son had comprehended them while he had not, wouldn't that be embarrassing?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was walking in the Inner Domain, appreciating the customs and people, experiencing the turmoil and waves of the martial arts world, while also looking for a suitable disciple.</p><p></p><p>He was also compiling the Qimen Martial Arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I should go take a look at the Sword Saint Cliff."</p><p></p><p>He thought of Xie Tiangheng, wondering if he had recovered from his setback.</p><p></p><p>Undeniably, Xie Tiangheng's talent was indeed formidable, to have actually comprehended the Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>And using the Sword Technique as the foundation to enter the Sword Dao and comprehend the Sword Intent, it just perfectly completed the entire cultivation process of the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>From cultivating sword techniques, to cultivating sword techniques, to Sword Heart Enlightenment, to comprehending Sword Intent...</p><p></p><p>It had all been perfected.</p><p></p><p>"Guiding Xie Tiangheng a bit, consider it his contribution to completing the entire cultivation system of the Sword Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had figured it out, the Sword Dao he had compiled before was too profound, the starting point was too high, lacking a solid foundation, lacking a complete system.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Yan had comprehended it, the entry threshold for the Sword Dao was still very high.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's talent was naturally not bad, but even after such a long time, he still had not achieved sword heart clarity and comprehended the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xu Yan could not be regarded as a normal prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng's sword techniques were just right to complement the entire Sword Dao system, greatly lowering the entry threshold for the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Sword Dao prodigies like Xie Lingfeng, or those slightly inferior to him, could now smoothly cultivate and enter the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Although talent was still required, the threshold had been lowered, and even if they could not comprehend the sword intent, as long as they cultivated the sword techniques, their strength would not be weak.</p><p></p><p>It had raised the overall strength of Sword Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Sword Saint Cliff?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and decided to ask someone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Following the direction Jiao Ming had left, Ping'er kept going forward. Occasionally, she encountered some sect forces and would inquire about them, and if they showed the slightest disrespect, she would annihilate them without mercy, just like slaughtering pigs and dogs, without any compassion.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Ming, that bastard!" Ping'er was furious in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, who is the person you want to catch? What's their name?"</p><p></p><p>Ping'er furrowed her brows. When the master had sent someone to convey the message for her to come to the Inner Domain to catch someone, she had thought Jiao Ming was in the Inner Domain, so it would be a simple task. Therefore, she had not asked who the target was or what their name was.</p><p></p><p>She had even left without waiting for the person to finish speaking and came to the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Ping'er regretted it a bit. If she had known who the target was, it would have been easier to find them.</p><p></p><p>"In this lowly place, I can't even find a decent-looking and powerful young man. I'm so irritated that my whole body is burning up.</p><p></p><p>"No, I have to find someone to vent my frustration and relieve my worries."</p><p></p><p>Ping'er's face flushed slightly.</p><p></p><p>She looked around, preparing to go to the big city to see if there were any men with decent looks and strength.</p><p></p><p>"This lowly place is really suffocating. I'll just let some lowly person, a pig-like person, defile me and disgust me. At least it will be a release."</p><p></p><p>Ping'er gritted her teeth. She decided that after finding Jiao Ming, she would exaggerate the story when she returned, so that the mistress would punish him severely! If it weren't for him, she wouldn't have to find some lowly person, a pig-like person, to vent her emptiness.</p><p></p><p>"The powerful sects in the Inner Domain, which ones are there?" Ping'er had an idea and went to ask someone about the major sects in the area, so she could find a somewhat handsome lowly person there to make herself feel better.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked about the location of the Sword Saint Cliff and then leisurely made his way there, enjoying the sights along the way.</p><p></p><p>He was not far from the Sword Saint Cliff now.</p><p></p><p>Standing on a mountain, Li Xuan gazed into the distance, and the towering peak in front of him was the Sword Saint Cliff!</p><p></p><p>"The scenery in the Inner Domain is truly colorful and vibrant."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was marveling at it, his brow suddenly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure descended from the sky and landed on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>Ping'er had been on her way to the Sword Saint Cliff, but on the way, she saw a young man standing on the mountain peak, who was quite handsome and had an aura that was hard to find even in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"In this lowly place, there is actually such a man?"</p><p></p><p>At that moment, Ping'er's heart started racing.</p><p></p><p>"He's the one!"</p><p></p><p>Ping'er became excited and instantly appeared in front of Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>She circled around Li Xuan, looking more and more pleased and satisfied the more she looked at him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan furrowed his brow, looking at this flushed woman who was exuding a flirtatious and vulgar aura.</p><p></p><p>Although her appearance was beautiful and her figure was alluring, the excessive vulgarity and flirtatiousness made him frown.</p><p></p><p>"A Spirit Realm cultivator? Is this her natural state, or has she cultivated some techniques?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pondering in his heart.</p><p></p><p>As for this flirtatious woman and her intentions, he didn't really care. He could easily slap her to death without a second thought, as he didn't take her seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>"A Spirit Realm cultivator coming to the Inner Domain, this is a good opportunity to ask her and learn more about the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was thinking this when Ping'er had already circled around him and stood in front of him, adopting a superior attitude as she spoke:</p><p></p><p>"In this lowly place, there is actually such a handsome man. How extraordinary. </p><p></p><p>"But alas, even the most beautiful appearance is just a pig-like existence in this lowly place.</p><p></p><p>"Come, today I will bestow upon you, a lowly person, the ultimate joy of defiling my body.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly kneel down and be grateful, this is a blessing you have sought for three lifetimes!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Ping'er's expression suddenly turned horrified, as the aura of a Celestial Cultivator erupted from her body. However, in that instant, she was completely immobilized, as if a mighty will had instantly suppressed her.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the will of heaven could not be defied, and she was unable to resist!</p><p></p><p>Poof! Her body exploded and turned to ashes, disappearing.</p><p></p><p>She never understood why she had encountered such a terrifying expert in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"I got a bit carried away," Li Xuan sighed after slapping Ping'er to death.</p><p></p><p>Now he finally understood why Xu Yan had drawn his sword to kill that Celestial Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Her despicable behavior was truly sickening.</p><p></p><p>Especially that arrogant attitude, calling others pigs and lowly people - who wouldn't want to kill her after hearing that? And that flirtatious aura of hers had already made him feel disgusted and uncomfortable, yet she still acted as if she was bestowing a great favor, coveting his body! She deserved to die, and he had no choice but to slap her to death.</p><p></p><p>After killing Ping'er, Li Xuan felt a bit regretful. He had originally planned to ask her about her purpose and how many Celestial Cultivators had entered the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to inquire about the situation in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he got so disgusted that he couldn't hold back and killed her.</p><p></p><p>"Oh well, if there are other Celestial Cultivators who have entered the Inner Domain, I'll soon find out. Are all the Celestial Cultivators from the Spirit Realm like this? </p><p></p><p>"It seems the rumors are true - the Celestial Cultivators of the Spirit Realm look down on the Inner Domain as inferior, even despising the people here as pigs and dogs.</p><p></p><p>"Inner Domain cultivators entering the Spirit Realm definitely won't receive good treatment. Where does this sense of superiority come from?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, unable to fully understand why the Celestial Cultivators of the Spirit Realm would look down on Inner Domain cultivators to such an extreme degree.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Spirit Realm must have a strict hierarchy."</p><p></p><p>Judging from this one incident, the Spirit Realm must have a severe hierarchy, and the living conditions of the lower-level cultivators there must be even worse than the lower-level cultivators in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>After killing Ping'er, Li Xuan proceeded towards the Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>As for what her purpose was in entering the Inner Domain, since she was dead, he could no longer find out.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Sword Saint Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>As he ascended the stairs, Li Xuan looked at the disciples cultivating at the Sword Saint Cliff and sighed in admiration. It was indeed the top force in the Inner Domain. The disciples' talents were all quite good, and their strength was a step above the disciples of other sects.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

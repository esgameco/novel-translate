            <p>Chapter 43: The Crisis of the Xu Family</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, the most urgent task is for you to return home and handle this matter," Li Xuan said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I must hurry back home!" Xu Yan came to his senses and immediately said, "Master, your disciple will return home to handle this matter, and once it is resolved, I will come back to serve you."</p><p></p><p>"Go then," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"But what about them..." Xu Yan looked at the Monk in Hemp Robe and the County Magistrate, his expression darkening.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry about them," Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan bowed respectfully, then his figure vanished into the night.</p><p></p><p>He did not ride a horse, but directly used the Nimble Crane Technique. With his current strength, his speed was much faster than a horse.</p><p></p><p>Rushing back home, naturally he used the Nimble Crane Technique.</p><p></p><p>The Monk in Hemp Robe and the others were terrified. Xu Junhe's foolish son, how could he be so powerful? Could it be that he had found a hidden high-level expert?</p><p></p><p>In this world, were there truly powerful experts like those in the legends?</p><p></p><p>Whose brain was not working properly?</p><p></p><p>For a moment, all the top experts of the Heaven Mother Sect were questioning their lives.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan left, Li Xuan immediately smiled and pulled the Monk in Hemp Robe, "Don't just stand there, come in and chat."</p><p></p><p>"No, senior, we still have matters to attend to, to provide relief to the suffering masses... Yes, to provide relief to the suffering masses!" The Monk in Hemp Robe was drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>The young man in front of him, though appearing young, was most likely an ancient monster. Since Xu Yan, that foolish boy, was so powerful and his strength exceeded the norm, his master could not be judged by ordinary standards.</p><p></p><p>"So you are truly going to provide relief to the suffering masses?" Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we have relief efforts for the common people," the Monk in Hemp Robe trembled.</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate got up from the ground and timidly backed away, wanting to flee.</p><p></p><p>"You, the County Magistrate of Cloud Mountain, come here," Li Xuan waved the jade scepter in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, whatever you command, I will fulfill!" The County Magistrate bowed and fawned.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be anxious, all of you come in and chat, about this Heaven Mother Sect and such..." As Li Xuan's qi surged, an invisible pressure enveloped everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" The Heaven Mother Sect members dared not disobey, their faces full of fawning smiles as they entered the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered the courtyard, a flash of insight struck the Monk in Hemp Robe, and he immediately knelt down with a thud.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, your divine might is unparalleled, towering like the heavens, the peerless expert in the world. From this day on, my Heaven Mother Sect wishes to revere you as the Heavenly Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Sovereign, divine might unparalleled, peerless in the world, Monk in Hemp Robe pays respects to the Heavenly Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>The Monk in Hemp Robe kowtowed repeatedly, his expression solemn, like a devout believer.</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate and the others saw this and hastily knelt down as well, their expressions solemn, like devout believers, kowtowing without any reservation.</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud, thud.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the Heavenly Sovereign!"</p><p>"The Heavenly Sovereign's divine might is unparalleled, peerless in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>These people from the Heaven Mother Sect, what a bunch of eccentrics?</p><p>Heavenly Sovereign, huh? One male, one female?</p><p>In the future, should they change the name to the "Heavenly Sovereign Sect"?</p><p></p><p>"There are two paths: either stand up and have a proper conversation, or... go die."</p><p>Li Xuan spoke in an indifferent tone.</p><p></p><p>The sound of kowtowing stopped, and the Monk in Hemp Robe and the others wiped the blood trickling from their foreheads and stood up silently.</p><p></p><p>Whether to choose conversation or choose death, they still knew how to make the right choice.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down in the chair, and had the Monk in Hemp Robe and the others introduce the Heaven Mother Sect, the court, and the jianghu, so that he could further understand this world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The World...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Donghe Prefecture, the Xu Family.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Xu family's residence was brightly lit, with the guards patrolling the estate, weapons in hand, on high alert.</p><p></p><p>There was a person stationed on top of each building, vigilantly watching their surroundings.</p><p></p><p>In the inner courtyard, Chen the Escort Leader and Wang the Inn Master were sitting in the pavilion, holding weapons.</p><p></p><p>Besides these two, there were three other people also on guard in the inner courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Five top martial artists of the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, why have the evil followers of the Heavenly Mother Sect targeted our Xu family? What does the government say about this?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu asked with a worried expression.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe sighed and said, "The Heavenly Mother Sect has come to our doorstep, demanding nearly half of our family's wealth, claiming it is to aid the suffering masses, but in reality, they are forcing us to join their heretical sect.</p><p></p><p>"This is a rebellious and evil cult. Once involved, the consequences would be unimaginable, like a rebellion."</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu frowned and said, "I know this well, but the Heavenly Mother Sect is causing chaos in the prefecture, why is the government not arresting them? General Jiang Pingshan of Donghe, how can he just sit by and watch?"</p><p></p><p>"Because the time to act has not yet come," Xu Junhe paced back and forth in the hall, brows furrowed, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Husband, are we to wait until the Heavenly Mother Sect barges into our Xu family before taking action? Are we to just watch as our Xu family is destroyed by this heretical cult? Isn't the Prefect of Donghe afraid of being held accountable?"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu was perplexed.</p><p></p><p>"They are waiting for a piece of news," Xu Junhe felt it was time to tell his wife.</p><p></p><p>"That band of mountain bandits suddenly disappeared without a trace, and the goods were safely delivered to the capital. I thought we had weathered the storm, but now an even greater calamity has arrived, a disaster that is difficult to overcome!"</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu was taken aback, "What disaster?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe let out a breath and said, "The struggle for the Crown Prince!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Lady Xu's face immediately paled, and she trembled as she spoke, "Husband, are you saying that my father..."</p><p></p><p>"Your father's mentor is Elder Chen, and Elder Chen supports the Third Prince. Your father has long been seen as a confidant of the Third Prince, belonging to his faction.</p><p></p><p>"Since last year, when the Third Prince was distributing relief supplies in the three prefectures and lost the precious gem he was to present to the Emperor, he has been at a disadvantage in the struggle for the Crown Prince. Now, the situation is about to be settled."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe sighed.</p><p></p><p>If it were an ordinary gem, it would have been fine, and the Third Prince's relief efforts would not have been punished. However, that gem was known as the Longevity Stone, a rare treasure in the world.</p><p></p><p>Carrying it on one's person has the miraculous effect of curing illnesses and prolonging life.</p><p></p><p>With the loss of such a precious item, there were rumors that the Third Prince did not wish for the Emperor to live a long life, and had intentionally lost the gem.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the gem's authenticity, this incident has caused the Third Prince to fall out of favor with the Emperor, and his faction has been eliminated from the struggle for the Crown Prince.</p><p></p><p>Lady Xu's face turned pale, and she trembled as she asked, "Is there no way to salvage this? Can we not ally with the First Prince?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe let out a bitter smile, "Your father is Elder Chen's disciple, a confidant of the Third Prince. There is no chance."</p><p></p><p>Holding his wife's hand, Xu Junhe was silent for a moment before saying, "Our Xu family's vast wealth has naturally made us a target for this reckoning. It is fate and destiny. I, Xu Junhe, have come this far with my humble status, and I do not regret this life."</p><p></p><p>With a helpless sigh, he said, "It's just that, Zhan'er, ah!"</p><p></p><p>Leaning on him, Lady Xu's eyes were red as she said, "It's a blessing that Zhan'er is not home. I hope he can escape this disaster. That child is just a little too naive, believing those fictional stories and seeking some master."</p><p></p><p>"As long as we find Zhan'er before the authorities do, we can ensure his safety. I have made the arrangements," Xu Junhe gently embraced his wife.</p><p></p><p>Physician Pan came in and said, "Master, everything is ready. Once we find the young master, we will immediately escort him to the State of Wu."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nodded and said, "There are some businesses in the State of Wu that can ensure Zhan'er's wealth and status. You, Physician Pan, please take good care of him."</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Physician Pan sighed, "I will take good care of him. After this incident, he should no longer be so foolish and naive."</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

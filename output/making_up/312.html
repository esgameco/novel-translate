        <h1>Chapter 312</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Leitong's face was gloomy, but in the depths of his eyes, there was a hidden sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>To be able to sneak in silently and confuse everyone, even he, the supreme expert, had not detected the slightest clue - what kind of ability was this?</p><p></p><p>What kind of power could achieve this?</p><p></p><p>Since the other party had done this, it meant they were not afraid of being discovered later, nor did they fear retaliation from the Leiyun Manor. They must have a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>Was it the Wanshi Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Leitong took a deep breath and said in a low voice, "You go back, I'll go to the Changqing Pavilion to investigate."</p><p></p><p>"Elder, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The others also understood that the Changqing Pavilion must have a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>After the others left, Leitong stood there, recalling his previous visits to the Changqing Pavilion, but he just couldn't figure out what had gone wrong.</p><p></p><p>"No, something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed.</p><p></p><p>He finally understood what was wrong.</p><p></p><p>In the past few days, there were injured martial artists lingering outside the Changqing Pavilion, but when they approached the Changqing Pavilion, everything was normal, and he didn't see any injured people seeking treatment.</p><p></p><p>This was obviously abnormal.</p><p></p><p>The injured people seeking treatment were all lined up far away, but when they approached the Changqing Pavilion, they couldn't be seen? Clearly, once he entered a certain range, he was bewitched, and everything he saw was an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Even the people! The more he thought about it, the more his scalp tingled. What kind of ability was this, that even he, a supreme expert, was bewitched, and with his powerful spiritual sense, he didn't detect it at all.</p><p></p><p>"I thought those martial artists were just curious and came to watch the Changqing Pavilion, but it turns out to be like this!"</p><p></p><p>Leitong muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Since he was a certain distance away from the Changqing Pavilion, those lined up to seek treatment were lazily gathered together, not in a neat queue, so he didn't realize they were martial artists seeking treatment.</p><p></p><p>"What a remarkable skill!"</p><p></p><p>Leitong moved swiftly towards the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Changqing Pavilion, the people seeking treatment were lined up, waiting to enter, including Cultivators of the Spirit Refining Realm, and he even saw an Elder from a Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>This Elder had been severely injured before, with his foundation damaged and his cultivation stagnant, and he had also consumed his lifespan. Yet, he was now waiting in line with some scattered cultivators, and even in front of him was a Great Celestial Realm martial artist who was sickly and had old injuries.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Leitong's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Something must have happened at the Changqing Pavilion, otherwise, how could a Spiritual Sect Elder queue up obediently like this? He took a deep breath and stepped into the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Get to the back of the line!"</p><p></p><p>A martial artist in the queue glared at him unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"What are you looking at? Do you think Spiritual Sect martial artists are so great? The other day, a Spiritual Sect martial artist who violated the rules was beaten to death. If you don't line up according to the rules, you won't get treatment."</p><p></p><p>The martial artist was not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Leitong snorted coldly, and a surge of aura instantly caused the martial artist to turn pale and collapse to the ground, trembling.</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists in the queue also shuddered in fear.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be... the Elder from the Leiyun Manor?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Sect martial artists in the queue recognized Leitong's attire and realized he was an Elder from the Leiyun Manor.</p><p></p><p>Leitong stepped into the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized that the Changqing Pavilion was different from what he had always seen.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and said in a low voice, "Changqing Pavilion, what a remarkable skill!"</p><p></p><p>He was almost bursting with anger. He, the Elder of the Leiyun Manor, a supreme expert who had condensed a thread of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles, was being toyed with like a monkey!</p><p></p><p>"Elder Lei, do you have any other business?" Yue'er asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, she had not noticed Leitong's barely contained rage.</p><p></p><p>The others glanced at Leitong briefly and then continued with their own tasks, completely ignoring him.</p><p></p><p>"After you return, take one of these three pills a day, and you will be fully healed," Meng Shushu said, handing three pills to an injured person.</p><p></p><p>"Next!"</p><p></p><p>He continued to diagnose and treat the patients in an orderly manner.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er asked Leitong a question, then went back to operating the diagnostic spiritual tool, while Meng Shushu and Shi Er were responsible for providing the prescribed pills.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yingfu was busy with the flying ship, helping to refine its shape.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming was in the corner, condensing the aura of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was sitting in a chair, leisurely sipping the spiritual tea brewed by Caili'er and watching Taocang.</p><p></p><p>No one paid any attention to Leitong's anger.</p><p></p><p>Leitong clenched his fists, trembling with rage, and the divine weapon on his waist was faintly emitting streaks of lightning, as if he was about to unleash a thunderous attack.</p><p></p><p>But he ultimately restrained himself.</p><p></p><p>Because he saw the powerful expert from the Hailing Clan, calmly brewing tea for a young man. The expert's aura was concealed, appearing like an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>But the more it was like this, the more Leitong was wary. This meant the expert had a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Leitong snorted coldly and said indifferently, "Changqing Pavilion, take care of yourselves!"</p><p></p><p>He turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Don't bother with him, he's just a clown."</p><p></p><p>"What a pathetic display of rage."</p><p></p><p>"Is he about to die from anger?"</p><p></p><p>"No, he's still a so-called supreme expert, he won't die from this."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu and Shi Er's voices came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>Leitong's eyes were bloodshot. How dare these weak ones mock him?</p><p></p><p>Outrageous! He gripped the divine weapon on his waist, ready to unleash a devastating attack and annihilate those two insignificant ants who dared to mock him!</p><p></p><p>"Ahem, you two, don't provoke him too much," Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>At Li Xuan's dry cough, Leitong suddenly felt his head pounding, and his spiritual sense was shaken, as if a thunderbolt had exploded in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His expression immediately turned horrified, and his eyes were filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, he hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful expert!"</p><p></p><p>Leitong was deeply shaken. No wonder the Changqing Pavilion was so fearless, they had such a formidable power backing them up. This was their foundation!</p><p></p><p>"Stronger than the Wutiannang? How is that possible!" Leitong's expression was grave as he hurriedly returned to the Leiyun Manor. This matter must be reported to the Manor Lord, as there was such a powerful existence in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Changqing Pavilion was gradually spreading, and the name of the Pill Fairy, Suli Xiu, was also becoming known throughout the Spiritual Realm. Many came from various states, attracted by the Pavilion's fame.</p><p></p><p>For example, Xu Yan had gone to the Dachuan State.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had slain the martial artists of the Thousand Martial Palace, and Meng Chong had swept through the Three Absolute Halls, with his Six-Zhang Golden Body, and so on.</p><p></p><p>As for Suli Xiu, she was also preparing to break through to the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Just a little more, and I can completely remember the Ninth Page of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles," Li Xuan was inwardly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Ninth Page was the summary of the Heavenly and Earthly Principles. Once he could remember it, it would mean he had thoroughly comprehended the Heavenly and Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>The refinement of the flying ship was also nearing completion, and Fang Hao was beaming with excitement, as his master's flying ship was about to be finished.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With this, he could now refine his own flying boat.</p><p></p><p>Having successfully refined his own flying boat, he could now set out to the Grand Alliance headquarters, as he had delayed for some time.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to display his divine might and subdue the prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally memorized it all."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put away the Taicangshu, having completely memorized the Heavenly Earthly Principles on the ninth page.</p><p></p><p>Squinting his eyes slightly, a web of Heavenly Earthly Principles appeared above his spiritual platform. His primordial spirit observed this web of principles, continuing to comprehend the Heavenly Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Heavenly Earthly Principles were so clear in his perception.</p><p></p><p>They corresponded perfectly with the Heavenly Earthly Principles he had memorized.</p><p></p><p>To a certain extent, he could even manipulate the Heavenly Earthly Principles for his own use.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with his current divine abilities, even though he had grasped the Heavenly Earthly Principles, the range he could control was still very limited.</p><p></p><p>"Once I enter the Divine Appearance Realm, the Heavenly Earthly Principles will be mine to command!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Divine Appearance Realm, with a mere wave of his hand, he could seize a Heavenly Earthly Principle as a weapon! This was mainly due to his comprehension of the Taicangshu's Heavenly Earthly Principles; otherwise, ordinary Divine Appearance Realm cultivators would be unable to freely grasp and use a principle as he could.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited, his strength having increased again. "When will Xue Yan be able to comprehend the divine martial dao techniques of the Divine Appearance Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"I've only just entered the Divine Abilities Realm, so I'm in no hurry. Next, I should continue compiling the Divine Abilities Martial Classics."</p><p></p><p>He opened the Taicangshu to the tenth page, curious to see if it would depict even higher-level Heavenly Earthly Principles. What he needed to do next was to compile the Divine Abilities Martial Classics while memorizing the content of the tenth page and recording it in the Great Dao Golden Book to obtain the information.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao techniques after the Indestructible Golden Body should also be pondered over."</p><p></p><p>According to his estimation, Meng Chong was about to break through the second layer of the Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The third layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body was the Divine Abilities Realm, and Li Xuan was also looking forward to what powerful divine abilities the martial dao techniques would give birth to.</p><p></p><p>"The tenth page is even more profound. Even with my Divine Abilities Realm cultivation, comprehending the Heavenly Earthly Principles, I would still find it difficult to memorize it in the short term."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the tenth page of the Taicangshu, Li Xuan sighed deeply.</p><p></p><p>The patterns depicted on the tenth page changed little, seeming constant, yet they were extremely profound. Even memorizing a single pattern would prove challenging for him, let alone grasping their profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, while he was studying the tenth page of the Taicangshu, the Great Dao Golden Book on his spiritual platform opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>This scene was already familiar to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan even observed it calmly, as it was either news that his disciple Xue Yan had killed enemies, or that Meng Chong had done so.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the third layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body. You have broken through the third layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put away the Taicangshu, his heart filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had comprehended the third layer of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body, and his martial dao techniques had also broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm. What kind of divine abilities would his physical martial dao techniques give birth to? At this moment, he felt his physical body was undergoing a sublime transformation, his divine essence further strengthening, and his primordial spirit becoming even more powerful, entering a wondrous state.</p><p></p><p>Both the orthodox martial dao and the physical martial dao had broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm.</p><p></p><p>His strength had naturally surged again.</p><p></p><p>"Your physical martial dao has broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm, granting you the divine ability 'Rebirth with a Single Thought'!"</p><p></p><p>Rebirth with a Single Thought! Li Xuan was greatly excited and elated.</p><p></p><p>"This divine ability is so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>With an indestructible primordial spirit, a single thought could restore the flesh and blood. As long as one's primordial spirit still lingered, even if the body was reduced to ashes, a single thought could resurrect the flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this divine ability, though powerful, had its limitations and could not be used endlessly.</p><p></p><p>Each time it was used, there would be a cooldown period to replenish the resurrection energy before it could be used again.</p><p></p><p>However, the higher the realm and the stronger the cultivator, the shorter the cooldown period would be. At a certain level, it might even be possible to use it repeatedly without interruption.</p><p></p><p>"As long as one is not instantly annihilated, one can rise again!"</p><p></p><p>This divine ability was akin to having an extra life.</p><p></p><p>If one's body was shattered, the primordial spirit could instantly activate the Returning to the Primal technique to evade the enemy's search, making them believe the cultivator had been completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Once the enemy had left, the cultivator could find a place to resurrect with a single thought, restoring the flesh and blood, and then hide to cultivate and strengthen themselves. When their power was sufficient, they could find the enemy and take revenge. This divine ability provided a chance for a fresh start!</p><p></p><p>"The divine abilities of the physical martial dao are indeed unique, with their extraordinary restorative powers."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"I can compile a similar divine ability in my Divine Abilities Martial Classics and give it to Xue Yan to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes lit up as he had a new idea.</p><p></p><p>"Your physical martial dao has broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm, and you have gained the divine ability 'Heaven and Earth Slash'."</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth Slash, with a single slash, could even sever the heavens and the earth! This was an offensive divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"When combined with the techniques of Heavenly Earthly Manifestation and Divine Annihilation, its power will be even greater!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very satisfied.</p><p></p><p>"Your physical martial dao has broken through to the Divine Abilities Realm, and you have gained the divine ability 'Heaven and Earth Wind and Thunder'."</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth Wind and Thunder, when unleashed, would transform the body into a great mountain, with wind and thunder at one's command, sweeping across the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>"The physical martial dao at the Divine Essence Realm has a Nine-Zhang Golden Body, while at the Divine Abilities Realm, it is an Eighteen-Zhang Golden Body. This divine ability is derived from that transformation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan understood.</p><p></p><p>"The physical martial dao has given birth to three divine abilities, which is not bad."</p><p></p><p>This time, the breakthrough of the physical martial dao to the Divine Abilities Realm had produced three divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face was filled with contentment, as his efforts in cultivating his disciples had not been in vain, and the harvest was bountiful.</p><p></p><p>"When Meng Chong breaks through, he will also receive divine ability feedback, and the divine abilities will increase further."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to Meng Chong's breakthrough to the Divine Abilities Realm.</p><p></p><p>"As for Su Ling Xiu, she should be close to comprehending the divine martial dao techniques of the Alchemy Martial Dao as well, right?"</p><p></p><p>The cultivation method of the Alchemy Martial Dao was similar to the orthodox martial dao, not much different. Xue Yan had already explained the techniques of the Divine Abilities Realm to Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>These days, Su Ling Xiu had been in deep contemplation, and she should be close to comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>"What divine abilities will the Alchemy Martial Dao breakthrough bring?"</p><p></p><p>The uniqueness of the Alchemy Martial Dao would surely give birth to distinctive divine abilities, perhaps related to longevity or the ability to heal injuries.</p><p></p><p>"Will it be extended lifespan or divine abilities to recover from injuries?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan speculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With his increased strength, Li Xuan's mood was excellent. When his mood was good, he would feel inclined to guide and instruct Shi Er, Meng Shu Shu, and Zhou Ying in their cultivation, passing on the techniques of the martial dao to them.</p><p></p><p>With a casual gesture, a Heavenly Earthly Principle force coalesced.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>He casually tossed the gathered Heavenly Earthly Principle force to Yue Chang Ming.</p><p></p><p>This was a fragment of Heavenly Earthly Principle force, far surpassing the mere Heavenly Earthly Principle aura.</p><p></p><p>Yue Chang Ming was greatly excited. After absorbing the Heavenly Earthly Principle force, he felt his divine soul had changed, as if it was about to be torn apart. He even sensed the presence of the Heavenly Earthly Principles.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, senior, for bestowing this opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Chang Ming respectfully bowed, then hurriedly continued his cultivation, comprehending and refining the Heavenly Earthly Principle force.</p><p></p><p>What a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Yue Chang Ming believed that once he had refined this fragment of Heavenly Earthly Principle force, even the transcendent cultivators of the Spirit Sect would be no match for him.</p>

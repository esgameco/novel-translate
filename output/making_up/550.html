        <h1>Chapter 550</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not know about the changes that had occurred in Hongze Heaven and Earth after he left, nor did he know about the existence of the mysterious jade figure, which had already moved to a different location and continued to hide.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, are you sure someone is approaching?" Xu Yan asked Canghai Turtle after returning to the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"I'm fairly certain," Canghai Turtle replied, looking in the direction the sound was coming from and stating his judgment.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, someone is indeed approaching. If it's really people from the Immortal Temple, that would be perfect. I hope it's those three we encountered before," Xu Yan said with a nod.</p><p></p><p>"What happened inside Hongze Heaven and Earth?" Canghai Turtle couldn't help asking curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Nothing happened!" Xu Yan shook his head. </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and the other two also nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"That's not right. I saw some unusual things inside Hongze Heaven and Earth," Canghai Turtle said in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"What did you discover?" Xu Yan asked in surprise. </p><p></p><p>This old turtle had been so scared just looking at Hongze Heaven and Earth, yet he dared to keep staring at it and noticed some anomalies? Canghai Turtle explained his findings and said solemnly, "I thought you might have encountered enemies!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "I thought it was something else. So that's what it was - just some disturbance caused by my breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle was stunned. "You had a breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Gulp! Canghai Turtle swallowed and asked cautiously, "What level of strength are you at now?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled and said, "Chopping off your head, you old turtle, shouldn't be too much of a problem!"</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle was shocked. </p><p></p><p>He thought back to when he first met Xu Yan and how weak he was then. How much time had passed? And now he already had the strength to kill a minor Heavenly Lord? At this rate of improvement, it wouldn't be long before he rivaled Tai Cang, and then surpassed the former Tai Cang! When it came to being a prodigy, Xu Yan was truly unmatched!</p><p></p><p>"In that case, if the people coming are those three from the Immortal Temple, we don't need to fear them?" Canghai Turtle asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not. It'll be perfect for honing my sword skills," Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned and said, "Our strength has also improved. I wonder if the three of us together could take on a Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle sighed inwardly. Meng Chong and the other two would likely surpass him before long as well.</p><p></p><p>He thought about how he had lived for such an incredibly long time, yet these people could casually surpass him after just a few decades or a hundred years of cultivation. It made him feel utterly useless. Even that streak of purple light from the world's creation wasn't much help - it had only given him a tiny bit of enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>Of course, Canghai Turtle knew that Xu Yan and the other three were able to increase their strength so rapidly and become such prodigies all thanks to the powerful martial arts passed down by their master and his excellent guidance.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Dao Ancestor!" Canghai Turtle sighed inwardly, then felt a bit delighted. Wasn't he now considered one of the Dao Ancestor's disciples too? Thinking of this, Canghai Turtle felt grateful for his decision to give Xu Yan the Primordial Turtle Shell back then.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!" Xu Yan's eyes lit up as he looked into the distance.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle and Meng Chong's group followed his gaze and faintly perceived three figures slowly approaching.</p><p></p><p>That spirit beast was probably too terrified to come any closer, so these three had abandoned it and were advancing very cautiously.</p><p></p><p>"Should we ambush them or confront them directly?" Canghai Turtle asked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's confront them directly. It'll be good practice for my sword skills," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright. Meng Chong and I should be able to hold off two of them," Canghai Turtle nodded.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to complicate things. I'll use my full strength in one sword strike to kill one of them. Of the remaining two, I'll use one to hone my sword skills. You and my junior brothers can handle the other one," Xu Yan said. He looked at Meng Chong's group and continued, "A weak Realm Lord's strength is just right for my junior brothers to practice their martial arts. They can fully display their divine abilities without worrying about overwhelming the opponent. The opponent also won't have the power to crush them, but can still pose a threat. It's perfect for practice."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned and clenched his fists. "Senior Brother makes a good point!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Jiang Buping also nodded with smiles.</p><p></p><p>"It's decided then. After we kill these three, we'll discuss how to deal with Hongze Heaven and Earth," Xu Yan said. With that, he stepped forward, making no attempt to conceal his aura as he went to meet the approaching figures.</p><p></p><p>"It's a creature of this world!" the three Realm Lords from the Immortal Temple exclaimed in delight as Xu Yan appeared.</p><p></p><p>"It's one of those four who escaped before. They've also come for Hongze Heaven and Earth. We can't let them get away this time!" One of them said sternly as he swiftly moved to attack Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Surrender now!" he said with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle and Meng Chong's group also revealed themselves, heading straight for the other two Immortal Temple Realm Lords. Canghai Turtle manifested his enormous body, with blue light surging like giant waves.</p><p></p><p>"You won't escape this time!" The remaining two Immortal Temple Realm Lords advanced to meet Canghai Turtle and Meng Chong's group instead of retreating.</p><p></p><p>"Remember this - the one who kills you is Sword Immortal Xu Yan!" Xu Yan said to the Realm Lord attacking him, his gaze intense. He raised his hand and a gray-white sword appeared.</p><p></p><p>This gray-white sword had no sharp aura or surging sword intent. It seemed somewhat empty and heavy, as if ordinary and without much power.</p><p></p><p>The Sword of Death! This was what Xu Yan had comprehended - the meaning and power representing death in the world.</p><p></p><p>Swish! Xu Yan swung the sword without holding back. It was his strongest strike at his current level.</p><p></p><p>The gray-white sword vanished in an instant, reappearing the next moment as it slashed towards the attacking Immortal Temple Realm Lord. The Realm Lord's expression turned to horror as dark energy surged around him and he swung a curved blade to counter.</p><p></p><p>But to his shock, the gray-white sword seemed intangible, almost illusory, as if condensed from pure intent. His strike to block the gray-white sword failed, and it passed through his curved blade, slashing down directly.</p><p></p><p>Realizing something was wrong, he tried to change tactics to defend against this strange gray-white sword, but it was too late. He could only let out a low roar as powerful energy surged around him to form a strong defense.</p><p></p><p>He used all his secret techniques in that moment, even burning his own essence to create a powerful protective barrier. </p><p></p><p>As the gray-white sword approached, he sensed the intent of death.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The gray-white sword penetrated his defenses and slashed into his body.</p><p></p><p>Death descended!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the Realm Lord's expression was one of horror. He felt his life force being eroded, his physical body withering, his soul extinguishing. The terrifying intent of death filled him completely.</p><p></p><p>"You-!" He looked at Xu Yan in shock, but Xu Yan had already moved on after that one sword strike, heading straight for one of the two remaining Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The Immortal Temple Realm Lord's aura was extinguished, his body withered, and his soul had died and dissipated. In an instant he had become a desiccated corpse, as if dead for a long time!</p><p></p><p>Killed in one strike!</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xu Yan had already intercepted</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Among the two remaining people, a world of swords appeared in the sky, directly enveloping the opponent.</p><p></p><p>"Come spar with me and hone my sword skills!" </p><p></p><p>That Realm Lord's expression was terrified. "You... how is this possible?!"</p><p></p><p>With one sword strike, he had killed a companion no weaker than himself. To kill him would surely be effortless as well? At this moment, his heart trembled in fear, wanting to flee and escape.</p><p></p><p>"Escape? You cannot escape. Give it your all, and perhaps you'll have a slight chance of survival!" Xu Yan said with a calm smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'll fight you to the death!" That Realm Lord looked around, as if trapped in a world. Knowing escape was nearly impossible, his only choice was to fight desperately!</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it!" Xu Yan laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Sword intent manifested as Xu Yan began using his opponent to hone his sword skills from start to finish, verifying new sword techniques and confirming whether certain insights were correct.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and that Realm Lord fought fiercely. The sword world shook violently, yet remained unbroken. The shockwaves from their battle could not spread beyond the sword world.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Canghai Gui stood ready to intervene at any moment, blocking killing moves from the Buhua Divine Palace member while also guarding against his escape.</p><p></p><p>Of the three Realm Lords, one had instantly perished, another was locked in bitter combat. The situation looked unfavorable no matter how you viewed it, so this one would certainly be thinking of escape.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had not transformed into a giant. He merely wore golden armor, like a muscular man clad in golden battle gear. His divine might was awe-inspiring as he freely unleashed various martial arts divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao directly arranged a grand Qimen formation. His form moved through the formation, using its power to restrain and interfere with the opponent. He also used the Qimen weapon box to shoot out countless divine weapons like a torrential flood.</p><p></p><p>Combining formations with the grand Qimen formation, each step was a new formation, unpredictable and impossible to grasp. Using puppet bodies to confuse the opponent and draw away killing moves.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping wielded an ultimate soul weapon, freely using divine abilities to hone his martial arts and continuously attack the opponent's divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The three joined forces to battle that Realm Lord from Buhua Divine Palace. Though they could not overcome him, they freely displayed their martial arts divine abilities and accumulated valuable experience.</p><p></p><p>That Realm Lord was terrified in his heart. He attacked frantically, but although he held the upper hand, he was unable to break through their joint defenses or harm his enemies.</p><p></p><p>The great battle erupted in the Buhua territory. Thunderous sounds spread throughout the area, shattering the silence of this region.</p><p></p><p>Though the commotion could not compare to a battle between World Lords, it was still extremely intense, spreading over a vast distance.</p><p></p><p>This martial arts training session lasted for three days.</p><p></p><p>The two Realm Lords from Buhua Divine Palace tried to escape more than once, but were unable to break free. They could only continue fighting desperately.</p><p></p><p>"That's about enough!" Xu Yan looked at his opponent with a smile. It was time to end this martial arts training session.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A sword strike slashed out.</p><p></p><p>That Realm Lord was panting heavily, but his eyes were cold and now held a hint of madness.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He raised his hand to attack. Dark energy surged around him, condensing into a powerful force that entangled the incoming sword!</p><p></p><p>Swish! The two collided, and that sword shattered. Just as he was about to breathe a sigh of relief and attack Xu Yan again, something shocking happened.</p><p></p><p>A golden true dragon burst forth from the shattered sword!</p><p></p><p>As if its rest had been disturbed, the enraged true dragon let out a terrifying roar and violently charged forward.</p><p></p><p>The furious golden dragon seemed intent on perishing together with the enemy. Dragon might surged as the violent power of the true dragon was concentrated in this single strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The true dragon smashed through his defenses, then suddenly exploded. The terrifying dragon might and true dragon power tore at his physical body and divine soul. Intense pain coursed through him.</p><p></p><p>Ahh! An anguished scream rang out, followed by his body exploding. Under the sweeping dragon might, he turned to ash!</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: Dragon's Fury!</p><p></p><p>"Divine ability hidden within divine ability, layer upon layer, impossible to defend against. There's still room to explore in using divine abilities this way!" Xu Yan had a smug expression. The Dragon's Fury divine ability was hidden within his sword divine ability. When the sword divine ability was broken, Dragon's Fury immediately followed, impossible to defend against.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with his opponent, Xu Yan looked towards the battle where Meng Chong and the others were fighting.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the remaining Realm Lord was terrified. He was using secret techniques, trying to break out of the encirclement and escape.</p><p></p><p>Too frightening!</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, these four had been fleeing in a hurry from their pursuit. How much time had passed? Yet now they possessed the strength to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Either they had deliberately hidden their true abilities last time, or their strength had increased dramatically in a short time.</p><p></p><p>He leaned towards the latter possibility.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that some supreme treasure had appeared in the Hongze World, allowing such a rapid increase in strength?</p><p></p><p>"Junior brothers, you can try layering divine abilities!" Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Gui and that Buhua Divine Palace Realm Lord didn't know what layering divine abilities meant, but Meng Chong and the other two immediately understood and began practicing the technique of layering divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Taking advantage of the moment when the three were unfamiliar with layering divine abilities, that Buhua Divine Palace Realm Lord found an opening and escaped. His form moved to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Get back here!" Xu Yan slashed out with his sword, directly forcing the opponent back.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Gui swallowed. He felt that with his powerful defenses, he might be able to withstand 10 or 20 sword strikes from Xu Yan, rather than being killed in one strike.</p><p></p><p>"If even my defenses can't withstand it, who among the minor World Lords could be Xu Yan's match?" Canghai Gui marveled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Taihe, Taikun and Taimiao? Although they are stronger, they definitely couldn't defeat Xu Yan. They couldn't overcome him. The current Xu Yan, while not the number one among minor World Lords, is among the top ranks. Moreover, his killing power against those weaker than himself is even stronger."</p><p></p><p>The more Canghai Gui thought about it, the more he marveled at Xu Yan's rapid growth.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his martial killing power exceeded imagination.</p><p></p><p>Strong experts like Taihe and Taikun would need to spend some time and engage in a great battle to kill a Realm Lord weaker than themselves.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan could kill them in just two or three moves, and wasn't afraid of being surrounded.</p><p></p><p>This was mainly because Xu Yan's martial arts were so wondrous and his killing power so great that Taihe and the others' martial arts couldn't compare.</p><p></p><p>More importantly, Xu Yan's martial arts seemed to have a certain crushing effect even against Taicang martial arts. For those slightly weaker, defending against Xu Yan's martial attacks was far more difficult than against experts who also cultivated Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping layered their divine abilities, interweaving them together as they struck at that Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Binding, sealing, attacking the physical body, attacking the divine soul - multi-faceted divine abilities erupted layer after layer. After blocking one, there were more that followed in rapid succession, extremely abrupt.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Under this strike, that Realm Lord was severely injured.</p><p></p><p>"He's still not dead!" Meng Chong was surprised for a moment, then let out a low roar. A towering giant figure appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: Heaven Supporting Earth Destroying!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This divine ability not only contained the violent power of Heaven Supporting Earth Destroying, but also secretly incorporated Jiang Buping's Extreme Soul divine ability, Fang Hao's Sealing divine ability, and Meng Chong's own Great Sun Annihilation divine ability!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

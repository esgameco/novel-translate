            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 73 - Fierce Battle, Breakthrough of the Descending Dragon Palm (Seeking Monthly Votes)</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan's strength was not weak, and his Descending Dragon Palm technique was unparalleled in its ferocity, in terms of combat experience, he was naturally far inferior to Xue Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>At the moment when Xu Yan's Descending Dragon Palm struck out and a sudden opening appeared above his head, Xu Yan's heart jolted as he realized the problem.</p><p></p><p>However, this fleeting opportunity, for the battle-hardened Xue Wuxin who had experienced life-and-death battles, was enough to determine the outcome of life and death.</p><p></p><p>His figure soared through the air, and his long saber gleamed with a chilling light as it descended from midair.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan only felt his scalp tingle, his hairs stand on end, and a strong sense of crisis suddenly descended upon him. At this moment, it was too late for him to try to block the attack with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, an octagonal diagram flashed in his mind, and in that critical moment of crisis, he shifted his footsteps, his figure wavering and disappearing from the spot.</p><p></p><p>The next moment, he reappeared a dozen feet away.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A deep gash appeared on the ground, where Xue Wuxin's saber had ruthlessly struck.</p><p></p><p>He was deeply shaken! </p><p></p><p>At such a critical moment, the opponent had actually evaded, and what kind of technique was that?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was still pounding violently, his qi and blood boiling, and a huge dragon coiled around him, its aura growing increasingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>Just now, he had almost died!</p><p></p><p>If it hadn't been for the octagonal diagram that flashed in his mind in that crisis, giving him a sudden insight and allowing him to comprehend a new technique, that strike would have been impossible to evade.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was filled with shock and fury.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, disappearing from the spot, and in an instant, he appeared beside Xue Wuxin, the Descending Dragon Palm striking out with a thunderous force.</p><p></p><p>Spatial Shift!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's gaze was cold and sharp, his saber technique unfolding, the chilling sword qi criss-crossing and constantly pressing forward with overwhelming strength, continuously dissipating one Descending Dragon Palm after another.</p><p></p><p>Forced to constantly use the Spatial Shift technique to dodge and change positions, a few strands of blood-sucking vampire threads began to spread out from Xue Wuxin's body, covering the surroundings like a giant net.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze grew serious; the opponent's strength was slightly superior to his own. Especially that ruthless swordplay and the eerie, icy aura, both were extremely bizarre. </p><p></p><p>If it weren't for his vast and blazing qi and blood that could ignore the invasion of the icy aura, he might have already become stiff-limbed with a greatly reduced combat ability.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned deeply, the battle growing increasingly fierce, his mind becoming clearer, with no more distractions, fully immersed in the fight.</p><p></p><p>The octagonal diagram appeared in his mind, and with a shift of his footsteps, he changed positions.</p><p></p><p>The Spatial Shift technique became more and more skilled with the progression of the battle.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The mighty Descending Dragon Palm was once again shattered by one of Xue Wuxin's sword strikes.</p><p></p><p>The sharp sword light came slashing, and Xu Yan shifted his position again to evade.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the incantation of the Descending Dragon Palm surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood began to boil even more, his entire being seemingly in a state of excitement. Suddenly, he let out a roar, his two palms pushing out in an interchange, unleashing a massive Descending Dragon Palm force that split into eighteen giant dragons mid-trajectory, instantly enveloping Xue Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Palm had reached its pinnacle!</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin grew increasingly alarmed in the battle, the opponent's realm should not be higher than his own, and his strength should not surpass his either.</p><p></p><p>Yet, that tyrannical palm force, with its astonishing might, even though he tried to cut it down, he found it somewhat difficult.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the transformation of the dragon-shaped palm forces kept forming converging attacks against him.</p><p></p><p>"This kid is a bit troublesome, actually not fearing my blood demon qi at all, and even able to counter my blood demon qi!" </p><p></p><p>That blazing qi and blood kept dissipating his icy aura.</p><p></p><p>The more it was so, the stronger his desire grew. As long as he could devour the opponent, his strength would advance further.</p><p></p><p>He had never seen a warrior with such powerful qi and blood. That refined essence blood contained an immense spiritual aura.</p><p></p><p>Among the inner realm cultivators, no one could have such pure essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Even Grandmasters did not possess it!</p><p></p><p>The eighteen giant dragons converged in an attack, but Xue Wuxin's sword light surged, sweeping away the Descending Dragon Palm force in an instant, his speed reaching the pinnacle, ruthlessly striking towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Slash after slash, with his fierce attacks, Xu Yan once again fell into a disadvantageous position.</p><p></p><p>And the Spatial Shift technique was used more and more frequently, constantly evading, but he was not the least bit flustered, his gaze firmly fixed on Xue Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>His jade-like physique was shining brilliantly, his qi and blood seemingly endless.</p><p></p><p>"...Its majesty shakes the world, its wrath startles heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the incantation of the Descending Dragon Palm surfaced in his mind, and in the midst of the battle, he gained a sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"My Descending Dragon Palm, although its might is astonishing and seemingly tyrannical, it lacks the true 'majesty' and cannot startle heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>'Its majesty shakes the world, its wrath startles heaven and earth.' Without wrath, how can it startle heaven and earth? My Descending Dragon Palm lacks 'majesty,' lacks 'wrath,' and wrath is what can startle heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind became clear, the realization dawning on him, and in an instant, he seemed to have broken through a bottleneck in his understanding of the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, he halted his movements, and then thrust out a palm.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike was vastly different from the previous ones.</p><p></p><p>The moment the palm force was unleashed, it seemed to emit a whistling sound, a sense of chilling majesty radiating outwards.</p><p></p><p>This dragon-shaped palm force was more substantial, possessing an aura of divinity.</p><p></p><p>The speed had also increased explosively in that instant.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>The giant dragon opened its mouth, seemingly letting out a roar, and ruthlessly charged towards Xue Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!" </p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's heart trembled, and he struck out with a sword, but this sword strike did not shatter the palm force. Instead, it carried a vast, surging might, like a towering mountain crashing down, the power undiminished as the dragon's tail swept across.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" </p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's expression changed slightly, and he leapt up to evade the attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Another giant dragon came rumbling in.</p><p></p><p>One dragon after another kept roaring in, each exuding a chilling majesty, and Xue Wuxin's heart tightened as he stared at Xu Yan in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Has he broken through?"</p><p></p><p>What a demonic prodigy!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exhaled the foul air from his chest, his eyes gleaming with a sharp light. He had comprehended it!</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Palm had broken through its bottleneck, stepping into a new realm.</p><p></p><p>"Its wrath startles heaven and earth, I still cannot make the dragon-shaped palm forces truly 'wrathful,' truly possess the aura of 'wrath,' but I can manifest it in another way!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Xue Wuxin who was being pressed in the converging Descending Dragon Palm forces, and now it was his turn.</p><p></p><p>Let this unknown warrior, who seemed to be at the Innate Realm, witness the true power of the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>"My current Descending Dragon Palm should be at the Second Realm, right? I have broken through the Descending Dragon Palm realm and entered the Second Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, I'm only at the Qi and Blood Realm, unable to fully unleash the power of the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>"But it should be enough to deal with this guy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mind was enlightened, realizing that he had cultivated the Descending Dragon Palm to the Second Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The eighteen giant dragons converged on Xue Wuxin, and just as Xue Wuxin was about to unleash his fierce sword light to try to cut down the palm force, his heart suddenly jumped.</p><p></p><p>Danger!</p><p></p><p>A strong sense of crisis instantly surfaced.</p><p></p><p>The battle experience forged in life-and-death situations made him decisively channel his qi and soar into the air, his sword light sweeping upwards.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wanting to break out from the combined attack.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous explosion!</p><p></p><p>The eighteen dragon palm forces, the moment they converged, suddenly erupted in full force, the giant dragon bursting open, the ferocious power instantly striking towards Blood Wuxin!</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin's expression changed, he let out a light shout, the yin qi rolling and surging around his body, his long saber whipping up layer upon layer of saber qi, resisting this violent and savage power.</p><p></p><p>He never imagined that the eighteen giant dragons could instantly burst open and condense an unparalleled savage force.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!</p><p></p><p>"This is not a normal martial artist, how can there be such a cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>Even in the inner domain, even for grand masters, it is impossible to suddenly explode the projected palm force when necessary.</p><p></p><p>Once the palm force is unleashed, how can it be controlled freely?</p><p></p><p>It's impossible!</p><p></p><p>This border youth is not normal!</p><p></p><p>What kind of cultivation method is this?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The saber qi shattered, the tyrannical power of the dragon palm force, and the scorching aura attached to it, seemed to be evaporating the yin cold aura on his body.</p><p></p><p>Causing Blood Wuxin to feel extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"I, the lord, will definitely destroy you!" </p><p></p><p>The disheveled Blood Wuxin spoke with malice.</p><p></p><p>However, greeting him again were eighteen giant dragons, once again forming a combined attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Do you think you can destroy me?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was elated, completely unconcerned by Blood Wuxin's threat.</p><p></p><p>Palm after palm he struck out, each time it was eighteen giant dragons in a combined attack, instantly exploding, forming a savage and mighty power, descending upon Blood Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to him condensing the eighteen dragon palm forces into a momentary explosion.</p><p></p><p>This momentary explosion was the embodiment of Xu Yan's comprehension of 'Anger'.</p><p></p><p>Due to his still weak strength, he could not fully manifest it, so he could only present the power of 'Anger' in this way.</p><p></p><p>The effect was extremely good.</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension was indeed correct!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This intense battle had reaped a bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>Shifting and changing positions, he had comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>After the Dragon Palm reached its pinnacle, he had broken through again, comprehending the second layer of the Dragon Palm!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's qi and blood seemed endless, palm after palm he struck out, continuously pounding against Blood Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Wuxin was in a passive state of being hit, attempting to break out several times, only to be blasted back by the eighteen giant dragons.</p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that the palm force of the other party was becoming stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>He could even sense a 'Fury' from the palm force.</p><p></p><p>Absurd!</p><p></p><p>It was truly absurd!</p><p></p><p>Yet, this absurd scene was unfolding before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Blood Wuxin felt a sense of emptiness.</p><p></p><p>His injuries had relapsed a bit.</p><p></p><p>The consumption was too great.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it, why doesn't he get exhausted?" </p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin was furious and shocked.</p><p></p><p>He, the renowned demonic sect grand master, was actually being beaten into a sorry state by a youth in this border region!</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, Blood Wuxin was a famous and formidable demonic sect grand master!</p><p></p><p>If this got out, who would believe it?</p><p></p><p>"I can't continue fighting like this!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin knew that if he kept passively taking the beating, he would eventually be exhausted to death. </p><p></p><p>He might even be beaten to death by the other party.</p><p></p><p>He could sense that the other party's palm force was becoming more and more savage and tyrannical, the might growing stronger.</p><p></p><p>These dragon-shaped palm forces had become increasingly solid, and the savage power bursting forth carried a faint aura of 'Fury'.</p><p></p><p>"Bind!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin's long saber whipped up saber qi, the yin cold aura on his body suddenly becoming much denser.</p><p></p><p>The densely packed, spider web-like blood-sucking demon threads covering the battlefield instantly contracted, rushing towards Xu Yan to bind him.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled, those densely packed threads with a yin cold aura, although constantly melting under his scorching qi and blood, were too numerous.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized that he was actually trapped within the other party's set up web.</p><p></p><p>"I was careless! Lack of experience!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, he was not panicked.</p><p></p><p>These threads looked sinister, and although formidable, they should not be able to withstand his powerful qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Hundred-zhang qi and blood swept out, a giant dragon coiled, carrying a terrifying might, sweeping towards the enveloping giant web.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the threads were shattering and disappearing.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the entire giant web was dissolved by the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin took the opportunity to break free.</p><p></p><p>He did not expect the blood-sucking demon threads to truly threaten Xu Yan, it was only to disperse Xu Yan's power and seize the chance to break free.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was soaring in the air, a hundred zhang above.</p><p></p><p>Looking down at Xu Yan, the saber light swept down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan leapt up, striking out a palm.</p><p></p><p>However, with his qi and blood realm, he could not soar in the air, although leaping a hundred zhang was not a problem, Blood Wuxin could constantly distance himself, while he could not get close.</p><p></p><p>Hopping and jumping, he was already at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>The attack range of the Dragon Palm was only a hundred zhang.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin, hundreds of zhang away, launched attacks, a stream of piercing saber qi constantly pouring down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan could only passively defend, striking out a wave of Dragon Palm forces to block the attacks.</p><p></p><p>Occasionally he would leap up, trying to get close and attack Blood Wuxin, but the experienced and cunning Blood Wuxin would immediately distance himself when his advantage was about to disappear.</p><p></p><p>In this way, Xu Yan fell into a passive state.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a stream of saber light poured down, icy and terrifying, slashing out a series of trenches on the ground.</p><p></p><p>And on the ground, a line of scarlet giant dragons rose up, striking towards the saber light, the attacks colliding in mid-air with thunderous roars.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued.</p><p></p><p>The inn had been completely destroyed, not a trace remaining.</p><p></p><p>This official road had also collapsed in the great battle, no longer passable.</p><p></p><p>Trenches crisscrossed the ground, one huge pit after another.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding mountains and forests had also been devastated.</p><p></p><p>"I, Blood Wuxin, am a grand master realm martial artist, I refuse to believe I can't exhaust you to death!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin's eyes revealed a malicious glint.</p><p></p><p>He would not hesitate to pay any price, as long as he could annihilate this person.</p><p></p><p>Devouring his essence and blood, any price would be worth it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, let's see what you can do to me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked up at the hovering Blood Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>His eyes still filled with fighting spirit, if he could soar in the air, he would definitely smash the other party to death!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the powerful foundation of the Jade Bone realm martial artist was being fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood surged, constantly rippling, even after such an intense battle, Xu Yan's qi and blood remained undiminished, not feeling the slightest sense of excessive consumption.</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin started coughing.</p><p></p><p>The feeling of emptiness in his body was becoming more and more intense, his injuries were about to relapse.</p><p></p><p>The consumption was too great.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, seeing the still high-spirited Xu Yan, palm after palm striking out, full of energy, not showing the slightest sign of exhaustion or weakness, Blood Wuxin had a helpless expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>It was he, the grand master, who could not endure it!</p><p></p><p>Even though he was injured, he was still a grand master!</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a prodigy existing in this border region?</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

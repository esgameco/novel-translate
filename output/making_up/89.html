        <h1>Chapter 89</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 89: Changing the Heavens and Earth, the Great Gathering of the Wu Nation's Rivers and Lakes</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll have someone notify him to come over another day."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt relieved when he saw his master agree.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was not bad, and could be considered Xu Yan's first martial arts friend. Moreover, Xie Lingfeng had contributed to Xu Yan's breakthrough in understanding the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Master, my shidi is contemplating the profound principles of the Bagua. I've discovered that his insights are different from mine, so I'd like to discuss and verify them with him, perhaps leading to new realizations."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sought his master's opinion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi paused, suddenly realizing a question. The Bagua was something he needed to pass down to each of his disciples, and their realizations would naturally differ.</p><p></p><p>If they discussed and exchanged insights, would it not trigger even more realizations? This was not limited to the Bagua, but also applied to the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Certainly, Xu Yan cultivated the orthodox martial dao, while Meng Chong cultivated the physical martial dao. However, since they were both on the martial path, they could certainly verify each other's insights.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the disciples could gain realizations from this, adding more richness to the great cause of the martial dao. And he himself could also reap greater harvests.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, Li Xuanyi nodded and said, "The Bagua contains the profound principles of heaven and earth. The realizations of each person, at their respective stages, will differ. Discussing and exchanging insights is also a way to promote realizations.</p><p></p><p>"You and Meng Chong have this idea, which is good. As fellow disciples, verifying and elevating each other's martial dao realizations, be it orthodox martial dao or physical martial dao, your respective insights on the martial dao may bring new enlightenment to each other, allowing you to comprehend even more of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up excitedly as he replied, "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Go then," Li Xuanyi nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong should have also nearly realized his body technique by now, right?" Li Xuanyi mused.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden finger feedback came.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has reached small success in the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, breaking through to the Qi and Blood Realm. Your physical strength has received a certain degree of enhancement!"</p><p></p><p>Physical strength enhancement!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi felt his own physique instantly become more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's small breakthrough did not bring a large feedback, only about a twofold increase in his physical strength.</p><p></p><p>Currently, with two disciples, the harvests were not small. Li Xuanyi couldn't help but ponder whether he should accept a third disciple. What martial dao technique should he create for the third disciple?</p><p></p><p>Disciples were about quality, not quantity. After all, creating a powerful new technique was not an easy task, especially a strong one.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go out and wander around more? Staying in Yunshan County all the time, how can I recruit new disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of his transmigration that he ended up trapped in this small mountain village, unable to leave, causing him to become more reclusive.</p><p></p><p>Especially since he no longer needed to strive and cultivate arduously to improve his strength and obtain various resources - his disciples could handle it all, making him even more unwilling to move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought of the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect, that young girl.</p><p></p><p>"That young girl's medical skills are not bad, and she can even persuade evil people to reform. I wonder about her aptitude? If she didn't come to Yunshan County, as a high-level expert like myself, I wouldn't have a reason to specifically take her as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the martial dao ultimately requires some auxiliary support, such as medicinal pills... Let me think, can I create a martial dao technique related to medicinal pills?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>He already had ideas for a third martial dao branch.</p><p></p><p>The only question was how to create it, and it would require a suitable disciple who could comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>This required a certain foundation.</p><p></p><p>How could the cultivation of the martial dao lack medicinal pills?</p><p></p><p>For geniuses like Xu Yan and Meng Chong who cultivate the martial dao, they may not need medicinal pill assistance. But for other ordinary martial artists, they might very well need it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if there were suitable medicinal pills, they could also assist in refining the golden bones.</p><p></p><p>Although the golden bones refined with the aid of medicinal pills would not be as pure and powerful as those refined through one's own innate talent, they would still be golden bones. The foundation of the martial dao far surpasses that of bronze bones.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm should have some medicinal concoctions or the like that can assist in martial dao cultivation, right? When Xie Lingfeng comes, I'll try to get him to reveal some methods from the Inner Realm. With a reference, it will be easier to create one."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi made his plans.</p><p></p><p>Outside Yunshan County, in the mountain forests.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong stood on the Bagua diagram.</p><p></p><p>"This is Qian, representing Heaven. This is Kun, representing Earth..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped on the Bagua diagram, explaining his realizations and understanding one by one.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened quietly, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, this is the Lightness Crane Body Technique that I've comprehended."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan demonstrated the Lightness Crane Body Technique, his figure fluttering, swift and silent. He also described in detail how he had realized this technique.</p><p></p><p>Then, as his footsteps crossed, his figure instantly changed positions.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Shifting Position, which I suddenly realized during my battle with Xue Wuxin."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also explained the Shifting Position.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened with admiration and said, "Shixiong, your talent is superior to mine."</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, it's just that our talents are focused on different aspects."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, this is my realization."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also shared the insights he had gained on the Bagua in recent days.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Some of Meng Chong's realizations were things he had never thought of.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers then began to discuss and verify each other's realizations, starting with body techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's explanation of the Shifting Position provided a direction for Meng Chong's contemplation. This Shifting Position technique did not seem very suitable for Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>So he needed to contemplate and realize a body technique that fit his own style.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Xu Yan and Meng Chong would exchange realizations on the Bagua diagram, with Xu Yan mostly lecturing on his insights into body techniques.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi watched silently, greatly amazed: "So the Bagua can be contemplated in this way? Even I, as their master, didn't know this. These disciples are impressive, their realizations are becoming more and more!"</p><p></p><p>He felt that Meng Chong was about to realize his body technique.</p><p></p><p>In the process of exchanging realizations, Xu Yan also gained new insights, though it was unknown what powerful body technique he would realize.</p><p></p><p>After observing a few times, Li Xuanyi stopped paying attention and instead instructed Shi Er and Lian Zang.</p><p></p><p>On this day, it was as usual.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi lay in the chair, leisurely contemplating the possibilities of various martial dao branches and how to create powerful and profound ones.</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has realized the Horizontal Shift, your Horizontal Shift has reached mastery."</p><p></p><p>Horizontal Shift!</p><p></p><p>This was similar to but different from the Shifting Position. The Horizontal Shift was about instantly shifting horizontally, left or right, forward or backward, or even up and down.</p><p></p><p>The direction of the horizontal shift was relatively fixed, but since it could be performed in a continuous sequence, it also meant that the position could be constantly changed.</p><p></p><p>This was a true combat-oriented body technique, instantly closing in on the enemy or instantly creating distance, similar to the Shifting Position but with its own unique characteristics.</p><p></p><p>The Horizontal Shift fit Meng Chong's style better, with his powerful physique.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Way of the Martial Arts, once it comes to close-quarters combat, he has more advantages.</p><p></p><p>The suitable is the best.</p><p></p><p>"Spatial Shift + Lateral Shift, you have mastered the Heavenly Transformation. Your Heavenly Transformation has reached perfection."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Finger continued to provide feedback.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Transformation!</p><p></p><p>This is a fusion of Spatial Shift and Lateral Shift, even more profound and elusive.</p><p></p><p>If the strength is powerful enough, the heavens and earth can be reversed, changing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited: "What a wonderful disciple, you have again contributed to my grand martial arts undertaking!"</p><p></p><p>His strength has increased again.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic disciples gathered together, exchanging martial arts, can mutually promote and help with the comprehension of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the cultivation methods I've given to my disciples are all different. By mutually exchanging and verifying, they can better comprehend new martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>"The exchange between Xu Yan and Meng Chong, orthodox martial arts and physical martial arts, they should also gain new insights and harvests from each other.</p><p></p><p>"If successful, the feedback from the Golden Finger will greatly promote the development of my martial arts undertaking."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to his two disciples continuing to comprehend powerful martial arts techniques for him.</p><p></p><p>The more martial arts techniques he obtained, the more cultivation methods he mastered, the easier it would be for him to compile new techniques in the future, without lacking direction.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong comprehended the Lateral Shift technique, his whole person filled with excitement, he had finally grasped a movement art suitable for himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have finally comprehended a movement technique."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said excitedly after returning.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, it's just that your technique has some limitations. It's suitable for combat, but if it's for long-distance travel or chasing enemies, it won't be very effective."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and pointed out the limitations of the Lateral Shift.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong paused, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>In combat, the limitation is within a certain battlefield range, but with his Lateral Shift, he can arrive in an instant, with extreme speed, able to catch the enemy off guard.</p><p></p><p>He can instantly evade the enemy's attacks.</p><p></p><p>But if he needs to chase down enemies over a long distance, it would not be enough.</p><p></p><p>The Lateral Shift technique's strength lies in the instantaneous arrival at short distances, and the instantaneous evasion.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand, I will continue to work hard."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said with a determined gaze.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Shi Er returned from outside.</p><p></p><p>He was holding a chicken in his hand, and when he saw Meng Chong, he seemed hesitant to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have something to tell me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I heard some news from the Wu Kingdom, regarding you..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er chuckled awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"What news?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was curious. After fleeing to Yunshan County and becoming Li Xuan's disciple, he had no longer paid attention to other matters, fully immersing himself in cultivating the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't the Wu Emperor offering a reward of 100,000 taels of gold for you? After all this time, he hasn't been able to capture you, and the reward has increased. Whoever captures you can get a 3,000-year-old ginseng, ten precious herbs, and be enfeoffed as a marquis..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er said, feeling a bit tempted himself.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes widened in surprise: "The Wu Emperor is being so generous? Am I that important in his eyes?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's mouth twitched, it was precisely because Meng Chong had disrupted the entire Wu Kingdom, causing the Wu Emperor to be confined in the palace and unable to go out, how could he not hate Meng Chong to death?</p><p></p><p>"Because of this matter, the martial world of the Wu Kingdom is about to hold a grand meeting to elect a martial arts alliance leader, who will join forces to capture you and obtain the Wu Emperor's reward.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Wu Emperor has promised that as long as you are captured and brought back, the alliance leader will be enfeoffed as a marquis with a county as their domain!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er sighed, the Wu Emperor was really investing heavily to capture Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>For the martial world of the Wu Kingdom, this was a great opportunity, a chance to usher in a new era.</p><p></p><p>Now, the top experts of the Wu Kingdom have gathered, ready to elect an alliance leader and devise a plan to capture Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also sighed, just how much did the Wu Emperor hate his second disciple?</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong had not become his disciple and cultivated powerful martial arts, he would inevitably be captured and face a tragic end.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, upon hearing this, suddenly became energetic, excitedly asking, "Where in the Wu Kingdom is the martial arts meeting being held? When will it be held?"</p><p></p><p>"In three days, at Mount Tianping."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mount Tianping?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was excited, rubbing his bald head, and said, "That Wu Emperor owes me 100,000 taels of gold, a 3,000-year-old ginseng, ten precious herbs, a marquis title, and a domain. I have to go and claim them."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had a strange expression on his face, inwardly mourning for the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"As for the marquis title and domain, I don't want them. I'll just select some items from the imperial treasury to compensate myself."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother had already cleaned out the Qi Emperor's treasury, he was envious, and now it was finally his turn to plunder the Wu Emperor's treasury.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er thought of Xu Yan, who had cleaned out the Qi Emperor's treasury.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to go to the Wu Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stroked his head and chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"You can go if you want to."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not stop him.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Chong's current strength, just like the previous Xu Yan, sweeping through the Wu Kingdom would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was destined to be unlucky.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I'll be back soon."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, Master, is there anything you'd like me to get from the Wu Emperor?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and said, "Take a look and see if there are any books, like medical books, herb books, or miscellaneous records. I can read them to pass the time when I'm free."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master, I'll definitely find some rare books for you from the Wu Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong realized.</p><p></p><p>The books his master wanted were naturally not the kind sold on the streets.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "Just be mindful of your actions."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled, "Master, don't worry, the Wu Emperor is also helping me take revenge, I won't be too harsh on him."</p><p></p><p>Bringing his saber, Meng Chong immediately prepared to go to Mount Tianping, to meet the martial arts experts of the Wu Kingdom, secure the martial arts alliance leader position, and then go find the Wu Emperor to claim the reward.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up at this time, "Junior brother, the path to Mount Tianping is not close, it's better to ride a horse, although it's slower, it's more comfortable than running on foot."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought about it and said, "Then I thank you, senior brother."</p><p></p><p>After leading a horse from the stable, Meng Chong set off excitedly for Mount Tianping.</p><p></p><p>"Master, shall I have someone send some books here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at his master sitting in the chair, playing with a jade scepter, and spoke up.</p><p></p><p>He almost forgot that his master was an extraordinary person, almost reaching the Dao, and the few remaining pleasures he had were probably just teaching his disciples and reading books.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about how his master, upon first arriving at Yunshan County, immediately went to look for books, he felt a little ashamed: "I was only focused on my own cultivation and forgot about my master's preferences."</p>

        <h1>Chapter 200</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi faced countless martial artists, his expression calm and indifferent, but his heart was heavy.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Demon Child was stronger than any half-step Celestial Being he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>Of course, with his current strength, it still didn't amount to much.</p><p></p><p>However, with so many powerful experts, their auras intertwined, forming a formidable momentum. If they attacked together, the heavens would shake and the earth would split!</p><p></p><p>Gathering the might of the top masters in the world, this was no ordinary matter! He was somewhat convinced that even true Martial Dao Celestial Beings would have to retreat and flee in the face of this lineup.</p><p></p><p>But he was not the least bit afraid!</p><p></p><p>Instead, his blood was boiling. Throughout his journey of creating the martial arts and becoming the Martial Ancestor of the Great Wilderness, he had never truly experienced a grand battle.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he even had a desire for battle.</p><p></p><p>"Singlehandedly dominating the world is right before me, I, Li Xuan, shall suppress the world alone today!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's blood was surging.</p><p></p><p>Today, he would experience the thrill of singlehandedly dominating the world.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Cangjiang River seemed to be the same as before, yet it also seemed to have changed.</p><p></p><p>"Mountain River Sword Intent, Third Layer! Your Majesty, do you need a weapon?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Shi Er spoke up on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Since his Majesty wanted to dominate the world at the same level, did he need a weapon?</p><p></p><p>So, he nervously raised the serrated knife in his hand.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, it naturally drew the attention of the Demon Child and the others.</p><p></p><p>Abruptly!</p><p></p><p>"Why is the Blood Spirit Knife in your hands?" </p><p></p><p>The Demon Child's expression changed drastically, and he angrily exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>He even lost his composure and was about to rush into Canglan Island to kill Shi Er and seize the Blood Spirit Knife!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his brow, slapped his palm, and the golden dragon coiled, blocking the Demon Child.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did not kill the Demon Child was that he seemed to be able to learn the identity of the original soul snatcher from the Demon Child's words.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Spirit Knife?"</p><p></p><p>Many of the experts from the top forces had their expressions change, and they all looked towards the serrated knife in Shi Er's hands!</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, with so many powerful experts staring at him, was sweating profusely, his hands trembling as he tried to hide the serrated knife behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"Is this truly the Blood Spirit Knife?"</p><p></p><p>"Although it's a bit broken, it does resemble the legendary Blood Spirit Knife."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Knife, the Demon Lord's peerless weapon!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child roared, frantically attacking the golden dragon, and shouted, "Why is the Blood Spirit Knife in your hands? Tell me, where is Uncle Blood?"</p><p></p><p>Immediately, the Demon Child's eyes turned blood-red, glaring at Li Xuan with murderous intent. "Was it you? Did you kill Uncle Blood?"</p><p></p><p>All the half-step Celestial Being experts present now understood, the rumors about the Demon Child and the Demon Lord must be true.</p><p></p><p>From the Demon Child's address, it could be known.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Child brother, this is your chance to avenge the Demon Lord, don't be rash, let's attack together."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Empress Dowager of the Great Yue Kingdom spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child seemed to have calmed down, retreating to his original position, his aura intertwined with the other powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>He panted heavily, his eyes blood-red, and said hoarsely, "So you are indeed a Martial Dao Celestial Being, but I suppose you are also heavily injured? Uncle Blood was a Martial Dao Celestial Being, to kill him, the price you paid must have been high!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple-Robed Azure-Faced and others felt a chill, the Demon Lord Blood Spirit was a Martial Dao Celestial Being!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they all recalled the rumors of the martial artists of the world hunting down the Demon Lord, although the details had been deliberately erased.</p><p></p><p>But their forces still had the remnants of those rumors.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Empress Dowager of the Great Yue Kingdom had a complex expression. The Demon Lord Blood Spirit, a being that suppressed the world, was rumored to be a master beyond the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be true! Li Xuan suddenly realized, the one he had almost killed Meng Chong was the legendary Demon Sect Demon Lord!</p><p></p><p>A Martial Dao Celestial Being expert.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit puzzled, how could such a powerful expert be reduced to a mere remnant soul, parasitizing an old man's body, trying to possess Meng Chong's powerful physique and abundant qi.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly smiled and said, "That insect was just a remnant soul, trying to possess others to rise again, but was killed by my disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Ah, ah, ah... you will die, your disciple will also die!" </p><p></p><p>The Demon Child was on the verge of madness, almost losing his sanity.</p><p></p><p>"Attack, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>The Purple-Robed Azure-Faced, the Grand Empress Dowager of the Great Yue Kingdom, and others shouted in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, taking a step forward, and coldly said, "Today, let the martial artists of this inner domain witness the might of the Profound Mysteries, no more being frogs in a well!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the Cangjiang River seemed to transform into a giant sword, rising into the air and slashing towards the Subduing Heaven Alliance experts.</p><p></p><p>As the sword was unleashed, the heavens and earth changed color! Li Xuan also did not dare to be careless, at this moment, he fully unleashed his strength, striking out with a palm, and a thousand-zhang golden dragon roared out, as if a true dragon had descended upon the world!</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Heavenly Earth Saber that dominated the world slashed through the sky, unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>With a punch, the wind and thunder raged, destroying everything! Xie Tian Heng and other Sword Saint Cliff experts were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was the might of the Profound Mysteries?</p><p></p><p>With their strength, they could naturally sense that the power Li Xuan was displaying did not have the pressure of a Celestial Being.</p><p></p><p>This meant that he was truly fighting at the same level!</p><p></p><p>Facing so many enemies, he did not use his realm to bully others, what an extraordinary figure! The Subduing Heaven Alliance's half-step Celestial Being experts, along with the peak Grand Masters, launched a terrifying attack, as if they could shatter the Cangjiang River and erase Canglan Island!</p><p></p><p>However, facing such a terrifying assault, Xie Tian Heng and the others only saw the Cangjiang River rise into the air, transforming into a giant sword, and ruthlessly slashing through the Subduing Heaven Alliance's attack.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the thousand-zhang golden dragon thundered into the Subduing Heaven Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The unparalleled saber light, fists like wind and thunder, with every gesture, people were killed like ants! Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent, and in the blink of an eye, he unleashed the Mountain River Sword Dao, the Heavenly Earth Saber, the Descending Dragon Palm, and the Wind Thunder Golden Fist.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Red-Robed Azure-Faced was blasted to pieces, the Grand Empress Dowager of the Great Yue Kingdom was destroyed, one peak Grand Master after another turned to ash and dispersed.</p><p></p><p>With every step forward, dozens of martial artists were reduced to ash.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>The might of the Profound Mysteries, so powerful? Xu Yan was already terrifyingly strong, able to easily kill half-step Celestial Beings after entering the Profound Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>But in comparison, the difference was too great, like a hundredfold!</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu murmured, "No wonder, my master has always said that if he had even five percent of his former strength, he would be content.</p><p></p><p>"Not to mention five percent, even if my master had one percent of his former same-realm strength, he could sweep away hundreds or thousands of people."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Su Ling Xiu felt powerless.</p><p></p><p>Her master was a mountain that she could only look up to, unable to climb over.</p><p></p><p>The Subduing Heaven Alliance's experts were all terrified, roaring furiously and frantically unleashing their secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>However, they were unable to shake him in the slightest!</p><p></p><p>He didn't even reveal a trace of Celestial Being aura!</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao of the Great Wilderness, truly...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Is it truly this terrifying? At this moment, many people regretted having participated in this. But it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>Most of the grand sect masters below the peak grand sect masters were standing behind the stronger ones, just wanting to lend a hand in the great battle. The ones who would truly decide the outcome were the half-step Celestial Immortals and the peak grand sect masters.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these grand sect masters were trembling in fear. Taking advantage of the fact that the battle had not yet reached them, they hastily retreated, wanting to disassociate themselves from the Subdue Heaven Alliance. "Coercing the might of the world? Today, I shall overthrow the world!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained indifferent as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was boiling with hot blood, and the exhilarating battle was indeed so refreshing.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" The Demonic Child's eyes were bloodshot as he seized the opportunity to escape the battlefield, heading towards Canglan Island, with Stone Two as his target.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a cold snort, and a sword intent as fine as the wind blew from Canglan Island, sweeping across the Demonic Child.</p><p></p><p>Just as he had reached Canglan Island, not far from Stone Two, the Demonic Child's eyes lost their light, and his consciousness completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>With a thud, the body fell not far in front of Stone Two.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two was covered in cold sweat, holding the Blood Spirit Knife in his hands, looking flustered and even wanting to throw the knife aside.</p><p></p><p>"You cowardly mouse, if you don't dare to use it, then give it to me!" Zhou Ying said contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"Who says I don't dare to use it?" Stone Two hugged the knife to his chest, forcibly calming himself down.</p><p></p><p>The half-step Celestial Immortal experts had all been exterminated.</p><p></p><p>The peak grand sect masters were also dwindling, their faces deathly pale and filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please spare us!" </p><p></p><p>"We were misled, please forgive us, senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was calm and tranquil as he waved his hand, annihilating the remaining peak grand sect masters.</p><p></p><p>As a teacher, he had to set an example for his disciples, to utterly destroy the enemy. He could not show any mercy.</p><p></p><p>Not a single enemy could be spared! He looked up at the other grand sect masters who had retreated to the distance, as if he was drawing a clear line with the Subdue Heaven Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, these grand sect masters had come to resist the Celestial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>It was just that at this moment, they were terrified and hastily retreated to the distance, trying to disassociate themselves.</p><p></p><p>"How many grand sect masters are left in the Inner Realm?" Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>If he didn't kill them, it would seem that he was being soft-hearted. But if he did kill them, it would appear that he was too ruthless, almost wiping out all the grand sect masters in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice rang out from among the panicked grand sect masters: "The Subdue Heaven Alliance is heretical and rebellious, deceiving the martial artists of the world, committing treason. Their hearts deserve to be punished. The Celestial Immortal senior is respected and revered, suppressing the Subdue Heaven Alliance's traitors, restoring the bright and clear atmosphere of the Inner Realm! We, the juniors, are deeply grateful to the senior, and we kneel to thank the Celestial Immortal senior for eliminating these rebellious traitors, restoring the righteous and pure martial arts world of our Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the panicked grand sect masters seemed to have found their backbone, seeing a glimmer of hope. They all knelt down, "We kneel to thank the Celestial Immortal senior for suppressing the Subdue Heaven Alliance's traitors, restoring the bright and clear atmosphere of our Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the grand sect masters kneeling before him in a vast black mass, Li Xuan smiled. There would always be one or two clever ones among them.</p><p></p><p>They knelt down and drew a clear line with the Subdue Heaven Alliance.</p><p></p><p>From now on, this battle was not the martial artists of the Inner Realm gathering the world's might to resist the Celestial Immortals.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was the Celestial Immortal senior using his hand to suppress the calamity that had befallen the martial arts world of the Inner Realm, the Subdue Heaven Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Restoring the bright and clear atmosphere of the Inner Realm, returning the martial arts world to its righteous state. He was a senior of great virtue, wise and majestic, suppressing the traitors with a wave of his hand, turning the tide of history! This was the truth of the victor's ability to change history!</p><p></p><p>"We kneel to thank the senior for suppressing the Subdue Heaven Alliance's traitors, rescuing us from the abyss, and restoring the bright and clear atmosphere of our Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The grand sect masters' shouts grew more and more fervent, their expressions more solemn, as if everything they were saying was true - the senior had suppressed the traitors and restored the righteous and pure martial arts world, saving them from their suffering.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a light laugh and said indifferently, "So be it then."</p><p></p><p>There was no need to kill them further.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the grand sect masters were filled with deep gratitude, "Thank you, senior, for your great kindness and virtue! Your virtue is unparalleled in history..."</p><p></p><p>Sycophantic praises echoed like the tide.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A deafening sound came from upstream of the Canglan River. As the battle came to an end, a massive water wall came crashing down, unleashing a towering tidal wave that rolled towards them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up, seeing the terrifying tidal wave rushing towards them, threatening to overwhelm Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Before he could act, the grand sect masters who had been kneeling rushed to the front of the tidal wave, joining forces to suppress the giant waves, calming the turbulent Canglan River.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a step forward, returning to his seat on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have some tea!" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling's rosy face was flushed with excitement as she poured a pot of Cloudy Mist Spiritual Tea and served it to her master.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped the tea, as if the previous battle had been as effortless as crushing a few ants.</p><p></p><p>Although he had single-handedly suppressed the Subdue Heaven Alliance, overwhelming the world's might, this battle had still consumed some of his strength.</p><p></p><p>It was the most intense battle he had engaged in since his arrival.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling gently massaged her master's shoulders, "Master, it is your disciple's incompetence that has caused you, the esteemed senior, to deign to personally deal with some weak ones. You must be exhausted!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled, "As long as you understand. You must cultivate diligently, reach the realm of being unrivaled within your level, or even surpass the higher realms. That would make me truly content."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling pouted, "Master, how can I be unrivaled within my level? Big Brother and Second Brother are much stronger than me. No matter how hard I try, I can't catch up to them."</p><p></p><p>"Then strive to become unrivaled among the others at your level, aside from your two brothers."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted her hand.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've already achieved that." </p><p></p><p>Su Ling giggled playfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback. Su Ling's strength was indeed only slightly weaker than Xu Yanmeng.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be complacent. The martial dao is boundless, you must continue to cultivate diligently."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling nodded her head seriously.</p><p></p><p>With her master single-handedly overwhelming the world, there was no longer any force or powerful cultivator in the Inner Realm who would dare to trouble her.</p><p></p><p>The door to the Spirit Realm, the Celestial Immortal legends, no matter how alluring, would require sufficient strength to approach.</p><p></p><p>She heaved a deep sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Ling knew that as long as the opening of the Spirit Realm was related to her, the potential dangers would always exist. </p><p></p><p>Even if there were no threats in the Inner Realm, what about within the Spirit Realm? Su Ling secretly vowed that she must strive to break through to the Profound Enlightenment Realm and even higher levels, only then would any threats be truly insignificant to her.</p><p></p><p>"If I had the same level of strength as my master, I wouldn't have needed him to step in today. I could have suppressed the Subdue Heaven Alliance alone."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling silently thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure stepped forward, its aura surging like a drawn sword.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng!

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 8: Permian Bone Refining (Please collect and continue reading)</p><p></p><p>The horizon was turning white, and a ray of morning sun shone through the narrow alleys of the village, illuminating Xu Yan who was in the midst of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As always, Xu Yan had risen early to cultivate. At this moment, his heart was filled with excitement. As his qi and blood circulated, at a certain point his skin membrane tightened, emitting a "plucking" sound, like a steel string being stretched to its limit and releasing a burst of sound.</p><p></p><p>The skin membrane suddenly had a sense of being round and flawless.</p><p></p><p>His strength had become greater, and his qi and blood had also instantly improved.</p><p></p><p>The skin refinement was complete!</p><p></p><p>"Twenty days, I spent twenty days, and finally completed the skin refinement. Although I'm still far behind the ancient geniuses, I am now at the genius level as well!"</p><p></p><p>"As long as I refine the golden bones, I will not be weaker than the ancient geniuses!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited. He raised his hands and clenched his fists, feeling the great power within himself.</p><p></p><p>Even with bare hands, he would almost have no fear of blades and swords!</p><p></p><p>He could easily take on a hundred enemies!</p><p></p><p>And this was just the completion of skin refinement, the most basic stage of the foundation realm!</p><p></p><p>"Today I will settle down, and tomorrow I will start refining the bones!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finished his cultivation, picked up a hoe and went to tend the vegetables and feed the chickens, to relax his mind and prepare for the bone refinement tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>He firmly remembered the teachings of his master, to balance work and rest, and to remain calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan got up, washed up, and came out of the house, surprised to find that Xu Yan was not cultivating!</p><p></p><p>This was the first time since becoming his disciple that Xu Yan had not cultivated early in the morning.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on, has he given up?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, yesterday he was still diligently cultivating, how could he suddenly give up?"</p><p></p><p>Based on Li Xuan's understanding of Xu Yan in recent days, he was a stubborn person with a not-so-bright mind. It was impossible for him to suddenly give up.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan went to the chicken coop and saw Xu Yan from afar, hoeing the vegetable garden.</p><p></p><p>He then went over.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully greeted him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, good, you can calm your mind and tidy up the vegetable garden neatly..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the vegetable garden, somewhat surprised to find that the weeds had all been cleared, and the vegetables were thriving, even better than his own.</p><p></p><p>"It's all thanks to your excellent guidance, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled sheepishly.</p><p></p><p>"Why did you come to the vegetable garden to weed so early today?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was here to inquire why Xu Yan had not cultivated this morning.</p><p></p><p>From the current situation, Xu Yan did not seem to have given up.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has followed your teachings, balancing work and rest, to settle my mind before the next period of diligent cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan heaved a sigh of relief. It turned out that he was not giving up, but rather relaxing his mind, and then continuing his cultivation to sense the flow of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>A stubborn person like him, how could he easily give up?</p><p></p><p>He then showed a relieved smile and said, "Your realization is commendable, I am pleased."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immediately excited, thinking to himself, "Indeed, after completing the skin refinement, rushing into bone refinement was not the right choice. Settling down and relaxing the tense mind is the correct path of cultivation!"</p><p></p><p>"Maintain a good mentality, neither arrogant nor impatient, and you will surely succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan encouraged him and then turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>As he walked around the village, he found that since the last villager passed away, the houses had all fallen into disrepair.</p><p></p><p>He had converted a few houses into chicken coops, while the rest had become overgrown with weeds.</p><p></p><p>"How did Xu Yan get through the Evil Aura Forest? Was it just luck, that he happened to avoid the fierce tigers and beasts?"</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay trapped in the village forever, I have to think of a way to leave this place, and the key might be in Xu Yan..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"As a transmigrator, I'm really quite miserable, can't even get out of the newbie village!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>It was still dark, but Xu Yan had already gotten up to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood seep into the bones, refining the bones... It's a bit different from refining the skin, but not too much. My goal is to refine golden bones. Only by refining golden bones can I stand on par with the ancient geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Although my master doesn't say it out loud, he must be hoping that I can refine golden bones. Only by standing on par with the ancient geniuses can I be worthy of being my master's disciple!"</p><p></p><p>"As for jade bones, my master said it's not something that can be achieved through just perseverance and talent... I'll do my best, and if I can achieve jade bones, I will surely surpass the ancient geniuses!"</p><p></p><p>Jade bones are too difficult, and it's not something that can be achieved through just talent and perseverance, so Xu Yan's primary goal is to refine golden bones!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan circulated his qi and blood, beginning to seep them into his bones. In the beginning, it was extremely slow. At a certain moment, his entire skeleton seemed to have a sensation of being bitten by ants, a numb and itchy feeling, somewhat uncomfortable!</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood have seeped into the bones and are in the process of refining. To actually have this kind of feeling!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gritted his teeth and persisted.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder my master said that refining golden bones requires talent, perseverance, and willpower. Just at the start of refining the bones, it's already like this. Once it reaches the golden bones, seeping into the marrow, it will surely have an even more unbearable feeling!"</p><p></p><p>His entire skeleton had a numb and itchy sensation, as if ants were crawling on him. Xu Yan's forehead was beaded with sweat, but he gritted his teeth and persisted, his gaze resolute. No matter how painful it was, he had to keep going.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, as the qi and blood continued to seep in, after getting through the initial stage, the numb and itchy sensation, the feeling of ants crawling, began to weaken.</p><p></p><p>What followed was a sensation of tempering throughout his bones, similar to tempering the skin membrane, but much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>The progress of the qi and blood seeping into and tempering the bones was extremely slow, only staying on the surface of the bones without being able to further seep into the depths of the bones.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan realized that the difficulty of refining the bones was beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>No wonder those who can refine golden bones are so rare.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan came out of the house and saw Xu Yan in the midst of cultivation, nodding his head approvingly. Indeed, a single-minded person like him would not easily give up.</p><p></p><p>His attitude was maintained well!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan caught a glimpse of his master nodding, and his heart was immediately uplifted.</p><p></p><p>"My master must be approving that I'm enduring the pain of refining the bones and persisting!"</p><p></p><p>"Persist! Persist! No matter how great the pain, I must persist, and never give up!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan encouraged himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Continuing to temper the bones, as the qi and blood kept seeping in, more and more qi and blood covered the bones, constantly tempering them. The sensation of ants crawling was gone.</p><p></p><p>But a feeling of sand rubbing against the bones had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's forehead was beaded with sweat, but he gritted his teeth and persisted in the tempering, not uttering a sound.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the sensation of sand rubbing against the bones became increasingly intense. Xu Yan felt like he was about to reach his limit.</p><p></p><p>Beads of sweat kept dripping from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Lying under the tree on a chair, Li Xuan looked up at the time, then at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time for lunch. What's wrong with this disciple today? Has he forgotten the time? It's time to go make the meal!"</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan spoke up: "Alright, go make the meal. It's getting late!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan was suddenly struck in the heart. He began to conclude his cultivation, and the sensation of sand rubbing against the bones gradually disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was deeply moved: "Master must have noticed that I had reached my limit, so he's letting me take a break."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan concluded his cultivation and respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>ps: Please continue reading, please vote, please everything</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

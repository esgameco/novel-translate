        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 103: Witness How the Master Reverses the Upper Realm (Seeking Subscription)</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu watched as the man in the black robe struck with his palm, a terrifying power that seemed intent on annihilating Xu Yan. Her face turned deathly pale, her eyes filled with panic as she looked towards her master.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>However, her master remained seated, completely calm and unmoved, not making any attempt to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave as he thrust out his sword, the sword qi surging forth like a mighty river. Yet, compared to the terrifying palm strike, even with the support of the sword intent of mountains and rivers, it still appeared weak.</p><p></p><p>The gap in realms was quite significant. The strength of the man in the black robe was clearly beyond that of an ordinary grand master.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan then struck out with a palm, a golden dragon emerged, its eyes wide open, exuding a powerful draconic aura.</p><p></p><p>Descending Dragon Palm!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon erupted forth, ferocious and unparalleled, instantly pouncing towards the descending palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's eyes narrowed, yet his palm strike could not annihilate the young man.</p><p></p><p>In mid-air, the terrifying palm print shattered. The golden dragon also dissipated, and the surging sword qi collapsed and vanished.</p><p></p><p>The remnant palm force came crashing down from the sky, sending Xu Yan plummeting to the courtyard below.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu cried out in alarm, hurriedly going forward to support him.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan sprang back up, slightly disheveled but uninjured.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the man in the black robe in the sky, he said gravely, "I am no match for him. If I had reached the peak of the Innate Realm or attained perfection, perhaps I would have a chance to defeat him!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he had shed his previous disdain for the martial arts of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The might of the grand masters was truly formidable. His Descending Dragon Palm at the third level, and his comprehension of the draconic aura, as well as his initial understanding of the sword intent of mountains and rivers, were all still no match for his opponent.</p><p></p><p>"There is actually such a talented genius in the world, beyond this servant's expectations. A master who can withstand my palm strike and not perish, it would be difficult to find another like you in the Inner Realm, especially one so young."</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's voice was cold, his killing intent palpable, his aura surging, the pressure like a divine might descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Even with your talents, you must die today. Blame it on your association with certain individuals."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the sky, a terrifying power manifested. An enormous palm print, even more fearsome than the previous one.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not the least bit afraid. Although he was no match, his master was here.</p><p></p><p>"Hiding your true nature and acting arrogant, how despicable," Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan rose from his chair and said, "My disciple, I have always taught you to be humble and cautious. Now, how do you feel?</p><p></p><p>"Just because the martial arts of the Inner Realm are weaker, you cannot look down on everything. You must know that you are still only a beginner on the martial path, and there are countless stronger experts above you.</p><p></p><p>"A true martial artist must never be arrogant or complacent. No matter what kind of enemy you face, you must always be vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"When killing an enemy, even if you cut off their head with a single sword strike, it is still not necessarily safe, not necessarily guaranteed to truly kill them.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, when killing an enemy, you must shatter their bones, scatter their ashes, and extinguish their soul. Leave no loopholes, give them no chance to escape with their lives."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan ignored the powerful aura and terrifying presence of the grand master in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Instead, he solemnly imparted this lesson to his disciples. Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and even Suling Xiu were all young and impetuous. Having grown stronger, they tended to look down on the martial arts of the Inner Realm and become careless.</p><p></p><p>Many powerful experts had met their demise due to such arrogance and negligence.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he must make his disciples understand the importance of caution. When killing an enemy, one must ensure their complete annihilation, leaving no chance for survival, no matter how weak the enemy may seem.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong listened attentively and respectfully. Suling Xiu also heaved a sigh of relief. Was her master going to intervene now? Would she be safe?</p><p></p><p>"Throughout history, the strong have often fallen due to their arrogance and carelessness, being ambushed and killed by the weak. My disciples, you must remember, no matter how insignificant the enemy may seem, you must not hesitate to annihilate them completely, leaving no chance for survival.</p><p></p><p>"The pride of a true martial artist lies not in looking down on the weak, but in taking every enemy seriously. Only those who understand the importance of thoroughly extinguishing their foes can be considered true martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong listened with utmost reverence and solemnity. This was a precious opportunity to learn from their master's invaluable experience, which would be essential for them to establish their reputations and prowess in the martial world.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. I will remember this well!" Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"I will remember this as well!" Meng Chong echoed.</p><p></p><p>"I... I will remember too," Suling Xiu said timidly.</p><p></p><p>The enemy above was targeting her, and she had brought trouble to her master and senior brother.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's eyes gleamed with icy light. The young man's master was the one from earlier? How was that possible? He didn't look like a grand master at all.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had suppressed his mysterious aura and concealed his true strength, so the black-robed man could not sense the power of a true expert from him.</p><p></p><p>"To disregard a grand master, what crime is that? Today, I shall shatter your bones and scatter your ashes!" the black-robed man said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the black-robed man and spoke again, "My disciples, watch closely. I will demonstrate for you how to reverse the upper realm and slay the enemy.</p><p></p><p>"With my Innate Realm cultivation, I will show you how to overcome those of a higher realm."</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was time for him to take action. This was a good opportunity to broaden his disciples' horizons and demonstrate the extent of his power, how he could reverse the upper realm with his lower cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps this would allow his disciples to gain some insights and breakthroughs, allowing their strength to grow further.</p><p></p><p>When his disciples grew stronger, he would become even more powerful as well.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were instantly filled with excitement, eager to witness how their master would reverse the upper realm and slay the enemy.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of our master, even though he has already reached the level of standing alongside the Dao, transcending all martial realms, he does not use his realm to oppress others. Instead, he is willing to lower himself a realm to overcome the enemy.</p><p></p><p>"This is the unyielding spirit of a peerless expert. When will I be able to reach my master's level?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu stared with wide eyes. Her master was going to lower his realm to demonstrate to her senior brothers how to reverse the upper realm?</p><p></p><p>Just what kind of power did her master possess, to be so confident?</p><p></p><p>That was a grand master, after all. It was unheard of for any master-level cultivator to be able to reverse a grand master.</p><p></p><p>Even if her master's martial arts were stronger than the Inner Realm, could he really cross that vast chasm?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the black-robed man in the sky, his gaze calm and indifferent, one hand clasped behind his back, exuding an air of disdain.</p><p></p><p>"With my full strength, a hundred times that of the Innate Realm, I should be able to easily crush the one above, right?"</p><p></p><p>In order to showcase his master's immense power and unfathomable depths to his disciples, he was prepared to unleash his full might, to demonstrate how one could reverse the upper realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had no intention of holding back. When hunting a rabbit, even a lion uses its full strength. He was ready to deliver a decisive blow that would utterly annihilate the grand master above.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The power of the Grand Master of the Inner Realm is ten times that of a Master, and although my power may be discounted, it is not ten times that of the Grand Master, but perhaps five or six times as strong.</p><p></p><p>"With five or six times the power, along with my Descending Dragon Palm and the perfected Dragon Might Palm Art, a single palm strike would be enough to defeat him, even if he doesn't die."</p><p></p><p>As a venerable expert, one must display the bearing of a venerable expert.</p><p></p><p>So, Li Xuan spoke, "Young man, are you prepared to receive my palm strike?"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe's eyes burned with fury. Young man? Pretending to be an old monster?</p><p></p><p>Hmph! </p><p></p><p>He himself was a Grand Master, considered an "old monster" even in the eyes of ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous wretch, witness how I slay you!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe raised his palms, his palm force surging, and a terrifying power enveloped him like a protective barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Come then!" </p><p></p><p>He roared, slamming his palms down.</p><p></p><p>Fully unleashing both his defense and his attack, his heart was filled with rage, but when he struck, he did so with all his might. </p><p></p><p>In this moment, he revealed the true, formidable power of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong's expressions grew grave. They had underestimated the martial arts of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The might of a Grand Master was not to be taken lightly!</p><p></p><p>They could not be careless when they went to the Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely as I reverse the tide against the Upper Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan clasped one hand behind his back and raised the other, slamming it upwards.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>A golden dragon soared into the sky, its draconic might shaking the heavens, as if it would rend the firmament.</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the golden dragon, the aura of the Grand Master vanished completely, replaced only by the unparalleled, terrifying might of the dragon.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, even the heavens and earth seemed to pale in comparison.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan swallowed hard, realizing that the Descending Dragon Palm he had cultivated to the Innate Realm paled in comparison to the power his master had just displayed.</p><p></p><p>"Master is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's blood boiled with excitement. This was the power of his master in the Innate Realm?</p><p></p><p>Truly, it was boundless!</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's small mouth hung open in awe. This was the power of her master's Innate Realm?</p><p></p><p>This was the might of reversing the tide against the Upper Realm?</p><p></p><p>Why did it feel even more powerful than the Grand Master?</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was stunned, her heart trembling. Her mistress's master was truly so terrifying!</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe felt numb, the threat of death descending upon him, the terrifying pressure nearly suffocating him.</p><p></p><p>"Flee! I must flee!"</p><p></p><p>The only thought in his mind was to escape.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon, like an unstoppable force, shattered his palm force, as if a true dragon had descended upon the world, the terrifying pressure already enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>But now, it was too late to flee!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe let out a roar, his aura exploding, pouring out the full extent of his strength in a desperate attempt to withstand the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>But it was all in vain, all his attacks and defenses crumbling like paper.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous roar echoed through the air, a terrifying shockwave sweeping through, and under the onslaught of the golden dragon, the man in the black robe was instantly shattered.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon circled and swept, not leaving a single fragment untouched, crushing everything to ash, with only a few wisps drifting away in the wind.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master had uttered his final cry before being reduced to mere dust.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan retracted his striking hand, clasping it behind his back, as if he had merely swatted a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master's reputation is well-deserved. This single palm strike was barely enough to reduce him to ash. Had I held back even a little, I might not have been able to crush him to dust in a single blow."</p><p></p><p>He marveled inwardly at the Grand Master's strength. </p><p></p><p>Even a nearly full-force strike was only just enough to reduce the opponent to ash.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stared with wide eyes, utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>This was the "reversing the tide against the Upper Realm" his master had spoken of?</p><p></p><p>It ended with a single palm strike?</p><p></p><p>So simple?</p><p></p><p>He naturally did not doubt that his master had used his realm to overwhelm the opponent, and the aura his master had just displayed was indeed that of the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had expected his master's reversal of the tide against the Upper Realm to involve exchanging blows with the black-robed man for several moves before defeating him.</p><p></p><p>But it had ended with a single palm strike, reducing the opponent to ash.</p><p></p><p>"Master's Innate Realm power is so formidable. I am still so far behind."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, still unable to wrap his mind around it. The "reversing the tide against the Upper Realm" his master had spoken of was like this? </p><p></p><p>A single palm strike reducing the enemy to ash.</p><p></p><p>If one didn't know better, they would have thought it was just swatting a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was completely dumbfounded. Innate Realm cultivators were this powerful?</p><p></p><p>This was only the second realm of the martial dao, yet a single palm strike had reduced a Grand Master to dust?</p><p></p><p>Just how strong was her master?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was quite satisfied with his disciples' expressions, but his face remained calm and indifferent as he said, "When I was in the Innate Realm, my power was roughly at this level.</p><p></p><p>"My disciples, I do not expect you to reach the same level as me. If you can reach five or six tenths of my strength, I will be content."</p><p></p><p>Bluffing without a script, just speaking off the cuff.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply moved, thinking, "So Master initially didn't want to take me as a disciple because he felt I would never be able to reach his level, even with the utmost effort.</p><p></p><p>"Master must have thought that unless he could take on a disciple who could match or even surpass him, he would not take one on at all.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, he took me as a disciple because he was moved by my sincerity, and it was a fated teacher-disciple relationship.</p><p></p><p>"It was because he took me as a disciple that he re-entered the world and opened his heart to taking on more disciples, to pass on his martial dao."</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan imagined, the more ashamed he felt.</p><p></p><p>"I am too weak, I haven't even reached five or six tenths of Master's strength. I must work hard to improve my power, strive to reach five or six tenths of Master's level!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will definitely work hard to improve my strength!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said firmly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not know that his disciple had just engaged in another bout of imagination. He sat back in his chair, saying, "Mm, just do your best, don't be blindly obsessed."</p><p></p><p>After all, his own strength was a hundred times that of his peers. No matter how hard his disciple tried, he would never be able to reach five or six tenths of Li Xuan's own level in the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Because as his disciple's strength grew, his own would rise accordingly, always maintaining a hundred-fold superiority.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stimulated. He too wanted to reverse the tide against the Upper Realm, to crush the Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't do it with a single palm strike, being able to defeat the Grand Master with ten or more strikes would be acceptable.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was the same, his blood boiling with excitement, wishing he could break through to the Qi and Blood Realm and cultivate the Great Sun Golden Body right away.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu, while stunned, also had a timid look as she gently massaged Li Xuan's shoulders, saying obediently, "Master, I'm sorry for troubling you."</p><p></p><p>"As long as you are my disciple, diligently cultivating is all that matters. For me, there are no troubles in this world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan played with the jade talisman in his hand, speaking indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Master, actually, I..."</p><p></p><p>"No need to explain, just focus on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan interrupted.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to know about Suling Xiu's troubles just yet.</p><p></p><p>What if his disciple asked him to intervene? </p><p></p><p>If the opponents were numerous, like dozens of Grand Masters attacking him, what if he couldn't defeat them? Wouldn't that ruin his reputation as a reclusive expert?</p><p></p><p>Even if he could defeat them, it would require a bitter struggle. Would he still be able to maintain his bearing as a venerable expert?</p><p></p><p>So, it was better to play it safe for now.</p><p></p><p>Dear readers, please give me some monthly votes! ^_^</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 140</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the elder and nodded, saying, "You really understand the situation and know that I have high natural talent and strong strength, so I don't need to follow the rules!"</p><p></p><p>After saying that, he continued walking up, without the slightest intention of sparring with the elder.</p><p></p><p>The elder was dumbfounded, "Young friend, you haven't defeated me yet."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped in his tracks, with a disappointed look on his face, "I thought you really understood the situation, saying I don't need to follow the rules, but you still want me to defeat you according to the rules.</p><p></p><p>"If you truly think I can disregard the rules, you shouldn't have let me take action. I can just bypass you and go find a stronger opponent above."</p><p></p><p>The elder was extremely annoyed, "Damn it, I was just complimenting you, and you directly look down on my weak skills? *Takes a deep breath* I see the young friend also cultivates the Sword Dao, I dare to learn from your sword techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, "Your sword skills are too poor, if I attack you, it would be bullying you. Follow the old rules, just take my palm strike."</p><p></p><p>Damn it! The elder's face turned green, where did this arrogant young man come from?</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists and students of the Seven Star Academy all took a sharp breath, this guy is truly arrogant, actually saying the Academy's Sword Dao is too poor? Although the Seven Star Academy's Sword Dao is slightly inferior to the Sword Sovereign Cliff, it is still ranked second in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>The elder in front of them has been cultivating the Sword Dao his entire life, delving deeply into it, and has even defeated the Grand Perfection Sword Dao Master of the Sword Sovereign Cliff.</p><p></p><p>With such strength, in the eyes of this young man, he is actually not worthy? "Arrogant boy, take my sword strike!"</p><p></p><p>The elder's face flushed red, furious, he horizontally swung his long sword, with a thunderous sound, sword qi burst forth, the cold light was chilling, layer upon layer of sword light, like connecting heaven and earth, swept out.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heaven and Earth Frigid Light? It seems the Academy's Elder is truly angered, it was this sword technique that allowed him to defeat the Grand Perfection Master of the Sword Sovereign Cliff back then."</p><p></p><p>"So powerful! I also cultivate the Sword Dao, but facing this sword strike, I don't even know how to block it, there are no openings at all!"</p><p></p><p>The students of the Seven Star Academy exclaimed in amazement one after another.</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of being the Academy's Elder, a Grand Perfection Sword Dao Master, a single strike is extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Among the surrounding martial artists, there were also some who cultivated the Sword Dao, and they were all full of admiration, indeed the Seven Star Academy's Elder, this Heaven and Earth Frigid Light technique is extremely fierce, like connecting heaven and earth, unavoidable, with no flaws.</p><p></p><p>It also seems to contain changes.</p><p></p><p>Among the many observing martial artists, there was a young man in his twenties, his expression serious, staring at the elder's sword strike without blinking.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the technique that defeated my Sword Sovereign Cliff's Grand Perfection Master? It is truly fierce, I wonder how Xie Senior would deal with this move?"</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He is a disciple of the Sword Sovereign Cliff, known as the genius second only to Xie Lingfeng, he came to the Seven Star Academy to spar with their Sword Dao, paving the way for his own breakthrough to the Patriarch realm.</p><p></p><p>"Flowery nonsense!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and slapped out a palm.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Dragon roared and suddenly plunged into the layers of sword light, in an instant, the sword light connecting heaven and earth was shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Rotate!"</p><p></p><p>The elder's expression became solemn, the broken sword light suddenly began to rotate, this is one of the killing moves of the Heaven and Earth Frigid Light.</p><p></p><p>However, the fierce Golden Dragon directly struck the sword light that the elder had just started rotating, before the sword momentum could form its power, it was thunderously hit.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword light exploded and collapsed, and the Golden Dragon's tail swept the elder away.</p><p></p><p>Silence! The entire venue fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful move, yet it still couldn't withstand the young man's palm strike? What kind of technique was that Golden Dragon, truly powerful beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>The elder was knocked to the ground, feeling somewhat dazed.</p><p></p><p>For a moment, he was at a loss, his proud sword dao, actually so easily defeated? Xu Yan was about to continue walking up, glancing at the elder, his footsteps paused, and he spoke, "The Sword Dao is not about grand momentum, not about flashy sword techniques, but about refining a single sword strike, this is the true essence of the killing art, the rest are just embellishments.</p><p></p><p>"You have not even entered the door of the Sword Dao, you do not understand the Sword Intent, for you, fast, fierce, and ruthless, is the right path.</p><p></p><p>"Not to spread the sword momentum in vain, weakening it and making it unsubstantial, even if there are changing moves, they are too slow.</p><p></p><p>"I have a friend, he has cultivated the Sword Technique to the peak, stronger than you by far, he is the closest to stepping into the Sword Dao."</p><p></p><p>The elder's Sword Dao, although it seemed powerful, the sword momentum was grand and frightening, but ultimately it was empty.</p><p></p><p>Against ordinary martial artists, it would certainly be invincible.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's eyes, this move was not as good as Xie Lingfeng's Myriad River Sword Technique, let alone the Flying Rainbow Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>If he were to face Xie Lingfeng, this Heaven and Earth Frigid Light would be shattered by a single Flying Rainbow Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>So far, among the sword cultivators Xu Yan has seen, only Xie Lingfeng has truly grasped the threshold of the Sword Dao, cultivating the Sword Technique to the peak.</p><p></p><p>And he is also close to breaking free from the shackles of the Sword Technique.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Xie Senior has already attained the Sword Heart Enlightenment?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It should still not be the case, after all, to attain the Sword Heart Enlightenment is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>The elder was dumbfounded, he had cultivated for half a lifetime, yet he had not even entered the door of the Sword Dao?</p><p></p><p>He opened his mouth wanting to refute, but as a loser, he had no right to refute. In the end, he sighed, "I have learned."</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu stood in place, completely stunned by Xu Yan's words, he gained some new insights from that.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this person, his talent in the Sword Dao, could it be that he has already surpassed my Senior?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, the Seven Star Academy's Patriarch is not bad, he didn't fly into a rage or feel humiliated by the defeat, he just accepted it. He continued walking up.</p><p></p><p>The eighth layer.</p><p></p><p>The guardian was a Peak Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had defeated the Seven Star Academy's Patriarch guardians one by one on his way up, and all were defeated with a single palm strike. Now the Seven Star Academy could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>The guardian of the eighth layer was among the top of the Seven Star Academy's Peak Patriarchs.</p><p></p><p>"Whew, it's Elder Ding Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The students of the Seven Star Academy exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>"What, Patriarch Ding Yan?"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists were also shocked.</p><p></p><p>A young man actually alarmed the renowned Patriarch Ding Yan to come guard the platform, it's clear the Seven Star Academy felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Elder Ding Yan, with a fearsome reputation, in the peak of Patriarchs, he is ranked among the top thirty in the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>On the arena, a man in a wide robe and long sleeves, with three strands of long beard, stood elegantly, holding a three-foot long calligraphy brush, a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, do you have the qualifications to enter the platform and spar with me?"</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, "Yes, you are the first one who has the strength to let me enter the platform and spar."</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan's strength is very powerful, not much weaker than the Half-Step Grand Patriarch Yin Hong.</p><p></p><p>And he is just a Peak Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>However, in Xu Yan's eyes, the so-called Half-Step Grand Patriarch is actually just an expert whose strength is not enough to break through to the Grand Patriarch realm in one go, so he can only break through halfway.</p><p></p><p>Such Half-Step Grand Patriarchs...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He didn't catch Ding Yan's eye much.</p><p></p><p>But Ding Yan was different - he was a peak grand master, currently refining his cultivation, preparing to break through to the grand master realm. With his martial arts foundation and strength, once he completed his cultivation, he would be able to break through to the grand master realm in one go.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped onto the arena. The onlooking crowd grew increasingly excited, a great battle was about to begin.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, do you have the strength to make me draw my sword?" </p><p></p><p>Ding Yan glanced at the treasure sword at Xu Yan's waist and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then spoke truthfully, "If I were to draw my sword, you might not be able to withstand a single strike from me. Are you sure you want me to draw my sword?"</p><p></p><p>Sss! Although the crowd had already grown accustomed to the young man's arrogance, at this moment, they still couldn't help but gasp in shock.</p><p></p><p>This was Master Ding Yan after all. </p><p></p><p>To claim that he might not be able to withstand a single strike? Among the inner realm, perhaps there was not a single person at the master realm who would dare to say such words.</p><p></p><p>Only grand masters would have the qualifications to say such words.</p><p></p><p>Even the Sword Sovereign Xie Tianheng, at the peak master realm, did not dare to make such a bold claim!</p><p></p><p>What an arrogant young man! Ding Yan was momentarily stunned, then he laughed, "Young friend, since you have such confidence, I'm even more eager to experience what kind of sword dao you possess, that I wouldn't even be able to withstand a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, then looked up towards the ninth-layer arena, the highest level arena, passing through which would allow one to peruse all the martial arts classics of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Is the one guarding the top layer a grand master?"</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan nodded, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>A grand master, Xu Yan felt a little regretful, with his current strength, he would be unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>But perhaps there was still a chance.</p><p></p><p>As long as it wasn't a grand master, then it would be fine, right? Rules were always meant to be broken by the strong.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan spoke, "If you want me to draw my sword, that's fine. But if you can't withstand a single strike from me, then the guardian of the ninth layer doesn't need to be a grand master. How about we replace them with ten peak masters instead? I'll fight and defeat ten of them, and that will count as me passing through, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan was completely dumbfounded. To call the young man arrogant would be an understatement, he had self-awareness and knew he couldn't defeat a grand master.</p><p></p><p>But to claim he would fight and defeat ten peak masters? </p><p></p><p>The onlooking crowd had already become numb to this young man's increasing audacity.</p><p></p><p>"The ninth layer, by the rules, is guarded by a grand master. Young friend, this proposal of yours..."</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan didn't know how to respond.</p><p></p><p>This rule, he couldn't change it.</p><p></p><p>That was the domain of the grand masters!</p><p></p><p>"Although I can't defeat a grand master right now, it won't be long before I can. It's just a matter of a little more time.</p><p></p><p>"Since you can't withstand a single strike from me, I want to break through the ninth layer. Let ten peak masters replace the grand master as the guardians, that's only reasonable, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't want to wait until after his breakthrough to try again. He wanted to clear the way in one go, and go peruse the martial arts classics of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan sighed and shook his head, about to refuse.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure flashed in, also wearing a wide robe, holding a yellowed book, seemingly engrossed in studying its contents.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you can defeat Ding Yan with a single strike, I will have ten peak grand masters spar with you!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the newcomer, Ding Yan immediately respectfully saluted, "Greetings, Grand Supervisor Fu!"</p><p></p><p>The students of the Seven Star Academy were instantly shocked, this was the legendary Grand Supervisor Fu Yuntian?</p><p></p><p>One of the Five Grand Supervisors of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Grand Supervisor Fu!" </p><p></p><p>The students of the Seven Star Academy all saluted.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian nodded, glanced at Xu Yan, then continued studying the book in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled, a grand master! This grand master was very strong, even stronger than the one his master had easily slapped away.</p><p></p><p>A powerful figure among the grand masters! "Even if I break through to the Xiantian realm, I might not be able to defeat him with a single palm strike, it might take dozens of strikes or several sword strikes."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Then he grew excited, "No problem, he won't be able to withstand a single strike from me. If I can defeat the ten peak masters guarding the ninth layer, will I then be able to peruse all the classics?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian looked up and smiled, "The classics of our Seven Star Academy, especially those on the ninth layer, are not open for just anyone to peruse.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you clear the way, there will still be some conditions for you to be able to read the materials there. </p><p></p><p>"For example, whether your identity is suitable to view the things there, after all, the ninth layer involves many sensitive matters, it is only open to those truly devoted to the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, not unsatisfied with this, the other party's words made sense.</p><p></p><p>The things involved were too sensitive, not just anyone could enter.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if your identity would work?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>He looked at Ding Yan and said solemnly, "Are you ready? I'm about to draw my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan also became serious. Although the young man seemed arrogant, his strength was truly formidable, Ding Yan dared not be careless.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the treasure brush in his hand, the aura of a peak master was undeniable.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, please go ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Zing! The sword was unsheathed, in that instant, the onlookers felt a momentary daze, as if they saw mountains and rivers appearing, a giant dragon circling.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A dragon's roar echoed, in that moment, everyone felt like they saw a grand mountain and river landscape.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Xu Yan drew his sword, Fu Yuntian's gaze immediately shifted from the book, his heart shaken as he watched the young man, what kind of sword art was this? Seemingly containing the wondrous principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>That was mountains and rivers? How could a sword art have the meaning of mountains and rivers? Xu Yan's first strike already evoked the appearance of mountains and rivers, the roar of a dragon.</p><p></p><p>Ding Yan felt a momentary daze, the dragon's roar, and he seemed to have entered a grand mountain and river landscape. He saw the bleak and ruthless mountains and rivers, as if they were about to engulf all life.</p><p></p><p>The vast mountains and rivers suddenly collapsed, as if extinguishing all existence.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" </p><p></p><p>He was greatly alarmed, what kind of sword art was this? An illusion? A hallucination? Boom! His aura erupted, his treasure brush suddenly striking out, his figure frantically retreating.</p><p></p><p>This retreat made it seem as if the mountains and rivers were receding.</p><p></p><p>Before he could catch his breath, the mountains and rivers disappeared, his mind returning, and as his vision cleared, he felt a chill at his throat.</p><p></p><p>The sword tip was just an inch away from his throat.</p><p></p><p>His earlier retreat seemed to have taken him far away, yet it also seemed like his body hadn't actually moved, he had just retreated out of the mountain and river landscape.</p><p></p><p>"I've lost!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ding Yan bitterly smiled. </p><p></p><p>He couldn't even withstand a single strike!</p><p></p><p>Silence. The surroundings were deathly quiet, everyone was shocked and bewildered.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword art was that! </p><p></p><p>Could there truly be such a sword dao in this world? The renowned Sword Sovereign Cliff, the number one sword sect in the inner realm, perhaps they didn't even possess such an unfathomable sword art.</p><p></p><p>Dong Qiu stared with wide eyes, his heart in turmoil, what kind of sword art was this? Perhaps even his senior brother couldn't withstand this single strike.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

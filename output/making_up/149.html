        <h1>Chapter 149</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"It's already very fast!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned back and was suddenly shocked - the speed of this Grand Master was truly not slow!</p><p></p><p>He took out a rope and directly tied Meng Shu Shu to his back, freeing the hand that was grabbing his collar.</p><p></p><p>In the Dazzling Golden Body Acupoint, a stream of sword intent flowed into the sword from his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned around and slashed out.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sword light, spanning the sky, directly attacked the black-robed Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>This slash was forged from the sword intent that Meng Chong had cultivated in the acupoint for some time.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the cultivation time was too short, so this slash did not possess the power to threaten the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>It only slightly obstructed him!</p><p></p><p>So, after Meng Chong unleashed the slash, he quickly fled, using the Thunderous Lightning Body Art to the extreme, widening the distance between him and the Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's Hu Shan or Xie Lingfeng, if you put down Meng Shu Shu, this seat will spare your life!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of the black-robed Grand Master came from behind.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense! I, Sword Sovereign Cliff's Hu Shan, would never abandon my friend."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, this seat wants to see how long you can run!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Grand Master madly chased after him.</p><p></p><p>The distance slowly closed in again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Another sword beam attacked.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, block it, my friend!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to run frantically, while the Meng Shu Shu hanging on his back was almost coughing up blood! Again?</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>He could only desperately fight back, blocking the Grand Master's remaining power.</p><p></p><p>Pu! Another mouthful of blood was spat out.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, I can't hold on much longer!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu's face was deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>This strike from the Grand Master, due to the distance being too far, had little power left.</p><p></p><p>However, it was still the power of a Grand Master, and Meng Shu Shu, in blocking it, also suffered a heavy impact, and his injuries worsened.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out a medicinal pill, "My friend, open your mouth!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu could only grimace and swallow the medicinal pill.</p><p></p><p>It must be said that this healing pill was extraordinary in its efficacy, and Meng Shu Shu immediately felt much better.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, you still owe me eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said while fleeing.</p><p></p><p>This chase went on for nearly half a day, with the black-robed Grand Master striking five times, and Meng Shu Shu blocking the aftershocks, but even with the medicinal pills, his injuries could not fully recover.</p><p></p><p>"I can't hold on much longer!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu's face was deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"There's a city up ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up, suddenly rushing into the city, wanting to use the crowd to escape the Grand Master's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>However, the black-robed Grand Master coldly said, "Masters in the city, listen. This seat has come to kill, and if you do not lend a hand, don't blame this seat for harming the innocent!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master could disregard any rules in the city! With this statement, the Sect Masters in the city were immediately alarmed and took to the skies, surrounding and attacking Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's face turned black, the Grand Master was really formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! I am Sword Sovereign Cliff's Xie Lingfeng, do you not fear my Sword Sovereign Cliff?"</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment, Meng Chong roared.</p><p></p><p>The attacking Sect Masters were suddenly shocked and hastily stopped in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>They were greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Cliff's Xie Lingfeng?</p><p></p><p>Who was that? Daring to chase and attack the genius of Sword Sovereign Cliff, and moreover, Xie Tianheng's only son. Even if the opponent was a Grand Master, he would surely die! This hesitation allowed Meng Chong to pass through several streets, shaking off the Grand Master for a distance, taking to the skies and fleeing out of the city.</p><p></p><p>If it was within the city, it would certainly involve the innocent. That Grand Master was obviously a ruthless and merciless person. As soon as Meng Chong fled, a tavern behind him was instantly destroyed by a strike.</p><p></p><p>"You can't escape!" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed Grand Master was furious, continuing the chase.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to flee, cursing, "I don't believe I can't outlast you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu panted heavily, "I can't hold out much longer!"</p><p></p><p>This human shield was too miserable! "Don't panic, here, eat another medicinal pill!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fed him another pill. "Brother Meng, quickly eat the Earth Spirit Root, or you may not be able to outlast the Grand Master!"</p><p></p><p>After eating the pill, his injuries recovered somewhat, and Meng Shu Shu reminded him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up, carefully taking out an Earth Spirit Root, breaking off a piece and directly putting it in his mouth. Suddenly, a surge of abundant spiritual energy flooded his body.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal power of the Earth Spirit Root was warm and lasting, and in an instant, Meng Chong felt that his Golden Body Acupoints had become active.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, quickly eat!"</p><p></p><p>He stuffed the remaining half of the Earth Spirit Root into Meng Shu Shu's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu couldn't die, if he died, wouldn't it have been in vain? Meng Chong had already seen the value of the spirit herb explorer.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Shu Shu, the chances of obtaining rare spirit herbs would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shu Shu, this seat wants to see how long you can hold out!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master suddenly erupted, closing the distance and slashing out again.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu was already very skilled, roaring and pouring all his strength into blocking the aftershock of this strike.</p><p></p><p>Cough cough!</p><p></p><p>He was impacted again, and the injuries that had just recovered were injured again.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Meng Chong was able to widen the distance again.</p><p></p><p>"My friend, there's a big city up ahead, should we go hide there?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>"A big city? If there's a Grand Master guarding it, it's worth a try!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu Shu spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Such a big city, there should be a Grand Master guarding it, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's speed increased, descending from the sky onto the big city.</p><p></p><p>"Who dares to act recklessly and disregard the rules..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an angry voice came from the city.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura surged up.</p><p></p><p>A Grand Master powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sword Sovereign Cliff's Hu Shan, I was forced to act without notice, my apologies!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>The furious Grand Master was suddenly taken aback, and his aura subsided.</p><p></p><p>Sword Sovereign Cliff's Hu Shan? He then saw the black-robed Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>His gaze narrowed, which Grand Master dared to chase and attack Sword Sovereign Cliff's Hu Shan! "Sir, it's best not to interfere."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed Grand Master coldly spoke, directly entering the city and continuing to chase Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"On my orders, block that bald man in the east!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's face changed slightly, there were people of the opponent's faction in the city.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, two figures came rushing over, both Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's face changed, in addition to the Sect Masters, there was also a Half-Step Grand Master rushing to intercept him.</p><p></p><p>This place is not suitable to linger!</p><p></p><p>If he was blocked, he would be caught up by the Grand Master, and then it would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>"Scram!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned and fled in another direction, directly slashing and killing the obstructing Sect Master, his body shining with golden light. He took to the skies, not staying in the city, and fled.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he unleashed the Thunderous Lightning Body Art to the extreme, the aura of his Golden Body Acupoints surging like a vortex.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Meng Chong's speed suddenly increased.</p><p></p><p>The Thunderous Lightning Body Art had broken through to the small success stage! The increased speed widened the distance from the Grand Master, but that Grand Master was still relentless, chasing from afar, not giving him a moment's rest.</p><p></p><p>"Persistent ghost!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cursed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a smile, he turned back and looked, and that grand master actually took out a spiritual pill and swallowed it to replenish his depleted energy.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see who can outlast the other!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out an earth spirit root and directly put it into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Body was activated, refining the spiritual pill, while also impacting the acupoints of the Golden Body, opening the fourth acupoint.</p><p></p><p>One chased, the other fled, and three days passed.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe was still relentless, continuously pursuing and hunting him, without any intention of giving up.</p><p></p><p>As for the grand master, the news of him chasing and hunting Xie Lingfeng started to spread.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, a corrected message came, saying the grand master was actually chasing the Sword Sovereign Cliff's Hu Shan! "So you want to chase, then I'll let you chase to your heart's content!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cursed.</p><p></p><p>He ate another earth spirit root, and the completion of the Great Sun Golden Body was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu secretly breathed a sigh of relief. After Meng Chong's breakthrough in movement technique, the grand master could no longer close the distance, and Meng Shu didn't need to intervene to block the aftershocks of the attacks, and his injuries were gradually recovering.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still deeply worried.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe was relentless in his pursuit, and the news of Meng Chong impersonating Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had probably also spread. Once the powerful experts of the Sword Sovereign Cliff got the news, they would likely come to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>If that happened, being attacked from both the front and the back, the consequences would be disastrous! "My dear brother, for your sake, I've risked my life and even eaten four earth spirit roots, which is a huge loss for me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spoke.</p><p></p><p>If he brought them back to his junior sister to refine, the effects would be far more than just this.</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt a pang in his heart.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of eight earth spirit roots, and he had already eaten half of them.</p><p></p><p>The only thing worth celebrating was that he was about to break through to the small completion of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, your great kindness is beyond words of thanks!" Meng Shu cupped his fists.</p><p></p><p>He already owed Meng Chong his life, so a little more debt wouldn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>"My dear brother, you should strive and work hard in the future, explore more spiritual medicines, and pick more rare spiritual herbs, try to buy me a storage bag as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>"You can't slack off anymore, otherwise, how can you repay the favor of me risking my life to save you?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rambled on.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was dumbfounded, how could this reckless fellow be so talkative? Repeatedly emphasizing that he should strive, pick rare spiritual herbs, and buy him a storage bag...</p><p></p><p>Listening to it, his mind was filled with the voice of having to strive.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, don't worry, I will work diligently and strive hard to try to buy a storage bag as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, my dear brother has ambition, I believe in you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the Great Sun Golden Body broke through.</p><p></p><p>The breakthrough of the Great Sun Golden Body to the small completion stage caused Meng Chong to abruptly stop, turning back to look at the pursuing grand master. His entire body was shining with golden light, and his figure suddenly expanded by a circle.</p><p></p><p>That terrifying aura made Meng Shu's heart tremble with fear!</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong unleashed a sword strike, this was his strike after breaking through to the small completion of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A domineering and unparalleled strike, cutting across the sky, directly towards the man in the black robe! "I cannot let you live, I must kill you!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe blocked this strike, his heart filled with trepidation. The other party's strength had grown so much.</p><p></p><p>This was a great calamity. If the other party's strength continued to break through, even he, the grand master, would be in danger.</p><p></p><p>"The grand master is indeed difficult to kill!" Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>His breakthrough to the small completion of the Great Sun Golden Body and his full-force strike were still unable to injure the grand master.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu rolled his eyes, did he really think the grand master was an easy target that could be slain with a single strike?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Only after reaching the great completion of the Great Sun Golden Body will I have the strength to kill him, but to break through to the great completion in the short term is impossible."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't help but frown.</p><p></p><p>Even if he consumed all the spiritual pills on his body, he still couldn't break through to the great completion of the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Should he just keep exhausting himself? That would be risky!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder where my elder brother is."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt a bit helpless.</p><p></p><p>He thought of his elder brother Xu Yan. If he could team up with his elder brother, they should be able to deal with the grand master behind them.</p><p></p><p>"If my elder brother breaks through to the great completion of the Xiantian Realm, he should be able to kill the grand master."</p><p></p><p>He was a bit troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go find Xie Lingfeng?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought of Xie Lingfeng. If he went to the Sword Sovereign Cliff to find Xie Lingfeng, would he be able to escape the predicament?</p><p></p><p>"I'll just keep exhausting him for now, and see how it goes. If it really doesn't work out, I'll go to the Sword Sovereign Cliff."</p><p></p><p>No, I've already used Xie Lingfeng's and Hu Shan's names, if the Sword Sovereign Cliff finds out, they should come looking for me, and if Xie Lingfeng knows, he should realize it's me.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Meng Chong continued to flee, seeing who could outlast the other!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of power is my sister's enemy, there seems to be more than one grand master expert."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was secretly shocked.</p><p></p><p>No wonder his sister had to hide in the remote border regions.</p><p></p><p>The enemy forces were simply too powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, what if another grand master expert comes, what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe was relentless, unwilling to give up on killing them.</p><p></p><p>And the forces he belonged to might have more than one grand master expert.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was too powerful, and since he had already offended them, they would surely try every means to eliminate Meng Chong, otherwise he would become a great threat.</p><p></p><p>So the arrival of a second grand master expert was not impossible!</p><p></p><p>"If all else fails, I'll go to the Sword Sovereign Cliff!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"But the Sword Sovereign Cliff is too far away from here!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Return to the Great Yue Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>If he really couldn't shake them off, and even a second or third grand master expert came to hunt him, he had no choice but to flee back to Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>With his master's strength, no matter how many grand masters came, they would all die. As long as he could kill them all cleanly, no one would know that he had fled to the border regions.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan learned that Meng Chong was being pursued by a grand master, his heart filled with rage. Without any delay, he immediately headed towards the border of the Yan Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at a large city, he descended with an imposing aura, frightening the grand masters in the city, who pretended not to have seen him violating the rules.</p><p></p><p>The young man's aura was extremely dangerous! Xu Yan held the jade token given by the woman in plain clothes and went to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to obtain the latest information.</p><p></p><p>After getting the intel, he soared into the sky, following the direction of Meng Chong's escape that the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion provided.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he didn't find any trace of Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>He became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>In front was a small city, and he immediately entered the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion in this city, holding the jade token to obtain information. The news he received was that Meng Chong had left a certain large city and was heading towards the Great Yue Kingdom according to the estimation.</p><p></p><p>"If I can know the general direction of my junior brother's escape, the enemy can also obtain it!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Xu Yan's expression changed slightly, becoming even more urgent.</p><p></p><p>Just as he left the small city, a falcon descended.</p><p></p><p>A falcon from the Sword Sovereign Cliff!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the envelope, quickly scanned it, looked in a certain direction, and his figure flashed, disappearing from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother is fleeing in this direction, the distance shouldn't be too far, and the grand master's aura is domineering, he should be able to sense it easily."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood on a high peak, surveying the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a faint golden glow flashed in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed, taking a step and disappearing from the spot, directly rushing towards it.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

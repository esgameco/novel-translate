        <h1>Chapter 237</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan drank the spiritual tea that Xu Yan had retrieved from the Dai family's treasure vault, and he felt refreshed and invigorated.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the Dai family had carefully stored this spiritual tea in their treasure vault - it was of high quality and had the effect of nourishing one's spirit and soul.</p><p></p><p>Although the effect was subtle, drinking it could make one feel more clear-minded and energized. If a peak Grandmaster were to drink this spiritual tea, they could gradually break through to the half-step Celestial Realm and enter the stage of spirit convergence.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was sitting on the mountain peak, refining his martial dao, and his strength was increasing daily. At times, it even seemed like there were sword lights arrayed in patterns within his mountain and river.</p><p></p><p>These sword lights were arranged in a certain regularity or order.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly delighted, thinking, "Could it be that Xu Yan is about to comprehend a sword formation?"</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Yan's prodigious talent, Li Xuan would not be too surprised if he could comprehend a sword formation after studying the array diagram.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu began refining pills, using primarily third-grade spiritual medicines as the main ingredients, to provide the pills needed for Xu Junhe, Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu to break through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>Recently, Kou Ruozhi had also broken through to the Primal Perfection Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he still lacked something to reach the Penetrating Mystery Realm and would need more time to consolidate his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Among the pill refinement disciples, two had already broken through to the Primal Realm. The rest all had their qi and blood at the peak.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation speed was not considered slow, especially with the aid of medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>There were also some among the Martial Dao Grandmasters preparing to break through to the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Canglan Island was rapidly increasing, except for Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was studying the Heavenly Dao Principles on the third page of the Taicangshu, while also pondering the martial realms beyond the Spiritual Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>"After refining the spiritual root, spiritual techniques will naturally emerge. And beyond the Spiritual Perception Realm, one must delve into the Heavenly Dao Principles and the Might of Heaven and Earth. How should one utilize the Heavenly Dao Principles and harness the Might of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"To continue cultivating the Martial Dao, one must transcend Heaven and Earth. So the Martial Dao realms beyond Spiritual Perception, while utilizing the Heavenly Dao Principles and the Might of Heaven and Earth, must not be constrained by them.</p><p></p><p>"One can use the principles, but not be limited by them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had some ideas about the realms beyond Spiritual Perception.</p><p></p><p>Time passed calmly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not far from reaching Perfection Attainment, which also meant he was not far from breaking through to the Unbreakable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was in a similar situation.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun had already broken through to the Peak Grandmaster Realm but had not advanced further, and would occasionally seek guidance from Meng Chong on the Martial Dao, which he could provide without any difficulty, despite their different cultivation paths.</p><p></p><p>Yuxiaolongfinally began interacting with the Crimson Cat, wanting to learn the Great Demon Techniques. For this, it started to curry favor with Xu's mother, but she did not seem to like snakes very much.</p><p></p><p>However, as this was the pet snake of her beloved son, the Crimson Cat was allowed to interact with Yuxiaolong.</p><p></p><p>Atop Canglan Island, Xu Yan was sitting in meditation, seemingly fused with Heaven and Earth, his form even undergoing subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>His Harmonious Coexistence Technique had further advanced, to the point where even changing his appearance would not be detected by others.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has mastered the Harmonious Coexistence Technique, and it has been elevated to the Returning to the True Technique."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The Returning to the True Technique - everything becomes true!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan marveled inwardly. This Returning to the True Technique was truly powerful. His aura could blend with even stone, making him indistinguishable from a mere rock. Not only Celestial Cultivators, but even stronger martial artists would be unable to detect any flaws or differences.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his refinement, and the sword intent was emerging around him, as if he were in a profound state.</p><p></p><p>That day, Li Xuan was memorizing the Heavenly Dao Principles on the third page of the Taicangshu, preparing to record them in the Dao Golden Book to provide assistance for the upcoming martial dao creation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up towards the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on his lips - Xu Yan's sword dao was about to break through.</p><p></p><p>The currently perfecting his foundation, Meng Chong, suddenly looked up towards the mountain peak, the location of his senior.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Su Lingxiu also raised her head to look.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, everyone on Canglan Island turned their gaze towards the mountain peak, some with surprise, others with confusion.</p><p></p><p>"When did a sword appear on the mountain?"</p><p>"Wasn't there a tree there before?"</p><p></p><p>Some people asked in puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, is that a sword you see?"</p><p>Zhou Ying frowned as she looked towards the mountain, remembering that there had been a large tree there.</p><p></p><p>"It is a sword, perhaps just recently erected there," Shi Er nodded, still puzzled.</p><p>Why would they erect a sword there? The weaker one's cultivation, the more likely they would see it as a sword.</p><p></p><p>But in Meng Chong's eyes, it was a large tree, yet also a sword! The sword intent was condensed within, radiating a fierce sword aura. In that moment, Meng Chong gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Has the senior disciple reached the Heart Sword Realm? Is this the Heart Sword Realm? Using all things in Heaven and Earth as swords, encountering a mountain, the mountain becomes a sword, meeting a river, the river becomes a sword... The second realm of the Dao of the Blade is the Concealed Blade Realm, which has a similar principle to the Heart Sword Realm; the blade is hidden within Heaven and Earth, for where in Heaven and Earth is there no blade? What in Heaven and Earth is not a blade..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong observed the large tree, and enlightenment dawned in his mind. His Blade Dao had reached perfection, and he now had a direction for cultivating the Concealed Blade Realm - how to cultivate and how to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, your Blade Dao has reached perfection, and you have comprehended the cultivation direction of the Concealed Blade Realm. You have broken through to the Concealed Blade Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at Meng Chong, greatly pleased.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Concealed Blade Realm."</p><p>The blade intent hidden, the edge not revealed, yet able to cleave Heaven and Earth with a single strike!</p><p>His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the second realm of the Sword Dao, the Heart Sword Realm. Your Heart Sword Realm is perfected."</p><p></p><p>In a flash, the small grasses on the mountain peak shot forth like sharp swords, slicing into the Canglan River above, causing it to be severed!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, everyone on Canglan Island knew that Xu Yan had broken through again.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary grasses, like keen blades, had severed the Canglan River - what a profound and powerful sword dao! Su Lingxiu watched with shining eyes. The tree had transformed into a sword, and even the small grasses had become swords, as if all things in Heaven and Earth could be forged into swords.</p><p></p><p>The senior disciple's sword dao was truly profound and mighty.</p><p></p><p>"All plants and trees can become swords, and the Dao of Alchemy and Martial Arts that I cultivate..."</p><p>In that moment, Su Lingxiu gained enlightenment, and the alchemical flames surged from her body.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced sideways, immediately delighted. When Xu Yan broke through the Heart Sword Realm, not only did Meng Chong gain enlightenment, but Su Lingxiu also seemed to have comprehended a new realm.</p><p>"Meng Chong has exceptional talent, and Su Lingxiu is the same. It is only natural that they would gain enlightenment when Xu Yan broke through the Heart Sword Realm."</p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the Cinnabar Flame, and your Cinnabar Flame is perfected."</p><p></p><p>The Cinnabar Flame, the essence of fire, could accelerate pill refinement, increase success rates, produce purer and higher-grade medicinal pills, and even cause the appearance of a medicinal halo.</p><p>Moreover, its power was formidable, far exceeding ordinary flames.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's breakthrough to the Heart Sword Realm had unexpectedly led to enlightenment for both Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu, which was a harvest beyond Li Xuan's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Yuxiaolong was greatly shocked, Xu Yan's strength had increased further.</p><p>"With his current strength, he would not necessarily be defeated even in a battle against ordinary Celestial Cultivators. If he were to launch a sneak attack..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more alarmed he felt.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's cultivation speed was too fast. It wouldn't be long before even ordinary Zhengshen Tianren could not be his match. "I must learn the Great Demon Technique. This is my opportunity, I cannot miss it!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolongʼs gaze was resolute.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the Chihui Cat, this greedy and gluttonous fellow, should be relatively easy to deceive, right? He still had some stored items on him, if he took some out to exchange for the Great Demon Cultivation Technique, it should work.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolongʼs mind was in deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the second realm of the Sword Dao, the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The third realm of the Sword Dao should also be compiled soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt some pressure in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao realms above the Divine Realm had just taken shape, and the third realm of the Sword Dao also needed to be prioritized.</p><p></p><p>Although he felt the pressure, Li Xuan was full of motivation, for the advancement of one's cultivation was the greatest joy in the world.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Xu Yan broke through to the Heart Sword Realm of the second realm of the Sword Dao, the Descending Dragon Palm also broke through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, the Descending Dragon Palm has broken through to the fifth layer, your Descending Dragon Palm has reached the fifth layer of mastery."</p><p></p><p>The fifth layer of the Descending Dragon Palm had an even stronger dragon aura, the dragon palm force was almost indistinguishable from a true dragon, vivid and lifelike, like a real dragon.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it vaguely possessed a majestic power.</p><p></p><p>The dragon-shaped palm force unleashed by the fifth layer Descending Dragon Palm seemed to possess the power to ride the clouds and fight on the water. Li Xuan had a feeling that the divine ability of the Golden Dragon was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when he broke through to the Divine Realm, the golden dragon summoned by the Descending Dragon Palm would possess divine abilities, just like a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>On Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sat in meditation, silently contemplating. The words Xu Yan had pointed out to him all surfaced in his mind. At a certain moment, a flash of insight led him into a profound state.</p><p></p><p>He felt a little depressed. He had been exposed to the true Sword Dao earlier and had contemplated it earlier, yet his father had actually attained Sword Heart Enlightenment and grasped the Sword Intent before him.</p><p></p><p>He even began to doubt his own talent.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of contemplating the Sword Dao, at a certain moment, the sword techniques he had learned suddenly appeared in his mind, and in an instant, the flaws and weaknesses of the sword techniques were all clearly perceived.</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques seemed so insignificant in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Sword Heart Enlightenment! On Canglan Island, Li Xuan was pondering the third realm of the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Golden Book opened.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple in the cultivation of the Sword Dao, Xie Lingfeng, has broken through to Sword Heart Enlightenment, your Heart Sword Realm comprehension has improved."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had attained Sword Heart Enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Grasping the Sword Intent should not be too far away."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to what Sword Intent Xie Lingfeng would comprehend.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Xie Lingfeng came.</p><p></p><p>Although he had attained Sword Heart Enlightenment and entered the Sword Dao, he still lacked the comprehension of the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>He came to seek guidance from his senior.</p><p></p><p>However, he found that Xu Yan had returned from the Spirit Realm, and was immediately excited.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations Brother Xie on entering the Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still lacking, the Sword Intent is difficult to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Intent is not actually difficult to comprehend. Brother Xie already has a foundation, as long as you find the right direction, you will be able to comprehend the Sword Intent soon."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his shoulder and said.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was speechless, the Sword Intent seemed so easy to comprehend in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"But I haven't found the direction to comprehend the Sword Intent."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said frustratedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pointed to the Cangjiang River and said, "Look at this Cangjiang River, flowing endlessly. Is your cultivated Wanhe Sword Technique not like this? You can use this as a direction to comprehend the essence within."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was startled, gazing at the Cangjiang River, his mind began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he had some enlightenment, as if he had found the direction to comprehend the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Xu, for the guidance."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng found a place to sit down and began to contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Under Xu Yan's guidance, Xie Lingfeng quickly found the direction, and a sword intent gradually emerged from his body, like a vast and endless river.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the sword intent was refined and began to transform.</p><p></p><p>The sound of the flowing river, endless and unceasing, arose around Xie Lingfeng, and the Sword Intent manifested, like a great river circling his body.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the great river divided into numerous small rivers, the small rivers intertwined with each other, and then merged back into the great river.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple in the cultivation of the Sword Dao, Xie Lingfeng, has comprehended the Wanhe Sword Intent, your Wanhe Sword Intent has reached mastery."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up and nodded, the Sword Dao had gained another one who had comprehended the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the Sword Intent, Xie Lingfeng prepared to break through to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached Innate Perfection, but had stayed at that stage for a period of time just to enter the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's talent was stronger than that of Xu Junhe and the others. He did not encounter any bottleneck in the Innate Realm, and after Xu Yan taught and explained the Tong Xuan Realm techniques, Xie Lingfeng began his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng broke through to the Tong Xuan Realm, but the Great Dao Golden Book did not give any feedback, which was within Li Xuan's expectations. After all, he was already at the Shen Yuan Realm, and Xie Lingfeng's breakthrough to the Tong Xuan Realm was nothing extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he was not Li Xuan's disciple, so the lack of feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book was normal.</p><p></p><p>However, in the Martial Dao Spiritual Shadow, there was a spiritual shadow that possessed the Sword Intent and could unleash the Wanhe Sword Intent, which was a reflection of Xie Lingfeng, this great Huanggu martial artist.</p><p></p><p>After Xie Lingfeng's breakthrough, Xu Junhe and the others also began to break through to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, Meng Shushu, Shi Er, and Zhou Ying broke through to the Tong Xuan Realm, and several other martial scholars also followed suit and broke through to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Tong Xuan Realm, they possessed strength comparable to peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>After all, in the current Inner Realm, there were not many who had reached the Half-Step Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to teach martial dao to Xu Junhe and the others, and even tried to guide them in comprehending realms of understanding.</p><p></p><p>However, limited by their talent, the difficulty of comprehending realms of understanding in a short time was too great.</p><p></p><p>But after breaking through to the Tong Xuan Realm, they at least had the power to protect themselves.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the time to go to the Great Wilderness Cabinet, guiding Guo Rongshan and the others in their martial dao cultivation, and also brought them some elixirs refined by Su Lingxiu, ensuring they could cultivate to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time to go to the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Junhe and the others having broken through, he could leave his divine spiritual avatar token behind to ensure their safety, and then go to the Spirit Realm to roam.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was already looking forward to returning to the Spirit Realm, to venture into the vast martial dao world there and clash with the extraordinary spirit cultivators and geniuses.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he was eager to go to the Spirit Realm and find the fourth disciple, to cultivate the Extraordinary Gate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Meng Chong's body was emanating a golden light, his innate foundation had been perfected, and he could prepare to break through the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body, and during the breakthrough, his body would be transformed and upgraded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed an expectant expression, "What divine bone will Meng Chong's transformation produce?"</p><p></p><p>Divine Bones and Spiritual Bodies, this special constitution would make one's strength even greater, and the martial dao path ahead would be smoother.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Spirit Realm, it would be difficult to find such a special talent, wouldn't it?</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the capital city of the Zheng Kingdom, within the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Emperor, leading a group of imperial family members and several key ministers, all prostrated themselves on the ground, respectfully paying their respects.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Grand Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

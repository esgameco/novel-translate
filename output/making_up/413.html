        <h1>Chapter 413</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao began preparing to set up a grand formation in the Qinghua Realm, contemplating the layout of the Qinghua Realm's great array, keeping himself extremely busy.</p><p></p><p>To set up the grand formation, he needed to have a sufficient understanding of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>So he was studying maps of the Qinghua Realm, treasured collections from the three major factions.</p><p></p><p>In addition, when actually setting up the formation, he would need to personally visit some important locations to gain understanding and make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>This was a complex process that could not be completed in just a year or two.</p><p></p><p>Currently, with the great chaos in the Qinghua Realm's Heavenly Cavern, immortal lords like Da Yue Emperor were unable to spare any effort. So setting up the grand formation would have to wait until the Heavenly Cavern calmed down somewhat, when these immortal lords could lend their assistance.</p><p></p><p>As for when the Heavenly Cavern would calm down, Fang Hao didn't know, but they could take proactive measures to pacify it.</p><p></p><p>For example, could Master intervene?</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also planning her own path of medicine and martial arts, pondering how to set up a Heavenly Furnace to absorb the laws of heaven and earth, using the rhythms of the Dao to refine pills.</p><p></p><p>She had found her own way to increase her strength.</p><p></p><p>Of course, setting up the Heavenly Furnace required quite a few materials and would take some time to complete. But once the setup was finished, it would be time to reap the rewards - her strength would increase rapidly, making it all worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was studying how to forge Extreme Soul Divine Weapons and comprehending Extreme Soul Divine Abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Jiang Buping has understood how to forge Extreme Soul Divine Weapons. You have obtained an Extreme Dao Soul Weapon."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Above his spirit platform, a long spear appeared, falling into the hands of his Extreme Soul body.</p><p></p><p>The spear was cold and sharp, surrounded by a fierce aura that seemed as if it could tear apart one's soul just by looking at it.</p><p></p><p>"Good, not bad. With this Extreme Dao Soul Weapon, I can truly unleash the power of Extreme Soul martial arts now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even warriors above the Immortal realm who are in harmony with heaven and earth couldn't withstand a single strike from me."</p><p></p><p>The Void-Breaking realm could shatter the void of heaven and earth. This void-breaking power was enough to blast out warriors in harmony with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth realm is a great leap, surpassing the Immortal realm by two or three levels is no problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reassessed his martial arts once again.</p><p></p><p>Starting from the Divine Ability realm, it no longer corresponded one-to-one with the Cang Realm's martial arts levels. The Divine Ability realm had already surpassed the Spirit Refinement realm, reaching the Law Condensation realm, and was even somewhat stronger.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Image realm was stronger than the True Kings of the True Refinement realm, while the Void-Breaking realm possessed the power to shatter the void of heaven and earth, which in terms of strength also surpassed the Immortal Lord realm.</p><p></p><p>"Invincibility in the Cang Realm is getting closer and closer."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation. After becoming invincible in the Cang Realm, the next step would be to transcend heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Transcending heaven and earth should be enough to match the owner of the Cang Book, right?</p><p></p><p>Or even surpass them?</p><p></p><p>"I can't get carried away. After all, there are still many supreme beings. The owner of the Cang Book may not be the strongest."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan warned himself internally not to get overconfident.</p><p></p><p>He continued to calm his mind and study the general principles of the Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, as Jiang Buping began to comprehend Extreme Soul Divine Abilities, Li Xuan naturally received feedback, and the methods of Extreme Soul martial arts began to be perfected.</p><p></p><p>"This battle of Immortal Lords in the Nine Mountains Realm still hasn't ended?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a moment to glance in the direction of the Nine Mountains Realm, clicking his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what do you think about using the Heavenly Cavern as the mouth of my divine furnace?" Su Lingxiu asked while massaging her master's shoulders.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for some days, she felt that using the Heavenly Cavern as the Heavenly Furnace seemed to be the best choice.</p><p></p><p>Using the hole in heaven and earth as the divine furnace was a perfect match.</p><p></p><p>The huge mouth of the Heavenly Cavern would be the mouth of the divine furnace - how many pills could be made in one batch, and how powerful could the pills be?</p><p></p><p>"Can you control such a large Heavenly Cavern?" Li Xuan raised an eyebrow as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>He had to admit, Su Lingxiu's idea was truly excellent, but with her current strength, she couldn't control such a large Heavenly Cavern and turn it into a Heavenly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"I can't do the Great Heavenly Cavern yet, but I can handle a small one. We can change the Heavenly Cavern bit by bit, it just takes some more time."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"If you can do it, that's fine." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, now that the Heavenly Cavern is in chaos, it won't be easy." Su Lingxiu said with a giggle.</p><p></p><p>"Go find Feng Yan and eliminate a small Heavenly Cavern. With his strength, he can do it. Start by practicing with a small Heavenly Cavern. Don't think about the Da Yue Heavenly Cavern for now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>This girl had her eyes set directly on the Da Yue Heavenly Cavern, wanting him to intervene and clear it out so she could make it into a Heavenly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>"I just don't want to be too far from Master." Su Lingxiu calculated and said, "Although the Da Yue Heavenly Cavern is large, we don't necessarily need to turn the entire cavern into a Heavenly Furnace. We could turn part of it into a Heavenly Furnace first, then slowly cover the entire cavern."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan listened to Su Lingxiu's plan, he pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Da Yue Heavenly Cavern did seem to be a good place, after all it was one of the three great Heavenly Caverns of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>If it could be turned into a Heavenly Furnace, that would be most suitable. Of course, this would take quite some time.</p><p></p><p>As Su Lingxiu said, they could set it up bit by bit slowly. Once it was successfully turned into a Heavenly Furnace, even the Netherworld qi would be absorbed and refined into pills.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he thought about it, it seemed to have many benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Fine, for the sake of my disciple's martial arts progress, I'll intervene (show off) one more time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan grumbled to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, when your Fifth Junior Brother comes out of seclusion, Master will help you clear it out."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, feigning reluctance.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Su Lingxiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>As for why Master wanted to wait for Fifth Junior Brother to come out of seclusion, it was surely to teach by example, letting Fifth Junior Brother witness the power of Extreme Soul martial arts and gain a deeper understanding.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu couldn't help but look forward to it eagerly. Master was going to take action again, which was a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>It would also be a good chance to see the power of Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the Da Yue Heavenly Cavern, blood light surged. Da Yue Emperor and several other Immortal Lords were using a grand formation to resist the Netherworld Blood Scions attempting to enter the cavern.</p><p></p><p>A group of True King Celestial Lords were maintaining the operation of the formation, using its power to destroy the blood disciples trying to invade.</p><p></p><p>Even so, blood light still seeped in, surging like rolling waves of blood.</p><p></p><p>"If not for the enhancement of the formation, I'm afraid the Heavenly Cavern would fall again, and we would have to retreat to guard the entrance."</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Emperor sighed.</p><p></p><p>This Netherworld invasion was more intense than ever before, with more and stronger Netherworld Blood Scions taking action. They had even raised the upper limit of power the Heavenly Cavern could withstand.</p><p></p><p>Even with the formation's assistance, Da Yue Emperor and the others still felt pressure.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld seemed to have employed powerful Netherworld treasures this time. Even though only part of their power seeped through, it made the formation shake and the laws of heaven and earth fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cavern was a hole in heaven and earth, and the other side seemed to want to further expand this hole.</p><p></p><p>However, the laws of heaven and earth remained firm, dissipating the forces that had seeped in, thus ensuring the Heavenly Cavern was not expanded.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, above the Heavenly Cavern where the grand formation was sealed, a deep red light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Attack with full force!"</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Emperor's heart jolted in alarm. This</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A deep red light surged forth, so powerful that even he felt a sense of crisis! The great halberd unleashed its divine might, its powerful energy reinforcing the formation and surging towards the top of the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>The other Immortal Celestial Lords also hurriedly took action. </p><p></p><p>However, that beam of deep red light did not dissipate, nor did it seep into the Heavenly Cave. It seemed to be condensing.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth at the edge of the Heavenly Cave all manifested, swirling around the barrier between heaven and earth, as if to prevent this deep red light from seeping in. Even the rhythm of the Dao faintly flickered in and out of view.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" asked one Immortal Celestial Lord in shock.</p><p></p><p>"The handiwork of the Blood Spirit of the Netherworld Prison!" said the Great Yue Emperor, his face gloomy and secretly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"What?" The others all turned pale with fright.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Blood Spirit of the Netherworld Prison can enter the Heavenly Cave now?"</p><p></p><p>Their hearts sank. </p><p></p><p>If the Blood Spirit of the Netherworld Prison could enter the Heavenly Cave, it was beyond their ability to resist. That was an existence that surpassed Immortal Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Spirit cannot enter the Heavenly Cave, but it has used some method to infiltrate an attack. The formation will break, and once it does, we will have difficulty keeping the enemies of the Netherworld Prison outside the Heavenly Cave."</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Blood Spirit's attack poses a great threat to us. We must be careful and cautious, and cannot confront it head-on!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor said gravely.</p><p></p><p>His expression was extremely heavy. If his guess was correct, the Great Yue Heavenly Cave would fall again, becoming like before - guarding the entrance to the Heavenly Cave, stopping the enemies of the Netherworld Prison from bursting out from within. </p><p></p><p>Once that happened, the Great Yue Nation would lose its advantage.</p><p></p><p>Should they ask the senior experts to take action?</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor couldn't bring himself to make that request, nor did he have the face to do so.</p><p></p><p>Besides, how could those senior experts lower themselves to take action?</p><p></p><p>"Everyone be careful," said the Great Yue Emperor, taking a deep breath. They could only rely on themselves now.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the group of True King Celestial Lords reinforcing the formation, he instructed: "Withdraw from this place and set up defensive formations in the outer layer."</p><p></p><p>He had already prepared for the core area of the Heavenly Cave to fall.</p><p></p><p>But if they could seal the Netherworld realm within the core area of the Heavenly Cave, that would be acceptable too.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The group of True King Celestial Lords changed expression and retreated, taking out formation disks outside the core area of the Heavenly Cave and beginning to set up defensive formations.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Under the grave gazes of the Great Yue Emperor and the others, a drop of deep red power like blood penetrated the barrier between heaven and earth and fell from above the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>As this drop of deep red blood fell, in an instant, a terrifying aura spread, surging forth like the atmosphere of purgatory.</p><p></p><p>"Attack with full force!" The Great Yue Emperor's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Several Immortal Celestial Lords unleashed powerful attacks, reinforcing the great formation in an attempt to resist this falling blood-like power.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The deep red blood suddenly dispersed, transforming into a crimson light like hellfire from purgatory, suddenly bursting into flames.</p><p></p><p>A gloomy voice transmitted from outside the barrier between heaven and earth:</p><p></p><p>"Mere insects dare to resist the Netherworld Bone Blood Drop!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Even though it had penetrated the barrier between heaven and earth, this Netherworld Bone Blood Drop had already been blocked by half its power, but it was still incredibly strong. As it transformed into a crimson blood light sweeping through, the original formation instantly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the Heavenly Cave, the laws of heaven and earth shone with light, constantly eroding the external power, preventing this force from further expanding the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's heart trembled, knowing they could not resist. If they didn't retreat, they would likely be injured by this attack.</p><p></p><p>Once injured and their strength impaired, it would be even harder to resist the coming onslaught of the Blood Children of the Netherworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Celestial Lords all retreated. The formation at the core of the Heavenly Cave had disappeared, and surging waves of blood light poured in. One blood figure after another descended.</p><p></p><p>Just like when the Heavenly Cave first appeared, in the end they were unable to keep the enemy outside.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A blood figure, incredibly powerful, no weaker than the Great Yue Emperor in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>The other Blood Children were not weak either.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare for a great battle," said the Great Yue Emperor, taking a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>The core area of the Heavenly Cave had fallen. This meant they could no longer intercept the enemies of the Netherworld Prison outside the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, defensive formations still existed outside the core area of the Heavenly Cave. These could assist in defense and reduce pressure. The power that the Blood Spirit had infiltrated was confined to the core area of the Heavenly Cave and could not affect the outer regions.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to worry about the Blood Spirit's power breaking through the formations.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Waves of blood surged and blood light soared to the sky as one blood figure after another frantically charged forward.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor, wielding his great halberd, stood within the formation to meet the strongest Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>The great formation activated. One Immortal Celestial Lord after another, one True King Celestial Lord after another, relied on the power of the formation to resist the invading Netherworld Prison forces.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave once again entered into fierce slaughter.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Yue Nation, True King Celestial Lord after True King Celestial Lord began rushing to the Heavenly Cave, bringing with them the formation disks refined by Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Yue Heavenly Cave has fallen?" Fang Hao was astonished.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, a Blood Spirit of the Netherworld Prison infiltrated its power and shattered the defensive formation," said the True King Celestial Lord who had returned from the Heavenly Cave to request formation disks, his face grave.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Ten Absolute Killing Formation. Take it to set up," Fang Hao nodded, taking out several formation disks and handing them to the True King Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Director Fang!" The True King Celestial Lord expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>Taking the formation disks, he was about to head to the Great Yue Heavenly Cave when suddenly a message arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Heavenly Cave had fallen. The Blood Children of the Netherworld Prison had directly blood refined thousands of blood slaves and dozens of blood disciples, setting up the Netherworld Prison's killing technique and shattering the defensive formation.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and the others were forced to retreat to guard the entrance of the Great Yue Heavenly Cave! The situation had suddenly become critical. Seeing this, Fang Hao said, "I'll go with you."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Even in the capital of the Great Yue Nation, one could see a faint red color in the sky above the Heavenly Cave. It was evident how determined this invasion from the Netherworld Prison was, actually blood refining a group of blood disciples to perform the killing technique.</p><p></p><p>Eight great forces of heaven and earth suddenly converged. Thunder, fire, and other phenomena appeared in the sky above the Heavenly Cave as Fang Hao used the Qimen Dunjia to borrow the great forces of heaven and earth to set up a grand formation.</p><p></p><p>"It's not easy to set up this Great Yue Heavenly Cave as a Heavenly Divine Furnace," Su Lingxiu clicked her tongue.</p><p></p><p>"However, the greater the difficulty, the greater the reward must be. I want to use this Heavenly Cave as a Heavenly Divine Furnace!" Jiang Buping emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>In his hand he held a long spear. An aura of extremity swirled around the spear, and this spear seemed to be forged from divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"What divine weapon is this? Just looking at it gives me a feeling of divine will being torn apart," Stone Two said in shock.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Jiang Buping emerge from seclusion, Su Lingxiu was immediately overjoyed. She tugged on Li Xuan's arm and said, "Master, Master, Fifth Junior Brother has come out of seclusion. You should take action now!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright then." Li Xuan patted her hand and looked towards where the Great Yue Heavenly Cave was located. It was time to take action again.</p><p></p><p>The Fifth Gate of Martial Arts had already emerged. It was time to demonstrate it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

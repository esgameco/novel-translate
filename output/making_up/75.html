            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 75: The Inner Realm and the Borderlands, Crushing Their Bones and Scattering Their Ashes</p><p></p><p>Two strands of blood-sucking vampire threads, their speed and power were far stronger than the previous blood-sucking vampire threads. Even a steel plate could be easily pierced through.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong felt a strong sense of crisis looming in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He let out a low roar, his entire muscular body bulging, and with a thud, his flesh became like a golden bell, even emitting a faint golden glow.</p><p></p><p>He raised his fists in front of his chest, protecting his vital points.</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>The blood-sucking vampire threads instantly pierced into the center of his fists, the icy aura penetrating from his fists to his arms, entering his body.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood within his body suddenly raged, sweeping through his entire body. The bottleneck was broken, and he had broken through the limit of the Copper Bone realm!</p><p></p><p>However, the danger had not disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had just reached the pinnacle of the Golden Bone realm, he was still no match.</p><p></p><p>A stinging pain came from his fists, the icy aura seemingly trying to freeze his fists.</p><p></p><p>He let out another low roar, and the raging qi and blood in his body, under his control, surged towards his fists.</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>His fists struck out, shattering the blood-sucking vampire threads that had pierced into his fists.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin was shocked, "What kind of flesh and blood is this? It actually blocked my blood-sucking vampire threads?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin became serious.</p><p></p><p>He was a Sect Master-level expert, and although he hadn't used much force, the previous two attacks would have easily penetrated a Third-Grade Martial Artist in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even for a Sect Master-level expert, they would be unable to block it with just their flesh and blood.</p><p></p><p>Yet this bald youth, although his strength was not as strong as a Third-Grade Martial Artist or above, the solidity of his flesh and blood was shockingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>Tsss!</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin flicked his finger, and a thicker blood-sucking vampire thread shot out, directly targeting Meng Chong's heart.</p><p></p><p>This strike, he truly unleashed the power of a Sect Master-level expert.</p><p></p><p>"You won't be able to block this!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was filled with dread. No matter what, he would not be able to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>He had not even entered the path of the Martial Dao, and even if the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor was powerful, it would be impossible to block the attack of an expert who seemed to be at the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had cultivated the Golden Bone or even the Diamond Vajra Bone, he would still be unable to block it.</p><p></p><p>The gap in realms was too great! </p><p></p><p>The crisis of death had arrived, and Meng Chong was powerless. Compared to Blood Wuxin, he was too weak!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Just as the critical moment of crisis arrived, suddenly, a golden dragon descended from the sky. The blood-sucking vampire thread was instantly shattered, and the golden giant dragon coiled around, directly pulling the airborne Blood Wuxin down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed, feeling a sense of having narrowly escaped death.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had returned from the Eastern River Prefecture, intending to have Shi Er use the intelligence from the Heavenly Mother Sect to investigate the situation in the capital.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he returned to Yunshan County, he sensed a cold aura. A martial artist!</p><p></p><p>And it was right in his courtyard!</p><p></p><p>He was immediately alarmed. Where did this martial artist come from?</p><p></p><p>He immediately teleported to the courtyard above.</p><p></p><p>He just happened to see Meng Chong facing a crisis, and immediately intervened, rescuing Meng Chong and then restraining the airborne Blood Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing I arrived in time, or else my second disciple would have been killed!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Seeing that his second disciple was about to enter the Martial Dao, if he had been killed, it would have been a huge loss for him.</p><p></p><p>Where would he find another suitable disciple to cultivate the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he became furious.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the restrained Blood Wuxin with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>This was a martial artist, and his strength was not weak.</p><p></p><p>It seemed... he was in an injured state.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cultivation in his body was not qi and blood, but a chilling aura, with a tinge of bloodiness, clearly not a good person.</p><p></p><p>"True Qi?" Li Xuan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"No, it's somewhat similar to True Qi, but the quality is inferior to True Qi."</p><p></p><p>The "True Qi" in the other party's body was far less refined than his own Innate True Qi, and its power and quality were also significantly weaker.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is he someone sent by the Wu Emperor? Why would he come to kill my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, having narrowly escaped death, looked at Blood Wuxin with an angry expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down on the chair, an aura of mystery emanating from him, making him appear even more enigmatic.</p><p></p><p>"How are your injuries?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the wound on Meng Chong's fist, with a lingering icy aura.</p><p></p><p>However, the problem was not serious, just a minor injury.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Chong's current flesh and blood recovery ability, it would be completely healed in two to three days.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, under the stimulation of this icy aura, Meng Chong's qi and blood had raged, breaking through the bottleneck and advancing to the Refining Golden Bone stage.</p><p></p><p>It could be considered a blessing in disguise?</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin lay on the ground, his heart filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>A golden dragon coiled around him, the terrifying pressure suppressing him, making him unable to move.</p><p></p><p>His inner energy was also being suppressed, as if it was about to collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"A Grand Sect Master? How could there be a Grand Sect Master expert in the Borderlands?</p><p></p><p>"No! That's not right, this terrifying aura, even a Grand Sect Master might not possess.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this person? He looks profoundly mysterious!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>In the Borderlands, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth was depleted, the spiritual energy was violent, and without the guidance of the spiritual energy, it was impossible to refine and withstand the violent spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there could not be any martial artists.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that he had fled to the Borderlands, escaping the pursuit in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet he never expected that the Borderlands would have such a powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>"Is this their master?"</p><p></p><p>This mysterious expert's hand-seals summoned a golden dragon, with unstoppable might, and the techniques were the same as the young man's. This person must be the young man's master.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on in the Borderlands?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin felt resentful. He had come all the way to the Borderlands, only to end up facing death.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the fallen Blood Wuxin, his brow slightly furrowed. Where did this martial artist come from? Why did he attack Meng Chong? Could it be that he was really sent by the Wu Emperor, as Meng Chong had said?</p><p></p><p>If he was a martial artist sent by the Wu Emperor, his strength should be no weaker than the experts in the Qi Kingdom. There should be martial artists in the Qi Kingdom as well. However, Xu Yan had been causing trouble in the Qi Kingdom for so long, but no martial artists had appeared.</p><p></p><p>"No, could it be that the Qi Emperor has taken a breather and summoned a martial artist to come out?"</p><p></p><p>The martial power of the Qi Kingdom had always been very low.</p><p></p><p>From the various clues, it did not seem that there were any martial artists. Otherwise, Xu Yan would not have been ridiculed for believing in the legends and constantly seeking out powerful experts to cultivate the true Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Xuan was about to have Meng Chong question Blood Wuxin about his origins and his strength in the Martial Dao world, he saw Xu Yan rushing over.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his eyebrows, suddenly understanding. The martial artist Xu Yan had been fighting with must be this person in front of him, right?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan followed the direction of Blood Wuxin's escape, and when he reached the outskirts of Yunshan County, he saw a golden dragon flash by. He was immediately startled, his master had intervened?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly rushed over and saw Blood Wuxin lying on the ground, a golden dragon coiled around him, restraining him tightly.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully saluted.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw the injury on Meng Chong's hand and was shocked, "Shidi, was it him who injured you?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Shixiong, if Master hadn't returned in time, I would have been killed."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said with lingering fear.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This guy might have been sent by Emperor Wu to kill me!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong gritted his teeth and angrily said.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't be." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback, Meng Chong had misunderstood.</p><p></p><p>"You've fought with him, tell us about it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xu Yan and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, and then recounted the whole story.</p><p></p><p>From going to the capital city to investigate the origin of the dried corpse, he originally thought it was the legendary corpse demon, but found out it was not, so he prepared to come back and ask his master what kind of demonic creature was harming people.</p><p></p><p>However, at a post station dozens of miles away, he found that all the station officials had been killed, with their blood drained. He encountered the Blood Heartless and after a fierce battle, the Blood Heartless fled, unable to withstand the fight.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened with a shocked heart, this was a demonic cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Devouring others' blood, if not a demonic cultivator, then what? </p><p></p><p>Where did this demonic cultivator come from?</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why the other party wanted to attack Meng Chong. It must be because they saw that Meng Chong's vital energy was vigorous and his essence blood was rich, containing a huge spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>It could help him recover his injuries and enhance his strength.</p><p></p><p>It's just that they underestimated Meng Chong's physical prowess. The first two times they attacked, they were careless.</p><p></p><p>Also, it's thanks to their carelessness that, otherwise, by the time they returned, Meng Chong would have already died!</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, where do you come from and what are your intentions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slightly loosened the restraint of the golden dragon binding the Blood Heartless, allowing him to speak.</p><p></p><p>This was a good opportunity to learn more about the martial arts world in this world.</p><p></p><p>What is the strength of the martial arts world? What level is his own strength at now?</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and confess!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong clenched his fists and glared at the Blood Heartless angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Admit it honestly, or I'll kill you!"</p><p></p><p>He almost killed him, Meng Chong was furious at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless' heart sank, he looked at Li Xuan, feeling that he was unfathomable and his strength was profound, absolutely not something a great master could compare to.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to escape, he could only try to save his life!</p><p></p><p>"Venerable senior, I apologize, I am the Blood Heartless, from the Inner Domain, being chased by an enemy, so I fled to this remote wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless spoke cautiously.</p><p></p><p>Inner Domain!</p><p>Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan already understood that the Qi Kingdom and Wu Kingdom were located in the wilderness, and beyond the endless mountains was the Inner Domain!</p><p></p><p>The Inner Domain has martial artists!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless should be a demonic martial artist from the Inner Domain, who was besieged and injured, and thus fled to the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>What level is the strength of the martial artists in the Inner Domain?</p><p>What is the martial arts system like in the Inner Domain?</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless' "true qi" was of poor quality, was it because of the cultivation method, or was it due to the different martial arts system?</p><p></p><p>These questions, as a reclusive high-level expert, Li Xuan naturally would not ask.</p><p></p><p>He is a high-level expert, and he must be thoroughly familiar with this world.</p><p></p><p>If he asked such questions, wouldn't it make him seem ignorant of the martial arts world?</p><p></p><p>Besides, he didn't need to ask.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already eagerly asked.</p><p></p><p>Where is the Inner Domain?</p><p>Is it the martial arts world?</p><p>Master has always mysteriously smiled and not mentioned the martial arts world, saying that when his strength reaches a certain level, he will naturally know.</p><p>Now is the opportunity to understand the martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Inner Domain? Is it the martial arts world? Why is this place called the Wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless was stunned, looking at Xu Yan in doubt, he didn't know about the Inner Domain?</p><p>Didn't know about the Wilderness?</p><p></p><p>Looking at Li Xuan again, that mysterious and powerful expert, sitting in the chair, leisurely, seemingly indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"This is a high-level expert!</p><p>From the Inner Domain? Reclusive in the Wilderness.</p><p>Is it to avoid an enemy, or for some other reason? He has taken two disciples here, but has never mentioned anything about the Inner Domain, so..."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless had a bold guess.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Domain is beyond the great mountains, and this place is called the Wilderness because the spiritual energy is depleted, the spiritual energy is violent, unable to sense the spiritual mechanism and absorb the spiritual energy, unable to give birth to martial artists..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong listened with furrowed brows, the Wilderness, the spiritual energy depleted, unable to give birth to martial artists? </p><p>How could that be possible?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also greatly puzzled, "I can absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, I can cultivate... It should be because of the reason I made up for the martial arts, no wonder I feel the spiritual energy is not gentle enough."</p><p></p><p>He finally understood why the spiritual energy was not gentle, it was because the spiritual mechanism was depleted.</p><p></p><p>"It's because of the Heaven and Earth Bridge, using it as a bridge to connect heaven and earth, so even without the spiritual mechanism, one can still cultivate."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan realized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to say, tell us everything you know, what is the strength of the martial arts world in the Inner Domain? Are you a Xiantian realm cultivator? What level are you at?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>Xiantian realm?</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless was a bit confused, what realm is the Xiantian realm?</p><p></p><p>This kid, is he a Xiantian realm cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts are divided into nine grades, breaking through one grade is Refining Qi Master, Refining Qi Grand Master... I am a Mastery realm martial artist, this is my inner qi, sensing the spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth, guiding the spiritual energy into the body, transforming it into martial arts inner qi..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong listened with a dazed expression, what are these nine grades and Refining Qi Masters and Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>The other party is actually a Mastery realm martial artist, and the Grand Master is already the top expert in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened silently, according to the Blood Heartless' words, in terms of realm, the Xiantian realm is weaker than the Mastery realm, the Mastery realm experts in the Inner Domain are much stronger than the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>And his current strength is comparable to the Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>Even a little stronger.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, his heart immediately relaxed, with his current strength, he is also at the top level in the Inner Domain, it won't be long before Xu Yan breaks through the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>His strength absolutely surpasses the Grand Master!</p><p></p><p>"I've said everything I know."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless finished telling everything he knew, then pleaded earnestly: "I was just fleeing in a panic, without any intention to kill, I hope the venerable senior..."</p><p></p><p>It's time to beg for mercy!</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan slightly moved his hand, and the golden dragon suddenly erupted with a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Blood Heartless instantly shattered into dozens of pieces, and then the golden dragon rolled and erupted with scorching energy, grinding the dozens of corpse pieces into flying ash, and with a gust of wind, the ash all blew away.</p><p></p><p>There was not a single trace left.</p><p></p><p>Only a bag and a knife fell to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon rolled, and the knife and bag fell into Li Xuan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both stunned, he just killed him?</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, with a serious expression on his face, it was time to educate his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Disciples, you must remember, for this kind of person of unknown origin, with evil intentions and hostility, do not be soft-hearted, crush their bones, scatter their ashes, and extinguish their souls, leaving no trace, no clues to be found.</p><p></p><p>"This can avoid many unnecessary troubles, such as killing the small ones, the big ones will come, kill one person, the sect behind them will come to the door, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Just crush the bones, scatter the ashes, and extinguish the soul, leaving no trace.</p><p></p><p>"As long as no one knows who did it, it has nothing to do with us!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong listened attentively, this was the master imparting the experience of the martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>"Crush the bones, scatter the ashes, extinguish the soul? As long as no one knows it was me, it has nothing to do with me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured, he felt he had enlightened!</p>

        <h1>Chapter 482</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Shocked, he couldn't help but look vigilant.</p><p></p><p>"Don't panic, I am the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao guided by the Ancestor of the Dao!" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi tried hard to put on a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao?! Xu Junhe's heart shook. Although he didn't know what the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao was, he still breathed a sigh of relief. It seemed the other party had become the Heavenly Dao through the guidance of an elder.</p><p></p><p>"So it's the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe bowed respectfully with cupped hands.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the concept of Heavenly Dao emerged, and he became increasingly amazed by the elder's methods.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao. Seeing that the Great Wilderness is weak, I need you of Canglan Island to do some things!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi spoke carefully.</p><p></p><p>"What needs to be done?"</p><p></p><p>"Revere the Heavenly Dao! Those who comprehend the Heavenly Dao will greatly increase their cultivation speed, can have sudden insights into martial arts, and find cultivation easier..."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Junhe nodded and said, "No problem!"</p><p></p><p>These were all small matters. Since this one had become the Heavenly Dao of the Great Wilderness through an elder's guidance, he was now one of their own.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Heavenly Dao was quite mysterious!</p><p></p><p>"This Canglan Island is a bit small. A holy land should look like a holy land."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi took steps on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>"It is indeed a bit small, but this island is rather special after all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Small problem. In my eyes as the Heavenly Dao, these are all small problems."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi laughed happily.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Junhe was shocked to discover that Canglan Island was growing larger. In an instant, it turned into a huge island. Correspondingly, the section of the Cang River where Canglan Island was located turned into a vast lake of blue waves.</p><p></p><p>The Cang River was still the Cang River. The only difference was that the section of the Cang River at Canglan Island had become a large lake, while the downstream of the Cang River continued to flow out from the other end of the lake.</p><p></p><p>This change was completed in just a short time.</p><p></p><p>The people on Canglan Island were stunned for a moment, but were shocked to find that Canglan Island had completely changed.</p><p></p><p>The ships sailing on the Cang River and those martial artists suddenly felt they were on an unfamiliar river. Looking up, they saw that the holy land of Canglan Island had disappeared to who knows where.</p><p></p><p>"Look quickly, how did the downstream turn into a big lake? We were clearly just in the Canglan Island section of the Cang River. What exactly happened?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we've arrived in the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible. I'm on the Cang River, and didn't cross the gate to the Spirit Realm. How could I be in the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Where did the holy island go?"</p><p></p><p>The ships on the Cang River and many martial artists were shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Several master-level martial artists took to the air, flying towards the original direction of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Flying along the way, gliding over the rippling blue lake, they finally saw a small black dot in the center of the lake.</p><p></p><p>As they got closer, they found that it seemed to be Canglan Island!</p><p></p><p>However, it had undergone huge changes compared to the Canglan Island in their memory.</p><p></p><p>The mountains on the island towered high. The original small island had now become a giant island.</p><p></p><p>But looking at the outline of the island, one could faintly see the shape of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Junhe was entertaining Tianzi, his heart shocked. This was the power of the Heavenly Dao - changing heaven and earth in a single thought!</p><p></p><p>On this day, with the dramatic change of Canglan Island, the transformation of the Great Wilderness also began.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, the holy land of Canglan Island in the Great Wilderness, the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, and the Great Wilderness Inner Cabinet together passed down the idea of revering the Heavenly Dao and martial artists comprehending the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Heavenly Dao allowed one to have sudden insights into martial arts and easily break through bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>In addition to cultivation, martial artists of the Great Wilderness also began to comprehend the Heavenly Dao. Some former inner domain martial artists gained sudden insights while comprehending the Heavenly Dao, and in a short time, completed the transition to the Great Wilderness martial path.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the strength of the Great Wilderness visibly increased.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao method of Ancestor Dao is indeed profound and powerful. I can become stronger just by lying down. These shackles on my body will be completely removed before long."</p><p></p><p>"What Taishuang couldn't do, I, Tianzi, can accomplish. Those guys just wait and see, including those from the Unmelting Divine Temple secretly watching me from the world - just you all wait!"</p><p></p><p>This was his world!</p><p></p><p>"Taishuang is dead, the Great Wilderness shall rise. I am the Heavenly Dao of the Great Wilderness. Those who offend the dignity of my Heavenly Dao shall be severely punished!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was entering a stage of explosive growth in strength. The grade of spirit medicines was constantly improving, and heavenly and earthly treasures became more abundant. Martial artists could also cultivate faster.</p><p></p><p>In just a short time, martial artists cultivating and comprehending the Heavenly Dao had become deeply rooted in people's hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness had a Heavenly Dao, recognized by the living beings of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"You're all quite good at making a fuss. This world isn't yours. Just you wait to kneel down and call me Grandpa Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi looked towards the location of the Divine Realm and sneered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>No matter what schemes those people had, they ultimately knew too little about Taishuang. As long as he, the spirit of the world, was here, no one could seize the authority of the world and become the master of the Taishuang world.</p><p></p><p>Even if they obtained the Taishuang Book, it wasn't so easy to become the master of the world.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the Taishuang Book left by Taishuang could cultivate someone to become the new master of the Taishuang world, it also required his approval. Otherwise, as the spirit of the world, he could check and balance the other party.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to make some advance arrangements for the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the range of the Great Wilderness was only the inner domain, which was the smallest one.</p><p></p><p>Now that the strength of the Great Wilderness was rapidly increasing, when the time was right, he would extend the rules of the Heavenly Dao to the Spirit Realm, then to the Divine Realm, and finally to the entire world.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, the tremors of the world were still continuing.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was unaffected, but people like Emperor Dayue were feeling some pressure and were desperately cultivating to improve their strength as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also upgrading the grand formation of the Qinghua Sect, while Su Lingxiu was using the World Divine Furnace to enhance her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Within the Nine Mountains, the demon race was making a grand show. More and more immortal-realm spirit beasts from various parts of the Divine Realm were gathering.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat looked at the Wind Spirit Tiger and said, "The position of Demon King has been decided. You don't have the position of Demon King, but I won't mistreat you either. You'll serve as a Demon General of the demon race. I'll assign twelve Demon Commanders to you!"</p><p></p><p>"But, worthy brother..." </p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as it started speaking, a roar came.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you address the Demon King as 'worthy brother'? You're offending our Great Demon King. What punishment do you deserve?"</p><p></p><p>Several spirit beasts who had pledged allegiance to the Red Cat earliest and were quicker-witted jumped out to rebuke the Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger's face turned black.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, the other Demon Commanders surged with energy, as if they might take action to subdue it at any time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wind Spirit Tiger felt a surge of crisis. With so many Demon Commanders acting together, it was no match for them. By now, the Wind Spirit Tiger also knew that it could no longer continue being the big brother.</p><p></p><p>The entire Divine Realm was now in turmoil, and the great changes in the world had already come. Moreover, its escape from Dragon Abyss with its life had spread, which would surely attract the attention of Tian Seventeen.</p><p></p><p>Only in the demon race did it have a place to stay.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was very strong! So strong that it made the Wind Spirit Tiger's heart palpitate. That majestic tiger aura truly possessed the air of a tiger king. No tiger spirit beast in the world could defy the tiger king's might of the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>And the Red Cat was not just the king of the tiger clan, but also the founder of the demon race, the Great King of demons.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>!</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Yu Xiaolong and Little Ha, the three great demon kings were all stronger than it. Indeed, there was no place for it anymore.</p><p></p><p>The ways of the demon race were also what the Wind Spirit Tiger urgently needed. It wanted to become stronger to deal with the impending crisis, and even to seek revenge against Tian Shiqi!</p><p></p><p>"I pay my respects to the Great Demon King!" </p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wind Spirit Tiger submitted.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! There's no need for such formalities between us. From today on, you shall be the Wind Spirit Demon General!"</p><p></p><p>Chimao said with great delight.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, thank you, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Chimao came down and said, "I've heard there are twelve Spirit Beast Kings in the Divine Realm. Now only you are here. Where are the other eleven Spirit Beast Kings?"</p><p></p><p>The twelve Spirit Beast Kings were the strongest among the spirit beasts of the Divine Realm. Chimao wanted to gather twelve demon generals!</p><p></p><p>"The Jiao that was originally in Longyuan was tricked away by Tian Shiqi to who knows where. As for the other beast kings, they each have their own territories, and they're quite arrogant. I don't know where they are now."</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger shook its head and said.</p><p></p><p>"Then spread the news that the positions of demon generals in the demon race are waiting for them, first come first served!"</p><p></p><p>Chimao said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>Inside that pavilion in Taimiao Divine Sect, Xin Mengrou respectfully prostrated herself before the statue.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshai's ambitions are not small, but it's too presumptuous of him to think he can seize the authority of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>A dreamy female voice came from the statue.</p><p></p><p>"You've cultivated very well. When the Dao Realm and Divine Realm are connected, come to the Taimiao Realm in the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou respectfully said, "Yes, Ancestral Master!"</p><p></p><p>"The true dragon has been subdued, this is no small matter. The true dragon clan has profound foundations. The disappearance of that little dragon cub has caused quite a stir, and subduing a dragon is a great humiliation for the true dragon clan."</p><p></p><p>"The true dragons will surely retaliate. Besides the true dragon clan, other forces from various realms will likely covet the method of subduing dragons."</p><p></p><p>"Be especially wary of Tianshai. This person is ambitious and acts shamelessly. He may be the first to try to seize the dragon-subduing method. If he has backing, find someone to protect you quickly. The affairs of the Divine Realm have already been transmitted to the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>The statue's voice was cold and always emotionless. Moreover, the voice sounded as if it were from a dream.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was puzzled. The heavenly ladder to the Dao Realm had been broken, so how did they learn about Xu Yan subduing the dragon in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Master, the heavenly ladder is broken. How was the news of subduing the dragon transmitted to the Dao Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Taihe, Dayan, Taikun, and others have channels to communicate with the Dao Realm. They naturally would transmit the affairs of the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>The statue explained.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou suddenly understood. No wonder the Ancestral Master was curious about the dragon-subduing incident. It turned out that major forces had already transmitted the news to various realms in the Dao Realm through special channels.</p><p></p><p>"There should be Divine Venerable realm martial artists in the Divine Realm, otherwise this couldn't be done. Tell them to be careful. Tianshai will likely have that person take action."</p><p></p><p>The statue reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the warning, Ancestral Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's heart shook. Although that senior was incredibly powerful and may have given Xu Yan some life-saving measures, necessary precautions couldn't be lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Go now!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou immediately went to find Xu Yan to inform him that news of the dragon-subduing had spread throughout the Dao Realm, and about the crisis it would trigger.</p><p></p><p>"A Divine Venerable martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, thinking of Tian Shiqi.</p><p></p><p>"It's no matter, just a small issue. Besides, that old man's strength is even greater."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Outside Taimiao Divine Sect, Meng Chong, Jiang Buping, and Wu Tiannan rushed over.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xin, it's been a long time."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan looked at Xin Mengrou and sighed with emotion. The little girl from back then had already come this far, even surpassing him.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu, you're still not falling behind."</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou smiled happily. Some past knots in her heart had long been untied. It was worth rejoicing to meet an old friend again.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu, did you find the person you were looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan shook his head somewhat dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone gathered at Taimiao Divine Sect, and Meng Chong and Jiang Buping asked curiously, "Senior Brother, where's the true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"Right here!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and Ao Yuxue from inside the primordial turtle shell was moved out.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the beautiful young woman with two small horns on her head, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping were stunned. They circled around her and said in disbelief, "She's the true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "That's right, she's a female dragon, and not yet an adult!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue angrily stomped her feet and said, "Can you stop calling me a female dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"Then little mother dragon?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"You... you..."</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's eyes turned red, almost on the verge of tears.</p><p></p><p>"It's dragon maiden, dragon maiden, you know? We of the true dragon clan are not like those spirit beasts, we can't be called female or mother!"</p><p></p><p>She angrily corrected.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, true dragons look like this?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, somewhat confused.</p><p></p><p>"The legends don't describe true dragons like this."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping also nodded, "I've seen brief descriptions in the Jiang family's ancient records. True dragons aren't supposed to be people with two small horns!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, pinching one of Ao Yuxue's small horns, and said, "She has transformed into human form."</p><p></p><p>Then he instructed Ao Yuxue, "Quickly return to your true dragon form, let my junior brothers see what a true dragon looks like."</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's face flushed red with grief and indignation. What did they take her for, an exhibit?</p><p></p><p>"I won't!"</p><p></p><p>She shook her head stubbornly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snorted coldly and said, "You are the dragon I subdued. You dare to defy me?"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the small golden dragon in her mind start to surge, Ao Yuxue immediately became afraid and said, "Fine, I'll return to my true form. Why are you being so fierce!"</p><p></p><p>Roar! Accompanied by a dragon's cry, a flawless jade-white true dragon rose into the air, coiling in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a true dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, does Yu Xiaolong have a chance to become a dragon now?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly thought of Yu Xiaolong the Jiao.</p><p></p><p>"Probably?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wasn't certain either.</p><p></p><p>"Are you satisfied now?"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue came down from the sky and transformed back into human form.</p><p></p><p>However, her complexion was much paler than before, clearly showing her injuries from before were not light.</p><p></p><p>"I need to go back and recuperate!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan collected Ao Yuxue back into the primordial turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"Let's return to Qinghua Realm. It's time to seclude ourselves and consolidate for a while."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"That's right. The Divine Realm is changing greatly, and powerful experts from the Dao Realm will arrive soon. We should consolidate and improve our strength as quickly as possible."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu, care to join us?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Wu Tiannan with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, we'd also like to go pay our respects to the senior and we miss Little Sister Lingxiu."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"What about Senior Xin?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>"Wait for me a moment. I'll go bid farewell to the Ancestral Master. I'd also like to consult the senior about some martial arts confusion!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

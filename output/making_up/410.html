        <h1>Chapter 410</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This old man, Wu Tiannan had encountered him more than a dozen times. Each time he encountered the other party, he was lying not far from him.</p><p></p><p>At first, he thought it was just a coincidence. </p><p></p><p>After it happened again and again, Wu Tiannan was certain that the other party was deliberately following him.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he was about to step forward and ask directly, when he saw the old man suddenly sit up, look up at the sky, with a surprised and astonished expression.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was puzzled. While remaining vigilant of the other party, he looked up at the sky but didn't discover anything.</p><p></p><p>And the other party didn't take advantage of him looking at the sky to suddenly attack.</p><p></p><p>"Strange," the old man muttered.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, why are you following me?" Wu Tiannan took a deep breath and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The old man withdrew his gaze, looked at Wu Tiannan, and said with a smile: "I'm not following you, this is fate. Why is your luck so extraordinary, young man?"</p><p></p><p>Before Wu Tiannan could react, the old man was already in front of him, circling around him, clicking his tongue and saying: "Not simple, really not simple. The martial arts you practice are quite extraordinary, your luck is extraordinary. Who is your master?"</p><p></p><p>"I..." Wu Tiannan was shocked. The old man's strength was far beyond what he could compare to. If he wanted to kill him, it wouldn't take any effort at all.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be an Immortal Venerable?" he thought to himself, but for a moment he didn't know how to answer out loud.</p><p></p><p>Who was his master? His martial arts guide was not a master-disciple relationship, and his relationship with the senior expert was also not a master-disciple relationship. Strictly speaking, he had no master!</p><p></p><p>"This junior has no master," he said.</p><p></p><p>"Then who passed on your martial arts to you?" The old man asked with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"A senior expert passed it on."</p><p></p><p>"A senior expert? How does he compare to me?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, you are not as good as him."</p><p></p><p>"Interesting." The old man smiled and said, "Your thick luck seems to be favored by heaven and earth. Was it bestowed by that expert you mentioned?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was puzzled and shook his head, "I don't know."</p><p></p><p>He also felt that his luck seemed a bit too good. For example, some days ago, he saw two Immortal Venerables engage in a great battle. All the martial artists traveling with him died.</p><p></p><p>But he escaped unscathed, and even picked up a divine weapon! This kind of experience of turning danger into safety and obtaining treasures had happened more than once or twice. Now that the old man asked about it, Wu Tiannan couldn't help but wonder if his thick luck had something to do with the senior expert. Was it because he had successfully cultivated the divine ability passed on by the senior expert and established a martial arts connection with this senior expert, thus receiving karmic feedback?</p><p></p><p>After all, the senior expert was a supreme being who had transcended heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Where is this expert you speak of?" the old man asked with interest.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan pondered for a moment before saying, "He may be in the Qinghua Realm, or he may not be. I'm not sure."</p><p></p><p>The old man nodded.</p><p></p><p>He took out a token and stuffed it into Wu Tiannan's hand, saying, "This is for you. It's annoying to run into you everywhere, as if you're treating me as some kind of opportunity. Your luck is a bit ridiculous."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was dumbfounded. It was clearly this old man who had been following him, so how could he think that he was running into Wu Tiannan everywhere?</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" he looked at the token in his hand, feeling it was extraordinary but not understanding its purpose.</p><p></p><p>"When you go to the Tahe Realm, when the time is right, you silly boy will know the use of the token," the old man shook his head. How could there be someone with such luck in this world?</p><p></p><p>How strange.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, wait a moment. I want to ask you about someone," Wu Tiannan suddenly said.</p><p></p><p>"With your luck, you'll find them soon enough. No need to ask me. This old man doesn't know many people in the Divine Realm!" The old man waved his hand and left, disappearing without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had a helpless expression as he put away the token.</p><p></p><p>"The Tahe Realm, huh? The first and strongest realm of the Divine Realm. I'll go there sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>He set off again on his journey to find someone.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"This Wu Tiannan seems a bit odd," Li Xuan suddenly said with surprise in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was one thing that Wu Tiannan had cultivated divine abilities, and more than one at that. What surprised him more was that through this martial arts connection, he was astonished to discover that Wu Tiannan's luck seemed to be extremely thick.</p><p></p><p>"Could he really be a child of fortune?" Li Xuan was puzzled. Wu Tiannan was actually a child of fortune? When Wu Tiannan was around, there was no Heavenly Dao Eye, otherwise he could have seen through his luck at a glance to figure out what was going on.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, no matter how much of a child of fortune he is, he's no match for my disciple," Li Xuan shook his head and returned his attention to the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>"Almost there, I'm almost done memorizing the main principles of the Taicang Book."</p><p></p><p>He was not far from fully comprehending the Dao principles of the Taicang Heaven and Earth, which also meant he could go to that small stone house in the Wu Kingdom palace to take a look at that mysterious figure and explore the secrets of the Taicang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>While Li Xuan was living his normal little life, on one hand studying the main principles of the Taicang Book, and on the other hand adding bricks and tiles to his great martial arts cause, a piece of news arrived.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains City, where the gate to the Nine Mountains Realm was located, had fallen. To the surprise of Emperor Dayue and others, it was not occupied by Tianshadiying, but rather a Blood Son of the Netherworld had entered the gate of the Nine Mountains Realm and was confronting an Immortal Venerable of the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>Half of the entire Nine Mountains City had collapsed, with countless dead and injured.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the Immortal Venerables had lasted for a long time, with no victor yet determined.</p><p></p><p>And since the gate of the Nine Mountains Realm could lead directly into the Qinghua Realm, another Immortal Venerable was sent to guard the gate of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was a certain chance that the Immortal Venerable confronting the Blood Son of the Netherworld was one of Tianshadiying's people.</p><p></p><p>Just as Emperor Dayue, the Sect Master of Tianwu Gate, and the Sect Master of Wanlei Sect were discussing plans to go to the Nine Mountains Realm to provide support and defeat that Blood Son of the Netherworld, the sky rift in the Qinghua Realm once again showed signs of a large-scale invasion.</p><p></p><p>At the location of the Dayue sky rift, there were even powerful Blood Sons of the Netherworld attempting to descend. Left with no choice, Emperor Dayue had to personally go to guard it.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld sky rifts were turbulent at this time, clearly to tie down the Qinghua Realm and prevent Emperor Dayue and others from going to the Nine Mountains Realm to provide support.</p><p></p><p>"Another Blood Son of the Netherworld, it's really chaotic," Li Xuan sighed as he looked towards the direction of the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? A Netherworld army has appeared this time?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a look and then paid no more attention. It was just an army of a few thousand Netherworld martial artists. The life-saving jade talismans of Xu Yan and Meng Chong had not been activated yet, indicating that the two had not encountered any danger. Since there was no danger, rising up amidst the chaos and improving through battle was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was becoming more and more chaotic, with battles between Immortal Venerables breaking out several times.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the closed cultivation room, Jiang Buping's soul appeared, while his physical body was inside his soul, wrapped by the power of his soul.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, strands of undissipating qi were fusing into his soul, merging with his soul, or rather, assimilating with it.</p><p></p><p>As the undissipating qi fused, changes were also occurring in his soul.</p><p></p><p>His already powerful soul was now</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>As the indestructible qi was absorbed, it became more and more solid, gradually becoming indistinguishable from the physical body.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the last wisp of indestructible qi completely dispersed into the spirit soul, fully merging with it.</p><p></p><p>A faint glow emanated from the spirit soul, and a sense of indestructibility manifested on it.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The spirit soul exploded, turning into a mist-like form, then quickly came back together, intact as before, without any sense of weakening.</p><p></p><p>The increasingly solid spirit soul continued to transform, and a powerful spiritual force surged out, growing stronger and more concentrated.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Jiang Buping's spirit soul was already vastly different from that of a Taicang martial artist, seeming to possess a quality of indestructibility and immortality.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The spirit soul scattered again, becoming a mist that spread throughout the closed room, then reassembled once more.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally succeeded!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After days and nights of arduous cultivation, from initially enduring drowsiness and listlessness, relying on stimulating his body with intense pain and taking pills to force himself to stay awake and focus on cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had finally fully integrated the indestructible qi into his spirit soul.</p><p></p><p>After the indestructible qi merged with the spirit soul and became one, initiating a transformation, he had finally cultivated an indestructible spirit soul! He would no longer be troubled by the indestructible qi, and no longer had to worry about one day losing his intelligence and becoming muddled.</p><p></p><p>"This is only the first step!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping calmed his excited emotions and resumed cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to enter the realm of Extreme Soul Martial Arts and become an Extreme Soul martial artist. Merging with the indestructible qi and transforming into an indestructible spirit soul was only the first step.</p><p></p><p>At this point, he was not yet an Extreme Soul martial artist and had not truly crossed the threshold of Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Although, due to the indestructible qi, he was born with a spirit soul and had a higher starting point for cultivating Extreme Soul Martial Arts, skipping the step-by-step, level-by-level arduous cultivation, and directly merging with the indestructible qi to cultivate an indestructible spirit soul in one go.</p><p></p><p>For this very reason, despite cultivating an indestructible spirit soul, he had not yet crossed the threshold of Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"I have already comprehended Extreme Soul Martial Arts, and it won't be long before I become an Extreme Soul martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's eyes were determined.</p><p></p><p>He had finally risen again. Those who had abandoned him, insulted him, and mocked him probably never imagined that he would rise again and reappear before them, right? "Taikun Realm, I will return."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression was resolute.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul Martial Arts, the pinnacle of the spirit soul, the ultimate way of the spirit soul, lies in the word 'extreme'; the physical body can be present or absent, but Extreme Soul martial artists do not abandon the physical body, rather they gradually refine the physical body into the spirit soul."</p><p></p><p>"Using the physical body to nourish the spirit soul, this physical body is no longer one of flesh and blood, but an Extreme Soul body."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping looked at his physical body, enveloping it with his spirit soul's power, and began truly cultivating Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Jiang Buping has merged with the indestructible qi, transforming into an indestructible spirit soul. Your primordial spirit has transformed into an indestructible and immortal primordial spirit."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao arrived.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had finally fully merged with the indestructible qi, transforming into an indestructible spirit soul, taking a crucial step in the cultivation of Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"So this is an indestructible and immortal primordial spirit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>His fifth disciple had also started to provide feedback, and new martial arts gains were coming.</p><p></p><p>The transformation of his primordial spirit to be indestructible and immortal also meant that his strength had increased, and even if his physical body was destroyed, his primordial spirit would not perish.</p><p></p><p>To completely kill him would be almost impossible; he could only be sealed away.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but think of the one in the small stone house in the Wu Kingdom's palace. Was it because of such a special quality, unable to be completely destroyed, that they were sealed away?</p><p></p><p>"With my current primordial spirit, if I use the soul-killing divine ability, even martial artists with strength comparable to mine would not be able to resist."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immediately felt his confidence increase again.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul Martial Arts will soon be cultivated."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation. After Jiang Buping successfully cultivated Extreme Soul Martial Arts, what feedback would he receive? This fifth martial art was focused on the spirit soul, would the feedback cause his primordial spirit to transform once again? Time passed as Li Xuan waited in eager anticipation.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was becoming increasingly chaotic. Battles between Immortal Venerable beings erupted every few days, and the various great abysses in the Qinghua Realm also began to experience turmoil, forcing these Immortal Venerable beings to not rashly leave the abysses.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor had been stationed at the abyss for some time now, with Sui Hongwu presiding over the Great Yue capital.</p><p></p><p>Although there were formations to assist, greatly reducing the threat of Netherworld invasions, the Immortal Venerable beings were still tied down, unable to attend to the chaos in the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>This was perhaps the intention of Tianshabei and Diying.</p><p></p><p>As for Feng Yan, this Immortal Venerable, he pretended not to know about the turmoil in the Nine Mountains Realm. After all, he had no disciples or subordinates there; he was a lone cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he continued to preside over the Qimen Academy and the Medicine Academy, cultivating divine abilities while working diligently.</p><p></p><p>"When opportunity comes, I must seize it firmly!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan thought resolutely, nothing could shake his determination to grasp this opportunity! He was able to become an Immortal Venerable not only because of his innate talent and hard work but also because of a huge advantage: knowing how to seize opportunities!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, who was studying the Taicang Book, suddenly saw the Golden Book of the Great Dao open, and feedback appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Has Jiang Buping successfully cultivated Extreme Soul Martial Arts?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's first thought was that Jiang Buping had become an Extreme Soul martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has cultivated an indestructible sword intent. Your indestructible sword intent is a hundred times stronger."</p><p></p><p>Indestructible sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately delighted. "Xu Yan truly lives up to being my martial arts pioneer. He has used the indestructible qi to cultivate sword techniques, creating an indestructible sword intent that is eternal and undying."</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but marvel at how extraordinary Xu Yan was.</p><p></p><p>The indestructible sword intent, continuous and unending, eternal and undying, meant that the sword intent would be even harder to destroy, and even if a trace of sword intent remained somewhere, it would be difficult to dissipate even after the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>"With the indestructible sword intent combined with the Yin-Yang Undying Sword, the defense is so strong that with Xu Yan's current strength, even ordinary Immortal Venerable beings would not be able to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also thought of the Xunfeng sword intent, which was a soul-killing sword intent. With the indestructible property, once it slashed into an enemy's soul, even if the enemy could resist it, the residual sword intent would be difficult to eliminate.</p><p></p><p>The residual sword intent would constantly affect the soul, becoming an eternal wound on the soul. If one day the soul weakened, it would be killed by the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"The indestructible sword intent has finally been found, figuring out how to use the indestructible qi to enhance strength."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a feeling that Xu Yan would likely eventually comprehend how to use the indestructible qi to cultivate primordial spirit-like divine abilities, and even if contaminated by the indestructible qi, he would not lose his intelligence.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also listening to the method of Extreme Soul Martial Arts. Although his talent was not in Extreme Soul Martial Arts and he cultivated pure martial arts, given Xu Yan's extraordinary nature, it was not impossible for him to use Extreme Soul Martial Arts as a reference to comprehend a method to be unaffected by the indestructible qi.</p><p></p><p>"Pure martial arts, because of their purity, can accommodate all ways."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, knowing that one day Xu Yan would forge his own path in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

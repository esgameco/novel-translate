        <h1>Chapter 527</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Beyond the Outer Realm, the original Netherworld realm had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the Outer Realm, only one world remained, like a magnificent jewel inlaid in the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld gazed distantly at that world with deep eyes.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?"</p><p></p><p>When the Witch Demon realm collided with Cang Shu, the expected clash of realm forces, violent upheaval of the Cang Shu realm, and even the appearance of huge holes in the world did not occur.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was as if the Cang Shu realm had devoured the Witch Demon realm, actually expanding. The laws of the Cang Shu realm seemed to have grown stronger.</p><p></p><p>In the primordial chaos of the Outer Realm, that jewel-like world seemed to be shrouded in a layer of radiance. Moreover, this radiance was slowly growing stronger, illuminating the Outer Realm.</p><p></p><p>Roar! An Outer Realm spirit let out a cry, wanting to enter that world, but anxiously stopped short, as if feeling a sense of awe towards that magnificent realm.</p><p></p><p>This had never happened before.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Cang Shu's contingency plan? You actually prepared to this extent?"</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld muttered to itself.</p><p></p><p>An imposing figure appeared in its mind - he was gentle yet domineering, not bullying others with his power, yet inviolable. Even after perishing, he had arranged such a backup plan. It was truly inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>After the passage of long ages, even though Cang Shu had died, his realm still remained. That one in the Divine Palace of the Outer Realm had not invaded the Cang Shu realm after Cang Shu's demise.</p><p></p><p>"How did you end up losing?"</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld murmured in its heart. To this day, it still could not imagine that the one who ultimately lost would be Cang Shu!</p><p></p><p>"The time is almost here."</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld looked towards a certain place in the Outer Realm, then turned and led five Blood Lords away. No matter what arrangements Cang Shu had made or what contingencies he had left behind, the final outcome was already determined.</p><p></p><p>It had been determined the moment Cang Shu perished.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Outer Realm, an Outer Realm spirit as large as a huge mountain lay silently, having long lost any trace of life.</p><p></p><p>This spirit had a back like mountain ranges and thick limbs. Its head had disappeared, leaving only a corpse as large as a mountain, covered in fierce scales.</p><p></p><p>Around this spirit, low roars could be heard from time to time. In the primordial chaos, pairs of huge eyes could be seen, emanating a faint cold light.</p><p></p><p>This was the territory of the spirits.</p><p></p><p>Each Outer Realm spirit had a powerful aura, no weaker than the lord of a small realm. They gathered in groups, surrounding the mountain-like spirit corpse.</p><p></p><p>The mountain-like spirit corpse had once been an extremely powerful spirit, but it had perished ages ago.</p><p></p><p>Its huge and hard corpse seemed to have transformed into a real great mountain.</p><p></p><p>Between the fierce scales, some thin, light red grass had even grown, as if giving this mountain formed from the spirit's corpse some signs of life.</p><p></p><p>A weak spirit approached the huge mountain, lowering its head to nibble on the light red grass. This was one of the food sources for the young of this group of spirits.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, the spirit corpse mountain emitted a muffled sound. The young spirit was startled, crying out in alarm as it ran back to rejoin the spirit group.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A low roar sounded out. The leader of the spirit group looked towards the corpse mountain and let out a deep growl.</p><p></p><p>The corpse mountain did not make any further movements. The warning in the spirit leader's eyes slowly faded as it continued to rest prone on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Outer Realm was endless primordial chaos. No one knew how many Outer Realm spirits lived there, or how many once-powerful spirits had perished, their corpses turning into mountains.</p><p></p><p>This spirit corpse mountain was not particularly eye-catching in the Outer Realm, and was even somewhat ordinary.</p><p></p><p>However, the interior of this spirit corpse mountain had long since been hollowed out, carved into a secret hiding place.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this mountain formed from the spirit's corpse had a special property - it could gather and conceal auras, preventing detection by others.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Demon realm has disappeared."</p><p></p><p>Inside the corpse mountain, a pair of eyes opened in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The person sitting cross-legged in the secret chamber had a high forehead, large eyes, and hair like strange insects. His appearance was fierce and terrifying, with a muscular body exuding an aura of might.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, his eyes looked somewhat dim, his face pale, and his aura weak.</p><p></p><p>Even his insect-like hair strands seemed to have lost their vitality.</p><p></p><p>Witch Demon!</p><p></p><p>He was the lord of the Witch Demon realm, one of the seven realm lords - Witch Demon! This was his true Witch Demon form!</p><p></p><p>Witch Demon's eyes looked towards a certain direction. After a long silence, he finally let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"Has the Divine Palace of the Outer Realm already begun to make its move? I have not yet recovered."</p><p></p><p>With a sigh, his insect-like hair gradually returned to normal. His high forehead and large eyes disappeared, replaced by the appearance of an imposing man.</p><p></p><p>This was Witch Demon's human form! After transforming into human form, his hair was no longer insect-like, but it looked dry and lackluster.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot continue like this. It's time to take a risk. I must recover as quickly as possible."</p><p></p><p>Witch Demon's gaze gradually turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I, Witch Demon, die, I will make you Divine Palace of the Outer Realm pay a price."</p><p></p><p>Witch Demon stood up and slowly walked out of the spirit corpse mountain where he was hiding, looking towards the group of Outer Realm spirits outside.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the spirit corpse mountain exploded. A fierce and terrifying figure appeared. Its huge body stood tall in the Outer Realm, with hair like writhing insects floating and swaying. Its giant arms ended in claw-like hands sharp as blades.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The spirits let out howls, but these sounds revealed their fear.</p><p></p><p>"Devouring you will help speed up my recovery somewhat."</p><p></p><p>Witch Demon looked at this group of spirits, his gaze deep. Since gaining sentience and establishing his realm, he had never again eaten spirits alive.</p><p></p><p>That was how he had hunted for food before gaining sentience.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could no longer afford to care about such things. He had to recover as quickly as possible, even if this action would expose his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>If he continued hiding and recovering slowly, who knew how long it would take to fully recover. Moreover, he no longer had time to keep hiding and recovering gradually.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Witch Demon's aura was powerful. His insect-like hair lashed out, instantly wrapping around a spirit and pulling it in. The insect-like hair began devouring the spirit.</p><p></p><p>The spirits in this area of the Outer Realm all looked towards a certain spot, showing fear on their faces. A terrifying aura was manifesting there.</p><p></p><p>Two figures walking through the Outer Realm suddenly raised their heads, looking in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>"It's Witch Demon's aura. He has finally revealed his whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"This time, he won't be able to escape!"</p><p></p><p>The two figures instantly vanished from where they were, heading straight for where Witch Demon's aura had appeared.</p><p></p><p>After devouring a group of spirits, Witch Demon concealed his aura and fled far away in an instant. He had not yet recovered, and if he was caught up to, there would ultimately be some danger.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Witch Demon left, two figures arrived.</p><p></p><p>"He can't have gone far. Since he risked exposing himself to devour spirits, it shows that not only has he not recovered from his injuries, they have actually gotten worse. Let's split up to chase him. He won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>The two figures separated and began pursuing Witch Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Outer Realm, a spirit was instantly torn apart, wrapped up by insect-like hair and completely devoured.</p><p></p><p>Witch Demon devoured one</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After the head spirit left, it continued to flee far away.</p><p></p><p>In the slowly drifting ancient and solemn temple, a voice sounded. The voice was not loud, but it was supreme, irrefutable, and unquestionable.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Demon has appeared. Blood Demon, go kill him."</p><p></p><p>"Yes," Blood Demon respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>A streak of blood light shot out from the Immortal Temple, heading straight for a certain place in the Immortal Land. Its speed was extremely fast, instantly leaving the Immortal Temple far behind.</p><p></p><p>After Blood Demon left the Immortal Temple, his eyes grew dark and sinister.</p><p></p><p>"I, Blood Demon, have obtained this great opportunity. How could I associate with you useless lot? I am a disciple of the Ancestor of the Dao! I'll tolerate you for now, but wait until I break through to the Realm of Establishing the Dao. No, until I break through beyond that - then I'll show you.</p><p></p><p>"The master of the Immortal Temple must be me!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon laughed coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Hunt down and kill the Witch Demon? </p><p></p><p>Blood Demon had no interest in that. It was just that his strength was still inferior to others for now, so he didn't dare disobey and could only pretend to follow orders.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Demon truly didn't die. That's quite impressive."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>In that battle back then, he had fought against the Witch Demon. The Witch Demon's strength was still above his own.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang!"</p><p></p><p>In that battle, when the Witch Demon suffered heavy injuries, at the last moment it was that domineering and majestic figure who came with one punch, directly opening up a path of survival for the Witch Demon.</p><p></p><p>But Tai Cang was dead!</p><p></p><p>"If Tai Cang hadn't died, would his strength have surpassed his by now?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>That one in the Immortal Temple was undoubtedly extremely powerful. However, if Tai Cang had been given more time, the outcome would have been hard to predict.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon transformed into a streak of blood light, instantly disappearing far away, leaving behind both the Immortal Temple and the realm where Tai Cang resided. He pretended to go hunt down the Witch Demon, but in reality he wanted to find a place to seclude himself and cultivate bitterly, waiting for feedback from his soul fragment, waiting to become a supreme expert above the Realm of Establishing the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through, he would immediately return to the Immortal Temple, pull down that one, step on him viciously a few times, and tell him that he, Blood Demon, was the true master of the Immortal Temple!</p><p></p><p>Although the Immortal Land was a chaotic mess, Blood Demon felt that his future was bright!...</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness realm, after experiencing the great changes of heaven and earth, had begun to gradually stabilize. The pattern of yin and yang division was also gradually established.</p><p></p><p>The various Realm Lord level experts also successively returned to their respective cave heavens.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Heavenly Dao made them both joyful and secretly worried.</p><p></p><p>They were joyful because comprehending the Heavenly Dao could actually allow them to continue improving, even paving the way forward, with the opportunity to raise their strength to the true level of Lord of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>They were worried because they all had to exist under the Heavenly Dao. If they were careless and violated the Heavenly Dao, wouldn't they suffer heavenly punishment?</p><p></p><p>This was true heavenly punishment, which even these Realm Lords could not withstand.</p><p></p><p>Just like a few days ago, the Cloud Silk Realm Lord violated the Heavenly Dao and suffered heavenly punishment, being struck by heavenly lightning for a full three days and three nights.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Silk Realm Lord with snow-white skin and peerless beauty was directly struck into charcoal. Although she didn't die, it was very miserable.</p><p></p><p>Besides this, the crisis of the Immortal Temple had not been resolved due to the appearance of the Great Wilderness Heavenly Dao. It was still like a sharp blade suspended above their heads.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was divided into five continents, namely east, south, west, north, and the central ancient continent of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The ancient continent was where the Dao Domain was located.</p><p></p><p>Besides the five continents, there was also a Yin Realm. To enter the Yin Realm required a certain level of strength, as well as special methods of entry.</p><p></p><p>One could enter with just the soul, but for the physical body to enter the Yin Realm required an even higher realm.</p><p></p><p>The Yin Realm was under major construction. It was said that the passage for the cycle of yin and yang reincarnation was being built.</p><p></p><p>The various Realm Lords didn't know what exactly the yin and yang reincarnation was, but they knew it was extremely powerful, extremely profound, and extremely inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>The expansion of the entire world was continuing. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth was becoming more and more abundant. Martial arts cultivation was becoming easier and easier, and cultivation speed was becoming faster and faster.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was developing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xu Yan who was in seclusion, full of anticipation in his heart. This was Xu Yan's longest seclusion yet, and he was about to comprehend the Realm of Creation.</p><p></p><p>"Once one enters the Realm of Creation, everything is different."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a premonition that once he stepped into the Realm of Creation, there would also be a huge improvement in the use of the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, as the energy surged around Xu Yan's body, the image of mountains and rivers of heaven and earth appeared, as if forming its own world.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is about to break through to the great completion of the Heaven and Earth Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. The ones who gained the most from this division of yin and yang in heaven and earth were undoubtedly his own disciples, though Red Cat also gained quite a bit.</p><p></p><p>That big cat was also in seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan comprehends the Realm of Creation, you break through to the Realm of Creation."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, golden light surged forth. This surge of golden light seemed to show the birth of all things, the scene of heaven and earth coming into being.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immersed himself in the profundities of the Realm of Creation, feeling its power and mystery.</p><p></p><p>One thought creates heaven and earth, one thought gives birth to all things, one thought brings heaven and earth into being...</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Realm of Creation!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan opened his eyes, feeling the changes in himself, excited beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Realm of Creation truly exceeded imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Now I am truly invincible, far surpassing Tai Cang from back then. Even that one in the Immortal Temple would be no match for me."</p><p></p><p>Only by truly breaking through to the Realm of Creation could one truly know how powerful and wondrous it was.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Ancestor of the Dao, possessing the power of creation, a worthy Ancestor of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>The title of Ancestor of the Dao was well-deserved!</p><p></p><p>If he wasn't the Ancestor of the Dao, who had the qualifications to be called the Ancestor of the Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan breaks through to the great completion of the Heaven and Earth Realm, your power of creation increases a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao came again.</p><p></p><p>"Even stronger again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt utterly comfortable all over, in a great mood.</p><p></p><p>When in a good mood, he couldn't help but give some guidance to those confused about the martial way.</p><p></p><p>So with a wave of his hand, he guided Wu Tiannan, Xie Lingfeng and others, opening up their path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping all broke through to the small completion of the Heaven and Earth Realm. Li Xuan's other four martial arts improved once again.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Xie Lingfeng and others also began to break through successively.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Wilderness realm gradually entered the right track, Tian Zi, the incarnation of the Heavenly Dao, finally had some free time. The entire world had the Heavenly Dao operating on its own.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was comprehending the Heavenly Dao. Vaguely, he seemed to see the path forward in martial arts, and his strength changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Reincarnation is too difficult to construct!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Zi sighed with a bitter face.</p><p></p><p>The power of the Heavenly Dao's rules was still a bit weak, and his comprehension of reincarnation was still insufficient. In the short term, he could not complete the construction of reincarnation.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang are already divided. How can establishing reincarnation be difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said with a smile, "Just watch carefully."</p><p></p><p>When Tian Zi heard this, he immediately became excited. The Ancestor of the Dao was going to take action and help him construct the reincarnation of heaven and earth for the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he could see the profundity of reincarnation spoken of by the Ancestor of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

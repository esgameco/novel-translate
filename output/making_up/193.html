        <h1>Chapter 193</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was shocked and exclaimed in disbelief, "You are Ziyun? The Princess of Ziyun Kingdom, Ziyun?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun immediately straightened her slender waist and proudly said, "That's right, it's me!"</p><p></p><p>"How did you become a Grand Master?" Xie Lingfeng was still shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, with my peerless talent, breaking through to the Grand Master realm was easy-peasy. You are Xie Lingfeng, aren't you? You've become quite useless!" Ziyun boasted arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's face darkened, feeling belittled.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he couldn't refute her for the moment. "Brother Xie, do you know her?" Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"She is one of the three youngest Grand Masters in the Inner Realm, Princess Ziyun of Ziyun Kingdom," Xie Lingfeng sighed bitterly.</p><p></p><p>The three youngest Grand Masters, and Ziyun had broken through first!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Xie Lingfeng's shoulder, comforting him, "Brother Xie, don't be discouraged. Even though she is a Grand Master, it doesn't mean she can defeat you."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng shook his head. Although he had refined his true qi and greatly improved in the Sword Dao, to defeat the Grand Master Ziyun was almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun continued to pester Meng Chong, "How about it, can you rest assured now? Accept my employment and escort me to that place."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned, "With your talent and strength, you can go there alone. Why do you need me to escort you?"</p><p></p><p>"Because I like you! I like a man like you, not those delicate pretty boys that I don't like at all," Ziyun said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong still hesitating, Ziyun gritted her teeth and added, "That place is a treasure land with fifth-grade spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I agree!" Meng Chong immediately agreed upon hearing about the spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun was stunned for a moment. If she had mentioned the spirit herbs from the start, he would have agreed right away? She couldn't help but feel frustrated, wishing she had said that earlier.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng frowned and said, "Ziyun, there are many peak Grand Masters in the Ziyun Kingdom, why do you have to find Brother Meng? What's so special about that place?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyun looked at him, hesitated for a moment, and said, "I had a falling out with my father the Emperor. He must have sent his men to capture me. That place is indeed special, but I can't say too much about the specifics."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was taken aback. Ziyun was known as one of the three youngest Grand Masters in the Inner Realm, a precious talent in any force. Yet, she had fallen out with the Ziyun Emperor?</p><p></p><p>Ziyun continued, "To get to that place, I need to cross the Ziyun Kingdom. With Meng Chong's strength, he can escort me there. The secrets will be revealed once we arrive."</p><p></p><p>She then added, "I fell out with my father because he wanted to marry me off to someone I've never even met. How outrageous! I had no choice but to defy him."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and the others were puzzled. The Ziyun Emperor must have lost his mind. Such a talented genius, any force would want to keep her as a pillar, yet he wanted to marry her off? </p><p></p><p>"Who did he want to marry you to?" Xie Lingfeng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Inner Realm, there were only a few who would be qualified to marry Ziyun and make the Ziyun Emperor consider it.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!" Ziyun shook her head. "Don't ask anymore, I haven't even met that person, and I don't even know his name. I think my father has gone mad."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was dumbfounded. The Ziyun Emperor did seem to have gone mad.</p><p></p><p>That day, Meng Chong left Canglan Island to escort Ziyun to that place.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Yan continued to cultivate his sword intent, while Su Ling Xiu began to refine the pills to assist in the cultivation of the Heaven-Earth Bridge for the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was the first to attempt the transformation to the Great Desolate Martial Dao. </p><p></p><p>He was excited.</p><p></p><p>After the successful pill refinement, Xie Lingfeng began to cultivate the Heaven-Earth Bridge, taking the first step towards transforming to the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>If successful, he would be the first in the Inner Realm to transform from a Martial Master to a Primordial Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also finished cultivating his sword intent and watched nearby.</p><p></p><p>Everyone had an expectant look, as if Xie Lingfeng succeeded in the transformation, the Martial Masters in the Seven Star Academy would also have the option to transform their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>However, for a Grand Master to transform, the difficulty was quite high. In addition to cultivating the Heaven-Earth Bridge, refining the true essence and comprehending the Profound Mysteries were major obstacles.</p><p></p><p>If one was above the Grand Master realm, there might not be a need to transform.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng swallowed a pill and began to cultivate the Heaven-Earth Bridge, fully transforming to the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>He was the first true cultivator in the Inner Realm to transform from the Inner Realm Martial Dao to the Great Desolate Martial Dao. The success of cultivating the Heaven-Earth Bridge was still uncertain.</p><p></p><p>As the pill was refined, Xie Lingfeng felt a meridian in his body connecting, like a bridge, and his perception of the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy became more acute.</p><p></p><p>The prototype of the Heaven-Earth Bridge had been cultivated, and as long as he continued to refine and consolidate it, he would completely transform into a Primordial Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng swallowed another pill and continued to cultivate the Heaven-Earth Bridge. As the Heaven-Earth Bridge stabilized, the Heaven and Earth spiritual energy was guided into his dantian sea of qi.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could confirm that the transformation was successful.</p><p></p><p>"I've succeeded!" Xie Lingfeng was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan heaved a sigh of relief. Since the transformation method was confirmed to be feasible, the probability of Primordial Realm cultivators appearing in the near future had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Primordial Realm cultivators transformed from the Martial Dao would still be a bit inferior, but they would be stronger than the Grand Masters. Therefore, many Martial Dao cultivators were willing to transform.</p><p></p><p>However, the transformation required the assistance of pills, which inevitably imposed limitations. And the transformation method was now completely under the control of the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The martial cultivators in the Inner Realm are countless, and there are many geniuses. Perhaps after the transformation method is spread out, someone will have a flash of insight and discover a way to cultivate the Heaven-Earth Bridge without the need for pills?" Li Yuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>With Xie Lingfeng's successful transformation, several Martial Dao scholars at the Grand Master realm also prepared to transform to the Primordial Realm, and continue to research the differences between the Inner Realm Martial Dao and the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan also prepared to transform his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng continued to stabilize and strengthen the Heaven-Earth Bridge. As for breaking through to the Profound Mysteries realm, he didn't want to think about it for now, as his foundation was still too shallow to achieve that.</p><p></p><p>He only wanted to improve his strength, to be able to defeat Grand Master realm cultivators with his perfected Primordial Realm cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, at the perfected Primordial Realm, could even kill peak Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng didn't set his sights too high, as long as he could defeat mid-level Grand Masters with his perfected Primordial Realm, he would be satisfied.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, in a certain area was the Qingqing Pavilion's alchemy room, still under the charge of Alchemist Pan. The people from the Tianbo Pavilion came regularly to collect the pills and deliver the spirit herbs needed for alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to cultivate his sword intent, while Zhou Ying prepared to break through to the Primordial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan was carefree, occasionally drifting on the Canglan River, leisurely fishing, living a comfortable life.</p><p></p><p>One day.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has killed a Grand Master with a single punch, increasing your combat experience."</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared, indicating that Meng Chong had killed a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"Have they reached the Ziyun Kingdom?" Li Yuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>It shouldn't be long now...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's been a while, hasn't it? Meng Chong should be able to kill peak grand masters by now, right? With his current strength, and having accumulated a solid foundation in preparation for breaking through the Tongxuan Realm, he can easily kill peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has consecutively slain peak grand masters, and your Heaven Earth Saber has been greatly enhanced, breaking through the second layer of the Heaven Earth Saber." Li Xuan was stunned for a moment - the Heaven Earth Saber had broken through? In the period after Meng Chong's consecutive killings of peak grand masters, there had been no feedback from the Godly Hands.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still contemplating the sword intent, with subtle winds constantly swirling around him. Those faint winds contained a quenching force, as if they could extinguish one's spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly excited, "Xu Yan has not cultivated the sword dao of the Extinguishing God type, but has directly comprehended the sword intent targeting the divine soul!"</p><p></p><p>Once he grasps it, Xu Yan will be able to effortlessly slay Half-Step Celestials.</p><p></p><p>He will no longer fear true Celestial Realm cultivators at all.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, once the sword intent is fully understood, it can not only be used for offense, but also for defense.</p><p></p><p>"I should also ponder the advancement of the Great Sun Golden Body, leaving no weaknesses behind."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered deeply.</p><p></p><p>On Canglang Island, it was calm and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>But in the inner domain, there were undercurrents stirring.</p><p></p><p>In a small mountain village in the Yan Kingdom, there was a dilapidated wooden hut where an old man with a sallow complexion and a slightly hunched back, with white hair, lived.</p><p></p><p>He was carving a wooden sculpture, with wood chips flying. Soon, a statue of a middle-aged man with a cold and somewhat sinister expression and icy eyes appeared in his hands.</p><p></p><p>The old man contemplated the statue for a long time, as if he had lost himself in thought.</p><p></p><p>A blue-faced man in white robes slowly approached and stopped in front of the old man, staring at the statue in his hands for a while before lightly chuckling, "Who would have thought that the once-fearsome Demon Child is still alive, hiding in this small mountain village?"</p><p></p><p>The old man continued staring at the statue, seemingly unaware of the blue-faced man's arrival.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man did not mind and continued, "In the past, when the Demon Patriarch founded the Demon Sect, a child of seven or eight years old followed him, being the Demon Patriarch's closest companion, known as the Demon Child.</p><p></p><p>"He was also the strongest of the nine great Demon Overlords, with the highest status. When the Demon Patriarch disappeared, the Demon Sect fractured and was attacked by the remaining powerful Demon Overlords, forcing him to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"The name of the Blood-Thirsty Demon Child has disappeared from the inner domain for many long years. Who would have thought that the former Demon Child is now in this small village?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child raised his head and looked at the blue-faced man, "If you have something to say, just say it. If you keep blabbering, you'll die!"</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man spoke solemnly, "Elder Yin has passed away."</p><p></p><p>"He's dead, so be it." The Demon Child was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>It had nothing to do with him, whether it was a Demon Sect member or not.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yin received a task to capture a person, and if he completes it, he can enter the Gate of the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man stared intently at the Demon Child.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child raised his head, his expression calm and unruffled.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure that capturing a person can grant entry into the Spiritual Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man raised his hand and tossed a scroll over.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child opened it and his face lit up with excitement as he asked, "Where is the person?"</p><p></p><p>"Canglang Island!" the blue-faced man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child carefully placed the statue on a shelf, then asked, "Tell me, what is your purpose? Is the person difficult to capture?"</p><p></p><p>"Elder Yin and Kuye have both died, and dozens of peak grand masters have also all died. I have already contacted the powerful experts of the major factions, preparing to join forces to attack Canglang Island and force them to hand over the person."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man did not hide his plans, revealing them all.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child pondered for a moment, then took out a wooden token and tossed it to the blue-faced man, saying, "Go find Cold Master, and unless you have the Purple Absolute of the Blue-Faced Man, I won't lend a hand."</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man did not get angry, took the wooden token, and cupped his hands, "I'll take my leave then."</p><p></p><p>After walking for a while, he suddenly turned back and asked, "That statue, is it the Demon Patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>The Demon Child had already picked up another piece of wood and was focused on carving, wood chips flying as the outline of the statue took shape.</p><p></p><p>The blue-faced man turned and left.</p><p></p><p>In a mountain forest far away from Canglang Island, the blue-faced man in white robes stood there, with ten red-robed blue-faced men behind him, all peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Footsteps sounded, and a man with a deathly pale complexion, as if he had been soaked in icy water, holding a gleaming long sword, slowly approached.</p><p></p><p>As he drew near, a chilling aura emanated from him.</p><p></p><p>The man stopped in front of a large tree, leaning against it. Frost gradually appeared on the tree trunk, as if the tree was losing its vitality.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed blue-faced man looked at the pale man with a hint of wariness in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Then, two more figures appeared. Both were hooded, hiding their faces, obviously to conceal their identities.</p><p></p><p>After arriving, they glanced at the pale man and one of them narrowed his eyes, hoarsely saying, "Cold Master? Demon Overlord Cold Master!"</p><p></p><p>Cold Master raised his gaze and looked at the two, sneering, "If you want to kill and seize the treasure, be straightforward about it. Hiding and being evasive, afraid of being known - if you can't do that, don't come out."</p><p></p><p>The hooded figures humphed and ignored Cold Master.</p><p></p><p>"Since everyone is here, let's go." Cold Master spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Not everyone is here yet," the blue-robed blue-faced man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Cold Master frowned, looking somewhat displeased.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, dozens of figures arrived, all of them peak grand masters!</p><p></p><p>The newcomers all wore masks to conceal their identities, and did not interact much with each other.</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed blue-faced man counted the numbers - there were fifty-five peak grand masters, plus the ten behind him, making a total of sixty-five peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>In terms of lineup, it had already surpassed the previous attack on the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he, Cold Master, and the other two were all Half-Step Celestials.</p><p></p><p>If with such a lineup they still failed to capture the person, they would have to resort to other means to force the other party to hand over the person.</p><p></p><p>The matter of Suling Xiu was related to the Gate of the Spiritual Realm, and once this news spread, all the powerful experts and factions in the martial dao world would try to force the person out.</p><p></p><p>This was a path beyond the realm of grand masters - no faction or expert would want to miss out on this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>However, if it came to that, the secret of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm would no longer be hidden, but known to many.</p><p></p><p>Unless absolutely necessary, no one wanted to share such a precious secret and opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"This time, either the other party hands over the person, or we will raze Canglang Island to the ground!"</p><p></p><p>The blue-robed blue-faced man said coldly, leading the ten red-robed blue-faced men towards Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>Cold Master and the other two Half-Step Celestials closely followed, and the group of peak grand masters exchanged glances and silently followed behind.</p><p></p><p>This battle must be won! The Changqing Pavilion must be destroyed! The Great Desolate Martial Dao will also disappear from the inner domain!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

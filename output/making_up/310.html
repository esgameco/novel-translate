        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Pavilion was once the top Spiritual Sect, with the Three Peerless Halls as its pinnacle. However, the powerful cultivators there were nearly wiped out, and the Thousand Martial Pavilion's supreme status was lost.</p><p></p><p>The tales of Meng Chong's Six-Zhang Golden Body and the Giant in Golden Armor also swept through the Spiritual Realm like a storm.</p><p></p><p>Although not as violent as the Xu Yan incident, it still shocked many cultivators and shook numerous Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Knife Sovereign Meng Chong single-handedly suppressed the Genius of the Distant State and single-handedly destroyed the Three Peerless Halls!</p><p></p><p>"Has the Thousand Martial Pavilion fallen on hard times?"</p><p></p><p>"Maybe they were too shameless, so they are receiving retribution now."</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Realm's cultivation world, there was much discussion about the Thousand Martial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sanctuary, its Genius and Patriarch, were all slain by Xu Yan, and this was a subordinate Sect of the Thousand Martial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Three Peerless Halls, where the Genius was killed by Meng Chong, and the Hall Master and Elders were also slain by Meng Chong, suffered a massive decline in strength, and this was also a subordinate force of the Thousand Martial Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>As for the Thousand Martial Pavilion itself, its Genius was slain, and its Divine Artifact was stolen! Among the great Spiritual Sects, the Thousand Martial Pavilion was the first to suffer such losses and blows.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm's cultivation world became lively because of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, making the competition between Geniuses even more eye-catching.</p><p></p><p>"Haven't they caught Xu Yan yet?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Pavilion's reputation has been damaged."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is impressive, he stole the Thousand Martial Pavilion's Divine Artifact, and they still can't catch him!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, everyone thought that Xu Yan wouldn't be able to escape for long and would be killed by the Thousand Martial Pavilion's experts to retrieve the Divine Artifact.</p><p></p><p>But it seems that Xu Yan is still roaming freely, and the Thousand Martial Pavilion's Patriarch is searching blindly, unable to find him!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has appeared! Xu Yan has appeared!"</p><p></p><p>"Really, was he killed?"</p><p></p><p>"No, he killed one of the Thousand Martial Pavilion's experts, and then ran away again!"</p><p></p><p>Occasionally, news of Xu Yan's whereabouts would surface, revealing his traces.</p><p></p><p>After a few times, everyone couldn't help but suspect that Xu Yan was deliberately exposing his traces, luring the Thousand Martial Pavilion's experts to chase and kill him.</p><p></p><p>"Have you heard about the Pill Dao Immortal Lady? They say that even if one's foundation is completely destroyed, she can still heal them."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard about that too, and the miraculous medicinal pills she has, it's truly unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my distant cousin's sworn brother's older brother's son was crushed by a Spiritual Sect's scoundrel, and his foundation was destroyed, leaving him useless. But he was saved and has now recovered to the Small Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Is it truly that miraculous?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>"Where is this Pill Dao Immortal Lady?"</p><p></p><p>"In Luo State, at the Long Qing Pavilion, which was the former site of the Crimson Abyss Sect."</p><p></p><p>While the incidents of Xu Yan and Meng Chong were being widely discussed, and all cultivators were paying close attention, another piece of news also began to spread through the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Pill Dao Immortal Lady, Su Ling Xiu, at the Long Qing Pavilion, possessed divine pill dao skills that could revive the dead. As long as one wasn't already dead, any severe injury could be healed! The only requirement was being able to afford the diagnosis fee and the necessary spiritual herbs for the treatment. Some were amazed at how such miraculous techniques had suddenly appeared in the Spiritual Realm, while others were skeptical.</p><p></p><p>Nonetheless, the name of the Pill Dao Immortal Lady, Su Ling Xiu, was gradually spreading throughout the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My senior brother is too fierce!"</p><p></p><p>In a certain great city, Meng Chong, wearing a wig, exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to go and block the Thousand Martial Pavilion's mountain gate, but the news came that his senior brother not only slew the Thousand Martial Pavilion's Genius, but also stole their Divine Artifact and escaped.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Pavilion was going mad.</p><p></p><p>He had to give up the idea of blocking the Thousand Martial Pavilion's mountain gate, as at this time, going there would likely provoke the Thousand Martial Pavilion's experts to go berserk.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go and block the Thunder Cloud Villa instead?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Since he currently had no enmity with the Thunder Cloud Villa, directly blocking their gate might not be appropriate, and after the lesson of the Thousand Martial Pavilion, the Thunder Cloud Villa would probably resort to underhanded methods.</p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't afraid, as he had his master's divine talisman, he couldn't always rely on his master's divine powers to roam the cultivation world. In the end, he still had to rely on his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"I should find a place to seclude myself for a while and break through the second layer of the Indestructible Golden Body."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered, and in addition to breaking through the second layer of the Indestructible Golden Body, he also needed to comprehend the cultivation method for the third layer.</p><p></p><p>It should be time to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>He was almost at the breakthrough to the second layer, so the comprehension of the third layer's cultivation method should be on the agenda.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine abilities will I give birth to when I break through to the Spiritual Dao Realm with my physical martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"After the breakthrough, I should also start roaming the Spiritual Realm, traveling in all directions, cultivating in all directions, comprehending the heavens and earth in all directions, and accumulating martial dao experience."</p><p></p><p>With a plan in mind, Meng Chong left the great city and found a place to seclude himself for his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"My junior sister has become famous too!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing some cultivators discussing the matter of the Pill Dao Immortal Lady, he couldn't help but exclaim.</p><p></p><p>"But Fourth Senior Brother's reputation is a bit lacking in comparison."</p><p></p><p>Although Fang Hao, the Jade State Alliance's Alliance Master, also had some small fame, as he had broken the pattern of the Jade State, and was even the first to break the pattern of the Spiritual Realm's states.</p><p></p><p>However, the Jade State was ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>So naturally, it didn't attract as much attention.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the elderly man blocking his path, his face full of killing intent, and his brow slightly furrowed.</p><p></p><p>The old man's aura was quite peculiar, and it gave Xu Yan a vague sense of danger.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, peerless Genius, today you shall drink the bitter cup of defeat!"</p><p></p><p>The old man's hoarse and gloomy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>"Someone from the Thousand Martial Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, there was something off about this old man.</p><p></p><p>This time, by slightly revealing his traces, he had actually attracted such an old fellow.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the Cold Absolute Blade?"</p><p></p><p>The old man did not answer, but instead knitted his brows.</p><p></p><p>The Cold Absolute Blade was not on Xu Yan, could it be that he had discarded it?</p><p></p><p>But how was that possible, it was a Divine Artifact! Was it hidden somewhere?</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the whereabouts of the Cold Absolute Blade, and I'll grant you a quick death!"</p><p></p><p>The old man said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and waved his hand, bringing out the Cold Absolute Blade.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the ability, then come and take this broken blade back."</p><p></p><p>He then quickly stored the Cold Absolute Blade back into his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>The old man was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>That was not a storage bag, but something that could contain a Divine Artifact?</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The old man let out a low roar, his white hair flying, and an unhealthy reddish glow appeared on his aged face.</p><p></p><p>A chilling aura mixed with a deathly presence surged forth, and a powerful punch was thrust towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan unleashed a sword strike, enveloping the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The mountains and rivers collapsed, and the old man closed in, unleashing another punch.</p><p></p><p>The killing intent was biting, and the aura of death permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>"Trifling tricks!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare to fight for too long, or else the Thousand Martial Pavilion's Patriarch would catch up, and it would take a lot of time to shake him off.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In that instant, Xu Yan struck with his sword, combining the Gentle Wind Sword Intent with the Mountain and River Sword Intent. It appeared to be a single sword strike, but it was as if the mountains and rivers were being cleaved by a celestial being wielding a sword.</p><p></p><p>The old man's expression darkened slightly, and a gray light surged from his body, with the aura of death enveloping him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the temperature around them seemed to drop, and a bone-chilling aura of death permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! He thrust out a punch, and his aged body shriveled, as if his very soul was being consumed.</p><p></p><p>The old man's face did not show any pain, but rather a faint smile, with a sense of cold detachment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart skipped a beat, this attack was no ordinary one, it was imbued with the aura of death. It seemed that the old man had accumulated a lifetime's worth of martial dao, all converging in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It all poured out.</p><p></p><p>"The Transcendent Spiritual Sect really has some capabilities, the Thousand Martial Hall actually has this secret technique, is this the elite death squad of the Thousand Martial Hall?"</p><p></p><p>Two sword wheels appeared in front of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Life and Death Sword Wheels!</p><p></p><p>It was like a life and death transaction, constantly eroding the old man's attack, but the old man's attack was even more fierce than Wu Yuan's, and that deathly aura was like a deadly poison, constantly encroaching.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan activated his divine element to resist that deathly aura.</p><p></p><p>"It's quite powerful!"</p><p></p><p>A strand of divine element was actually tainted by the deathly aura, Xu Yan decisively severed that strand of divine element, dissipating it in midair.</p><p></p><p>He continued to attack, his figure also slowly retreating.</p><p></p><p>But the old man's attacks were getting closer and closer to him, as if they were impossible to resist, especially that deathly aura, so insidious and toxic.</p><p></p><p>"To refine one's life's cultivation and divine soul as the foundation into a deathly aura, it must have taken a long time and a great price, right?" Moreover, it can only be unleashed when one's lifespan is running out.</p><p></p><p>"I have to admit, the power is indeed formidable, but this kind of secret technique is nothing but trash in my eyes!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was calm, and in this brief battle, he had already grasped how the old man had cultivated this powerful deathly aura.</p><p></p><p>The old man's expression darkened, a hint of wariness flashing in his deep eyes.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment of battle, Xu Yan had already grasped the origin of his secret technique?</p><p></p><p>This young man is too monstrous, far surpassing the Blood Demon of the past, he must die, or else he will become a great calamity!</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, his physical body even began to smile, the attacks becoming more and more fierce, the deathly aura almost turning black, like maggots in the bone, constantly eroding Xu Yan's attacks, constantly approaching, and becoming more and more fierce.</p><p></p><p>"So what if you know? You can't escape it!"</p><p></p><p>The attack had already locked onto Xu Yan's aura, he could only resist it head-on, there was no way to dodge it.</p><p></p><p>And with Xu Yan's strength, even if he could resist it head-on, he would inevitably be eroded by the deathly aura, corroding his martial dao foundation and his divine soul.</p><p></p><p>He would surely suffer a heavy blow!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, judging from the current situation, Xu Yan would not be able to resist it head-on!</p><p></p><p>The old man's gaze was cold and ruthless, Xu Yan was doomed to die! Once he died, although he himself would not live much longer, the others would soon find this place, and the Saber Elder would also come hunting soon.</p><p></p><p>The Cold Absolute Saber would be reclaimed.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan's corpse would be hung at the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall, to intimidate the entire Spiritual Domain, this is the fate of those who offend the Thousand Martial Hall!"Who says I can't dodge it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>His figure instantly disappeared from the original spot, shifting to another position.</p><p></p><p>"You think..."</p><p></p><p>The old man's words were cut off, and he suddenly revealed a horrified expression.</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>This attack of his had actually lost its direction! The aura he had originally locked onto Xu Yan had disappeared, but the person was clearly not far away!</p><p></p><p>"I have always been overwhelming and directly attacking the enemy's spearhead, but that doesn't mean I don't have other means. Today, I'll let you experience it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled brilliantly, the old man's attack had missed, and it was dissipating, he didn't even need to take action, just watching with a mocking gaze as the old man died in resentment and fear!</p><p></p><p>"You will die!"</p><p></p><p>The old man let out a final roar of rage and completely dissipated.</p><p></p><p>But his attack, the lingering deathly aura, still lingered around, and it would not dissipate for a while.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Martial Hall actually has such means, the other Transcendent Spiritual Sects must be similar, can't be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself, his figure moved, and he instantly disappeared from the spot.</p><p></p><p>In less than a quarter of an hour, an old man's figure appeared, his expression suddenly changing as he sensed the lingering deathly aura.</p><p></p><p>"Failed?"</p><p></p><p>He found it hard to believe that he was unable to leave a trace of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xu Yan has already become this powerful?</p><p></p><p>This young man is a greater threat than the Blood Demon of the past!</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>An angry voice came.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder descended, and his expression immediately changed.</p><p></p><p>"Unable to leave Xu Yan behind, but I don't know if he was injured or not!"</p><p></p><p>The old man said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Continue the pursuit!"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder's expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>However, in the following days, there was not a single trace of Xu Yan, as if he had vanished into thin air, the Saber Elder and the others couldn't help but suspect that Xu Yan might have been injured and was hiding, not daring to show his presence.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's hiding techniques are far more ingenious than the Blood Demon's of the past, this young man must die!"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder thought coldly in his heart.</p><p></p><p>In the distance above, a Piercing Cloud Sculpture was flying, on the back of the Piercing Cloud Sculpture was a small palace, and the colorfully dressed Cui Huayu had a serious expression on his face, not smiling.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at this small palace and sighed, "You guys in the Transcendent Spiritual Sect really know how to live it up!"</p><p></p><p>"Can't help it, I've been sickly since I was little, can't even withstand the wind, so it has to be like this."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's face was deathly pale, and he chuckled dryly.</p><p></p><p>Encountering Xu Yan, he couldn't help but greet him, and as a result, Xu Yan casually entered his small palace.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, this time he didn't have any beauties accompanying him, otherwise it would have been so embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>"You're sickly?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan curiously stared at Cui Huayu, this person looked rather weak and sickly, giving a sense of frailty.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a late-stage Cultivated Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"The Imperial Spirit Sect is also part of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, your true disciple realm is a bit low."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's cultivation was only at the late-stage Cultivated Spirit Celestial, compared to the disciples of the Thousand Martial Hall like Wu Yuan, he was quite lacking.</p><p></p><p>"Can't help it, I'm sickly, being able to reach this realm is already very difficult for me."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, how did you become a true disciple of the Imperial Spirit Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't believe his words.</p><p></p><p>"Because I have background, my master and uncle are both Supremes."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"If you're so sickly, why would your master accept you as a disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still didn't believe him.</p><p></p><p>"Well, actually..."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu felt embarrassed, lowering his voice, "To be honest, I'm actually my master's illegitimate son, you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Your master is a Supreme, why wouldn't he dare to acknowledge you as his son? Isn't your master's wife very powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu scratched his head awkwardly, "My master's wife is the younger sister of the current Sect Master of the Imperial Spirit Sect."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood now, no wonder Cui Huayu's father could only accept him as a disciple and not openly acknowledge him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'll keep it a secret, I won't let your master's wife know the truth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, you don't need to be so careful, actually, the master's wife is also my real mother!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu continued awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like you're trying to fool me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stared at him.</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, I'm telling the truth."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu almost broke out in cold sweat, Xu Yan was a terrifying person, he never cared about the enemy's identity background and would just directly eliminate them, offending him would be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"My father and mother must have something wrong with their heads, they insisted on taking me as their disciple and making me address them as master and disciple, I'm helpless about it."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu had a look of helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

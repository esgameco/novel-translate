            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 88: Dragon Soaring Through the Rivers and Mountains, Spiritual Body</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was in the midst of breaking through to the Xiantian Realm. The Heaven-Earth Bridge was connected, and the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth entered his body, opening up the Dantian Sea of Qi.</p><p></p><p>His physical body was also undergoing a transformation, as if it was thoroughly cleansing the mundane dust, pristine and untainted by the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>Waves of genuine Xiantian Qi were being refined.</p><p></p><p>Rumbling, the genuine Xiantian Qi opened up the Dantian Sea of Qi and circulated through the meridians of his entire body.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Dantian Sea of Qi, where the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth is gathered and transformed into genuine Xiantian Qi..."</p><p></p><p>Under the impact of the spiritual energy, the Dantian continued to expand, and the genuine Xiantian Qi kept rising.</p><p></p><p>His entire physique of blood and qi had been refined into genuine Xiantian Qi.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still in the process of advancement, the transformation was ongoing, the Dantian Sea of Qi was still expanding, the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth kept pouring into his body, and the genuine Xiantian Qi continued to rise.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it seemed that the Dantian Sea of Qi he had opened up could never be fully filled.</p><p></p><p>"I have already comprehended a sword intent, but the true meaning of the Descending Dragon Palm has not yet been grasped. Now is the time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the image of his master's Descending Dragon Palm appeared, with a huge golden dragon that seemed to possess the might of a true divine dragon.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>A dragon's roar seemed to resonate within his body. On the Heaven-Earth Bridge, a huge dragon emerged, rolling with spiritual energy, originally crimson red but gradually turning golden.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Dragon!</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the sword intent of the mountains and rivers appeared, as if containing the vicissitudes of the mountains and rivers, the turning of the ages, manifesting within the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>One sword, the mountains and rivers appear; one sword, the mountains and rivers vanish!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent surged, the golden dragon roared.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the golden dragon seemed to open its eyes, becoming increasingly real.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were filled with awe-inspiring might, overlooking all beings, gazing down upon the mountains and rivers, its majesty too dazzling to behold.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan felt that he had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Within the Dantian Sea of Qi, a golden dragon's illusory form appeared, circling and coiling within the sea, its eyes filled with awe-inspiring might.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon was like a mere outline, without visible scales or whiskers, only a pair of eyes that radiated immense spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"I have finally grasped it, this is the dragon's might, one of the essential meanings of the Descending Dragon Palm. Its might shakes the world, just like this!"</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Xu Yan had comprehended the dragon's might, the essence of the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth kept surging and pouring into his body, like fiery liquor, making Xu Yan feel completely refreshed and purified.</p><p></p><p>The entire person was in a state of sublimation.</p><p></p><p>Outside the slope, Li Xuanling stood in the air, silently watching the breakthrough of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His breakthrough was a result of the feedback from the "golden finger", completed in an instant.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan's was a true and solid cultivation, the process of his breakthrough could not be accomplished in a single moment.</p><p></p><p>Especially the breakthrough from the Qi-Blood Realm to the Xiantian Realm, this was a true process of transcending the mortal world.</p><p></p><p>"The sword intent of the mountains and rivers... Has Xu Yan comprehended something else in the midst of his breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling was greatly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Something was happening to Xu Yan, not just a simple breakthrough to the Xiantian Realm, and the moment the sword intent of the mountains and rivers appeared, Li Xuanling sensed a change.</p><p></p><p>"Is Xu Yan applying the sword intent in his breakthrough?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling had an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>This was a good thing, the more monstrous Xu Yan became, the stronger the feedback from the "golden finger" would be after this breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's physical body is growing stronger, and the sword intent of the mountains and rivers seems to have merged with his physique, yet it is not quite the sword intent..."</p><p></p><p>"What is happening exactly?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling was greatly amazed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was constantly undergoing transformations.</p><p></p><p>He continued to silently observe, waiting for Xu Yan's breakthrough to be completed, waiting for the feedback from the "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura of might emanated from Xu Yan's body.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a golden dragon was coiling within him.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm? Could it be that Xu Yan has already comprehended the true meaning of the Descending Dragon Palm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Once the true meaning of the Descending Dragon Palm was comprehended, it meant that the level of the Descending Dragon Palm had been further elevated.</p><p></p><p>One step closer to truly possessing the might of the dragon.</p><p></p><p>Standing on a large tree, Meng Chong was also watching Xu Yan's breakthrough, although he could not clearly sense the changes like Li Xuanling could.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he could still feel that Xu Yan was growing stronger, giving him a sense of transcendence from the mundane world.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Xiantian Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"What would my breakthrough to the Xiantian Realm in the Martial Dao be like?"</p><p></p><p>He did not yet know the cultivation methods beyond the Qi-Blood Realm in the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>His master had not yet taught him the techniques for the next stage.</p><p></p><p>"I must strive to fully master the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Once the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor was fully mastered, his master would teach him the cultivation methods for the next stage.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Xu Yan suddenly levitated.</p><p></p><p>A golden dragon was coiling beneath him, as if lifting him up into the air.</p><p></p><p>"He's finally about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's breakthrough meant that the feedback from the "golden finger" was about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Suspended in the air, Xu Yan stood up, his expression filled with excitement, he had finally broken through!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could constantly absorb the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, his true qi was inexhaustible, and he no longer felt hunger.</p><p></p><p>He had truly transcended the mortal world!</p><p></p><p>Excited, he raised his hand and struck out a palm, the golden dragon roared, its might terrifying, especially its pair of eyes that instilled fear in all who beheld them.</p><p></p><p>He extended two fingers together, and a sword intent of the mountains and rivers surged forth, as if capable of burying all beings.</p><p></p><p>His strength had already undergone a tremendous transformation!</p><p></p><p>At the moment of Xu Yan's breakthrough, the feedback from the "golden finger" arrived.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling finally understood what had happened during Xu Yan's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, cultivating the techniques you created, has broken through to the Xiantian Realm. Your Xiantian Realm Mastery has increased a hundredfold."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple's Descending Dragon Palm has advanced to the Third Realm, and he has comprehended the true meaning of the Dragon's Might in the Descending Dragon Palm. Your Descending Dragon Palm Third Realm Mastery and Dragon's Might Mastery are complete."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple's physique has transformed into the Dragon Soaring Through the Mountains and Rivers Spiritual Body."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Soaring Through the Mountains and Rivers Spiritual Body!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling was greatly excited, the rewards Xu Yan had gained from this breakthrough were truly immense.</p><p></p><p>His strength had soared instantly.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Xiantian Spiritual Bone not long ago, he had now also gained the Dragon Soaring Through the Mountains and Rivers Spiritual Body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuanling could sense the profundity of the spiritual body, without needing to cultivate any techniques, the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth would naturally enter his body, constantly being refined into true qi.</p><p></p><p>He had a natural affinity with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth and all spiritual things.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Soaring Through the Mountains and Rivers Spiritual Body, it was as if a dragon was surging within him, the mountains and rivers hidden, containing immense power.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, can I now dominate the Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Can I easily defeat even Grand Masters?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanling was excited at the thought.</p><p></p><p>However, the specific situation in the Inner Realm could not be simply viewed in this way, Blood Wuxin and Xie Lingfeng might not have fully fathomed the secrets of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Cultivator Grand Masters might not necessarily be at the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were both Grand Masters as well.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Grandmaster said, "The gap in strength can be very large.</p><p></p><p>Blood Heartless cultivates demonic arts, which appear powerful but actually have hidden flaws.</p><p></p><p>After all, Xie Lingfeng is still young.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he must not be arrogant and think that there are no more powerful experts in this world.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Meng Chong below, hoping his second disciple would also make an effort.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had broken through, Li Xuan no longer paid attention to him and directly left, returning to the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>In a great mood today, he pointed out a few things to Shi Er and passed on the method of refining the dantian.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a wisp of the Sword Dao intent emerged, accelerating Shi Er's bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was overjoyed. At this bone refinement speed, it wouldn't be long before he could complete the tempering of the Copper Bone. </p><p></p><p>As for the Golden Bone, he didn't have any hope for that. After tempering the Copper Bone, he would start refining the dantian, striving to enter the Martial Dao as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's breakthrough, he did not immediately return but continued to consolidate his realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood under the scorching sun, cultivating the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering. At this moment, he entered a mysterious state.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun in his heart resonated with the Great Sun in the sky, and waves of scorching energy permeated his body, the jade-like golden light shining brilliantly. The Golden Bell Qi and Blood grew stronger, and his physical body was rapidly strengthening.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Sun in my heart has resonated with the Great Sun in the sky. I've finally achieved it. My cultivation speed has increased, and I feel like I'm becoming stronger in a furnace."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited. He felt that he was not far from the small success of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned on the third day after his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have broken through to the Xiantian Realm," Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, my disciple. You have truly embarked on the Martial Dao. Do not be complacent, and strive to achieve the great success of the Xiantian Realm as soon as possible," Li Xuan said with a pleased expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Shi Er who was truly cultivating, Xu Yan sensed a faint trace of sword intent surrounding him, seemingly accelerating the tempering of his bones.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's happening with Shi Er?"</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er's talent is average, and his cultivation is too slow. That wisp of sword intent helps him cultivate a bit faster."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "Shi Er's Copper Bone is basically his limit, but being able to reach the Copper Bone means he has already escaped the ranks of the lowest-level martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "Master, can I also use sword intent to help my parents quickly complete their bone refinement?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "The foundation of the Martial Dao must be built on one's own efforts, step by step, solidly cultivating and comprehending the insights of cultivation. Forcing growth will ultimately lead to a weak foundation.</p><p></p><p>"However, if there is no hope of achieving the Golden Bone, it's fine to use sword intent to assist the bone refinement. After all, it's just the Copper Bone, and it can't be considered as forcing growth.</p><p></p><p>"You must grasp the proper degree yourself and not let the sword intent harm others."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood, "As long as I don't have the talent of the ancient prodigies, I can use sword intent to assist, without worrying about forcing growth and a weak foundation."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Xu Yan suddenly realized, "It turns out that Master had already seen the potential of the ancient prodigy in me, so he didn't use sword intent to assist my bone refinement, but instead let me build a solid foundation in the Martial Dao step by step."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand now," Xu Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>Since the sword intent can assist his parents and accelerate the bone refinement, this is a good thing. He also didn't think his parents had the talent of the ancient prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they started cultivating the Martial Dao at an older age, so it was a bit late. Being able to temper the Copper Bone was already good enough.</p><p></p><p>"Why is Shi Er's Copper Bone a bit weak?" Xu Yan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was currently in the stage of tempering the Copper Bone, but it was weaker than Xu Yan's Copper Bone back then.</p><p></p><p>"Even for the same Copper Bone, there are differences," Li Xuan explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan's eyes lit up, and he eagerly asked, "Master, then how strong is my Jade Bone compared to others with the Jade Bone?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled, inwardly thinking, "Strong or weak? Aside from your master, your Jade Bone is naturally the strongest. Moreover, it has now further evolved into the Dragon Soaring Through Mountains and Rivers Spiritual Bone."</p><p></p><p>However, he said, "As long as your Martial Dao heart is clear and you have the determination to never be inferior to anyone for the rest of your life, then you will never be inferior to anyone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became pensive.</p><p></p><p>"Master means that there are those with Jade Bones stronger than mine, but as long as my Martial Dao is unwavering, I can catch up to them and not be inferior to anyone!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze was resolute, and his fighting spirit was high. "Master, you can rest assured. My Martial Dao heart will never waver. I will cultivate with the determination to never be inferior to anyone, and no setbacks will defeat me!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! Since you have this determination, I believe you will not be inferior to anyone!" Li Xuan said approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he added, "Except for your master."</p><p></p><p>"Master, Xie Lingfeng and the others want to visit you. Should we receive them?" Xu Yan mentioned Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng comes from the Sword Sovereign Cliff in the Inner Realm, and he is an extremely powerful force there. Moreover, his background is not ordinary, and he must have many Martial Dao cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"If there are cultivation methods from the Inner Realm, it will be easier to compile cultivation methods, and I won't make them too weak.</p><p></p><p>"These two have been convinced by Xu Yan that the cultivation they've been practicing is false Martial Dao, so they must want to convert to true Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>The internal energy of a Grandmaster Martial Artist is actually similar to true qi. To convert it to true qi, they only need to refine it, and it can be upgraded to true qi, just not the innate true qi.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng wants to see him, so it must be for Martial Dao matters.</p><p></p><p>The internal energy of Grandmaster Martial Artists is also true qi, just with a different name in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>To convert it to true qi, it's just a matter of refining and enhancing the quality. As for the method, Li Xuan, being a Xiantian Realm cultivator with the Spiritual Bone of the Dragon Soaring Through Mountains and Rivers, is proficient in the use of spiritual energy, far surpassing other martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Refining the Martial Dao internal energy and converting it into true qi is no problem for him. He just needs to slightly modify the method of refining blood and qi into innate true qi.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the true qi refined from Martial Dao internal energy would be weaker than the pure innate true qi. However, compared to Copper Bone or below martial artists, it may not be much weaker, and the Martial Dao internal energy in the Inner Realm also has varying degrees of strength.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's Martial Dao internal energy is stronger than Blood Heartless'. If he refines it into true qi, although it won't be as strong as Xu Yan's innate true qi, it definitely won't be weaker than Shi Er's innate true qi, as Xie Lingfeng is a genius in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, let him come when he has the time," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng has a background in the Inner Realm, and Xu Yan will eventually have to go there. Having Xie Lingfeng as a connection is a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if a true-false Martial Dao conflict were to break out, having an extra force would be helpful.</p><p></p><p>Most importantly, Li Xuan could obtain Martial Dao cultivation methods from Xie Lingfeng and the others, which would make it easier to compile subsequent cultivation methods after having a reference.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 208</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In Jiao Ming's eyes, Xu Yan's strength was beyond his expectations, but to kill him with three swords was undoubtedly a pipe dream. </p><p></p><p>The martial art he cultivated was a powerful fist technique of the force he belonged to. </p><p></p><p>Its power was formidable, with each punch surrounded by a halo of stars, like falling celestial bodies, containing the force of destruction. </p><p></p><p>Although he had just started cultivating it, the destructive power was not that strong, but it would be no problem to destroy the illusory scene in front of him.</p><p></p><p>In the Small Celestial Realm, Jiao Ming was not considered a strong cultivator, but he was not weak either. </p><p></p><p>This punch, Jiao Ming was fully confident, could destroy the illusory image, and then he would seize the opportunity to launch a powerful offensive and subdue the opponent! Suddenly, a gentle breeze blew, and Jiao Ming was startled. Where did this wind come from? It could actually ignore his punch and blow towards him?</p><p></p><p>Abruptly, he felt an excruciating pain in his head, his divine might shaking, his consciousness darkening, and his head spinning. </p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze was not blowing on his body, but on his consciousness, on his own divine spirit! The gentle breeze, in an instant, became fierce and ruthless, as if tearing apart his spiritual consciousness!</p><p></p><p>Pu! Jiao Ming's body swayed, the punch aura dimmed, and he was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming was horrified, what kind of technique was this, that could directly attack his gathered divine spirit.</p><p></p><p>In the Small Celestial Realm, at the stage of gathering the divine spirit, although one possesses great divine might, the gathered divine body is extremely illusory and weak.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming a Refined Spirit Celestial could one be considered to have completed the refinement of the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>It is rumored that only Refined Spirit Celestials possess the means to directly attack spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>At that time, the spiritual soul can be embodied and naturally possess such means.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was not a Refined Spirit Celestial, so how could he possess such a means to directly attack the spiritual consciousness? Jiao Ming had no time to investigate the reason, he only felt his consciousness darkening, his spirit shaking, as if it was being torn apart bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Danger!</p><p></p><p>A life-and-death crisis!</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, Jiao Ming let out a roar, his aura bursting forth, his fists pounding out with all his might, forming a powerful defensive force around him.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he activated the Gathering Divine technique, trying to consolidate his rapidly disintegrating spiritual consciousness, to free himself from the darkness of consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He moved to retreat.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Two sword wheels swept towards him, a strong crisis descended.</p><p></p><p>Pu! The punch force he had unleashed, all the star auras, were gradually broken.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming sensed a fierce sword light, and suddenly punched out, trying to block this extremely dangerous attack.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he punched out.</p><p></p><p>The originally fierce sword light, in an instant, became gentle and continuous, from attack to defense, and the sword light that originally did not sense any crisis, suddenly turned into a fierce killing intent! Pu! The defense was shattered, Jiao Ming was horrified.</p><p></p><p>The excruciating pain in his head had not subsided, his consciousness was still muddled, his reaction speed had slowed down, Jiao Ming was after all a Martial Dao Celestial, even in such an unfavorable situation, he still managed to activate a life-saving technique in the crisis.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A circle of light suddenly erupted from Jiao Ming's body, enveloping him in a defensive barrier.</p><p></p><p>This was a defensive technique he activated in the most critical moment, under the operation of the Gathering Divine technique, his consciousness became a little clearer, and he decisively burned a portion of his own power to unleash a defense.</p><p></p><p>A defense without any loopholes or dead angles, which could temporarily save him from this fatal blow! At the same time, he did not care about the consumption, or even the damage to his foundation, any hesitation could cost him his life.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming frantically activated the Gathering Divine technique, trying to restore the clarity of his consciousness, and re-consolidate the spiritual consciousness that was about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In his consciousness, he seemed to see a sword light.</p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze surged out again.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiao Ming's expression changed drastically, the spiritual consciousness that he had just tried to recover was suddenly like being ravaged by a violent wind, and it immediately became fragmented again.</p><p></p><p>His head was in a mess, his consciousness was in a daze, although he had only a thread of clarity left, he was frantically activating the Gathering Divine technique, trying to re-consolidate his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to flee, wanting to avoid all these crises.</p><p></p><p>But it was already too late.</p><p></p><p>In a battle between experts, the outcome is decided in an instant.</p><p></p><p>He heard Xu Yan's voice.</p><p></p><p>"Third sword, I'll cut you down!"</p><p></p><p>Hum! Mountains and rivers appeared, turning into a thunderbolt, like a divine punishment descending! Pu! Xu Yan sighed inwardly, this Martial Dao Celestial is indeed formidable, even after his Gentle Wind Sword Intent and two swords, he still hasn't completely destroyed his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The third sword, the Thunder Sword Slash! Pu! Jiao Ming's body was slashed in half, the wound was charred and continuously spreading, and a small toad-like pouch fell out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and retrieved the storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming's charred body immediately crumbled and dissipated like flying ash.</p><p></p><p>In the original spot, there was a faint spiritual consciousness fluctuation.</p><p></p><p>Under the gentle breeze, it dissipated into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>From appearing to turning into flying ash, it was only a matter of moments.</p><p></p><p>From the beginning when Jiao Ming was high and mighty, looking down on him with contempt, his fate was already sealed.</p><p></p><p>After slaying a Martial Dao Celestial, Xu Yan's expression remained calm and undisturbed.</p><p></p><p>He didn't even bother to find out what this Martial Dao Celestial's name was, or what he came to the Ice Palace for.</p><p></p><p>"My Gentle Wind Sword Intent still needs more improvement, I need to spend some time continuing to cultivate it, and strive to be able to kill a Small Celestial Realm Gathered Divine Body with a single sword next time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A figure came from the sky, moving at an extremely fast speed, like a furious thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, why are you here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>And the direction Meng Chong came from seemed to be the same as the Martial Dao Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was now completely puzzled, he had chased after the Martial Dao Celestial, wanting to see what the Martial Dao Celestial came to the Inner Realm for.</p><p></p><p>But the person is gone.</p><p></p><p>Killed by the elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun's expression was full of shock, that was a Martial Dao Celestial, and he was just killed like that?</p><p></p><p>The way he looked at Xu Yan was as if he was looking at a monster.</p><p></p><p>"Came for that Martial Dao Celestial?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, what was that Martial Dao Celestial's purpose in coming here?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was full of curiosity, how could that Celestial end up in conflict with the elder brother?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either, maybe he was looking for someone?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, a bit annoyed, "That Celestial, so high and mighty, looking down on me with contempt, just three swords and I killed him, his strength was just average."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun: ...</p><p></p><p>A high and mighty Martial Dao Celestial, killed in just three swords? "Brother, do you know his background?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong told Xu Yan everything about the trip to the Icy North, the Spiritual Realm, and the opening of the Spiritual Realm Gate.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised for a moment, and said, "Miss Du and I went to that Celestial Tomb, which is the tomb of the Demon Lord, known as the Blood Demon in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"And I suspect the person who was possessed by Elder Wu before, and killed by you, was the Demon Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was stunned.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers cross-checked with each other, and they could roughly confirm that the remnant soul that Meng Chong had killed, which was parasitic in the insect, was indeed the Demon Lord!</p><p></p><p>In the end,</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Back to the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm, I will go, but not now," Xu Yanping said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Before going to the Spiritual Realm, the Great Wilderness must be stabilized first.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, the Spiritual Realm is a place they must go.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they talked about the Martial Dao Celestial Being again. The person is already dead, and as for why he came to the Inner Realm, it is no longer possible to investigate.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened Jiao Ming's storage bag, inside were not only spirit medicines and spirit crystals, but also a pair of hand guards, with sharp fingers like cold knives, obviously the opponent's weapon.</p><p></p><p>It's just that he was too arrogant, and Xu Yan's strength was too strong, he didn't even have a chance to take out the weapon.</p><p></p><p>The hand guards looked extraordinary, after all, they were the weapon of a Martial Dao Celestial Being.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out the hand guards and looked at them, "Junior brother, this is for you!"</p><p></p><p>These hand guards are not suitable for him, but are more suitable for Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Brother," Meng Chong excitedly accepted them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also took out a jade token from the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Ming of the Venus Palace?" </p><p></p><p>The Venus Palace was obviously the force the opponent belonged to.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder his strength was not very good, it turns out he was a pauper!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a bit disgusted, although there were several fifth-grade spirit medicines in the storage bag, but the opponent was a Martial Dao Celestial Being, and there was only this little in the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>If he's not a pauper, what else could he be? The matter here is over, it's time to go back to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The Ice Tower had been destroyed in the great battle, even if it had stored some spirit medicines, they had already been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying saw that the great battle was over, and the heart she had been holding finally relaxed.</p><p></p><p>Young Master Xu is invincible!</p><p></p><p>Even a Martial Dao Celestial Being was slain by him.</p><p></p><p>"I'll send Miss Du back to the Seven Star Academy, Junior Brother, what about you?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll go with Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked back at Ziyun and said, "You go your own way."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun snorted twice and said, "Meng Chong, I will come find you, and then we'll go through the Gate of the Spiritual Realm together."</p><p></p><p>"I can't determine when I'll enter the Gate of the Spiritual Realm yet, our paths may not be the same."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what, I will definitely come find you."</p><p></p><p>Ziyun said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"As you wish!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't be bothered to deal with her.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun left, she had obtained what she needed, and now she should focus on cultivating and improving her strength, there were still some things she needed to do.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan escorted Du Yuying back to the Seven Star Academy, and Meng Chong went with him. The opening of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm means a new world.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming, this Martial Dao Celestial Being, will there be a second one, a third one, coming out of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm?</p><p></p><p>And with Jiao Ming killed, will the Venus Palace send strong experts again?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was living a carefree and leisurely life.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong killed the snow bear and slew the Celestial Being's soul, and there has been no feedback since then.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained calm and did not encounter any special situations in the Celestial Being's tomb.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, there was no danger there.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh!</p><p></p><p>In the past two days, a thunderous sound has appeared on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>It was the sound coming from the body of the red cat.</p><p></p><p>The huge red cat was lying on the ground sleeping, and occasional thunderous sounds came from its body, and vaguely, a breath seemed to be surging out.</p><p></p><p>It was already on the verge of transforming into a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, the red cat he had casually caught was about to transform into a great demon.</p><p></p><p>"The red cat is really going to transform into a great demon, what kind of feedback will it bring?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is the red cat going to become a great demon?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"After the red cat becomes a great demon, can it shrink?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling's face was full of expectation.</p><p></p><p>The current red cat was too big, one of its tiger claws was almost as big as her body.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how much it can comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally wouldn't give an accurate answer.</p><p></p><p>Whether the red cat's size can be freely adjusted after transforming into a great demon, he had no idea.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everyone was paying attention to the transformation of the red cat.</p><p></p><p>The red cat lying on the ground was getting bigger and bigger every day, like a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>That breath was also getting stronger and stronger, making people feel a sense of awe.</p><p></p><p>"That must be demonic qi," Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The red cat's transformation into a great demon is comparable to the peak Grand Ancestor, and with its powerful physical body and mountain-like size, ordinary peak Grand Ancestors would not be its match."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan evaluated the red cat's strength.</p><p></p><p>Boom! One day, the thick gold chain around the red cat's neck was broken due to its growing size.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had a worried look on his face, he had deliberately made the thick gold chain larger, but it was still broken, the red cat's size was growing too fast.</p><p></p><p>"I need to forge a new gold chain."</p><p></p><p>The helpless Shi Er began to prepare a new gold chain, he wished he could slap himself a few times, how did he let the red cat develop a liking for wearing a gold chain?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had not been sailing on the Canglan River for several days, staying on Canglan Island, waiting for the red cat's transformation, in case something happened when the red cat transformed into a great demon.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the divine meaning boundary martial dao technique you created, he has broken through to the divine meaning boundary."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Li Xuan was stunned, Xu Yan had actually comprehended the divine meaning boundary technique, much faster than he had expected.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan felt a huge transformation within himself.</p><p></p><p>The Nirvana Palace opened, and the Spiritual Platform appeared.</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the martial dao divine meaning condensed, forming the meaning of heaven and earth, at this moment, the divine meaning covered Canglan Island, every grass and tree were under his control.</p><p></p><p>Under the cover of the divine meaning, the world seemed to have changed.</p><p></p><p>In a thought, a small insect on Canglan Island turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Every person on Canglan Island was exposed in the divine meaning without any cover, their cultivation progress, true qi strength, bone strength, and so on were all revealed.</p><p></p><p>He had seen through everything on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>The transforming red cat, under the divine meaning, had a huge power hidden in its body, was that the power of a great demon? The acupoint on its head that he often used the bamboo stick to point at was now opening, emitting a mysterious mist, opening the acupoint of spiritual wisdom.</p><p></p><p>And on the red cat's chest, an acupoint was opening, constantly expanding, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surging into it, nurturing some mysterious power.</p><p></p><p>On the red cat's abdomen, an acupoint was opening, nurturing mysteries, as if it could swallow everything that entered it.</p><p></p><p>There was also an acupoint opening on its back...</p><p></p><p>The acupoints on the red cat's body were responding to each other, forming a certain cycle, and the acupoints he had pointed out were also the acupoints of the great demon technique.</p><p></p><p>Under the divine meaning, everything was exposed without any hiding.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan deeply realized the meaning of "my will is the will of heaven"! The Nirvana Palace was constantly expanding and opening, the Spiritual Platform was constantly solidifying, emitting mysterious radiant light, and on the Spiritual Platform, there was a divine meaning form.</p><p></p><p>The divine meaning form was similar to him, but it seemed to be able to resonate with any terrain or environment in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>My form is the form of heaven! He had broken through the fourth boundary of the martial dao, the divine meaning boundary!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

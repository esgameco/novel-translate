        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A golden light emerged, and Li Xuan thought it was feedback from Suling Xiu's martial arts initiation, but to his surprise, it was actually feedback from his disciple Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, while sparring in the Seven Star Academy, defeated several martial arts masters. You have gained experience in discourse on the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. Xu Yan went to the Seven Star Academy and defeated their martial arts masters in sparring? The Seven Star Academy was a top-tier force in the inner domain, with an influence that was beyond imagination. Even some sect patriarchs were from the Seven Star Academy and served as its teachers!</p><p></p><p>"Could this provoke the intervention of great masters?" Li Xuan was secretly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>"Could Xu Yan's visit to the Seven Star Academy ignite a dispute between true and false martial arts?" </p><p></p><p>Thinking about this possibility, Li Xuan felt a headache coming on. Xu Yan was still not strong enough, and if such a conflict were to erupt, the storm he would face would be truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has successfully cultivated the martial arts technique you compiled, and you have attained mastery in the Medicinal Martial Arts and the art of medicine."</p><p></p><p>The feedback from Suling Xiu's martial arts initiation had arrived.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan completely grasped the Medicinal Martial Arts, from the basics to the Xiantian realm, and his medical skills had also greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Medicinal Martial Arts after the initiation would not differ much from orthodox martial arts, except for the focus on the art of medicine.</p><p></p><p>"You have the Jade Bone, Golden Vajra Bone, and Evergreen Bone, and have obtained the Primordial Indestructible Spirit Bone."</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately excited. In that moment, he had undergone a transformation.</p><p></p><p>From a Primordial Spirit Bone, he had evolved into a Primordial Indestructible Spirit Bone! </p><p></p><p>The vitality was endless, and the spirit bone seemed to possess an inexhaustible life force.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this did not mean that he would not eventually reach the end of his lifespan. If his martial arts cultivation could not continue to break through, even if he lived several or even ten times longer than cultivators at the same realm, he would still have a day when his lifespan was exhausted.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that his Primordial Spirit Bone now possessed the characteristic of indestructibility. In the years to come, the spirit bone might even develop a consciousness and transform into a skeletal being, but by then, the skeletal consciousness would no longer be his own.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has grown even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>"With my Primordial Indestructible Spirit Bone and Dragon Soaring Heaven and Earth Spiritual Body, even if I can't compile any more martial arts techniques, I can still dominate the martial arts of this world with this monstrous talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed and pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Should I go to the outer wilderness to look for a suitable fourth disciple? If not, I'll have to wait until I return to the inner domain to see if I can find one."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still uncertain about the fourth martial arts system he wanted to compile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've broken through!" Suling Xiu excitedly ran over, her jade-like face flushed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have initiated the path, I will pass on to you the Medicinal Martial Arts techniques, acupoints, and needle techniques, as well as the Medicinal Classic. You must continue to ponder and comprehend them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!" Suling Xiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>She opened her palm, and a flame-like aura of blood qi emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw this and said, "Your control of blood qi is still weak. I will teach you how to enhance your control of blood qi."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu eagerly went to cultivate, trying to refine dan with her blood qi.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how Xu Yan is doing at the Seven Star Academy?" Li Xuan frowned in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had defeated the martial arts masters at the Seven Star Academy. Would the academy, concerned about its reputation, send out a great master to retaliate?</p><p></p><p>Or would they not dare, as that would be bullying the weak and bring them no glory even if they won?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the inner domain, even considering going to the Seven Star Academy to take a look.</p><p></p><p>To him, even great masters were like grasshoppers that could be easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu immersed herself in the comprehension of the Medicinal Martial Arts and the continuous improvement of her dan refinement techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, in the martial arts discourse at the Seven Star Academy, has shaken the hearts and minds of many sect masters, causing them to doubt their own martial arts cultivation. Your experience in discourse has greatly increased, and your mind has become clear and complete."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not only sparred with the sect masters at the Seven Star Academy, but had also engaged in discourse on the Dao, shaking the faith of these masters in their own martial arts cultivation?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but feel a headache coming on. Could it be that Xu Yan had told them, "What you all cultivate is false martial arts, only mine is the true martial arts"?</p><p></p><p>"No, Xu Yan is not that foolish. He wouldn't provoke the people of the Seven Star Academy, as there are great masters there."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan calmed down.</p><p></p><p>The next day, as Li Xuan was cultivating and studying ancient texts, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has completed the separation of true qi and comprehended the profundity of true qi. You have grasped the profound origin of true qi and can freely manipulate the changes of true qi."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, Li Xuan deeply understood the profound origin of true qi and that he could freely manipulate its changes.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan actually managed to separate true qi and comprehend its profundity? This is truly an extraordinary talent!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The mysteries of true qi? You truly are the pioneer of my martial dao undertaking. I'm so delighted, my teacher!" </p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan had grasped the mysteries of true qi, it wouldn't be long before he comprehended the way of the profound.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised a finger, and a wisp of true qi emerged. Under his will, the true qi transformed into the shape of a tree, then a cat.</p><p></p><p>"I've fathomed the profound mysteries of the origin of true qi and can freely change its form at will. My strength has increased further."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had succeeded in dividing the true qi and grasped its profound mysteries, so his strength had greatly increased, and Li Xuan's strength had naturally risen along with it.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the peak of the Xiantian Realm. Your strength has surged, and you've grasped the meaning of the profound."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt his true qi surging, becoming even more powerful and pure. He had also grasped a glimpse of the meaning of the profound.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has broken through to the peak of the Xiantian Realm, and he has also comprehended the mysteries of true qi. With his current strength, he can even kill a Grand Master."</p><p></p><p>Even if he encountered a powerful Grand Master, he could at least defend himself, if not kill them.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, while being chased by a Grand Master, has made a breakthrough in his body technique, and your Shenlie Crossing the Void has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Damn! It was Meng Chong, not Xu Yan, who was being chased by a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>What exactly had happened?</p><p></p><p>"My two disciples are only aiming for the top-tier battles!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Once they entered the Inner Realm, it was either killing Patriarchs or killing Half-step Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Grand Masters had all come out and were being hunted.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong should be able to break through while escaping, and his speed should have further improved, so he shouldn't be caught by the Patriarchs."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan estimated.</p><p></p><p>Three days later.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slain a Grand Master with a single palm strike, shaking the Seven Star Academy. Your martial arts divine technique has gained the experience of one-hit kills!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>How long had it been since his breakthrough, and he had already killed a Grand Master?</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the direction of the Inner Realm, his heart was itching to go and take a look.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the golden finger feedback came again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, while being chased by a Grand Master, has made a breakthrough in his Great Sun Golden Body, completing it (to the Xiantian Realm)."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was starting to feel restless.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was still being chased? But since his strength had broken through, it shouldn't be too dangerous, right?</p><p></p><p>"What exactly have my two disciples been doing in the Inner Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>It was either killing Patriarchs or being chased by Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan had already started killing Grand Masters...</p><p></p><p>"Didn't they say the Patriarchs in the Inner Realm are already at the peak, and the Grand Masters are the pinnacle of the Inner Realm's martial dao? It's been such a short time, and the Grand Masters have already appeared and one has been killed."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan even suspected that Xu Yan might not be killing Patriarchs next, but Grand Masters instead.</p><p></p><p>One strike, one Grand Master? </p><p></p><p>This was too outrageous!</p><p></p><p>"How did Meng Chong provoke a Grand Master? He's been chased, I don't know if he's managed to escape the pursuit yet."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, the Inner Realm was so vast, even if he went to rescue them, he wouldn't know where to start.</p><p></p><p>"Since he was able to break through his strength while being chased, it shouldn't be too dangerous. If Xu Yan gets the news, he'll probably go to rescue him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already killed a Grand Master with a single palm strike, and the Grand Master chasing Meng Chong hadn't caught up with him for so long, so his strength shouldn't be too formidable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>After letting the black-robed man go, Xu Yan quietly followed him.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man was very cautious, seemingly worried about being followed, and kept circling around and testing to see if anyone was tailing him.</p><p></p><p>Only after confirming that no one was following him did he return to his resting place.</p><p></p><p>To Xu Yan's surprise, the black-robed man returned to the Thousand Star Lake.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he is actually a Patriarch of the Wushuang Pavilion? Is the enemy behind my shijie from the Wushuang Pavilion?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about the Wushuang Pavilion, it seemed that they were only the commissioned agents, not the mastermind behind it, and they had warned the black-robed man to be careful of being eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"Even if he's not a Patriarch of the Wushuang Pavilion, he must have some connection with a powerful figure there."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man entered the Thousand Star Lake, heading towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>A small island appeared in the lake, and among the lush green trees, a courtyard was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"Is this their base?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised for a moment, then quickly denied this judgment. "This should be one of their branch locations!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man entered the island, and a voice came from the courtyard, "Twenty-seven, did you catch the person?"</p><p></p><p>"I was tricked, Twenty-five was killed by him!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man angrily said.</p><p></p><p>"What? By whom?"</p><p></p><p>An angry voice came from the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slowly approached, his heart racing excitedly, "These people must have a huge fortune, they casually took out ten thousand spirit crystals. This branch should be storing some treasures, right?"</p><p></p><p>Not only could he kill his shijie's enemies, but he could also make a fortune. Where else could he find such a good opportunity?</p><p></p><p>He approached cautiously, ready to retreat if there were any Grand Master experts on the island. He would come back after his strength had improved further to take the place down.</p><p></p><p>"Who's there?"</p><p></p><p>A furious roar suddenly came.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful aura emerged, and five figures flew out of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Including the one who had just returned, there were three Patriarchs, and the other two were Half-step Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>There were no Grand Masters present.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately revealed a smile, "Gentlemen, do you want money or your lives? If you want your lives, hand over the spirit crystals and spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man who had just returned was shocked and furious, how had the other person tracked him here, and he hadn't even noticed?</p><p></p><p>"It's him, he killed Twenty-five!"</p><p></p><p>He roared, his aura erupting, "Attack together, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>They charged at him.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan slapped out, and a golden giant dragon roared, shaking the minds of the twenty-seven. In their momentary daze, there was a thunderous explosion, and the body was shattered, the fragments scattered everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon swept up the spirit tickets, and its tail swept away, instantly grinding the fragments into dust! The remaining four were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that Twenty-seven would be no match for them, and they would have a chance to intervene and help. But who would have thought that Twenty-seven would be instantly killed?</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The two Half-step Grand Masters erupted in furious flames, instantly charging at him.</p><p></p><p>The other two Patriarchs were also enraged. Just now, Twenty-seven had called them out, but they had only watched, thinking to observe. </p><p></p><p>But now, Twenty-seven had been killed with a single strike.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked, but also furiously angry. Their side had two Half-step Grand Masters, while the other side only had one person, what was there to fear?</p><p></p><p>So the two Patriarchs also joined the encirclement and attack.</p><p></p><p>The sword flashed, the long sword drawn. Facing the two Half-step Grand Masters, Xu Yan dared not be the slightest bit careless.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Dao Intent was unleashed, the sword light surging, layer upon layer, under the driving of the sword intent, a killing aura swept across the area.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

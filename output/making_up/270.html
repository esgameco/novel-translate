        <h1>Chapter 270</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>The once mighty and renowned Crimson Abyss Sect's Patriarch Lü Xintian, possessing a divine and radiant body, had reached the realm of the Great Celestial. He arrogantly challenged the prodigies of the Refining Spirit Celestials. At this moment, in the eyes of the gathered martial artists, he suddenly seemed like a clown, raging impotently.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Xu Yan was calm and indifferent, hands clasped behind his back, looking down with disdain, as if ignoring a raging grasshopper.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect killed the martial artist who had spoken his mind directly. The other martial artists, although not daring to voice it, felt the same way in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even the Refining Spirit martial artists from the Spiritual Sect families had this same feeling.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the Sect Master of the Jade Spirit Sect also found this absurd, having the same feeling, but they did not dare to reveal it, instead appearing deeply solemn.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Xu Yan has such confidence? Could it be that the renowned Patriarch Lü Xintian of the Crimson Abyss Sect, possessing a divine and radiant body, is not Xu Yan's equal?</p><p></p><p>No! Absolutely impossible!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan is merely putting on an act, pretending to be arrogant.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, Xu Yan may be deceiving us, and there may be a powerful expert lying in ambush to assassinate Patriarch Lü!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said with a grave expression, looking at the Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I'm watching him closely!" </p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect said coldly.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense was probing in all directions, and the entire battlefield was within his scope of detection. No one could escape him!</p><p></p><p>Whoever dared to make a move and try to assassinate Lü Xintian would have to get past him first.</p><p></p><p>And he was very confident, having just recently broken through to the peak of the Refining Spirit Celestial realm. "Xu Yan, you lowly insect, how dare you be so arrogant? Die!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Xintian roared, his massive spear sweeping towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still had his hands clasped behind his back, his expression indifferent. Suddenly, with a whooshing sound, in the horrified gaze of the martial artists, the grass, sand, and stones all rose up.</p><p></p><p>Transforming into fierce swords.</p><p></p><p>The myriad things of heaven and earth become my sword!</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the horrified eyes of the martial artists, the surrounding vegetation suddenly sprang up, as if transforming into a multitude of precious swords, their sword light shining all around.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, this is the Way of the Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>His hands were still clasped behind his back, but behind him and to his sides, there were densely packed swords, though they were made of grass and wood, they were remarkably sharp.</p><p></p><p>The swords surged forth like a tidal wave, flying towards the attacking Lü Xintian.</p><p></p><p>"Trivial tricks!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Xintian roared, his golden radiance flashing as he swept his massive spear, continuously shattering the sword light rushing towards him like a flood.</p><p></p><p>Although he scoffed, in his heart he was greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword art was this?</p><p></p><p>"Incredible, incredible, what kind of sword art is this? No wonder he is so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists were stunned, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a thought seemed to arise in their minds: I want this sword art, I want to be arrogant too!</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather, what kind of sword art is this?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er asked her grandfather in shock.</p><p></p><p>The old man was already greatly astonished, his eyes wide open, his expression one of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Way of the Sword? Grass, wood, and stone can all become swords? How is this possible?"</p><p></p><p>He had seen powerful sword cultivators before, but none had such a terrifying sword technique.</p><p></p><p>Transforming all things into swords? Unheard of!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Lü Xintian roared, unleashing his full power, but no matter how he activated his techniques or drew upon his divine and radiant body, he could not break through the tidal wave of swords.</p><p></p><p>"This boy must be killed!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the others had expressions of great fear.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan did not die, they would not be at ease in their hearts, and in the end, it would be them who perished!</p><p></p><p>They must kill Xu Yan before his strength grows too great.</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect was shocked, but he did not immediately move to kill Xu Yan. Instead, he had another idea.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful sword art, it must be brought under the control of the Crimson Abyss Sect!"</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, ready to act at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Lü Xintian could still fight, and although he could not break through the tidal wave of swords, he had not yet fallen into grave danger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze narrowed slightly as he noticed the movement of the Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect. He inwardly sneered, it was about time.</p><p></p><p>He rose into the air, looking towards a small mountain peak in the distance.</p><p></p><p>The mountain was not large, less than twenty zhang in height, and was a small rocky hill, the perfect size.</p><p></p><p>"When encountering a mountain, the mountain becomes the sword. Today, I shall use this mountain as the sword to slay Lü Xintian, and let the martial artists of this Spiritual Realm know what the true Way of the Sword is!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand towards the small mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists who saw this gesture were taken aback. Could it be that he was going to uproot that small mountain and throw it at Lü Xintian?</p><p></p><p>Of course, some even had the absurd thought that Xu Yan might turn the mountain into a sword.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's eyes widened as she stared intently at Xu Yan's every move. Seeing him raise his hand towards the mountain, she was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Turn the mountain into a sword? How can a mountain become a sword?"</p><p></p><p>The old man's breathing also grew heavier, his heart surging with shock.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu had already come out of the small palace, muttering to himself, "Incredible, incredible, a demonic prodigy has appeared in this Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Arise, sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shouted.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the horrified gaze of the martial artists, the small mountain peak rose up, soaring into the air and transforming into a massive gray sword in mid-air!</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely, this is the Way of the Sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Lü Xintian. "You can die beneath this sword, and find your peace."</p><p></p><p>Lü Xintian was greatly alarmed, all of this was beyond his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, it must be an illusion, you won't deceive me!"</p><p></p><p>He roared, instantly unleashing his secret martial arts techniques. His massive spear whipped up a golden storm, directly soaring into the air.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly smiled, and the massive sword formed from the mountain came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>The sword had no edge, yet it possessed an unstoppable, peerless, and ruthless killing intent!</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect was greatly alarmed. With this sword strike, Lü Xintian would surely die.</p><p></p><p>He moved to intervene, unleashing the full might of his Refining Spirit Celestial realm, rushing to intercept the descending sword.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze lifted, about to act and crush this grasshopper, when he suddenly looked towards the figure in the colorful robes in the palace!</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu raised his hand, and in an instant, a green feather transformed into a cold light, shooting towards the Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Don't interrupt the excitement!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu didn't care about Lü Xintian's life or death. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was excited, wanting to witness the power of this massive sword.</p><p></p><p>This was a sword art that had never been seen before.</p><p></p><p>How could he allow someone to interfere?</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect's expression changed, and with a thunderous punch, he shattered the incoming feather. However, this brief delay meant he could no longer save Lü Xintian in time.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect roared, his eyes bulging.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan was indifferent. The massive sword fell, and with a thunderous sound, the golden radiance shattered, the spear flew apart, and Lü Xintian let out a roar of fury, only to be reduced to dust under the sword.</p><p></p><p>Killing without leaving a trace!</p><p></p><p>"You should have died!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Crimson Abyss Sect's killing intent boiled over.</p><p></p><p>The renowned Patriarch Lü Xintian of the Crimson Abyss Sect, possessing a divine and radiant body, had been killed! Annihilated with a single strike!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was shocked by Xu Yan's swordsmanship, staring with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>The renowned Chiming True Transmission had actually died! Zhu Liang and the other Yushen Sect cultivators were shivering all over, as Lü Xinting was the one they had sought help from, and now he was dead!</p><p></p><p>"Kill him! No matter the cost, we must kill him!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's eyes were bloodshot as he said this. He fiercely looked at Su Zheng and said, "Your Sujia Clan is also involved in this. If you let Xu Yan escape, you know the consequences!"</p><p></p><p>Su Zheng naturally understood this logic.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him! No matter the cost, if Xu Yan does not die today, the Sujia Clan will be destroyed!"</p><p></p><p>As for the other Lingzong and aristocratic families, after witnessing Xu Yan's display, they might not immediately take action. If they failed to eliminate Xu Yan, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan's peak cultivators surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Young Xu Yan, you must die!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Chiming Sect looked up towards the direction of the incoming feathered projectile, which was a spiritual artifact. When he saw the multicolored robed Cui Huayu, his gaze sharpened.</p><p></p><p>"Are you going to stand up for Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Chiming Sect asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No, I just don't want to be disturbed by the excitement. Now that the excitement is over, what a powerful sword strike! Incredible, truly incredible!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu said, once again revealing his sickly weak demeanor, as he was supported by his attendants back into the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Kill Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Chiming Sect heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The peak cultivators' terrifying might was fully unleashed at this moment, causing the watching martial artists to turn deathly pale, trembling and retreating, almost prostrating on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, quickly intervene!" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er looked at her grandfather anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry!"</p><p></p><p>The elder's gaze was fixed on the back of the large cat.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put down his teacup and looked at the surging powerful experts, calmly saying, "There are rules for the Prodigy's Battle. Do you all wish to break the rules?"</p><p></p><p>"My Lingzong aristocratic family is the rule itself. Today, you all shall die!"</p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Chiming Sect said with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! The Lingzong aristocratic families, mere insects, in this heaven and earth, my words are the rule!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Fang Hao, he said, "Watch carefully, I will only demonstrate this once. The profound techniques might be too advanced for you to comprehend, so I'll just reveal a bit of the superficial."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, and even Xu Yan were all excited, watching as their master was about to act.</p><p></p><p>Master is going to display his skills again!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat on the scarlet cat, without even standing up, raised his hand with a light gesture. In an instant, the great energies of heaven and earth converged, and brilliant light descended, transforming into numerous formation artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! </p><p></p><p>The formation was activated! "Using the great energies of heaven and earth as the formation, using the extraordinary methods of heaven and earth as the formation, the formation arises, and all living beings perish."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>His voice was not loud, yet everyone present heard it clearly.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu, who had just entered the small palace, ran out again, his face filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this? What kind of martial art is this? Controlling the great energies of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>Even the renowned Lingzong True Transmission had never heard of such a terrifying technique, such powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" </p><p></p><p>The elder was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>The great energies of heaven and earth converged and descended, transforming into numerous formation artifacts. In an instant, the Second Elder of the Chiming Sect, the Yushen Sect, and the Sujia Clan's cultivators were all trapped within the formation.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>The Second Elder of the Chiming Sect roared.</p><p></p><p>He forcefully activated his cultivation techniques, fully displaying his peak cultivator's might, yet still felt a sense of crisis, as if he was trapped and could be annihilated at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang and the others were also horrified.</p><p></p><p>The group of peak cultivators joined forces, yet they were utterly powerless in the face of this grand formation, this extraordinary method of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was shaken, this was the extraordinary method of heaven and earth? This was the formation activated by a single thought?</p><p></p><p>Using the great energies of heaven and earth as the formation artifacts, using the extraordinary methods of heaven and earth as the formation, this was the profound mystery of the Qimen Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still too weak. Master has always hoped that I could find my own Qimen path, but I've never been able to break through."</p><p></p><p>"Master feared that the profound Qimen Martial Arts would have too great an impact on me, causing me to merely imitate without finding my own Qimen path."</p><p></p><p>"But even this superficial display has already influenced me greatly. It will take some time before I can truly transcend this."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao felt ashamed, "I'm too dull-witted!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu were also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Master's casual display was already so overwhelming.</p><p></p><p>"The great energies of heaven and earth... this is almost divine?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>This formation was too powerful. The great energies descended like dragons, and in an instant, the formation was activated, the extraordinary methods of heaven and earth were deployed.</p><p></p><p>The peak cultivators had no chance to escape the formation's enclosure, trapped within in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Insects unworthy of knowing my name!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Clenching his fist, the formation rumbled, the great energies of heaven and earth like dragons, the extraordinary methods of heaven and earth's formation revealing its might.</p><p></p><p>Within the formation, crimson light shone, and the killing intent descended.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p>"Join forces to break out..."</p><p></p><p>In just a moment or two, all the peak cultivators were reduced to ashes, perishing within the formation.</p><p></p><p>Only the storage bags flew over, falling into Xu Yan's hands.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, Master had casually killed these peak cultivators, yet their storage bags were completely unharmed. This level of control was far beyond his own.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and everything returned to tranquility.</p><p></p><p>But the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan had been destroyed!</p><p></p><p>The world was silent. All the martial artists were stunned, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu, the renowned Lingzong True Transmission, stared with wide eyes, unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>He was trembling inwardly, if he had been caught in that, he would have been annihilated like an ant.</p><p></p><p>"A peerless expert!"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely terrifying expert, even the strongest in the Lingzong Sect might not be his match.</p><p></p><p>The other calmly raised his hand, and the great energies of heaven and earth descended like dragons, transforming into boundless killing intent. What a terrifying technique was this?</p><p></p><p>Yue'er's eyes were wide, her mouth agape, unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The elder beside her was trembling, his lips quivering. Though he had experienced the Blood Demon's calamity, the battles of prodigies, and the conflicts of the strongest experts, none of that compared to the shock of this scene.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this? What kind of martial art was this? Has the Lingdomain ever seen such a terrifying and powerful martial art before? Unheard of!</p><p></p><p>What is a true expert? This is a true expert!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly satisfied with the reactions of these martial artists. This display had refreshed his spirit.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the stunned martial artists behind, the scarlet cat turned and returned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan naturally followed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao hurried back to ponder and contemplate, only sending a message to Gao, instructing the Wanshi Alliance to take over the territories and legacies of the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan, but not to act under the banner of the scattered cultivators. </p><p></p><p>For now, they should keep a low profile to avoid drawing the attention of the Lingzong Sects from other regions.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

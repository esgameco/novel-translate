        <h1>Chapter 82</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 82: The Excited Xu Yan, the Sword Venerable Cliff Xie Lingfeng</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang and Guo Rongshan looked up at the sound, and four figures descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A young man, with a precious sword hanging at his waist, was carrying the Crown Prince down from the sky; the other person was a middle-aged man, also with a precious sword hanging at his waist, carrying the Crown Prince's accompanying eunuch.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang suddenly became overjoyed and abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>The high-level expert he had been longing for had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, high-level expert!"</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang lowered his posture greatly, almost on the verge of tears from excitement.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan, on the other hand, felt a sinking feeling in his heart. His grandson Xu Yan could not yet fly, but the high-level expert was actually flying.</p><p></p><p>However, his grandson's master must be an extraordinary expert, so it should be fine, right?</p><p></p><p>He also hurriedly stood up and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's gaze was sharp, and without any nonsense, he directly asked, "Where is the troublemaker?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang was taken aback. Troublemaker? Xu Yan?!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's heart sank, this high-level expert's tone did not seem good. Could it be that he had some grudge against Xu Yan or his master?</p><p></p><p>His heart became anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Guo Rongshan, where is your grandson?"</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang straightened his back at this point and directly addressed him by name, no longer calling him "brother."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan pondered for a moment. His grandson was in Donghe Prefecture, following his master to cultivate. These two martial artists going there might be able to deal with Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>"In Donghe Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>He did not hide it and stood upright, glaring at Qi Huang.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang's heart sank. The victory had not yet been decided. If in the end, the two high-level experts before him could not prevail, that would be disastrous.</p><p></p><p>He immediately put on a smile and said, "Brother Guo, the high-level expert is looking for your grandson. I dare not hide it from him."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, upon hearing that Blood Without Heart was in Donghe Prefecture, immediately asked, "Which direction is Donghe Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince straightened his back at this point and said, "High-level expert, wherever you need to go, just have someone send a message, and let him come to the capital to pay his respects to the high-level expert."</p><p></p><p>He then raised his hand, pointing at Guo Rongshan, and ordered, "Lord Guo, quickly send a message to your grandson, and have him come to the capital to pay his respects to the high-level expert?"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan narrowed his eyes and looked at the Crown Prince. This kid needed to be disciplined.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince, feeling uneasy under his gaze, glared back at him fiercely. However, with the high-level expert backing him up, he immediately regained his arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was a bit confused, looking at Guo Rongshan with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"Your grandson?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Without Heart had become someone's grandson?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I don't know what business the high-level expert has with my grandson."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng blinked his eyes, feeling that something was not quite right about this.</p><p></p><p>He turned to Hu Shan and asked through a mental transmission, "How old is Blood Without Heart? Could it be that he is from the Borderlands?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was also a bit puzzled, saying, "Blood Without Heart should not be younger than me. As for coming from the Borderlands to the Inner Realm, it's impossible. The area near the Inner Realm is filled with fierce beasts. Without at least a fifth-rank cultivation, one absolutely cannot pass through."</p><p></p><p>"Then what is this all about?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had never thought that a martial artist would emerge from the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan pondered for a moment and said, "Perhaps Blood Without Heart has changed his ways. On the surface, he is this person's grandson, but in reality, he is secretly controlling this person, helping him to control the Qi Kingdom's court, secretly devouring others' vital essence to avoid causing major disasters.</p><p></p><p>"Is he using this to avoid being pursued by us?</p><p></p><p>"If it were someone else, and they went to the Borderlands and found no incidents of city-destroying sacrifices, they would not continue to investigate, but would return to the Inner Realm instead."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan analyzed it in this way.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng felt that it made sense. Blood Without Heart had suffered such a big loss in the Inner Realm, and had just fled to the Borderlands. He must have been low-key to avoid being pursued by Inner Realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>To conceal his identity, he even went so far as to become someone's grandson?</p><p></p><p>He really underestimated Blood Without Heart's restraint.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it this way, Xie Lingfeng narrowed his eyes and said to Guo Rongshan, "Send a message to your grandson, have him come to the capital to see me. Tell him he can't hide."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan did not hesitate and nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>This matter was no longer something he could control or resolve. Passing the message to his grandson, if it was truly impossible to defeat them, then let his grandson flee.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, I take my leave."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan paid his respects to Qi Huang.</p><p></p><p>"Go slowly, my dear minister."</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After Guo Rongshan left, Qi Huang immediately ordered a grand feast to be prepared to entertain Xie Lingfeng and the others.</p><p></p><p>However, Xie Lingfeng refused, only requesting a secluded residence to be arranged.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>He personally escorted Xie Lingfeng and the others to a secluded residence in the palace, and after returning to the imperial study, his aura changed, the might of an emperor returning.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order to secretly monitor the movements of the Qi Wang Mansion, and prepare to take control of the Divine Might Army."</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang commanded.</p><p></p><p>"Father, just raid Guo Rongshan's house directly!" The Crown Prince spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Foolish!" Qi Huang glared at his eldest son and said, "The victory is not yet decided. Why the hurry? What if it ends in a draw? What if we lose? We must be calm and not be hasty!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, Father is right!" The Crown Prince apologized with a guilty expression.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, however, he was very dissatisfied with his father. He was plotting to curry favor with the high-level expert, hoping the expert would support him in becoming the emperor of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>His father was old and confused, it was time to kick him out.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County, Li Xuan was continuously perfecting the cultivation method beyond the Innate Realm. This realm's strength could still be vastly superior to the great masters of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a message arrived in Donghe Prefecture from the capital.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist had descended upon the capital! </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was summoned to the capital to meet him!</p><p></p><p>It seemed the visitor was not well-intentioned!</p><p></p><p>The two people had descended from the sky, undoubtedly Inner Realm master-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will go to the capital to meet the Inner Realm martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an excited expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Inner Realm master, do you have the confidence?" Li Xuan pondered for a moment and asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Qi and Blood Realm was already complete, and he had also attained profound insights into the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>His strength had already changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>However, the two people, if they worked together, Xu Yan might not be able to handle them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, masters also had differences in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry. I have gained insights into the Sword Dao, and the Subduing Dragon Palm has also broken through the second layer. I am not afraid of Inner Realm masters, even if they work together, I am not afraid!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"If you have the confidence, then go."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Do you need me to accompany you?"</p><p></p><p>After thinking about it, Li Xuan asked again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you can stay here and guide the junior disciples. They are coming for Blood Without Heart, and they haven't harmed my grandfather's family, so they may not have malicious intentions.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good opportunity for me to temper my Sword Dao, and perhaps I can gain new insights."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought about it and shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"If you have this confidence, then go."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan set off enthusiastically.</p><p></p><p>"Inner Realm masters, two of them, are they coming to pursue Blood Without Heart? From Guo Rongshan's message, it seems they have ill intentions, but they haven't harmed the Guo family.</p><p></p><p>"And they also don't seem to have a high and mighty, overbearing attitude.</p><p></p><p>"They are not bloodthirsty people. Xu Yan going there should not be a problem, and with Xu Yan's strength, he should not lose to a master."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"This precious disciple of mine, I can't let him encounter any accidents. I'll go take a look."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan ultimately could not set his mind at ease.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, the Thunderous Golden Ape Fist..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong returned, Li Xuan instructed him for a while, then rose into the air and headed towards the capital city of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>In the capital city of the Qi Kingdom, at the Guo family's residence.</p><p></p><p>"Father, have those two eminent cultivators come for Yan'er?" Guo Yunkai asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"This is something we cannot interfere with. We can only watch and see how Yan'er handles it," Guo Rongshan said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Since the arrival of the eminent cultivators in the capital, all the ministers had become excited, rushing to express their loyalty to the Qi Emperor, just for the chance to meet the cultivators. The Qi Palace had become deserted, and in the ministers' eyes, the Qi Palace was doomed. They all distanced themselves, as if the Qi Palace was plague-ridden, afraid of being tainted.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor had no mind for the ministers. He went to pay his respects to the cultivators morning, noon and night, bringing out all kinds of precious medicines and rare jewels to offer them. Although the cultivators did not accept them, he did not take them back. Soft-mouthed and short-handed, as the ruler of a country, being so respectful and offering such precious treasures, the cultivators should at least show some response, right?</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor was delighted, just waiting for an opportunity to ask about the Dao of martial arts and request to be their disciple.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince also diligently attended to them, hoping to be accepted as their disciple and learn their powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he? Has he gone into hiding?" Xie Lingfeng became a little impatient.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Your Highness, he has already set out for the capital," the Crown Prince said flatteringly.</p><p></p><p>On that day, a figure swooped towards the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Old Qi Emperor, I, Xu Yan, have arrived. Where are those eminent cultivators?" Xu Yan came with his usual arrogance, his aura and presence dominating the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan's expressions changed.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist! Where did this martial artist come from?</p><p></p><p>Instantly, the two disappeared from their original spots and reappeared in front of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze sharpened. They were indeed Grandmaster-level martial artists. His gaze fell on Xie Lingfeng, instinctively feeling that this person was the strongest, with a fierce aura. A long sword hung at his waist - a sword cultivator!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up as he stood on the palace roof, rubbing his palms eagerly, wanting to test his skills against this inner domain sword cultivator. This inner domain martial artist was not much older than him, only about ten or so years his senior, but his strength exceeded even Blood Wuxin's.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the ones looking for me?" Xu Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's brow furrowed deeply. There was something a bit off about this young man. His aura was that of a martial artist, yet different from a typical martial artist's, his vital energy extremely vigorous.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he asked solemnly, "You are not Blood Wuxin. Where is Blood Wuxin?"</p><p></p><p>So they were indeed looking for Blood Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Wuxin is dead!" Xu Yan did not hide it.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?" Xie Lingfeng was taken aback. Blood Wuxin was a Grandmaster-level martial artist, how could he have died in the remote border regions?</p><p></p><p>"Who killed him?" Xie Lingfeng did not believe the young man in front of him could have defeated Blood Wuxin.</p><p></p><p>"My master!" Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Who is your master?" Xie Lingfeng asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's none of your business. Since you've come looking for me, let's fight. I'd like to experience the strength of an inner domain Grandmaster," Xu Yan said, his vital energy bursting forth as a huge crimson dragon coiled around him.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's heart raced. "Where do you come from? From the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood proudly and said, "What do you mean 'from the inner domain'? I am Xu Yan, a commoner from the East River Prefecture of the Qi Kingdom, which is considered the remote border regions!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible!" Xie Lingfeng exclaimed in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"The border regions could not possibly produce a martial artist!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered disdainfully. "So you think I'm not a martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was dumbfounded. Indeed, the young man in front of him was a martial artist from the border regions.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan also was greatly shocked. He tried to sense the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth, but found nothing. This meant the border regions still lacked the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Stop your nonsense, let's fight!" Xu Yan said impatiently, pointing at Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xie Lingfeng took a deep breath and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go outside the city," Xu Yan said, then shot off towards the city outskirts.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan exchanged a glance, both seeing the disbelief in each other's eyes.</p><p></p><p>They took to the air, flying towards the city outskirts.</p><p></p><p>The capital of Qi Kingdom was in an uproar. There were powerful martial artists battling, and the people rushed out of the city to watch, but they could no longer see the combatants.</p><p></p><p>Outside the capital, ten li away.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng hovered in the air, sword drawn, his aura fierce, like a sharp sword.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's vital energy was boiling, his excitement growing. He had just entered the Dao of the Sword, his sword heart illuminated, but he had not yet fully comprehended the Sword Dao. Perhaps this was an opportunity to test his skills against an inner domain sword cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xie Lingfeng, the Sword Saint Cliff," Xie Lingfeng cupped his fists in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, from the East River Prefecture," Xu Yan returned the greeting.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the fierce sword intent from Xie Lingfeng, Xu Yan grew even more excited. He was just at the Martial Dao entry level, in the Qi Blood Realm, but Xie Lingfeng seemed puzzled by this.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Brother, what realm are you at?" Xie Lingfeng asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He could not quite gauge Xu Yan's realm. It was not at the Grandmaster level, yet also not the First Rank.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan replied directly, "I'm at the peak of the Qi Blood Realm, just entering the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>"Qi Blood Realm?" Xie Lingfeng was bewildered. He had never heard of such a realm before.</p><p></p><p>He glanced back at Hu Shan, and saw the same confusion on his face.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan was just at the entry level of the Martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Brother, the Martial Dao's entry level is the Ninth Rank..." Xie Lingfeng began to explain.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan interrupted impatiently, "Enough talk, let's fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!" Xie Lingfeng's gaze sharpened, the sword tip pointing forward as sword qi flickered.</p><p></p><p>"Then I won't hold back!" Xu Yan raised his hand and struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The power of the Descending Dragon Palm transformed into a huge dragon, its might terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thrust out his sword, the sword qi like a lightning bolt, directly piercing the dragon's head, splitting it in two.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression darkened. Xie Lingfeng was stronger than Blood Wuxin, and by a significant margin.</p><p></p><p>He took a deep breath and unleashed the full power of the Descending Dragon Palm, eighteen giant dragons converging in a devastating attack.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's heart raced, what kind of palm technique was this? </p><p></p><p>His sword qi surged, forming a protective barrier around him. Then his figure flickered, a sword flash like thunder and lightning striking towards Xu Yan's throat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze sharpened. In that instant, he saw a weakness in Xie Lingfeng's attack, but the speed was too fast for him to exploit it. He quickly shifted his position to evade.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was shocked again, what kind of movement technique was this, able to instantly shift positions?</p>

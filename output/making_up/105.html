            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 105: Above the Innate is the Profound Mysteries (Seeking Monthly Votes)</p><p></p><p>When Stone Second broke through to the Qi and Blood Realm during his martial arts cultivation, Xu Yan was quite surprised. How could he be so weak?</p><p></p><p>The rumbling sound of his sinews and bones was much smaller than Xu Yan's initial breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>His Qi and Blood also appeared quite weak.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had the same thoughts.</p><p></p><p>However, Su Ling Xiu was greatly amazed. This was the rumbling of sinews and bones, the Qi and Blood like a fierce gale - truly extraordinary, with an imposing presence. </p><p></p><p>It was far more powerful than the martial arts of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>After Stone Second's breakthrough, Li Xuan saw a golden light appear.</p><p></p><p>"Your servant Stone Second, cultivating the martial arts you created, has seen a slight increase in your true Qi." </p><p></p><p>The feedback from the golden finger had changed to "the martial arts you created", proving that the feedback gained from cultivating a self-created cultivation method was extremely limited.</p><p></p><p>Stone Second was still his servant after all.</p><p></p><p>If it were strangers or those unrelated, they might not even get any feedback at all, one or two of them.</p><p></p><p>"The true Qi has only increased slightly." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt helpless. This feedback from the golden finger indicated his true Qi had indeed increased, but less than one-tenth.</p><p></p><p>"So, only disciples cultivating the techniques I created can gain abundant feedback. </p><p></p><p>For others cultivating established techniques, the feedback is too little. However, if the numbers are large, the gains should be a bit more."</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan knew that his fundamental focus was still on his disciples.</p><p></p><p>Only when his disciples continuously cultivated and grew stronger was that his true source of power.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Second's Copper Bone Initiation, this strength is about as expected."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Stone Second's martial arts initiation strength, which was roughly in line with his assessment.</p><p></p><p>Stone Second restrained his Qi and Blood, extremely excited, and knelt down towards Li Xuan, kowtowing and saying, "Thank you, Master, for passing down the martial arts to me!"</p><p></p><p>He then turned to bow to Su Ling Xiu, "Thank you, Heavenly Mother, for bestowing the medicinal pills!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, are you the Heavenly Mother?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>In Kou Ruozhi's mouth, the peerlessly beautiful immortal beauty without equal in the world was actually his own junior sister?</p><p></p><p>However, Kou Ruozhi had not lied. His junior sister was truly a rare beauty in the world.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, what's wrong?" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked at her elder brother puzzledly. Why did his gaze seem a bit strange?</p><p></p><p>"Kou Ruozhi told me before..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not hide it, and repeated everything Kou Ruozhi had said.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Ling Xiu became angry. Kou Ruozhi actually wanted to use her to coax her elder brother, clearly not taking her, the Heavenly Mother, seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>Outrageous!</p><p></p><p>"Kou Ruozhi is courting death, I'll bury him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, "I've always felt he was a treacherous and despicable person!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked at Stone Second, "Stone Second, go capture Kou Ruozhi!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Heavenly Mother!" </p><p></p><p>Stone Second promptly nodded in acknowledgement.</p><p></p><p>"Don't call me Heavenly Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu glared at him angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Stone Second nodded.</p><p></p><p>Having just broken through to the Qi and Blood Realm and become a true martial artist, he was still excited. He immediately set out to the Eastern River Prefecture to capture Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Stone Second, Su Ling Xiu continued refining pills.</p><p></p><p>The second batch of medicinal pills still failed, but there was progress.</p><p></p><p>After two attempts at pill refining, Su Ling Xiu was already tired, and needed to settle down and summarize her pill refining experience to improve the refining method.</p><p></p><p>Back in her room, she lay down on the bed.</p><p></p><p>"Miss."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying brought in a basin of water and wiped Su Ling Xiu's face.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, once I succeed in refining the medicinal pills and enter the martial arts initiation, you should cultivate the martial arts as well. With my medicinal pills, you will definitely be able to successfully cultivate the martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll listen to Miss."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then she said worriedly, "Miss, this time I rashly returned to the Inner Domain, and it has attracted a great master. Our whereabouts in the Borderlands may have been exposed."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu shook her head, "Not necessarily exposed. That great master is arrogant, dealing with you and me would be easy for him. He probably just tracked you down after discovering your trail, the others may not know."</p><p></p><p>"He has already been slapped to death by my master, not even leaving any ashes behind. Our whereabouts in the Borderlands should not be known by anyone."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was still somewhat worried, "I hope so."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu smiled, "What's there to be afraid of, with my master here."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying thought about it, and that senior indeed was unfathomable.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, on a small hill.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sat cross-legged, gripping the hilt of a sword, continuing to cultivate the sword while also contemplating the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan strolled leisurely on the small path on the hill, with Xu Yan following closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>Because of Su Ling Xiu, a great master had come to attack, and although he had been slapped to death, Li Xuan did not dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>Although the great master was arrogant, and might have directly tracked down Zhou Ying without informing others, the possibility of Su Ling Xiu and her companion's whereabouts being exposed was not high.</p><p></p><p>But he still had to be prepared for the worst.</p><p></p><p>He did not fear the great master, but was wary of the existence above the great master.</p><p></p><p>Of course, based on the current information, there were no martial artists above the great master level in the Inner Domain, and even if there were, they would be well-hidden old fellows.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already reached the initial stage of the Innate Realm, it was time to impart to him the martial arts techniques beyond the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stopped his steps.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple."</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>His heart was somewhat excited, his master was going to teach him the martial arts techniques beyond the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yesterday, in the battle with the great master, what insights did you gain?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered and said, "The great master was very strong, his inner Qi was far more substantial than a Patriarch, like the difference between a stream and a river. And I felt the great master seemed to have a kind of aura like the Heavenly Might."</p><p></p><p>In the battle with the great master, he finally realized that the martial arts of the Inner Domain were not entirely without merit.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will pass on to you the martial arts techniques beyond the Innate Realm. If you can comprehend the techniques, the realm beyond the Innate Realm will no longer be a bottleneck for you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned to look at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>"The Innate Realm theoretically corresponds to the Patriarch Realm of the Inner Domain, while the realm beyond the Innate is equivalent to the Great Master Realm. But you must remember not to look down on the martial arts of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"The path of the martial arts requires taking the strengths of others and complementing one's own weaknesses, understanding oneself, comprehending the profundities of Heaven and Earth, and grasping the boundlessness of the Dao. Only then can you be unrivaled on the martial arts path."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan bowed, "Disciple will remember Master's teachings!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Holding a jade scepter in one hand and his other hand clasped behind his back, he stood on the hillside, gazing into the distance, and slowly said, "The Innate Realm is the true transcendence of the mundane, the true entry into the path of the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"While the realm beyond the Innate is the initial exploration of the profundities of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shaken. The realm beyond the Innate had already involved the profundities of Heaven and Earth?</p><p></p><p>He thought of the aura of Heavenly Might from the great master, was that also like this?</p><p></p><p>He respectfully...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Listening attentively.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued, "Above the Innate Realm, there is a realm called the Profound Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The Profound Realm!</p><p></p><p>This was the third realm that Li Xuan had created, and after repeated deliberation and reference to the inner domain cultivation methods, he had finally determined it.</p><p></p><p>"What is the meaning of 'Profound'? It means to comprehend the profound mysteries, and also to understand the profound mysteries of Heaven and Earth. How can one possess the power of the Profound?"</p><p></p><p>"The most important thing is the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth is the foundation of the martial dao, and also the basis for the mysterious changes of Heaven and Earth. The human body can only absorb a limited amount of spiritual energy, but between Heaven and Earth, the spiritual energy is limitless.</p><p></p><p>"To attain the Profound, one must align with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, harness the spiritual energy permeating the entire body, and use it for one's own, for all the transformations of the Profound lie within."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the theory of the Profound Realm step by step.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened with his blood boiling, and his mind had already conjured up the powerful image of the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the hand or a step, it would be as if the might of Heaven was surging, and the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth would instantly become his power.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to break through to the Profound Realm, how many great masters in the world could be my match? Crushing a great master with a single palm strike would no longer be a dream!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became more and more excited as he imagined it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued, "The Innate Realm is about refining the innate true qi, while the Profound Realm is about refining the true essence!</p><p></p><p>"The true qi undergoes transformation and sublimation, becoming the true essence, which surges like a spring and flows like a mighty river..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened quietly as his master explained the true essence of the Profound Realm, and his heart began to comprehend how to refine the true qi into the true essence.</p><p></p><p>"The true essence of the Profound Realm comes from the transformation of the innate true qi. To transform the true qi into the true essence, it requires the sublimation and refinement of the true qi.</p><p></p><p>"Just like this mist, when it condenses and settles, it becomes water droplets, and the true qi must be refined in a similar manner to become the true essence."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained how the true qi transforms into the true essence.</p><p></p><p>The true qi condenses into a liquid, and that is the true essence, but to refine the true qi into the true essence and break through to the Profound Realm is not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>"The dantian is like a surging spring, and the true essence is like a mighty river, flowing endlessly. This is the foundation of the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The true essence of the Profound Realm can align with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, and the strength of the true essence determines the scope of control over the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"If it is powerful enough, it can even control the spiritual energy within a mile radius."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Xu Yan, and the disciple was already in deep contemplation, seemingly having gained some understanding of the direction of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how can the true essence align with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his head and asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled slightly and said, "The spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth is like this mist, and the true essence is like water. How do you think water can align with the mist?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned, and a flash of insight appeared in his mind, as if he had a vague understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, remember this: the Profound, the Profound, is about comprehending the profound mysteries of Heaven and Earth, and the spiritual energy is the foundation of the profound mysteries of Heaven and Earth. Only by aligning with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth and utilizing it can one truly understand the foundation of the profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"When the true essence aligns with the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, the power can reach the Profound, and one will have laid the foundation to control the mighty power of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan further explained the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly explaining the martial dao theory of the Profound Realm that he had created, Li Xuan walked back to the manor with a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>Leaving Xu Yan alone to ponder and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan now had full confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao cultivation method of the Profound Realm was more complete and coherent in theory than the Blood Qi Realm and the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Blood Qi Realm and the Innate Realm only had a vague theory, Xu Yan was still able to comprehend them. The Profound Realm at least had some substance to it.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was based on the martial dao cultivation methods from the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's prodigy-like abilities, comprehending the Profound Realm cultivation method would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>"The Profound Realm has already been passed on to Xu Yan, and now I should start preparing for the realm above the Profound. How should I cultivate after the Profound Realm? </p><p></p><p>"How should I design it to seamlessly connect with the next level, and make the theoretical structure reasonable?"</p><p></p><p>Back in the manor, Li Xuan sat in the chair and began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the martial dao cultivation methods written by Xie Lingfeng and the others, and started reading them again, hoping to find inspiration for the next realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivation methods written by Xie Lingfeng and the others only went up to the Great Master Realm, and there was nothing beyond that.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Qi Realm cultivates the blood qi, the Innate Realm cultivates the true qi, and the Profound Realm cultivates the true essence. Then what should be cultivated in the next realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, Xu Yan recorded the cultivation method of the Profound Realm and then sat cross-legged, inhaling and exhaling the spiritual energy of Heaven and Earth, while also trying to comprehend the profound mysteries within.</p><p></p><p>Wanting to derive the cultivation method of the Profound Realm from this.</p><p></p><p>"No, this is not right!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan had a realization.</p><p></p><p>"In the Profound Realm, the true essence aligns with Heaven and Earth, but how does one align with Heaven and Earth? Just as my master used the analogy of water aligning with mist, how does that work?</p><p></p><p>"Although I have cultivated the innate true qi, do I truly understand the true qi? Have I really comprehended the profound mysteries hidden within the true qi? The true essence is the transformation of the true qi, but if I don't even understand the true qi, how can I transform it into the true essence?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, Xu Yan withdrew his focus and began to wholeheartedly perceive and comprehend the true qi within his own body.</p><p></p><p>"Back in the Blood Qi Realm, I used the method of 'roasting meat' to improve my control over the blood qi. Then how should I improve my control over the true qi?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan realized that he should focus on enhancing his control over the true qi, only then could he truly comprehend the profound mysteries of the true qi.</p><p></p><p>"I used the 'roasting meat' method to refine the blood qi, which improved my mastery and understanding of the blood qi.</p><p></p><p>"Using the true qi to 'roast meat' may not work. The true qi is too powerful, and 'roasting meat' would be too easy, which would not help me improve my control over the true qi or understand its profound mysteries."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep contemplation.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, he felt as if he had returned to the small village, recalling the time when he first comprehended the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Raising his hand, the true qi manifested into a golden dragon over a zhang (3.3 meters) long.</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the golden dragon on his palm, Xu Yan had a thought, wanting to divide the dragon into two. But suddenly, he found that even this small amount of true qi, he could not split it into two.</p><p></p><p>Before the golden dragon could be divided, the true qi dissipated, and the dragon vanished.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, his eyes lit up, as if he had found a way to improve his control over the true qi.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Powerful true qi erupted, and a massive golden dragon soared into the sky. With a single thought, the dragon divided into two, then three, four... all the way up to eighteen.</p><p></p><p>"My true qi is so vast, yet I can easily divide and control it. But even a tiny wisp of true qi, I cannot control or divide at will."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"I must gradually divide the true qi, splitting it smaller and smaller, until I can effortlessly divide a single strand of true qi into ten or even twenty parts."</p><p></p><p>After this realization, Xu Yan became invigorated.</p><p></p><p>Ten fingers each produced a strand of true qi, and he began to study how to divide them, and then divide the divided strands further.</p><p></p><p>He even tried to interweave the true qi strands, yet keep them separate without merging.</p><p></p><p>"Once I comprehend the profound mysteries of the true qi, I will have grasped the cultivation method of the Profound Realm. When my Innate Realm is perfected, and I break through to the Profound Realm, it will be a natural progression!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly inspired, fully immersing himself in the task of dividing the true qi, seeking to uncover the profound secrets at its core.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Shi Ling Xiu had finished resting and was preparing to start refining pills again, when Shi Er brought Kou Ruozhi over.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 106 - Mastering the Fundamentals of Pill Refining</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, in the mountain forest, Su Ling Xiu was digging a pit, intending to bury Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>"Kou Ruozhi, you are truly unreasonable! When I agreed to become the Heavenly Mother, it was a proper arrangement - you were to provide the necessary resources, and I would use my medical skills to treat the impoverished masses. </p><p></p><p>"You used this to promote your cause and rally the people. How dare you try to exploit me like this!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was in a panic, seeing the pit getting deeper and deeper. He hurriedly tried to explain, "Heavenly Mother, that was just an expedient measure for the greater cause of our sect. I had to deceive them, but I never truly intended to use you to rally the people.</p><p></p><p>"And Heavenly Mother, you are so powerful, how could I dare to exploit you?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu sneered, "Do you think I would believe that? From the first time I met you, I knew you were a scheming person. If it wasn't for obtaining more precious medicines, if it wasn't for being well-informed about the Heavenly Mother Sect, why would I have agreed to become the Heavenly Mother?"</p><p></p><p>She had agreed to become the Heavenly Mother not only to have a foothold, but also to be well-informed about the situations in the Qi and Wu nations. The Heavenly Mother Sect provided her with various medicinal materials to meet her needs, and in return, she used her medical skills to treat the impoverished masses, allowing the sect to propagate its teachings and rally the people.</p><p></p><p>As for any rebellion, Su Ling Xiu didn't care about such things. At the end of the day, she was here to seek refuge in the remote wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Heavenly Mother Sect's current strength, the Qi and Wu nations were facing no major disasters or calamities, and they would not be able to achieve anything or stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mother, Xu Yan is truly a prodigy. Apart from him, no one else is worthy of you!" Kou Ruozhi became increasingly panicked.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu sneered, "Who gave you the right to decide my affairs?"</p><p></p><p>The pit had been dug.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, throw him in!"</p><p></p><p>Without a word, Shi Er grabbed Kou Ruozhi and threw him into the pit.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi glared angrily at Shi Er, the despicable scoundrel. Not only did he not plead for him, but he even used such force!</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu moved quickly, starting to bury him with soil.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's face turned deathly pale. She was really going to bury him alive!</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mother, please spare me! Heavenly Mother, please spare me! I'll never dare to do it again. I was only deceiving Xu Yan, it wasn't true. Please believe me..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was burying him at an astonishing speed, her proficiency making Shi Er's eyes twitch. How many people had she buried before, to be this skilled?</p><p></p><p>He recalled the rumors about Su Ling Xiu persuading evil people to reform, and realized it must have been at least a hundred, if not dozens, of people she had buried.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, please plead for me!" Kou Ruozhi panicked.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er wanted to plead, but when Su Ling Xiu glared at him, he hastily shut his mouth, not daring to say a word. If he pleaded for Kou Ruozhi and angered Su Ling Xiu, he might lose his supply of elixirs.</p><p></p><p>The soil had already reached Kou Ruozhi's neck, and he was completely terrified, frantically thinking of ways to save his life.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Fire Stone, the Divine Fire Stone! Heavenly Mother, if I die, who will be responsible for mining the Divine Fire Stone? The old mine is almost depleted, and the new one is only known to me within the sect!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly called out.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu paused, looking at him. "You know of a new Divine Fire Stone mine?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I accidentally discovered it. The new mine has an even greater reserve!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi frantically nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu picked up the iron shovel and hit him on the head, saying, "From today on, your life belongs to me. You will be responsible for the Divine Fire Stone, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu took out a reddish-brown medicinal pill and tossed it to Shi Er, saying, "Feed this to him."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er nodded, and under Kou Ruozhi's angry glare, he pried open his mouth and forced the pill down his throat.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heart-Melting Pill. It will activate once every half year. Without the antidote, it will slowly melt your heart, and you will die a painful death in half a month.</p><p></p><p>"I won't go into the details of the suffering."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu sneered.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's face turned deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"I am a cultivator, and a pill refining cultivator at that. I have many methods, so you better not try to deceive me. As long as you complete the tasks I assign you, otherwise... Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu picked up the iron shovel and returned to the manor.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Mother, please let me out!" Kou Ruozhi pleaded urgently.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, remember to dig Kou Ruozhi out in twelve hours."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu instructed.</p><p></p><p>Back in the manor, Su Ling Xiu excitedly began to continue refining pills.</p><p></p><p>The issue of the Divine Fire Stone supply had finally been resolved. With the fuel problem solved, the only thing lacking now was medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>"Unfortunately, there are no spiritual herbs in the remote wilderness."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>Pills refined from spiritual herbs would have astonishing effects, even being effective for Xiantian cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Before starting the pill refining, Su Ling Xiu picked up a draft and carefully reviewed it, going over the previous pill refining summaries and some new ideas in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Then, she started the fire to refine the pills.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was attending to her, and Shi Er also had an excited expression, waiting for the pills to be completed.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, after finishing her cultivation, Su Ling Xiu immersed herself completely in pill refining. The Blood Qi Pill still had not been successfully refined, but the summarization of the pill refining technique was becoming more and more complete.</p><p></p><p>The failed pills were all given to Shi Er to consume. They couldn't be wasted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong occasionally returned from the hillside to watch Su Ling Xiu refine pills.</p><p></p><p>Several days passed, and no more great masters came to attack.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying finally let out a sigh of relief, as their whereabouts had not been revealed.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Xuan looked at the cultivating Su Ling Xiu, once again falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"Something seems a bit off. She's almost about to refine Golden Bones."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's cultivation speed was beyond his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Now, the courtyard was no longer empty, as she had planted various flowers and trees, with blooming flowers and a faint floral fragrance lingering.</p><p></p><p>These were all planted by Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>"This girl, could it be that she has some special physique?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Su Ling Xiu cultivating amidst the flower bushes, a thought suddenly occurred to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"And this special physique just happens to be well-suited for the cultivation of the Pill Refining Dao, which is why her cultivation speed is so fast."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt this possibility was quite high.</p><p></p><p>"Learned medicine at four, treated patients and saved lives at six..."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about Su Ling Xiu's prodigious medical talent, he was filled with amazement.</p><p></p><p>After finishing her cultivation, Su Ling Xiu continued refining pills.</p><p></p><p>"She's about to succeed in refining the pills. The Pill Refining Dao should be about to be comprehended."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was anticipating it.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Su Ling Xiu began a new round of pill refining, once again attempting to refine the Blood Qi Pill.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had also returned to watch their shijie refine pills.</p><p></p><p>According to her explanation, this time she was certain to successfully refine the pill.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Fire Stone was ignited, the cauldron heated, and after repeated summarization and practice, Su Ling Xiu's pill refining steps were now extremely proficient.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>She added the medicinal materials into the furnace, sensing the temperature of the furnace. Her hands started to rhythmically strike the furnace, the force rippling through it, her movements orderly and rhythmic.</p><p></p><p>This was the refining technique she had summarized after repeated refinements.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the refinement reached the final stage - the pill condensation stage.</p><p></p><p>"This time, it must succeed!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu clenched her delicate fists, brimming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>She opened the furnace lid, and the furnace tipped over, spilling out three pills.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong eagerly came over to take a look. On Suling Xiu's fair palm was a glossy black pill, appearing a bit uneven.</p><p></p><p>The other two pills were reddish-brown, round and smooth, with a faint fragrance wafting from them.</p><p></p><p>Success!</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, junior sister, the pill refinement has succeeded!" Xu Yan and Meng Chong excitedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, I finally succeeded!" Suling Xiu jumped up, her face flushed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>She casually tossed the failed pill to Shi Er, then excitedly ran to her master with the other two pills.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Suling Xiu succeeded in refining the pills, Li Xuan, who was sitting in the chair, saw a golden light appear.</p><p></p><p>He became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has comprehended the pill refinement technique you compiled, and successfully refined the pills. Your foundational pill refinement technique has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>An image of the pill refinement technique appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>However, this was only the foundational pill refinement technique!</p><p></p><p>"This is only the foundational pill refinement technique, meaning the pill refinement technique still has room for further improvement."</p><p></p><p>A thought suddenly occurred to Li Xuan: "That girl, my third disciple, has only comprehended the initial form of the medicinal classic and the pill refinement technique. What I obtained is the complete version. If I pass on the complete medicinal classic and foundational pill refinement technique to her, will she be able to comprehend the higher levels of the medicinal classic and pill refinement technique based on this foundation?</p><p></p><p>"If so, wouldn't I be able to repeatedly 'shear the wool' of the golden-haired sheep?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more worthwhile it seemed to try.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal classic and pill refinement technique were different from martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Since the disciple had comprehended them, the martial arts techniques he had mastered were only about realms, as the disciple had already grasped the techniques. But the medicinal classic and pill refinement technique were different - Suling Xiu had only comprehended the initial form, while he had obtained the complete version and had already reached the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>If he passed it on to the disciple, it could reduce the time the disciple needed to perfect the medicinal classic and pill refinement technique, allowing her to comprehend the higher levels faster.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps it's feasible!" Li Xuan was greatly excited. If it worked, in addition to cultivating martial arts techniques, he could continuously 'shear the wool' of the golden-haired sheep through the medicinal and martial arts methods.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu excitedly came before him, her expression joyful, the excitement barely concealed in her clear eyes.</p><p></p><p>She opened her tender white hand and said, "Master, I have successfully refined the Qi-Blood Pill."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two reddish-brown pills on her delicate palm, Li Xuan nodded approvingly and said, "Not bad, that you could comprehend the foundational pill refinement technique in such a short time makes me very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, you are truly my disciple."</p><p></p><p>Receiving her master's recognition and officially becoming his disciple, no longer to be expelled from the sect, Suling Xiu's long-held anxiety finally dissipated.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Since you have comprehended the foundational pill refinement technique, I shall demonstrate it for you today!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>It was time to display his master's prowess again.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was greatly excited at this, her master was going to refine pills!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were also filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Their master was actually going to personally refine pills?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and the pill furnace flew over.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall demonstrate for you how the foundational pill refinement technique works."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Suling Xiu stared at the furnace with bright eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Let's refine the Qi-Blood Pill."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said, then waved his hand to grab the complete list of medicinal ingredients for the Qi-Blood Pill.</p><p></p><p>Holding the furnace with his left hand, his true qi surged forth, like raging flames.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the furnace became scorching hot.</p><p></p><p>He placed the medicinal ingredients into the furnace, then sat back in the chair without even standing up.</p><p></p><p>The furnace floated in midair, the true qi circling it, spinning rapidly as the refinement began.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was utterly awestruck.</p><p></p><p>This was the foundational pill refinement technique?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she felt ashamed, as she had not even comprehended the foundational pill refinement technique.</p><p></p><p>Watching her master refine the pills, it was like flowing water and unrestrained elegance, as if he was effortlessly plucking it from thin air.</p><p></p><p>And he was doing it while sitting calmly in the chair.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were also greatly shocked. The foundational pill refinement technique was so amazing?</p><p></p><p>Then how powerful must the advanced pill refinement techniques be?</p><p></p><p>They couldn't even imagine it!</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and Zhou Ying's eyes were wide open, unable to close their mouths.</p><p></p><p>The shock in their hearts was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw the expressions of his disciples and inwardly gloated, seeing this, right?  This was the power of their master.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The furnace lid opened, and twelve pills flew out.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, catching the pills.</p><p></p><p>The round, lustrous pills emanated a rich fragrance, their quality far surpassing the pills Suling Xiu had refined.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the furnace returned to the pill stove.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand now?" He looked at Suling Xiu and asked.</p><p></p><p>"I remember the technique, but my martial arts cultivation is not yet at the level to do it like you, Master," Suling Xiu said embarrassedly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't just remember the technique, what I demonstrated for you was not just the technique, but the profound principles and Dao of pill refinement. You must comprehend the meaning, not just the form!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan emphasized solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Copying the form alone, how could she improve the pill refinement technique?</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!" Suling Xiu respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan casually gave the Qi-Blood Pills to Xu Yan, as he needed them to cultivate and give to his family.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, he was almost at the peak of his Qi-Blood, and didn't need pill assistance.</p><p></p><p>"I shall now pass on to you the foundational pill refinement technique and medicinal classic," Li Xuan said, after demonstrating his skills.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual fire stones needed for refinement were running low, so Shi Er went to urge Kou Ruozhi to get more.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was tending to the flowers Suling Xiu had planted in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the pills and returned to the East River Commandery, while Meng Chong went to the hillside to continue cultivating his swords.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair and began imparting the medicinal classic and foundational pill refinement technique to Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal classic contained many pill formulas, with the theories behind the formula combinations clearly noted, which could provide inspiration for Suling Xiu to continue comprehending the Dao of medicine.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 418</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood-red light was dazzling, and a powerful aura suddenly enveloped the area, dyeing the sky and earth crimson.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who had been carefully investigating, suddenly changed expression dramatically. The Yin-Yang Immortal Sword appeared, pulsing with endless vitality. Sword light surged forth, and a golden dragon roared.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>It was as if all techniques were unleashed at once to block this sudden attack. </p><p></p><p>At the same time, his body flew backwards, wanting to escape.</p><p></p><p>Puff! At that moment, the sword light shattered. The golden dragon also crumbled. All attacks were disintegrating. Xu Yan seemed to have suffered a massive impact. Though his retreating form accelerated, he spat out a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, today is the day you die!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo was overjoyed at this moment. His figure flashed as he pursued and attacked. His crimson long blade radiated a chilling killing intent as he slashed down again!</p><p></p><p>As for the place where the Immortal Venerable had fallen, he no longer explored it. If there was an ambush, it would have erupted to attack him by now that he had revealed himself.</p><p></p><p>Kill Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>This was a once-in-a-thousand-years opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Child Mo!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's face was extremely gloomy. He frantically slashed out sword after sword while his body continuously flew backwards, appearing quite狼狈 as if desperately trying to escape and shake off Blood Child Mo's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't kill him this time, there won't be another chance!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo felt a chill in his heart.</p><p></p><p>With his strength, he had only managed to entangle Xu Yan and prevent his escape, but was unable to kill him in one strike. How monstrous was this?</p><p></p><p>"What sword technique is this? It's too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Whether for the cooperation with Tianshadiying or for the Netherworld itself, such a peerless genius must die!</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, once he grew up, he would surely become a great threat to the Netherworld!</p><p></p><p>"You can't escape!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo's entire body was enveloped in blood light. The crimson blade light illuminated the sky, and his powerful aura shook heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to retreat frantically, wanting to escape. Sword wheels revolved around him, constantly rotating, yet seeming about to shatter. He desperately slashed out sword after sword.</p><p></p><p>"Where's Meng Chong? Did he escape?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo sneered.</p><p></p><p>A feeling of excitement at killing a peerless genius arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, don't worry about me, run quickly!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shouted loudly.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of battle, Blood Child Mo saw a figure instantly disappear into the distance - it was Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>"After I kill you, Meng Chong won't escape for more than a few days!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo suddenly transformed into a streak of blood light, his speed explosively increasing as he attacked Xu Yan. With one slash, he broke through Xu Yan's layers of sword light, as if about to kill him in the next moment!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping, who was lying in ambush, sighed in admiration. The senior brother truly lived up to his title - his acting skills were far beyond his own! He recalled how he had once pretended to be a muddleheaded fool to escape from Taikun Realm, thinking his acting skills were unparalleled. But seeing this today, he realized that while he might be good at playing a fool, his acting was far inferior to senior brother's.</p><p></p><p>"This is a true martial artist, not a brute!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he gained some understanding of the profound principles that Fourth Junior Brother had mentioned before - Master's teachings that martial artists are not brutes.</p><p></p><p>Senior brother had truly grasped the essence!</p><p></p><p>"Second Junior Brother may seem like a brute, but he's also someone skilled at improvising and scheming."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sighed. Perhaps only Third Junior Sister was a person of simple mind.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Third Junior Sister doesn't venture into the martial world. Master probably doesn't feel at ease letting her, given her relatively simple mindset!"</p><p></p><p>The one who had just escaped was actually a spirit avatar of Second Junior Brother. From such a distance and in the midst of battle, how could Blood Child Mo distinguish it? </p><p></p><p>Moreover, apart from being weaker in strength, the spirit avatar was identical to the real body, so naturally no flaws could be detected.</p><p></p><p>Now, Blood Child Mo's vigilance had decreased. He no longer needed to worry about Meng Chong's sneak attack, since Meng Chong had already fled.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Child Mo, if you want to kill me Xu Yan, you won't have an easy time either!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan halted his retreat, as if knowing he couldn't escape and preparing to fight to the death.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The Yin-Yang Immortal Sword instantly enlarged. The Mountain River Divine Image appeared, with eighteen golden dragons coiling around. In this instant, Xu Yan unleashed all his techniques.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo's expression also grew solemn. He was secretly shocked - Xu Yan's strength had become so powerful, invincible below Immortal Venerable level?!</p><p></p><p>"I admit, you're very monstrous, invincible below Immortal Venerable. But to injure me, you're still far from enough!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo coldly smiled. Blood light spread out, seeming to have an aura similar to an Immortal Venerable, at one with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I'll slay you. Great Cang shouldn't have a genius like you existing!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo stepped forward. Blood light surged, and behind him appeared a chilling blood-colored blade light. This blade light stood between heaven and earth, emanating killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze focused. He took a deep breath, and a faint light enveloped his body. At this moment, he activated the Mountain River Sacred Body. A vast light emerged from within him.</p><p></p><p>As the light spread, it manifested visions of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo was shocked. What kind of physique was this? His killing intent grew even stronger. He raised his hand and pointed, and the blood-colored blade light standing between heaven and earth slashed down.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red line appeared between heaven and earth. This line was like a wound in the world, stretching across the sky as it slashed towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan struck out palm after palm, using the True Dragon Fury technique eighteen times in succession. Then, eighteen black sword lights appeared, emanating an aura that could annihilate heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Next, layer upon layer of mountains and rivers manifested. Within the mountains and rivers, living beings wielded swords to slash.</p><p></p><p>The Undying Sword Intent fused with the mountains and rivers, reinforcing them. Golden dragons roared as well.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Xu Yan went all out. Sword of Mountains and Rivers, Heaven-Severing Sword, True Dragon Fury, Undying Sword Intent and more, including his Martial Divine Image, were all incorporated.</p><p></p><p>So many powerful techniques stacked together, instantly clashing with Blood Child Mo's slash, colliding against each other.</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo was greatly shocked. Xu Yan had actually blocked this slash of his?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, what amazed him even more was that although the mountain and river images were crumbling, they were spreading out, with even him at the edge of their range.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo coldly snorted. The blood-colored blade light grew even more dazzling. His aura surged as he raised his hand to slash forward. The blade light that had been deadlocked began to cut through mountains and rivers, cut through golden dragons, constantly approaching Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was also entangled by Xu Yan's attack.</p><p></p><p>Although it could only entangle him for one or two breaths, it showed Xu Yan's terrifying strength. And he wasn't even an Immortal Venerable!</p><p></p><p>If they fought at the same level, Blood Child Mo dared not imagine - he would probably be easily killed by the other party!</p><p></p><p>The blade light was getting closer and closer to Xu Yan. Blood was gushing from Xu Yan's mouth, as if he could barely hold on. A cold smile appeared at the corner of Blood Child Mo's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a domineering and matchless aura appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a terrifying giant was smashing down with a hand holding up the heavens!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Mo's expression changed. He let out a low roar, wanting to dodge, wanting to...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To defend, at this moment, a beam of light shone from between Xu Yan's eyebrows.</p><p></p><p>Already entangled by Xu Yan's power, in this moment under the illumination of light, Blood Son Mo only felt his power become sluggish for an instant. A brief one or two breaths was enough to change the outcome! In this moment of crisis, he only managed to manifest a layer of blood-colored shield light, wanting to withstand this strike! Boom!</p><p></p><p>The overwhelmingly violent attack smashed into his body. His physical form was cracking and collapsing. What terrified him was that this strike seemed to have grasped the weak point of his physical body, with all its power aimed at shattering his flesh.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the attacker's understanding of the physical body had reached an inconceivable level.</p><p></p><p>Poof! He couldn't help but spit out a mouthful of fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>"Want to kill..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo's expression twisted, appearing crazed. At this moment, a point of cold light appeared.</p><p></p><p>A long spear, radiating cold light, thrust over with unparalleled killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo had just slightly recovered at this moment and was about to resist this spear, when he was shocked to realize that this spear was not what the physical eye could see, but what the soul could perceive! This was a spear thrust towards the soul!</p><p></p><p>Hum! In Blood Son Mo's soul, a layer of blood membrane appeared, enveloping his soul. This was the only soul defense technique that had been passed down for entering the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The blood membrane was like paper, pierced through by the spear in one thrust into the soul. A huge wound appeared, and where the spear had pierced, the soul seemed to be dissolving.</p><p></p><p>An unprecedented intense pain surged forth. The intense pain in his soul caused his eyes to bulge out as he let out a shrill scream. All his methods for responding to crises froze for an instant at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Even though in the depths of his consciousness a strong sense of crisis emerged, constantly warning him of danger, fatal danger, that he must endure the pain and respond.</p><p></p><p>But how could one respond to a crisis in this instant when faced with unprecedented soul pain?</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A gust of fierce wind blew against his soul, tearing at it. At this moment, another violent force smashed down again, shattering his physical body. His soul seemed to have lost its support.</p><p></p><p>Poof! In the final moment, Blood Son Mo saw Meng Chong transformed into a giant, saw a spear-wielding youth whose aura was extremely strange, as if suppressing souls.</p><p></p><p>He saw the black sword light slashed down by Xu Yan that annihilated everything! At this moment, he suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>That Immortal Venerable had been killed by Xu Yan and the other two, and now they had come to ambush and kill him!</p><p></p><p>Regret welled up in his heart - he had been careless! But it was all too late!</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo died!</p><p></p><p>Turned to dust!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong panted for breath. This successive attack and assassination of an Immortal Venerable had kept his mind tense, and he had exerted all his strength. The divine ability Heaven-Shaking Earth-Shattering still consumed a great deal.</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan was slightly out of breath at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Mo's slash had been extremely powerful and domineering. He had to use all his strength not only to block this slash, but also to entangle Blood Son Mo for an instant to create an opportunity for Meng Chong to strike.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's chest heaved. The power of his Extreme Soul Martial Arts had been greatly consumed. Whether in assassinating that Immortal Venerable or killing Blood Son Mo, he had exerted all his strength and used the strongest soul-killing divine ability he currently mastered.</p><p></p><p>It was also what he had comprehended after his master's oral and demonstrative teachings.</p><p></p><p>The divine ability: Soul Slayer!</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Venerable of Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow is dead, and Blood Son Mo is also dead. Next we should leave Mount Dagai," Xu Yan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>In the Nine Mountains Realm, an Immortal Venerable had fallen, and a Blood Son of the Netherworld had fallen, both killed by them, the three disciples. When the news spread, the entire Nine Mountains Realm would be in turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps that Sky Seventeen would be unable to sit still and would have to take action personally.</p><p></p><p>With their current strength, they were no match for Sky Seventeen. If they confronted him directly, they might not even be able to kill an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>This time they had killed an Immortal Venerable against the odds, fought an exhilarating battle, and gained some insights and rewards. It was time to consolidate.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Spirit Venerable Mountain!"</p><p></p><p>Spirit Venerable Mountain had almost become Red Cat's territory. With Red Cat providing cover there, they wouldn't be discovered.</p><p></p><p>The three disciples immediately set off for Spirit Venerable Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Has a Blood Son fallen?"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerables of Mount Dagai all sensed that a being no weaker than the Immortal Realm had fallen.</p><p></p><p>Since it wasn't an Immortal Venerable of the Divine Realm, it must have been a Blood Son of the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>How much time had passed since an Immortal Venerable had fallen, and now another Blood Son had fallen? Who could have done this?</p><p></p><p>The Wan family's territory was not peaceful at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"You're saying Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and another person, the three of them joined forces to kill an Immortal Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the two clan elders, the Wan family's Immortal Venerable wore an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, that Immortal Venerable was killed by Xu Yan and the other two!"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elders' expressions still retained traces of shock, as if they were still in a dream.</p><p></p><p>"Monsters, they're truly monsters. Fortunately, our Wan family has a decent relationship with Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Wan family's Immortal Venerable felt his scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>Although it was three people joining forces, it showed just how monstrous these three were. It was simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>If they fought opponents of the same realm, wouldn't they be easily killed?</p><p></p><p>"The one who fell, could it be Blood Son Mo?"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family's Immortal Venerable thought of Blood Son Mo whom he had encountered on his way back to the clan territory. The other seemed to have been heading towards where the Immortal Venerable had fallen.</p><p></p><p>The confrontation between the Immortal Venerables of Mount Dagai had ended. An Immortal Venerable falling in the Nine Mountains Realm was an earth-shattering event.</p><p></p><p>And immediately after, news came that the fallen Immortal Venerable was from Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, who had come to assassinate Xu Yan and Meng Chong but ended up being killed instead! Xu Yan and Meng Chong had killed an Immortal Venerable against the odds!</p><p></p><p>When the news spread, the Nine Mountains Realm was shaken. Xu Yan and Meng Chong's names resounded throughout the Nine Mountains Realm!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerables of Thousand Fold Mountain and横峰 Mountain had retreated to their own territories, their hearts trembling. Xu Yan and Meng Chong could already kill Immortal Venerables? Too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>If he broke through to the Immortal Realm, how horrifying would he be?</p><p></p><p>On Spirit Venerable Mountain, Red Cat, Jade Little Dragon, and Little Ha gathered together.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of our Beast Race's supreme being!" Red Cat exclaimed proudly.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha nodded.</p><p></p><p>On 横峰 Mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong must not be allowed to live!"</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen stood up in shock.</p><p></p><p>Behind him was a man wearing a seven-leaf ferocious mask.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, Xu Yan and Meng Chong can even kill Immortal Venerables. None of the other Heaven's Bane members are their match. Even if this subordinate takes action, there may be danger."</p><p></p><p>Too frightening.</p><p></p><p>If killing one Immortal Venerable could be attributed to luck, killing Blood Son Mo right after meant that Xu Yan and Meng Chong had done it with their powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>The two of them joining forces could already kill Immortal Venerables? It was truly terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Fold Mountain and 横峰 Mountain both have grudges against Xu Yan and Meng Chong. Now that the Heavenly Abyss is peaceful, Immortal Venerables don't need to constantly guard the Heavenly Abyss. It's time they could move about and take action."</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen said with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

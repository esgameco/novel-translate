        <h1>Chapter 517</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After hearing the reason, Blood Demon was completely shocked. The appearance of Changqing Immortal actually meant such a great opportunity was waiting for him.</p><p></p><p>As a result, because his soul ultimately failed to meet the requirements, he was about to miss out.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not completely hopeless. As long as he could improve his soul to meet the conditions within a month, he could still seize this opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"At this point, I won't hide it from you. Because you were influenced by that person, you went into a demonic state and your consciousness became confused, but your soul also underwent some changes."</p><p></p><p>"I've also been looking for suitable candidates, and you have this chance. Do you understand?" Tianzi sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I understand!" Blood Demon nodded solemnly. </p><p></p><p>"Take this bottle of pills. Take one every three days. If your soul can meet the requirements within a month, you can still seize the opportunity!" Tianzi said seriously as he handed a bottle of pills to Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior. I absolutely won't disappoint you!" Blood Demon promised solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good. In a month, Changqing Immortal will come again. Make good use of this chance!" Tianzi said. Then he pointed at the large cauldron and said, "If you have perseverance and willpower, stay in the cauldron. It will help you improve faster."</p><p></p><p>He wouldn't let Blood Demon have an easy time for even a moment!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior!" Blood Demon jumped into the cauldron without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi closed the lid of the cauldron, finally revealing a mischievous smile before turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>Enduring pain as if being sliced by thousands of knives, Blood Demon's heart was burning with passion. "I must seize this opportunity. Strengthening my soul is not difficult for me. This blood soul is indeed a bit weak and should be strengthened."</p><p></p><p>The Ancestor of the Dao passed down a great technique, to be transmitted to those with affinity. Therefore, the Ancestor's disciples were all looking for suitable people for this great technique.</p><p></p><p>To cultivate this great technique, there were some requirements for one's soul.</p><p></p><p>Once one cultivated this great technique, it meant becoming a disciple of the Ancestor of the Dao. Moreover, this technique was so powerful that it could allow one to cultivate to the Realm of Establishing the Dao without any bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>And the Realm of Establishing the Dao was not the end point.</p><p></p><p>What an incredible opportunity this was! How could Blood Demon miss it? He would do everything in his power to seize it.</p><p></p><p>This was his only chance to surpass Taicang and surpass that person in the Immutable Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Once he became a powerhouse in the Realm of Establishing the Dao, or even an existence beyond that realm, that person in the Immutable Divine Palace would have to kneel down and worship him.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon's mind was filled with visions of one day sitting high on the throne of the Immutable Divine Palace, with that arrogant figure prostrating below, kowtowing and fawning on him obsequiously.</p><p></p><p>"Just you wait. When I, Blood Demon, rise up, I'll let you frogs in a well see the power of a disciple of the Ancestor of the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon directly regarded the powerhouses of the Immutable Divine Palace as frogs in a well!</p><p></p><p>Right now, Blood Demon was convinced that he would definitely become a disciple of the Ancestor of the Dao! I take pride in being a disciple of the Ancestor of the Dao!!...</p><p></p><p>Far away from the Taicang world, in an unknown distant immutable land, an ancient and majestic palace stood silently.</p><p></p><p>In front of, behind, and to the left and right of this divine palace crouched four huge and ferocious beasts. Their auras were fierce, their eyes flashing with murderous light as they gazed in all directions.</p><p></p><p>These were the true spirits of the Immutable Divine Palace, and these four true spirits were even stronger than the lords of small worlds.</p><p></p><p>The divine palace was ancient and majestic, standing silently in the chaotic immutable land. A faint aura of laws flowed around it.</p><p></p><p>Within tens of thousands of miles around the divine palace, not a single true spirit could be seen. No immutable true spirit dared to approach within ten thousand miles of the divine palace.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the divine palace was slowly moving, stirring up waves of immutable qi. Violent spiritual energy surged into the divine palace like roaring waves.</p><p></p><p>In a certain place inside the divine palace, a blood pool was bubbling. The blood in the pool rippled as bubbles burst.</p><p></p><p>Gurgle! The blood in the pool began to contract. A figure with a ferocious face, fangs protruding from its mouth, and a vicious gaze emerged from the bottom of the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>The blood flowed into its body, and the ferocious face gradually disappeared, transforming into the appearance of a middle-aged man.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the man's vicious eyes revealed excitement and fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>"The Ancestor of the Dao? What a great opportunity! I must seize it. There's no need to bother with the affairs of the Taicang world anymore."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon received the consciousness of his soul fragment and was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned for a long time to cultivate a soul fragment for countless years, using the seed from back then to guide its descent to Taicang. This was in order to obtain part of Taicang's world origin at the last moment, while also searching for any countermeasures Taicang had set up, to prevent Taicang's world from directly exploding at the last moment and causing the Immutable Divine Palace's plans to fail.</p><p></p><p>However, something unexpected happened. The soul fragment actually descended into an unknown world and possessed someone's physical body.</p><p></p><p>And this world was incredibly powerful, far beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>That Ancestor of the Dao was even more inconceivably strong. He couldn't even find words to describe how powerful the Ancestor of the Dao was.</p><p></p><p>Even more coincidentally, he encountered an extraordinary herb gatherer and had the chance to become a disciple of the Ancestor of the Dao and cultivate that great technique.</p><p></p><p>That person in the Immutable Divine Palace was not even worth an ant in front of the Ancestor of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, he couldn't miss such an opportunity!</p><p></p><p>"Strengthen the soul?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon took a deep breath. All the blood in the blood pool had already entered his body. He closed his eyes slightly and connected with his soul fragment.</p><p></p><p>Using the soul fragment as a link, he should be able to send his soul power over there!</p><p></p><p>Through the connection, he could even personally experience the pain his soul fragment was enduring. Blood Demon didn't doubt because of this, but instead became more convinced that this was a test, an initiation test from a powerful being to a weak one!</p><p></p><p>Just as he would set conditions when selecting disciples, only those who passed the threshold he set could become his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Powerful beings all have something in common."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon took a deep breath and began to circulate a secret technique, using his soul fragment as a link to transmit his soul power.</p><p></p><p>Let alone the Great Wilderness world, which was in an unknown distant place, even sending soul power to the Taicang world would not be easy. The pressure on his soul would not be small.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the amount of soul power transmitted each time would certainly not be much.</p><p></p><p>"But it's enough!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon firmly believed that as he transmitted soul power every day to strengthen his soul fragment, he would surely be able to meet the qualifying conditions within the agreed time.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A faint blood light rippled, and a wave of soul power was transmitted using the soul fragment as a guide.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Demon felt tremendous pressure. After this wave of soul power was transmitted, it continuously weakened. By the end, he even lost connection with it, until his soul fragment received the soul power, confirming it had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>However, through the soul fragment's perception, when this wave of soul power was transmitted, the soul fragment only received less than one-tenth of it.</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly is the Great Wilderness world? The transmission of soul power consumes so much."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The soul fragment only received one-tenth of the transmitted soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Continue!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was not discouraged at all. Although the blood soul could only receive one-tenth each time, slowly accumulating would be enough for the blood soul to strengthen and improve to meet the requirements.</p><p></p><p>"It can only be strengthened threefold at most, otherwise the soul fragment's essence will be unable to bear it</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Incessantly, and it's also easy to leak and be spied upon."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon thought silently, but even if it could only be enhanced threefold, it would be enough to meet the conditions. In the distant Immortal Palace, as Blood Demon was transmitting his soul power, Su Lingxiu had already returned to Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>After explaining her plan to trick Blood Demon to her master, she said, "Master, I'm going to capture Blood Extreme's remaining soul fragment to see if we can replicate the Heaven-Opening Purple Light pill."</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, but added a reminder, "Illusions can sometimes be very useful. They can confuse one's perception, consciousness and thinking."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu paused, pondering this. "But what kind of illusion could fool Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled meaningfully and said, "When inside and outside align, perception and consciousness can naturally be altered."</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration struck Su Lingxiu, and she had some ideas. She said happily, "Thank you, Master. I have some thoughts now. I'll discuss with Tianzi to come up with a feasible approach."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and looked up at the sky. Blood Demon was transmitting his soul power over, using blood essence as a conduit to bypass the laws of the Taicang realm, but he still couldn't escape Li Xuan's notice. </p><p></p><p>Of course, he couldn't escape Tianzi's notice either.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu bid farewell to her master and prepared to set off for the Taikun realm. This was her first time leaving the Qinghua realm since arriving in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, you're going to the Taikun realm?" Jiang Buping had just made a breakthrough, and when he heard Su Lingxiu was preparing to go to the Taikun realm to capture Blood Extreme's remaining soul fragment, he came over.</p><p></p><p>"I'm familiar with the Taikun realm. Let me accompany you, Senior Sister."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Junior Brother." Su Lingxiu nodded happily.</p><p></p><p>After saying goodbye to their master, Su Lingxiu and Jiang Buping immediately set off for the Taikun realm to capture Blood Extreme's remaining soul fragment.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the Nine Mountains realm.</p><p></p><p>The red cat came scampering over eagerly, offering various divine herbs it had collected.</p><p></p><p>"Red cat, you're quite impressive now." Su Lingxiu rubbed the red cat's head.</p><p></p><p>"Here, these are for you!" She gave the red cat several bottles of pills and said, "These should be able to enhance the strength of your demon soldiers and generals."</p><p></p><p>Passing through the Nine Mountains realm and heading towards the Taikun realm, Jiang Buping couldn't help but marvel at how much the divine realm had changed. It was no longer like it was in the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Back then, it was rare to even encounter an Immortal Venerable when traveling through the divine realm. Now they could meet several Heaven Unity realm cultivators, and Immortal realm cultivators were common.</p><p></p><p>Every ambitious cultivator was actively seizing this opportunity of great changes in heaven and earth, seeking fortune and trying their best to improve their strength.</p><p></p><p>The Taikun realm was one of the great realms of the divine world. Originally, the Jiang family of Taikun did not rule over the entire Taikun realm. But with the descent of the Taikun Supreme Being from the Dao realm, now all the forces in the entire Taikun realm had become affiliated with the Jiang family!</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Jiang Buping arrived in the Taikun realm and began searching for the location of that soul fragment according to Blood Extreme's directions.</p><p></p><p>The place where Blood Extreme was originally imprisoned was in the wilderness of the Taikun realm, but the original wilderness had changed with the shifts in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The wilderness was no longer desolate, but had grown vegetation, including some spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>As they arrived at the former wilderness, more and more low-level cultivators from the Taikun realm came to search for spiritual herbs, and the wilderness gradually became lively.</p><p></p><p>Small towns had even been established.</p><p></p><p>"It should be roughly in this direction. Even if there have been changes, they shouldn't be too big. Blood Extreme's soul fragment is hidden very deeply, and may have already escaped its confinement," Su Lingxiu said, looking into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that the Jiang family's Supreme Being hasn't found Blood Extreme's soul fragment yet means it has likely broken free of its restraints and gone into hiding," Jiang Buping said with a smile. "Don't worry, Senior Sister. As long as the soul fragment is still here, it won't be hard to find. It will just take a bit more time. With my abilities, a mere soul fragment can't escape my notice."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu giggled and said, "Junior Brother, you're underestimating your Senior Sister. Although I don't often fight with others, these eyes of mine are quite formidable. Blood Extreme's soul fragment can't escape my Little Heavenly Dao Eyes."</p><p></p><p>The two continued on their way, occasionally encountering some cultivators gathering herbs.</p><p></p><p>"That's a Divine Venerable realm cultivator," Su Lingxiu said, looking at a cultivator flying by in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Jiang family's Supreme Being is getting anxious and has Divine Venerable cultivators searching for Blood Extreme now."</p><p></p><p>They continued on, getting close to Blood Extreme's hiding place.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure descended before them.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was a Divine Venerable realm cultivator, waving a folding fan in his hand. He wore white robes and had a pale, beardless face with somewhat handsome features, though he gave off the impression of someone who had overindulged in carnal pleasures.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Divine Venerable's eyes showed a look of surprise as he stared at Su Lingxiu, examining her. The more he looked, the more delighted he became, his Adam's apple bobbing.</p><p></p><p>"I am the White-Robed Divine Venerable from the Dao realm. Would the young lady be willing to accompany me and return with me to the Dao realm?"</p><p></p><p>The White-Robed Divine Venerable's manner was rather frivolous as he stared at Su Lingxiu without blinking.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's expression darkened. "Get lost!"</p><p></p><p>"The young lady has quite a temper. I like it, I like it very much. I, the White-Robed Divine Venerable, have traveled the Dao realm and met many beauties, but none can compare to you.</p><p></p><p>"Young lady, your aura is like the spirit of plants and trees, like the morning dew at dawn, pure and flawless. It's truly wonderful, truly the best I've seen in my life. Since we've had the fortune to meet, you should come with me..."</p><p></p><p>The White-Robed Divine Venerable closed his fan, his face still beaming with a bright smile. The more he looked at Su Lingxiu, the more delighted he became, his Adam's apple constantly bobbing.</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, Su Lingxiu had already grabbed an iron shovel and charged at him.</p><p></p><p>"Your grandma hasn't buried anyone in a long time. Today I'll bury a Divine Venerable to scratch that itch!"</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>Before the White-Robed Divine Venerable could react, his head was struck by an iron shovel. His whole body fell to the ground, his head buzzing and his soul shaking.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>The White-Robed Divine Venerable was shocked. He had kicked an iron plate!</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu swung the shovel again with a clang, smashing it onto the White-Robed Divine Venerable's head. Then her hands flew as she dug a large pit in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Her speed and skill at digging left Jiang Buping dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"Think you're so great as a Divine Venerable? I'll bury you today!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu reached down and grabbed the White-Robed Divine Venerable on the ground, throwing him into the large pit.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the White-Robed Divine Venerable was shaking his head, starting to come to his senses. Just as he raised his head, he saw an iron shovel coming down.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to resist, but his soul was still reeling and he couldn't fight back at all.</p><p></p><p>Clang! Clang! Clang!</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu alternated between shoveling dirt and smashing the White-Robed Divine Venerable with the shovel. With each handful of dirt, the White-Robed Divine Venerable would cry out in agony. His soul suffered immense pain, as if part of it was being stripped away and dissipating into heaven and earth with each falling clod of soil! At this point, he panicked and wanted to beg for mercy, but he didn't have any chance to do so.</p><p></p><p>The iron shovel kept clanging down, the dirt kept falling handful by handful, his soul kept being stripped away. Apart from screaming, he couldn't make any other sound.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 30</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 30: One Should Wholeheartedly Devote Oneself to the Great Cause of the Martial Way</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pondering whether he should compose two more verses of the Qi-Blood Realm cultivation technique to replace the previous four, so that Xu Yan could ponder and comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>"If it can be connected to the Qi-Blood Realm, it would make it easier for the disciple to ponder and comprehend." </p><p></p><p>However, the four verses had already been passed down. Should he find an excuse to tell Xu Yan that those four verses were not suitable for him, and thus replace them with a new set of techniques?</p><p></p><p>If he did so, wouldn't it make him, the reclusive master, appear to lack understanding of his disciple's talents?</p><p></p><p>"I should wait a bit longer. If Xu Yan fails to ponder and comprehend the true meaning of the martial way from them, I'll give him the new techniques when he comes to me for guidance.</p><p></p><p>"But will that not dampen the disciple's faith?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this disciple was truly difficult to teach.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly.</p><p></p><p>A faint golden glow emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has comprehended the techniques you composed, and derived the true meaning of the martial way from them. You have obtained the cultivation technique of the Qi-Blood Realm, and your strength has increased exponentially..."</p><p></p><p>In that instant, </p><p></p><p>the cultivation technique of the Qi-Blood Realm appeared in Li Xuan's mind, and his Qi and Blood surged, doubling in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes widened, his heart racing excitedly: "My foolish disciple is truly amazing, to be able to ponder and comprehend the true meaning of the martial way like this? This Qi-Blood Realm cultivation technique, while not completely unrelated to the techniques, is still lightyears away from them...</p><p></p><p>"Goodness, what kind of brain does he have, to be able to ponder and comprehend this level of martial truth and cultivation technique?"</p><p></p><p>He could not help but be impressed.</p><p></p><p>This disciple was truly prodigious.</p><p></p><p>The golden fingertip provided feedback a second time, further increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>However, after the golden fingertip's feedback, its trace disappeared once more, as if it had never existed.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the golden fingertip only appears when my disciple successfully cultivates the techniques I fabricated."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether the golden fingertip had other avenues to explore remained to be seen.</p><p></p><p>For now, properly teaching this disciple Xu Yan, and guiding him to continuously strengthen his cultivation, was the top priority.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, your ability to comprehend the techniques in this time is commendable. Remain humble and diligent in your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan approached Xu Yan with a leisurely stride, as if he could see through his disciple at a glance, speaking with a hint of satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought inwardly: "Master's insight is truly remarkable, he saw through my comprehension of the techniques at a glance!"</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, is your resolve in the martial way unwavering?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, my resolve in the martial way is as firm as a rock!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan replied with determined eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Does your heart harbor thoughts of women?"</p><p></p><p>"My heart is free of women!"</p><p></p><p>"Good! Very good! My disciple, with such resolve in the martial way, you will one day reach the peak of the martial path!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Good disciple, you should wholeheartedly devote yourself to the great cause of the martial way, and not be distracted by women, for the martial way alone is the righteous path!</p><p></p><p>I am counting on you, my disciple!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted by his disciple's martial resolve.</p><p></p><p>Since comprehending the Qi-Blood Realm techniques, Xu Yan's strength had been increasing daily, though he was still far from the great accomplishment of the Qi-Blood Hundred Zhang.</p><p></p><p>Yet in just half a month, Xu Yan's Qi and Blood had already reached the Ten Zhang level!</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have been away from home for a long time. I wish to return home briefly to visit my parents."</p><p></p><p>One day, Xu Yan respectfully requested, thinking that he had been away from home for too long, and his parents must be worried.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he sighed.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Sighing, I have been here for a long time, but I have not left the small village yet. It's about time I leave this remote place.</p><p></p><p>I should go out and experience the customs and styles of this world.</p><p></p><p>I should go see the scenery of the Qi Kingdom, and experience the charm of the Qi jianghu (martial arts world). At the same time, I should see if it is truly as Xu Yan said, that the power levels are so low.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who has just entered the Qi Blood Realm, can kill a top jianghu expert with just one breath. As for myself, who has fully mastered the Qi Blood Realm, could I not just kill them with a single glare?</p><p></p><p>Is the power level in this world truly so shockingly low?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of Xu Yan's fierce battle with the fire-maned wolf, and based on that, the power level in this world should not be so low.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps there are some hidden secrets that even someone with Xu Yan's background cannot access?</p><p></p><p>After seeing Xu Yan off, Li Xuan leisurely returned, his hands behind his back.</p><p></p><p>Next time Xu Yan comes back, it will be time to leave this place. Of course, the tiring task of moving house will be left to his disciple.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the East River Prefecture, the hot topic on the streets, in the teahouses and inns, is the news that the cargo of the wealthy Xu family has been robbed by bandits.</p><p></p><p>"What bandits would dare to rob the Xu family's cargo?"</p><p></p><p>"It's because the Xu family's young master has just been rejected by the Great General, so the Xu family's prestige has plummeted, making them a target."</p><p></p><p>"Although the young master of the wealthy Xu family has been rejected by the General's mansion, the Xu family has a powerful backer - the Censor-in-Chief of the current dynasty."</p><p></p><p>The influential figures in the East River Prefecture are all discussing this matter privately.</p><p></p><p>In the Xu family's reception hall, Xu Junhe sits solemnly at the head, looking at the group of people below and says, "Where did these bandits come from? This cargo must be delivered as scheduled, or they will have to pay three times the compensation!"</p><p></p><p>"Chen Biaotou, Wang Guanzhu, you two will personally escort the cargo to Jingan. You must ensure the cargo is delivered as scheduled."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe looks at the two burly men below.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, we will deliver the cargo as scheduled. As for the bandits, we have our own ways to deal with them," Chen Biaotou says with a cupped fist salute.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nods, makes some other arrangements, then dismisses them.</p><p></p><p>Chen Biaotou and Wang Guanzhu are the head of the largest escort agency and the head of the largest martial arts school in the East River Prefecture, respectively. Both of them are top jianghu experts who have cultivated internal energy.</p><p></p><p>With these two in charge, the cargo should be able to be delivered as scheduled.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Junhe has some hidden worries about the buyer of this cargo.</p><p></p><p>He has become the wealthiest man in the East River Prefecture, and has even married the daughter of the current Censor-in-Chief, the former Prefect of East River. He is no ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The fact that this cargo was robbed by bandits, and his request for help from the East River Great General was rejected, makes Xu Junhe realize that he is being targeted.</p><p></p><p>And this force targeting him originates from the Qi imperial capital, Jingan!</p><p></p><p>Aware of the grave situation, Xu Junhe decisively mobilized his two major forces to ensure the cargo is delivered, not giving the enemy any excuse to attack.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's not what I'm thinking," Xu Junhe sighs.</p><p></p><p>Back in the rear courtyard, Lady Xu is worriedly saying, "My lord, Yan'er has been away from home for a long time, what if something has happened to him?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Lady, Yan'er will be fine," Xu Junhe replies, a bit troubled. His foolish son has never been sensible, and it's been three months since he left with no news.</p><p></p><p>What Xu Junhe is most worried about is that his foolish son has been captured and taken hostage, which would be the most fatal outcome.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Junhe is worrying about his foolish son, Xu Yan is riding a horse, traveling on the official road, and is on his way back to the East River Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"The foolish son of the Xu family? Hehe, I've found you!" A sinister voice suddenly sounds, and two figures block Xu Yan's path.</p>

        <h1>Chapter 307</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The five geniuses of the Qianwu Palace stared with wide eyes, their faces filled with disbelief, as four additional Xu Yan suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>The four were positioned in the four directions, seemingly forming a certain pattern, yet also fitting a profound mystery.</p><p></p><p>Originally, it was five against one, with the advantage on their side, but in the blink of an eye, it had become one-on-one?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was five people against five Xu Yans!</p><p></p><p>"You, you, you..." the young man holding the sword stammered, unable to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Just a small trick, no need to be so surprised," the five Xu Yans spoke in unison.</p><p></p><p>A small trick?!</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan spoke, he couldn't help but ponder for a moment. This was the first time he had manifested the divine elemental incarnations, so he was still a bit unfamiliar. Therefore, when the original body spoke, the incarnations spoke simultaneously as well.</p><p></p><p>He thought for a moment and said, "There's no need to be so surprised. This is the profundity of the Dao of martial arts. While it may seem like five of me, in reality, it is just one me. The other four are merely incarnations of my power."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke calmly, wanting to open the eyes of these frog-in-the-well cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This time, when he spoke, it was the original body speaking, while the other four incarnations remained silent.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I, Xu Yan, have come to let the Qianwu Palace, this self-righteous and aloof Spiritual Sect, witness the profundity of the Dao of martial arts, so that they may no longer be limited in their vision, thinking their geniuses are so noble, when in my eyes, they are but insignificant."</p><p></p><p>One of the incarnations spoke indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Strike now, and let them witness what a sword formation is!" another incarnation continued.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were all dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The five young men with swords and spears took a few deep breaths, calming their shocked hearts. Gritting their teeth, they let out a furious roar, "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>This battle was inevitable!</p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Yan had displayed such a wondrous technique, they had no reason to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"This is just an illusion, able to deceive others, but a mere illusory art cannot fool us!" the young man with the spear shouted angrily, unleashing a strike.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, trying to deceive us with illusions is simply laughable!" the young man with the fist gloves also said.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew this was not an illusion, they could only self-assure themselves in this way, bolstering their confidence and dispelling the fear deep within their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"So, it's an illusion, but this illusion is truly too powerful."</p><p></p><p>"You startled me for a moment, I thought there was such a wondrous technique."</p><p></p><p>The martial artists, upon hearing this, sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it was because of the distance, they couldn't see that this was not an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Although many felt that this was likely not an illusion, they didn't voice it, only furrowing their brows in silence.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Elders knitted their brows. Was this an illusion?</p><p></p><p>Even if it was an illusion, to be able to deceive so convincingly was an extremely profound technique.</p><p></p><p>"It should be an illusion, right? I've never heard of such a wondrous technique," one of the Elders said, seemingly trying to reassure himself.</p><p></p><p>The others remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Boom! "An illusion?" Xu Yan chuckled lightly. "Self-delusion, is it? You all strike now, or you'll never get the chance!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" The five struck.</p><p></p><p>The auras intertwined, the martial arts converged, and five powerful attacks were unleashed. In the blink of an eye, they coordinated their second wave of attacks.</p><p></p><p>This combination attack technique indeed had its unique merits.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>"Combination attack technique, nothing special!" Xu Yan chuckled lightly. One incarnation unleashed a sword strike, the dragon's roar resounding. Another incarnation, the sword light crashing down like thunderbolts.</p><p></p><p>Shifting their positions, the sword lights were fierce, sweeping across the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"This is a sword formation, watch closely!"</p><p></p><p>The five sword lights, in a manner that the martial artists could not comprehend, crossed and intertwined. In an instant, the sword lights became even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>Blocking all retreat routes, sealing all spaces, only the crisscrossing sword lights remained, each with a different killing intent.</p><p></p><p>It was as if five people were wielding five different sword arts.</p><p></p><p>With a crisp sound, the sword lights clashed, the figures shifting positions, instantly severing the combination attack of the Qianwu Palace geniuses, breaking their intertwined auras.</p><p></p><p>In this way, it became Xu Yan alone, surrounding the five of them, rather than them surrounding Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!" The observing martial artists were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it no longer seemed like the five Qianwu Palace geniuses were attacking Xu Yan, but rather each of them was facing the attacks of five Xu Yans. This was the sword formation? So inconceivable and profound.</p><p></p><p>"The combination attack of the Qianwu Palace seems so weak, no, all the Spiritual Sects' combination attacks are weak before this sword formation.</p><p></p><p>"This is Xu Yan alone, using some wondrous technique to divide himself into four, and then unleashing this sword formation.</p><p></p><p>"If it were five different people forming this sword formation, how would it be?" Cui Huayu was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>This sword formation technique completely overwhelmed the combination attack techniques of the Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Yaru also furrowed her brows, becoming increasingly curious about Xu Yan's mysterious master at this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Xu Yan's master is the legendary Celestial Venerable? No, even the legendary Celestial Venerable doesn't seem to have such wondrous techniques," Yaru pondered.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued, the profundity of the sword formation constantly unfolding. The five Qianwu Palace geniuses could no longer coordinate their attacks.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were hard-pressed to defend, constantly facing the risk of losing their lives.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Xu Yan was not using his full strength to instantly slay the five, but rather using them to demonstrate the essence of the sword formation to the outside world.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Elders had grim expressions.</p><p></p><p>The combination attack technique, under this sword formation, was so utterly weak.</p><p></p><p>"Have Wu Yuanzhun prepare to act," the Qianwu Palace Master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>This battle had no surprises left.</p><p></p><p>Those five were doomed to lose.</p><p></p><p>Even at this moment, he had doubts in his heart. Even if the Celestial Artifact Cold Absolute Knife wielded by Wu Yuanzhun was used, could it truly heavily injure or even kill Xu Yan? Wu Yuanzhun, after all, was not an apex expert.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, the Qianwu Palace Master ordered again, "Have the Elders seek an opportunity to annihilate Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder and the others were startled. The Palace Master actually thought that even Wu Yuanzhun could not heavily injure, let alone kill, Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, with Wu Yuanzhun wielding a Celestial Artifact, can Xu Yan really withstand it?" the Saber Elder asked, disbelief written on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Has Xu Yan truly used his full strength?" the Qianwu Palace Master asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder was taken aback. That's right, Xu Yan had never truly used his full strength, always appearing to be at ease.</p><p></p><p>"I understand," the Saber Elder nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, Xu Yan was using his divine elemental incarnations to unleash the sword formation. At this moment, he had gained some new insights.</p><p></p><p>He was currently using the Qianwu Palace geniuses to validate his own realizations.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the sword formation quietly underwent a change.</p><p></p><p>One of the incarnations was wielding the Sword Intent of Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>Another incarnation was wielding the Sword Intent of the Gentle Wind.</p><p></p><p>And the third...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The manifestation of the fourth avatar was the interweaving and alternating of the Mountain River Sword Intent and the Gentle Wind Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>The fourth avatar was currently attempting to fuse the Mountain River Sword Intent and the Gentle Wind Sword Intent into one.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's main body, with his eyes slightly narrowed, had the spiritual energy of the heavens and earth around him transform into invisible swords.</p><p></p><p>The aftershocks of the battle had also transformed into swords.</p><p></p><p>He even wanted to transform the incoming attacks into his own swords, but the difficulty was too great.</p><p></p><p>He could not achieve it.</p><p></p><p>"In the Heart Sword Realm, I have a sword in my heart, able to transform all things in heaven and earth into swords; if I have the intent of a sword in my heart, can I not also transform it into the desired sword intent?</p><p></p><p>"Whether it is the Mountain River Sword Intent or the Gentle Wind Sword Intent, they are both insights I have attained.</p><p></p><p>"Since they are sword intents within my heart, why can I not transform them into other sword intents? The wind blowing the mountains and rivers, the rippling waves, the flowing water..."</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the fourth avatar thrust out a sword, the sword intent flowing and soft, without any signs of killing, even having a gentle, watery quality.</p><p></p><p>However, in an instant, the young man holding the sword felt as if he had fallen into water, into raging waves, a terrifying yet invisible force, seemingly soft yet containing a dreadful killing power.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>He let out an angry roar, pouring all his strength into a single slash to break through the soft yet deadly sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a smile. Although he was still far from being able to freely transform his sword intent, his sword dao realm had advanced, reaching the pinnacle of the Heart Sword Realm!</p><p></p><p>He was only one step away from the complete Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Wise Sword Realm, it is too profound, I still have no clue about it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed. He had not yet fully comprehended the Heart Sword Realm himself, let alone gained insights into the even more mysterious Wise Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The five geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall knew that if they continued fighting, their defeat was certain.</p><p></p><p>They could only go all-out in a final desperate attempt.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a murderous aura emerged.</p><p></p><p>A blood-red killing intent surged out from the five of them, fusing together into an even more terrifying killing intent.</p><p></p><p>This burning life-sacrificing killing intent seemed to contain the powers and killing intents of five different martial arts, five layers of terrifying killing intent!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed. This killing intent was much stronger than the previous five, and the fusion of the five killing intents made it even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>He could not afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! The avatar of the Spiritual Origin returned to his main body, his strength returning to its peak state.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing the long sword, the Mountain River Sword Intent and the Gentle Wind Sword Intent merged together, the mountain and river layering upon each other, as if thousands of cultivators were wielding swords and slashing down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blood-red killing intent collided with the sword light, the sword light rippling in all directions, the blood-red killing intent also constantly undulating, locked in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>The powerful aftershocks had already destroyed the five geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall, reducing them to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists stared wide-eyed at the scene on the battlefield, the sword light surging like raging waves, seemingly unable to overcome the blood-red killing intent.</p><p></p><p>But the blood-red killing intent gradually began to dim.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, the sword light became soft and gentle, like a flowing stream, weak and feeble, yet it was this weak and feeble stream that prevented the blood-red killing intent from advancing, and it continued to dissipate until it vanished completely.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had won again. What would happen to the Thousand Martial Hall next? Would the geniuses still remain hidden? All the martial artists, including the powerful experts from the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families, looked towards the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Spiritual Origin Sect, could it really not produce a genius to compete with Xu Yan? This was no longer just a matter for the Thousand Martial Hall, it had even involved the honor of the Spiritual Origin Sects. If they were suppressed by a mere wandering cultivator, how could the Spiritual Sects still look down upon the world and the common cultivators?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood holding his sword, the sword light extending hundreds of feet, arrogantly pointing towards the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Does the Thousand Martial Hall have any geniuses daring to come and fight?"</p><p></p><p>The sword light extending hundreds of feet, directly challenging and provoking the Thousand Martial Hall. Could the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall still remain hidden?</p><p></p><p>If that were the case, it would truly be as Xu Yan had said, that they were all mere nobodies.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are just a common wandering cultivator, yet you dare to be so arrogant. If my senior brothers were not in seclusion, they would have long since suppressed you!"</p><p></p><p>A voice came from the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall, and a figure stepped out.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying aura of a blade surged up from him.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists looked over, and their faces instantly turned pale with shock.</p><p></p><p>The genius of the Thousand Martial Hall had made his move, and he was even directly using a divine artifact?</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, from his words, they learned that the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall had been in seclusion, unable to respond, which was why they had not appeared until now.</p><p></p><p>"This is... Could it be the Thousand Martial Hall's Wu Yuan?"</p><p></p><p>Someone whispered.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Ji said in disdain.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall had actually let Wu Yuan use a divine artifact, although it was not bullying the weak, it was still somewhat shameless.</p><p></p><p>However, in the competition of geniuses, there were no restrictions on what weapons they could use, so the Thousand Martial Hall's actions did not violate any rules.</p><p></p><p>"That Wu Yuan is going to get himself killed?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>As a true disciple of the Spiritual Origin Sect, he naturally understood the price Wu Yuan would have to pay to unleash the power of the divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong frowned, looking at Xu Yan, the young man still showed no signs of panic, but his expression had become noticeably more serious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression grew more grave. He had also recognized the person who had appeared as the genius of the Thousand Martial Hall mentioned in the small notebook given to him by the Elder of the Wood Clan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yuan had appeared, and he was even using a divine artifact of the Spiritual Origin Sect.</p><p></p><p>The blade light surging into the sky, the power of the divine artifact was not to be underestimated!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, take my strike, and if you do not die, I will consider you the victor. Ten years from now, when my senior brothers emerge from seclusion, we will have another competition!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Yuan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>He had to provide a reason for a possible defeat, so that the Thousand Martial Hall would not be completely without a way out.</p><p></p><p>He was telling everyone present that it was not because the Thousand Martial Hall lacked geniuses or those who could suppress Xu Yan, but rather that they were in seclusion and unable to come out and fight.</p><p></p><p>The final victory in the competition of geniuses could only be determined in the end!</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>A terrifying killing intent surged from Wu Yuan, but it was not the blood-red kind, it seemed to be a cold, icy killing intent that flowed into the blade.</p><p></p><p>The chilling blade light was reflected in front of the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Even from the distance, all the martial artists felt a chill run down their spines, as if a cold blade was placed against their necks.</p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The closer martial artists, their faces changing, hastily retreated a distance.</p><p></p><p>"Frigid Blade!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's expression grew grave.</p><p></p><p>One of the divine artifacts of the Thousand Martial Hall, its killing power was extremely strong, usually wielded by the Blade Elder.</p><p></p><p>For Wu Yuan to use this divine artifact, he must have received the Blade Elder's support. Even cultivators who had refined a strand of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth would find it difficult to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>"Does Xu Yan have a divine artifact?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu looked at Xu Yan, starting to feel a lack of confidence. Even if Xu Yan had a divine artifact, with his current realm, he might not be able to unleash its full power to resist Wu Yuan's strike.</p><p></p><p>"I hope it's just a severe injury, as long as he doesn't die, he'll have a chance to recover."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he was from the Spiritual Origin Sect and not on the same side as Xu Yan, he had developed a sense of admiration for this genius, and did not wish to see him die under this strike.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 64: Clearing Out the Imperial Treasury</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi rarely relaxed himself, and was currently resting in the chambers of a certain imperial concubine.</p><p></p><p>A eunuch hurriedly rushed in.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi asked sternly.</p><p></p><p>Ever since Xu Yan had forcefully arrived in the capital, the majestic imperial aura of Emperor Qi had been greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Even the common people felt that Emperor Qi was not as formidable as before, and their reverence for him had greatly diminished.</p><p></p><p>The court officials felt the same way! </p><p></p><p>Only in front of this group of eunuchs could Emperor Qi fully display his imperial might.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, Young Master Xu..."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch averted his gaze, hesitating.</p><p></p><p>"What about Xu Yan? Speak!" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi's expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu... he has cleared out the imperial treasury..."</p><p></p><p>The eunuch said with his head bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Cleared it out... cleared it out..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi's head buzzed, and he covered his chest with one hand as the muscles on his face twitched.</p><p></p><p>"I said, take whatever you like! </p><p></p><p>But I didn't mean for you to clear it out completely, you brat Xu Yan! You really have no courtesy at all!"</p><p></p><p>After taking a few deep breaths, Emperor Qi calmed his agitated heart and his expression returned to normal.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan likes it, so be it, let him take it all... Go tell Xu Yan that if he's missing anything, he can go to the national treasury and take whatever he likes!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi waved his hand generously.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>After the eunuch left.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi took a deep breath and ordered, "Go, tell the imperial kitchen to cook me some nine-leaf ganoderma to replenish my body!"</p><p></p><p>I must replenish my body, I almost fainted just now, my body is still too weak! </p><p></p><p>For the sake of the Qi Kingdom, I should reduce my visits to the harem in the future, can't let my body be depleted!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi gritted his teeth and made a firm decision.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a eunuch came running back.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty... the nine-leaf ganoderma is gone!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi immediately flew into a rage: "What? You servants dare to deceive me? Do you think I don't know there are a few more stored in the treasury?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan has powerful martial arts, so he doesn't take me seriously, but how dare these servants?</p><p>Are they trying to rebel?</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi was furious beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>"Bring him here, execute him!"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch immediately knelt down: "Your Majesty, please spare him, the nine-leaf ganoderma has already been taken by Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi:...</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand wearily, letting the eunuch leave.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi looked up at the sky: "Is this retribution because I've levied too many taxes and killed too many? But the real tyrants in history never had such retribution. Heaven is so unfair!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan naturally didn't know that Emperor Qi was now in the palace lamenting his misfortune. After clearing out the treasures he fancied from the treasury, Emperor Qi even had someone convey the message that if it's not enough, he can go to the national treasury and take whatever he likes.</p><p></p><p>"The old Emperor Qi is quite generous." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's goodwill towards Emperor Qi increased a bit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan brought back two large carriages full of treasures from the palace. Guo Rongshan's mouth twitched, his own grandson really has no courtesy at all.</p><p></p><p>Since he has already brought them back, there's no reason to return them.</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I'm going back to Donghe Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said he was ready to leave.</p><p></p><p>"The affairs of Donghe Prefecture, just let your father handle them, it won't get messed up, and this Qi Kingdom won't get messed up either."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan thought for a moment and said, "As long as the people of the Heavenly Mother Sect don't rebel, they can be used. If they do rebel, they should be killed. It's not a good thing for the Qi Kingdom to be in chaos."</p><p></p><p>His reputation among the people was that of a great sage, so he had to do something to maintain his image.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother Sect members are not all lunatics, and their believers are scattered throughout the Qi, Wu, and even the Northern Barbarian Kingdoms, with good intelligence networks that can be utilized. Your father knows how to make use of the Heavenly Mother Sect's information transmission and intelligence gathering capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan thought for a while, his son-in-law was a capable person, and he knew how to utilize the Heavenly Mother Sect's intelligence for his own benefit.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Grandpa. I understand," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, can ordinary people cultivate this martial dao technique?" Guo Rongshan asked with a hint of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, I'll have to ask my master," Xu Yan scratched his head.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, you go ask him."</p><p></p><p>"I understand."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan needed to take some of the treasures from the Qi Emperor's treasury back to the Eastern River Commandery to give to his master.</p><p></p><p>The nine-leaf spirit herbs and other precious medicinal ingredients, as well as some valuable paintings and precious jade, were all things he had to take with him.</p><p></p><p>That night, Xu Yan was cultivating in his small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>His qi and blood were surging, continuously growing stronger. As for the innate realm technique, Xu Yan felt that he was just missing a key breakthrough to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>With his cultivation, Xu Yan felt that he was not far from fully entering the qi and blood realm. The breakthrough would come in the next two or three days.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had left the capital, and the Qi Emperor heaved a sigh of relief. The ministers also breathed a sigh of relief. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's existence had been like a huge mountain pressing down on them, as if it could collapse and crush them at any moment! </p><p></p><p>Now that Xu Yan had left, it was as if the mountain had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Prince's mansion remained lofty and powerful. Guo Rongshan, the Prince's uncle and Grand Chancellor, the Crown Prince's tutor, still held high status and authority. Even though the ministers were dissatisfied in their hearts, they did not dare voice any objections.</p><p></p><p>The imperial treasury had been emptied by Xu Yan. The Qi Emperor directly confronted the ministers, ordering them to contribute treasures to the palace. Whoever dared not to, would be dismissed from office and have their property confiscated!</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, the court had already changed due to Xu Yan's involvement.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan remained silent. His own grandson had emptied the Qi Emperor's treasury, so the Qi Emperor would have to replenish it somehow.</p><p></p><p>The fastest and most direct way was to take from the ministers.</p><p></p><p>The ministers cursed inwardly, but they had no choice but to hand over their possessions.</p><p></p><p>After all, they still needed the power and influence of the court officials to seek out high-level cultivators. Without their status as court ministers, how could they recruit guards or find powerful experts?</p><p></p><p>In the Eastern River Commandery, at the Xu family estate, Xu Junhe was entertaining Jiang Pingshan and Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>He smiled and said, "Yan'er will be back soon. The position of Eastern River Commandery Governor is vacant, do you two have any recommendations?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan glanced at Kou Ruozhi and said, "The Eastern River Commandery is ultimately a commandery of the Qi Kingdom, so Master Xu must be cautious in his choice of personnel."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi raised his brow and sneered, "The Eastern River Commandery is the Xu family's Eastern River Commandery. What does it have to do with the Qi Kingdom? What does it have to do with the old Qi Emperor? Master Xu's decision is none of the Qi Emperor's business!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Pingshan's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>He fell silent. It was clear that Kou Ruozhi was prepared to ally with the Xu family, and had already expressed his stance. And the fact that the Eastern River Commandery belonged to the Xu family was beyond doubt.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe continued to smile calmly and said, "As for the security of the Eastern River Commandery, Brother Jiang will still need to put in more effort. The Eastern River General's Mansion will still be the General's Mansion."</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master Xu. Just give the order, and it will be done!" Jiang Pingshan cupped his fists.</p><p></p><p>He felt somewhat gloomy in his heart. Originally, this was his in-law's family, and Xu Yan was his son-in-law. But now, with one misstep, the situation had become vastly different.</p><p></p><p>"There is already someone selected for the Eastern River Commandery Governor position. Kou Ruozhi, you can be a secretary, a secretary of the Xu Mansion. As the strategist of the Heaven Mother Sect, you should understand my intentions," Xu Junhe said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Kou Ruozhi said, a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>But he also knew that the Heaven Mother Sect was ultimately just a sect, and could not rise to the highest echelons of society.</p><p></p><p>In the current Qi Kingdom, with the people's hearts at peace and no signs of rebellion, there was no opportunity for upheaval.</p><p></p><p>After seeing Jiang Pingshan off, Xu Junhe said solemnly to Kou Ruozhi, "In the Eastern River Commandery, everyone is searching for high-level cultivators. Kou Ruozhi, you need to keep an eye on this, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Kou Ruozhi nodded.</p><p></p><p>The high-level cultivator was in Cloud Mountain County, but no one dared to disturb him.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 516</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gods swallowed hard, cold sweat breaking out on their foreheads. This was a terribly fierce person, one they absolutely must not offend!</p><p></p><p>He had unhesitatingly killed the son of a Realm Lord with one punch. For those without powerful backing like themselves, he would kill even more casually without blinking an eye.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong killed Realm Lord Wan Tao's son, leaving no remains behind. Before long, a Realm Lord will descend. Can he withstand a Realm Lord's wrath?" said the god beside Zhou Qingshuang with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"He should... be fine, right?" Zhou Qingshuang said with some worry. </p><p></p><p>Since Meng Chong dared to kill, he must have some confidence, right? In her mind, she recalled Meng Chong's mysterious master, who was at minimum a Realm Lord, perhaps even beyond that level.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, time to head back!" Meng Chong waved his hand and left with flair.</p><p></p><p>The news of Wan Jie being killed with one punch quickly spread throughout the Divine Realm. The name of the Celestial God Meng Chong once again shook the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>When the martial artists who came from the Dao Realm heard of this, they were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord's son being killed was probably the first time in history! Moreover, leaving no remains behind and not even leaving a corpse for Realm Lord Wan Tao showed he didn't place Realm Lords in his eyes at all.</p><p></p><p>The group of Supreme Realm martial artists were all stunned at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The Carefree Realm Lord indeed had enough powerful strength to not fear Realm Lord Wan Tao, but allowing his disciple to kill Wan Tao's son and leave no remains undoubtedly broke the bottom line between Realm Lords.</p><p></p><p>Did he not fear sparking a war between Realm Lords?</p><p></p><p>"The world is about to descend into chaos!" some Supreme Realm martial artists muttered.</p><p></p><p>In the Taikun Realm, a Supreme from the Taikun Realm was walking in what was once wilderness, seemingly searching for something.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Taicang world, the standoff was still continuing, while Tianshai was secretly discussing something with Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon no longer knew how many days he had been in the large cauldron, nor how much cruel torture he had endured.</p><p></p><p>But he had gritted his teeth and persevered through it all.</p><p></p><p>"With a great opportunity before me, what does mere pain count for!" Blood Demon gritted his teeth and endured.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The lid of the cauldron opened, and the Herb Gatherer appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. Every true powerhouse is someone with an unyielding will. Without a firm will, how can one establish the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the satisfaction in the Herb Gatherer's eyes, Blood Demon was extremely excited. His persistence had indeed been correct - the Herb Gatherer was testing him, and also laying a solid foundation for him.</p><p></p><p>It was very likely to be the foundation for establishing the Dao!</p><p></p><p>"The first stage of treatment has ended. You must have felt the integration of your physical body and divine soul."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, senior!" Blood Demon nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Come out then. We'll begin the second stage of treatment next!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon came out of the cauldron and saw a man-high round barrel had appeared in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Get in," Tianzi indicated.</p><p></p><p>Without a word, Blood Demon jumped directly into the barrel.</p><p></p><p>"The upcoming treatment will be equally painful. If you can persevere through it, your karmic fortune will deepen further. Establishing the Dao and beyond may not be impossible."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi continued to deceive Blood Demon, painting a grand picture for him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Blood Demon seemed to be injected with chicken blood. Establishing the Dao and beyond! Once he had such strength, neither Taicang nor that one from the Unmelting Divine Palace would be his match!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I will definitely persevere!" Blood Demon said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Tianzi's face was full of satisfaction. Then he took out bugs, snakes, and all sorts of things that made one's scalp tingle just looking at them, and dumped them all into the barrel.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon couldn't help but swallow. Even he felt his scalp tingle.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Ten Thousand Spirits Return to Dragon Method. Once you persevere through it, you will obtain the Ten Thousand Spirits Sacred Body!" Tianzi deceived him.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Blood Demon became excited in his heart. Looking at those bugs no longer felt disgusting or frightening.</p><p></p><p>Although he didn't know what the Ten Thousand Spirits Sacred Body was, just the name sounded extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Tianzi took out a black true dragon. This true dragon was only about a foot long, but its aura was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Throwing the black dragon into the barrel, Tianzi said seriously: "Alright, I'm going to seal the Ten Thousand Spirits Barrel now. You can still regret it now, but once it starts it can't be stopped. That kind of pain of ten thousand spirits drilling into your body is not something humans can bear."</p><p></p><p>"This junior absolutely won't regret it!" Blood Demon said with determination in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>That was a true dragon! It had been thrown into the barrel, showing what kind of opportunity he would gain if he endured!</p><p></p><p>"Good, I haven't misjudged you!" Tianzi's face was full of satisfaction. Then he covered the barrel, patted the side of it, and revealed an evil smile.</p><p></p><p>Screams of agony came from inside the barrel.</p><p></p><p>"Scream, go ahead and scream. You're in for it now."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi looked up at the sky and chuckled lightly. The Heavenly Dao was not far from being able to operate the entire world.</p><p></p><p>Once it could operate the entire world, his Heavenly Dao's might would not be much inferior to Taicang's, and he would have some confidence to resist the Unmelting Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>But this was just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon's strength is very powerful. If I can use this blood soul to trap him, or even control him, it could have unimaginable effects. But trying to trap a World Lord is too difficult." </p><p></p><p>Tianzi felt he still needed to ask the Dao Ancestor for guidance.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong returned to the Qinghua Sect and continued cultivating, comprehending divine abilities and the Dao of the sword. He didn't immediately set out for the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was now a Realm Lord level powerhouse in the Dao Realm who wanted to cut him into a thousand pieces. Even if he went to the Dao Realm, he would have to keep a low profile.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and Su Lingxiu broke through to the World Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the World Realm. Your Medicine Dao martial way has reached small accomplishment in the Dao Establishment Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in a great mood, as his Medicine Dao martial way had also improved.</p><p></p><p>After Su Lingxiu's breakthrough, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping also broke through one after another. With this, all five martial ways had improved.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I should be able to suppress Taicang without much difficulty."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt his confidence growing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, how much stronger the Unmelting Divine Palace's powerhouses were compared to Taicang remained an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Only after breaking through to the Creation Realm would he truly have nothing to fear!</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how far Xu Yan has comprehended?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up towards the Dao Realm. Xu Yan was comprehending the world's fundamental essence, using this to comprehend the Creation Realm.</p><p></p><p>"He's not far from small accomplishment in the World Realm!"</p><p></p><p>While comprehending the world's fundamental essence, in addition to using it to comprehend the Creation Realm, it was also of great help for cultivating the World Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Xu Yan was approaching small accomplishment in the World Realm so quickly.</p><p></p><p>After consolidating her realm, Su Lingxiu hurriedly came out of seclusion. She still had an important matter to attend to, which was capturing Blood Extreme's core divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"There's no problem with that core divine soul of yours, right?" Su Lingxiu asked Blood Extreme in the jar.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, it's hiding well," Blood Extreme nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll capture that part of your divine soul</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Bring it back."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited and immediately prepared to set off for the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Go find Tianzi, there's something there that will interest you," Li Xuan called out to stop Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>This blood soul of the Blood Demon was somewhat special. Tianzi wanted to use this blood soul to trap the Blood Demon's true self. However, he didn't know how to do it without being detected by the Blood Demon. Li Xuan didn't give him any guidance on this, but instead handed the matter over to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu, as an alchemist warrior who also studied various spirit souls, was perfect to practice with this blood soul.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is it? I still need to go find that part of Blood Ji's spirit soul," Su Lingxiu asked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"A blood soul, residing in Blood Lingzi's corpse..." Li Xuan briefly explained the situation with the Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Su Lingxiu became very excited. "I'll go find him right away!"</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly set off for the Great Wilderness to find Tianzi.</p><p></p><p>When the Blood Demon came out of the barrel, he saw a graceful young woman. Wherever she passed, the grass and trees became more vibrant, and some buds that were about to bloom suddenly blossomed in an instant. </p><p></p><p>What shocked him even more was that a withered tree actually sprouted new buds.</p><p></p><p>"Why does she seem to have the ability to give vitality to all things?" The Blood Demon was greatly shocked. This aura of plants and trees being friendly to her, and everything becoming full of vitality wherever she went, was something he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>Judging by the herb gatherer's attitude, this young woman must be extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"You have such good fortune, kid," the herb gatherer sighed as he looked at him.</p><p></p><p>"This is Immortal Changqing. Come quickly and pay your respects. She is a disciple of the Dao Ancestor," the herb gatherer introduced.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon was greatly surprised. The young woman before him was actually a disciple of the Dao Ancestor? He couldn't even imagine what kind of existence the Dao Ancestor was, after all, he had created the Great Wilderness world with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>And the strength of the Great Wilderness world was far beyond comparison with the seven great worlds of Taicang.</p><p></p><p>As a disciple of the Dao Ancestor, the young woman's status was extremely noble and her strength must be incredibly powerful. No wonder everything became full of vitality and flowers bloomed wherever she went!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it also confirmed his guess that the herb gatherer was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Immortal Changqing!"</p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity. If there was a chance to become a disciple of the Dao Ancestor...</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon was extremely excited inside. Even though the herb gatherer indicated for him to prostrate himself on the ground, kneeling before a young woman would normally be beneath his dignity as the Blood Demon. But faced with such a huge opportunity, the Blood Demon knelt without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu appeared cold and aloof, but in the depths of her eyes, there was a hidden excitement. This Blood Demon soul looked very valuable for research.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, a jade platform fell to the ground. On the platform were various instruments, all used for studying spirit souls.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon once again broadened his horizons. This jade platform and instruments were all things he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"Lie down on it," Su Lingxiu said, still maintaining her cold demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi explained to the Blood Demon on the side: "Hurry and lie down. Immortal Changqing personally taking action is a great opportunity for you. Don't have any resistance, understand?" </p><p></p><p>Towards the end, his expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, senior!" The Blood Demon suppressed the excitement in his heart and quickly lay down on the jade platform.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A series of lines bound him to the jade platform. These lines seemed to be some kind of law force.</p><p></p><p>Then, he saw Immortal Changqing walk to the front of the jade platform and pull out some small tubes he had never seen before. One of the tubes was attached to his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"In a moment, you will feel drowsy. Don't resist. When you wake up, everything will have changed," Immortal Changqing said.</p><p></p><p>As soon as her words fell, the Blood Demon felt drowsy, then fell asleep and lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited. She inserted thin, long needles into the blood soul one by one, while Tianzi excitedly assisted on the side.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Have you made any discoveries?" he asked impatiently.</p><p></p><p>"This blood soul is somewhat special. When necessary, it can connect with the consciousness of the true self, and can directly return to the spirit soul of the true self.</p><p></p><p>"So, to trap the Blood Demon, we can only manipulate the blood soul and make the Blood Demon take the blood soul back.</p><p></p><p>"However, to deceive the Blood Demon, we still need to consider carefully to ensure foolproof success."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu spoke while dissecting the blood soul.</p><p></p><p>"Although he can connect with the consciousness of the true self, this connection is relatively virtual. It can only transmit what is seen and heard, as well as some thoughts. The true self cannot see through these arrangements through the blood soul, so we don't need to worry too much.</p><p></p><p>"Now the Blood Demon must think that the blood soul has entered a new world, and also feels it's a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"From my dissection just now, the blood soul transmitted information to the true self and shared the conscious state a few days ago.</p><p></p><p>"Find a way to make the Blood Demon transfer more spirit soul power over. I'll capture some for research..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu gave Tianzi ideas on how to deceive the Blood Demon into sending more spirit soul power to strengthen the blood soul.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this strengthening couldn't be too much. As for capturing spirit soul power for research, it was normal for there to be some loss during the transmission of spirit soul power. The Blood Demon wouldn't be suspicious.</p><p></p><p>"This blood soul is somewhat special. It seems to be a sub-soul of the Blood Demon that can draw spirit soul power. To cultivate this blood soul, the Blood Demon must have put in a lot of effort and spent quite some time.</p><p></p><p>"When he transfers spirit soul power to strengthen the blood soul, you use the power of the Heavenly Dao to block it a bit. Let the Blood Demon realize that transferring is very difficult, and the distance is extremely far, and he can't grasp the position..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu restored the blood soul, while also dispersing some pills into it and giving the blood soul some of Changqing's vitality.</p><p></p><p>Then, she made some small modifications to the blood soul's head, making it seem like two small horns had grown on the blood soul's head.</p><p></p><p>"Next, you tell him this..." Su Lingxiu said with a sly smile.</p><p></p><p>"Brilliant, brilliant! Why didn't I think of that?" Tianzi nodded repeatedly, very excited.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll leave first. When he wakes up, you tell him this, and set a time. I'll come back then."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu put away the jade platform and let the Blood Demon lie on the ground. She took out a jar and gave it to Tianzi. This was for containing the Blood Demon's spirit soul power.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi stood in place with a thoughtful expression, waiting for the Blood Demon to wake up.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the Blood Demon woke up. He found that his blood soul seemed a bit different, but before he could examine it closely, he quickly got up from the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, where is Immortal Changqing?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh!" The herb gatherer sighed. "Kid, your fortune is still a bit lacking, but you still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>"Senior, what happened?" The Blood Demon became a bit anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Your spirit soul is still not quite up to Immortal Changqing's requirements. However, if you can strengthen your spirit soul to meet the requirements within a month, you'll still have a chance."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi pondered for a moment, then began to explain to the Blood Demon, while also painting a bigger picture. Only with a big enough picture could they make the Blood Demon transfer more spirit soul power over.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

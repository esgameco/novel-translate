        <h1>Chapter 507</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle raised its head and said:</p><p></p><p>"Old turtle, you're being too modest. If I hadn't carefully searched, I wouldn't have been able to detect your presence. Even a realm lord would probably have difficulty discovering you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of admiration on his face.</p><p></p><p>However, the sea turtle's heart skipped a beat. How was it possible that Xu Yan could see through his turtle breath technique? </p><p></p><p>Although he wasn't at his peak due to injuries, his turtle breath technique shouldn't be much weaker than when he was at full strength. </p><p></p><p>Especially hidden at the bottom of the sea, covered by mud, even a realm lord shouldn't be able to detect anything unusual.</p><p></p><p>"You were able to find me?" The sea turtle was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Xu Yan nodded and pointed to his eyes, saying: "Your concealment technique is not yet able to deceive my eyes. Of course, if I hadn't carefully searched, I wouldn't have been able to find you either."</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle stared at Xu Yan's eyes for a long while, secretly shocked. Back during that great calamity, it was this technique that allowed him to escape with his life.</p><p></p><p>The being that caused that calamity had unimaginably powerful strength. The fact that he was able to escape, yet Xu Yan could discover him, was incredibly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>"Here is the heaven and earth essence you need!" Xu Yan raised his hand and tossed over a ball of heaven and earth essence.</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle was overjoyed and swallowed the ball of essence into its stomach. "It's a bit little. Could you get me some more?"</p><p></p><p>"With this ball of essence, you should be able to recover quite a bit. You can absorb heaven and earth essence yourself," Xu Yan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, you don't understand. This Taicang world is undergoing great changes. If I absorb heaven and earth essence myself, I risk exposing myself," the sea turtle sighed.</p><p></p><p>"But you're different. Even if someone discovers you, they won't do anything to you. After all, this is normal behavior for powerful beings, don't you think?" The sea turtle stared at him expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not impossible, but we agreed on a trade before. What about that great opportunity you mentioned?" Xu Yan pondered for a moment before nodding and speaking.</p><p></p><p>"That great opportunity..." The sea turtle pondered for a while. "With young friend Xu's current strength, you cannot go to where that great opportunity is located. And to be honest, after such a long time has passed, whether that opportunity has undergone some changes is also unknown.</p><p></p><p>"The location of the great opportunity cannot be explained in a few words, nor can it be pointed to with a map. I can only guide you there in person. But with my serious injuries unhealed, I temporarily cannot go there."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned. "The great opportunity you speak of, is it in the Unchanging Land?"</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle nodded. "Yes, it's in the Unchanging Land. And I'm almost certain the opportunity is no longer in its original location. But I do know its trajectory. With your current strength, young friend, it's still too dangerous to enter the Unchanging Land to seek this opportunity. You also don't have the strength to obtain this opportunity."</p><p></p><p>"What level of strength is needed to go after this opportunity you speak of?" Xu Yan pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>"At minimum, one must be a minor world lord, and among the top ranks of minor world lords at that. Otherwise, one lacks the strength to obtain the opportunity," the sea turtle said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"I'm quite curious, what exactly is this great opportunity you speak of? You've obtained the heaven and earth essence, so you should explain a bit, right?" Xu Yan was very curious about the great opportunity the sea turtle mentioned.</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle fell silent for a while before finally saying: "Young friend, this matter involves a great deal. Until your strength is sufficient and I have recovered my peak power, I dare not reveal too much.</p><p></p><p>"But I can give you a bit of information - if one obtains this opportunity, there is a very high chance of becoming a world lord!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Yan immediately understood. This opportunity must be related to the seven great world lords.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang, or which one?"</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle was surprised for a moment, but then realized - with Xu Yan being so extraordinary, his background must be unusual. It was only natural that he would know about the seven great world lords.</p><p></p><p>"Not Taicang." </p><p></p><p>The sea turtle said solemnly: "Young friend, since you know of Taicang, you must also know of the Unchanging Divine Palace. To be frank, this opportunity involves the Unchanging Divine Palace, and there may be potential conflict with them. So young friend must think carefully about whether to pursue this opportunity! Of course, my promise still stands - if young friend can successfully enter and obtain this opportunity, this old turtle is willing to follow you."</p><p></p><p>The great opportunity involves the Unchanging Divine Palace - no wonder the sea turtle was so cautious. And obtaining this opportunity offers the possibility of becoming a world lord. If word got out, those surviving minor world lords and realm lords would likely go crazy.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan naturally understood the dangers involved. This was why the sea turtle kept emphasizing that his current strength was insufficient to obtain the great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this great opportunity also had requirements for one's strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Unchanging Divine Palace, I see. Focus on healing your injuries. When my strength is sufficient, I'll come find you again."</p><p></p><p>With that, Xu Yan took a step and instantly vanished from the spot.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he can truly succeed." </p><p></p><p>The sea turtle sighed inwardly. Although Xu Yan seemed extraordinary, when he thought of the Unchanging Divine Palace, he felt somewhat lacking in confidence.</p><p></p><p>Even one as strong as Taicang had fallen!</p><p></p><p>"Even if Xu Yan becomes as strong as Taicang, it's not enough to oppose the Unchanging Divine Palace. And time is running short - the Unchanging Divine Palace must be planning to take action soon."</p><p></p><p>The sea turtle raised its head to look at the sky, its eyes full of worry.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had once again shocked the Divine Realm. Fighting one against five and slaying a Divine Venerable realm expert - when the news spread, those Divine Venerable experts who had been restless and intended to obtain the Dragon Subduing technique immediately gave up on the idea.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is Xu Yan's strength? Has he already broken through to the Divine Venerable realm, or even touched the threshold of the Supreme realm?"</p><p></p><p>"You all need to stop letting greed cloud your judgment. I've said it before - Xu Yan is so extraordinary, how could his heritage be simple? Behind him, there must be a Realm Lord level expert, or quite possibly even an ancient Minor World Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Releasing the Dragon Subduing technique would certainly offend the entire True Dragon race. How could Xu Yan not know this? But he did it anyway, which shows he has the confidence and a powerful enough backer!"</p><p></p><p>"Let's go into seclusion and cultivate. With the merging of the Dao Realm and Divine Realm, and the great changes in the world, there may be opportunities for breakthroughs. The Dragon Subduing technique is not something we can covet - only the great realms have the qualifications to get involved."</p><p></p><p>Many Divine Venerable martial artists were wary, and no one mentioned joining forces to seize the Dragon Subduing technique again.</p><p></p><p>"Number Seventy-six didn't die!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"With his intelligence, he shouldn't have been able to survive. And Xu Yan shouldn't have failed to discover him. Did he realize something was wrong beforehand and not approach Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was full of doubts.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't dare to inquire, fearing it would expose his own actions in using Number Seventy-six behind the scenes. He could only keep his questions to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Only a Supreme realm expert can contend with Xu Yan. I can't get involved anymore."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the Dao Realm, Ao Ming was anxious, wishing he could immediately descend to the Divine Realm to rescue his daughter and [sentence cut off]</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To be torn to pieces, to wash away the shame of the true dragon clan. However, not yet having the conditions to pass through the Shadow Realm and enter the Divine Realm, they could only wait anxiously.</p><p></p><p>The supreme beings from the various powerful realms like Taihe Realm, Taikun Realm, and Tiansha Realm were all waiting, each with their own tasks.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Cang Heaven and Earth were not something these supreme beings could control - that was a game for realm lord level powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A muffled sound came from the Shadow Realm, and its tremors began to weaken. Now the conditions were met to pass through the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Ao Ming let out a dragon's cry, his huge dragon eyes sweeping over the supreme beings present. He then led the four true spirits into the Shadow Realm, advancing towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" The supreme being from Taikun Realm smiled and stepped into the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>One by one, the supreme martial artists entered the Shadow Realm, descending towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Such a powerful true dragon. With my current strength, I probably couldn't subdue it. At least small success in the Heaven and Earth realm would be needed."</p><p></p><p>In a certain part of the Shadow Realm, Xu Yan was silent and invisible, as if he didn't exist within the Shadow Realm, quite in the state of "existing within heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth know not of me".</p><p></p><p>After reaching the Heaven and Earth realm, Xu Yan's techniques for concealing his breath and form had greatly improved, achieving the marvelous state of "existing within heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth know not of me" in this way.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Xu Yan dared to set foot in the Dao Realm, even though he knew there were forces in various realms that had their eyes on him.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Ao Ming leading the four true spirits in a grand procession, he assessed in his heart that with his current strength, trying to subdue that true dragon would be extremely difficult, almost impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>The gap in strength between them was simply too great.</p><p></p><p>"This true dragon is probably coming for me, but I'm no longer in the Divine Realm and can't be bothered to tangle with him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan withdrew his gaze and continued walking leisurely.</p><p></p><p>He seemed not to exist within the Shadow Realm, moving silently, so much so that even the laws of the Shadow Realm couldn't detect his presence.</p><p></p><p>One powerful aura after another kept coming from the direction of the Dao Realm, passing through the Shadow Realm. These supreme beings didn't linger in the Shadow Realm, nor did they show any intention of exploring it.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right over there!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan looked towards a certain part of the Shadow Realm. Even though it was far away, under his Minor Heavenly Eye, Xu Yan still sensed some anomalies.</p><p></p><p>"There's a powerful being hidden there!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly shocked. A powerful being was hiding in that location, and even he couldn't probe the bottom of this being's abilities.</p><p></p><p>He could only vaguely sense that someone was hiding there.</p><p></p><p>"Realm Lord level!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't dare to be careless, nor did he have any intention of going to investigate. He concealed himself even more thoroughly and moved away from that location.</p><p></p><p>A Realm Lord hiding there - their identity was self-evident.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord!</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Tiansha and Shadow... It was rumored that the Shadow Realm Lord was killed by Tiansha, and the Shadow Realm fell to Tiansha. It seems that was just a smokescreen to hide the Shadow Realm Lord. They must have big plans."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord's strength was naturally not weak, and hiding within the Shadow Realm, theoretically they would be the first to notice if any outsiders entered the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Xu Yan didn't dare to be careless at all, nor did he have any intention of going to investigate. After all, Realm Lord level martial artists were extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Shadow Realm Lord was especially skilled in concealment techniques, and this was their home turf in the Shadow Realm. Xu Yan couldn't guarantee that he wouldn't expose himself if he got close to them.</p><p></p><p>While the supreme beings of the Dao Realm were heading towards the Divine Realm, Xu Yan was going from the Divine Realm towards the Dao Realm, finally arriving at the connection point between the Shadow Realm and the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't immediately leave the Shadow Realm, but silently waited at the entrance, his eyes looking out towards the Dao Realm, scanning in all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Tiansha isn't here, and there are no Realm Lord level powerhouses either."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still didn't come out of the Shadow Realm, continuing to wait silently.</p><p></p><p>Finally, from the Divine Realm direction of the Shadow Realm, some auras appeared. Several martial artists came from the Divine Realm, returning to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among these people was Seventy-six.</p><p></p><p>Of course, some of the martial artists returning to the Dao Realm had come back from the Divine Realm under Seventy-six's persuasion.</p><p></p><p>The group came out of the Shadow Realm, returning to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan, silently and invisibly, followed this group into the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Dao Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Dao Realm, Xu Yan couldn't help but marvel.</p><p></p><p>Worthy of being the origin place of the Cang Heaven and Earth, whether in terms of spiritual energy or spiritual mechanisms, it was far beyond comparison with the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>And different from the Divine Realm, besides the dense spiritual energy, the Dao Realm also had the presence of heavenly dao rhythms. Although weaker beings couldn't sense or use these heavenly dao rhythms,</p><p></p><p>Cultivating in a place containing heavenly dao rhythms would improve one's talent and comprehension abilities, weaken martial bottlenecks, and naturally raise one's upper limit in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With the same talent, cultivating in the Dao Realm would be faster, martial arts would be easier to master, and ultimately one could reach a higher level.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder in ancient times of the Cang Heaven and Earth, martial artists would eventually go to the Origin Continent. The core of heaven and earth is truly different."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>After briefly determining his direction, he didn't head towards the Tiansha Realm, but towards his first destination.</p><p></p><p>It was a place rumored to have been a famous cultivation treasure ground in ancient times. Now, in the entire Dao Realm, except for a few special places, there wasn't much difference anywhere.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, that treasure ground no longer had the appeal that once made martial artists flock to it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan guessed that place should be one of the core origin places of heaven and earth. Even if there had been some changes, there should still be some unusual aspects.</p><p></p><p>He came to the Dao Realm to comprehend the Creation realm.</p><p></p><p>And the closer to the origin places of heaven and earth, the more likely he would be able to understand the mysteries of heavenly creation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked through the Dao Realm, heading towards that treasure ground. Passing by a large city, seeing the martial artists coming and going in the city, he couldn't help but marvel that the Dao Realm was indeed the core of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Venerable level beings in the Dao Realm were like Condensed Law realm martial artists in the Divine Realm - seen everywhere, at the bottom of the hierarchy, without any of the reverence they received in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't linger long in the city. After briefly gathering some information about the Dao Realm, he continued on his journey towards that treasure ground.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I, Xu Yan, have quite a reputation in the Dao Realm as well."</p><p></p><p>What the martial artists in the city were hotly discussing was naturally the fall of the Shadow Realm into the Divine Realm, the impending unification of the Dao Realm and Divine Realm, and some of the opportunities that might arise from this.</p><p></p><p>There were also speculations about what the various powerful realms were planning.</p><p></p><p>And he, Xu Yan, the dragon-subduing youth, was also one of the topics of conversation.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the news of Ao Ming from the True Dragon Realm leading the four great true spirits to descend upon the Divine Realm had spread, the martial artists of the Dao Realm were all discussing what fate awaited him, the dragon-subduing youth.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 384</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Who was this person, to be so incredibly powerful? Their martial arts techniques were simply unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Within the Qinghua realm, such miraculous techniques had never been heard of before. Could they be a peerless genius from the greater realms?</p><p></p><p>Flee! We must flee! Guardian Zong fought frantically, battering the two elders into a miserable state. Just as he was about to seize the opportunity to escape, suddenly a sword light descended from the sky with the roar of a dragon.</p><p></p><p>An enormous hand, containing immense power, also came crashing down towards him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had made his move! The incident at the Iron Ridge Heavenly Cave and Guardian Zong's betrayal had quickly spread throughout the Tianwu Sect's territory. The Tianwu Sect was furious and realized that some traitors had not yet been exposed.</p><p></p><p>They immediately issued an order to investigate and began inspecting all the forces guarding heavenly caves within their jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>The name of Sword Immortal Xu Yan also spread throughout the Tianwu Sect's territory - how one man had annihilated the enemy from the Netherworld Prison, and in the end even slain Guardian Zong.</p><p></p><p>Although he had the assistance of two True King Celestial Venerable, to be able to kill Guardian Zong in such a short time demonstrated extremely impressive strength. Within the entire Qinghua realm, likely no other genius could compare.</p><p></p><p>Especially that miraculous sword technique and the lifelike true dragon - it all surpassed imagination. Such martial arts were simply inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being the disciple of a great master!" exclaimed the Sect Leader of Tianwu Sect with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The other elders all nodded in agreement. The disciple of a great master, with such miraculous martial arts, was truly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Tianwu Sect, among those of the same age, not a single person was his match.</p><p></p><p>"No one can afford to offend the disciple of a great master. We must accommodate him as much as possible," the Sect Leader of Tianwu Sect said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Whether due to the great master's powerful deterrence, or the cooperation with Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu, they had to adopt the correct attitude and could not afford to offend the disciple of a great master.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan traveled through the territories controlled by the Tianwu Sect, entering one heavenly cave after another to temper his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Not long after, news also spread from the territory of the Myriad Thunder Sect about a bald and fierce young man with an incredibly powerful physical body who single-handedly crushed blood slaves. That violent battle shocked the martial artists who witnessed it.</p><p></p><p>With the sun suspended above his head and wind and thunder in his hands, he even transformed into a golden armored giant, incomparably mighty, like a god of war.</p><p></p><p>And so, the name Dao Jue Meng Chong did not spread far and was not resounding enough. Instead, he was called War God Meng Chong by the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The name War God Meng Chong began to spread widely.</p><p></p><p>"War God Meng Chong - he's not called Dao Jue anymore," Su Lingxiu remarked with a sigh in the small courtyard of the Medicine Hall in the capital of Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, you're still called the Medicine Immortal Maiden," Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>News of Xu Yan and Meng Chong's exploits had already spread here. Ever since Fang Hao began refining communication talismans and rebuilding a communication system similar to the Eternal Alliance in the Qinghua realm, the speed of information transmission had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Teleportation arrays were also being arranged, and the teaching of array techniques had begun. Some simple array setups no longer required his personal presence.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, thinking that venturing into the martial world was indeed more suitable for Xu Yan and Meng Chong. In just a short time exploring, they had already made progress.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Wisdom Sword realm. You have mastered the Wisdom Sword realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally stepped into the Wisdom Sword realm.</p><p></p><p>As for when he would be able to comprehend the direction of cultivation for the Saint Sword realm, that was still unknown for now, but Li Xuan had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the seventh level of the Dragon Subduing Palm. You have mastered the seventh level of the Dragon Subduing Palm."</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Palm had also broken through.</p><p></p><p>The seventh level of the Dragon Subduing Palm was a huge breakthrough. When striking out with a palm, it was no longer simply an overwhelmingly violent Dragon Subduing palm force, but as if striking out with a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>This true dragon possessed some of the nature of a true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"The seventh level of the Dragon Subduing Palm is already a divine ability palm technique, initially possessing the intent of the dragon subduing laws," Li Xuan thought joyfully to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's Dragon Fury was a divine ability derived from the Dragon Subduing Palm, while the seventh level of the Dragon Subduing Palm was itself equivalent to a divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Dragon Fury and the Dragon Subduing Palm could be perfectly overlaid and used together, as if fusing and unleashing two divine abilities at once, naturally greatly increasing their power.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the second level of the Indestructible Body of the Sun and Stars. You have broken through to the second level of the Indestructible Body of the Sun and Stars."</p><p></p><p>After news of Xu Yan and Meng Chong came one after another, on this day, when Meng Chong was in the Myriad Thunder Heavenly Cave, using his physical body to forcefully withstand the attack of a top-tier blood disciple, displaying the power of his strong physical body but also suffering some minor injuries, feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao also appeared.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had comprehended the second level of the Indestructible Body of the Sun and Stars. This was clearly the result of his enlightenment during fierce battle, using his physical body to forcefully withstand attacks and fully displaying the tyrannical nature of his physical body.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of great battle, in dangerous combat, even at the cost of his physical body suffering minor injuries, he had comprehended the second level of the Indestructible Body of the Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body cultivation has also broken through to the Void Shattering realm," Li Xuan thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's physical body was undergoing transformation. Within his acupoints, it was as if stars were being nurtured. Incomparably powerful stars revolved around his physical body, as if making his body like the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Gathering thousands of stars into one body - I have a general idea of the subsequent direction for the physical body technique of the Indestructible Body of the Sun and Stars."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan had an idea. He had found the subsequent path for the physical body technique of the Indestructible Body of the Sun and Stars.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I could easily crush the Great Yue Emperor with one hand," Li Xuan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>With his physical body cultivation breaking through to the Void Shattering realm, his strength had naturally increased greatly again. Relying on just the brute force of his physical body was enough to easily crush an Immortal Venerable like the Great Yue Emperor with one hand.</p><p></p><p>"That girl Su Lingxiu should be close to comprehending the Void Shattering realm too, right?" Li Xuan thought, full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>After Su Lingxiu's comprehension, his three martial arts would all reach the Void Shattering realm, and his strength would naturally increase further.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's Extraordinary martial arts had been constantly progressing. After all, the cultivation of Extraordinary martial arts was a bit special. To raise Extraordinary martial arts to a level comparable to the Void Shattering realm was not so easy.</p><p></p><p>"When will that fellow Jiang Buping be able to successfully cultivate the Extreme Soul martial arts?" Li Xuan thought of his newly accepted disciple Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>These days, he had been in secluded cultivation, constantly attempting to fuse with the indestructible qi and resolve the indestructible qi in his soul, transforming his soul into an indestructible soul.</p><p></p><p>However, the indestructible qi was not so easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Jiang Buping had made progress. As he constantly comprehended and attempted to fuse with the indestructible qi, his mental consciousness could now focus a bit even without stimulation.</p><p></p><p>This was a good sign, meaning that the method to resolve the indestructible qi was correct. What followed would depend on time, slowly resolving it bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>This time, although long, at least showed hope.</p><p></p><p>The first step was often the most difficult. As long as the indestructible qi was successfully resolved, his soul would no longer fear indestructible qi afterwards. He could even try to absorb a little indestructible qi to cultivate his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping is at the True King Celestial Venerable realm. Once he resolves the indestructible qi, his soul will transform..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Transforming into an indestructible spirit soul, successfully cultivating the Extreme Soul Martial Arts, his strength would be no weaker than a True King Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"And this is just the beginning stage. As he continues to cultivate, the power of the Extreme Soul Martial Arts will continue to manifest, allowing him to raise his strength to the level of an Immortal Celestial Venerable in a relatively short time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a rough assessment of Jiang Buping's power increase.</p><p></p><p>"For Senior Brother Xu Yan to maintain his powerful strength as the senior brother, he will face some pressure. However, he is not far from the Divine Phase realm. By the time Jiang Buping resolves the indestructible qi, Xu Yan will have already broken through to the Divine Phase realm."</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's strength, once he enters the Divine Phase realm, True King Celestial Venerables will no longer be his match. Relying on the Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword Divine Ability, even ordinary Immortal Celestial Venerables would find it difficult to harm him.</p><p></p><p>"These are new communication talismans. Although they cannot transmit messages to the Divine Realm, they can easily transmit messages within most of the Qinghua Realm. Using these to build a communication system will be much more convenient."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao handed a stack of communication talismans to Emperor Dayue and said.</p><p></p><p>These were the latest communication talismans he had refined, with a greatly increased transmission distance. The next stage of communication talismans would be able to transmit messages anywhere the laws of heaven and earth exist.</p><p></p><p>Since it involved the laws of heaven and earth, Fang Hao's current strength was not sufficient to refine them, and his understanding of the laws of heaven and earth was not yet adequate.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good! With these communication talismans, we can immediately know if anything happens in any city within the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan, who came representing the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, was also delighted. The communication talismans would bring the Qinghua Realm into a new era.</p><p></p><p>"Currently, the maximum transmission distance of the teleportation arrays is one hundred thousand li. This is the limit for now. For longer distances, the current divine materials cannot support the teleportation.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, refining and setting up a hundred-thousand-li teleportation array is not easy and consumes a lot of resources."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao continued.</p><p></p><p>He was very excited inside. Cooperating with Emperor Dayue was indeed a wise decision.</p><p></p><p>With such vast resources at his disposal, he had made huge improvements in arrays, artifact refining, restrictions, and other areas, reaching a new level.</p><p></p><p>His Extraordinary Gate Martial Arts were also rapidly improving.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Fang, if you need anything, just say the word. A hundred-thousand-li teleportation array is sufficient for now. It will greatly increase the speed of support to all directions."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I won't be polite. Each time the teleportation array is activated, it requires spirit crystals, but that's a minor issue. The key is the protective grand array for the teleportation array, which must be able to withstand attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, even if the teleportation array is damaged by attacks during the teleportation process, the person being teleported must remain safe. This is extremely important..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao then began to busy himself with setting up the teleportation array.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in the Medicine Hall, Su Lingxiu waved her hand, and a large jar appeared, filled with pills.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Dayue, these pills can increase the chances of breaking through from the Condensing Law realm to the Tempering Truth realm. They can help those in the Condensing Law realm break through bottlenecks. These are Tempering Truth Pills, ten thousand in total. I can't promise too much, but they should be able to increase the number of True King Celestial Venerables in your Great Yue Nation by several hundred."</p><p></p><p>Several hundred True King Celestial Venerables would significantly increase the strength of the Great Yue Nation.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was overjoyed and naturally began to send various rare divine herbs to Su Lingxiu in a continuous stream.</p><p></p><p>"These are pills for treating foundation damage. Even for True King Celestial Venerables, they can recover from general foundation damage. If the damage is too severe, they will need to come to me for treatment."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued to take out pills.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Miss Su!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Then, with a solemn expression, he asked, "Miss Su, do you have any pills that can increase the chances of breaking through to the Immortal Celestial Venerable realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Tempering Truth is easy to achieve, Immortality is hard to enter!" This saying was widely circulated in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Qinghua Realm, there was no exact count of how many True King Celestial Venerables there were, but the number of Immortal Celestial Venerables was clear - only the Great Yue Nation, Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, and Celestial Martial Gate had Immortal Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In total, there were less than twenty!</p><p></p><p>This shows how difficult it is to enter the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>Many ancient True King Celestial Venerables had long been at the peak of the True King realm, and even after accumulating foundation for countless years until their lifespan was exhausted, they still couldn't step into the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of pills made Emperor Dayue and others see that the chances of breaking through to the Immortal realm might increase somewhat.</p><p></p><p>For the Qinghua Realm, each additional Immortal Celestial Venerable was of great significance, enough to raise the overall strength of the Qinghua Realm by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>It would make it easier to deal with invasions from the Netherworld Prison.</p><p></p><p>Even if this Immortal Celestial Venerable was slightly weaker, it would still be the case.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pondered. The Immortal Celestial Venerable realm was too high, and since she didn't cultivate the Great Cang Martial Arts, it wasn't easy for her to refine pills that could increase the chances of breaking through to the Immortal Celestial Venerable realm. She needed more time to figure it out.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even if she figured it out, it was uncertain whether she could refine them at her current level.</p><p></p><p>One thing was certain: the materials needed to refine pills for breaking through to the Immortal Celestial Venerable realm would undoubtedly be extremely extraordinary, and each failed attempt at refining would result in a significant loss.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these losses would all be borne by Emperor Dayue and the others. Su Lingxiu didn't need to consider this; what she needed to consider was how to research and develop suitable pills.</p><p></p><p>"Emperor Dayue, the Immortal Celestial Venerable realm is indeed extraordinary. Increasing the chances of breaking through is not easy, and the materials needed will certainly be extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>"How about this: you can give me a list of heavenly treasures and earthly herbs from the Divine Realm, and also gather some for me. This way, it will be easier for me to research and develop suitable pills."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu finally said.</p><p></p><p>"Good, no problem!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue nodded.</p><p></p><p>Pills that increase the chances of breaking through to the Immortal Celestial Venerable realm were not just for him alone, so the materials Su Lingxiu needed would not be borne by the Great Yue Nation alone.</p><p></p><p>If she really developed them, whether it was the Great Yue Nation, Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, or Celestial Martial Gate, they all had top True King Celestial Venerables who were just one step away from the Immortal Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>With the help of pills, some would surely be able to break through.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue left contentedly with the pills. Cheng Zhan, representing the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, also bought the needed pills from Su Lingxiu. The Celestial Martial Gate did the same, and everyone was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu understood in her heart that the reason the Great Yue Nation, Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, and Celestial Martial Gate were so respectful to her, fulfilling her every request without any ill intentions, was because of the deterrence from her master.</p><p></p><p>"I can't rely on Master for everything. I also need to improve my strength. Although my Medicine Martial Arts are not good at fighting, that's only compared to Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu muttered to herself. Only with strong personal strength could she truly face all threats.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of arrays and pills undoubtedly brought the martial arts world of the Qinghua Realm into a new era, turning a new page. For martial artists in the Qinghua Realm, arrays and pills were no longer unfamiliar terms.</p><p></p><p>However, the scarcity of pills also meant that in the martial arts world of the Qinghua Realm, they were considered luxury items.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

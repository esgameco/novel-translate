            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 121: The True Meaning of the Dragon's Roar, the Four Unparalleled Masters</p><p></p><p>"That's right, life is the most important thing, hurry up and play the flute."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Wizard is quite sensible after all.</p><p></p><p>The change happened too quickly, Du Yuying didn't even have time to react before the Thousand Illusion Wizard was defeated?</p><p></p><p>And why did he have to listen to the Thousand Illusion Wizard play the flute!</p><p></p><p>Looking at the handsome young man beside her, Du Yuying's heart suddenly started beating faster, and a slight blush appeared on her face.</p><p></p><p>"Should I learn to play the flute too?"</p><p></p><p>This thought suddenly popped up in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Wizard looked at the three giant dragons coiled around him, completely blocking his retreat.</p><p></p><p>To escape, he must destroy the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of these golden dragons was overwhelmingly strong. Even if he exerted his full strength, it would still take some time to destroy one of the golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious young man obviously would not sit idly by.</p><p></p><p>So, he could only obediently play the flute and look for an opportunity to flee.</p><p></p><p>He raised the flute and started playing again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened for a while, furrowing his brows, and said, "You're not playing it right, where's the Thousand Illusion Wizard's music? You must use all your strength, the sound-killing technique, to attack me!"</p><p></p><p>"Since you said so."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Wizard let out a cold laugh, took a deep breath, and gently blew the flute, his breath flowing into the flute like a stream.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a fierce and violent flute sound rang out, like a series of invisible waves, surging and crashing against the golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, this was the true sound-killing technique.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes and listened carefully, the Dragon Subduing Palm constantly colliding with the sound-killing, comprehending its profundity and the method of the sound-killing.</p><p></p><p>"The Thousand Illusion Wizard's music comes from the flute, and his flute is also a treasure that can amplify the power of the sound-killing. And his method of using the sound-killing is somewhat special...</p><p></p><p>"What I need to comprehend is the Dragon's Roar, which is different from the general sound-killing technique. This is the true meaning of the Dragon's Roar, not something that the sound-killing technique can compare to.</p><p></p><p>"The sound-killing technique is just a method, but the Dragon's Roar I want to understand is at a higher level, closer to the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan contemplated deeply, the golden dragons circling, occasionally opening their mouths and letting out a soft low roar, each time the low roar came, the Thousand Illusion's music would be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>As if it was being restrained.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Wizard's heart was heavy, while playing the flute, he was also looking for an opportunity to break through.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying returned to the carriage, and her maid, Cui'er, was now blushing and unwilling to show her face, especially to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Just now, under the Thousand Illusion's music, she had actually experienced that kind of illusion!</p><p></p><p>"Miss."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sat down, her expression calm, and said, "We owe him four seventh-grade spirit herbs again, make a note of it."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er took out a handkerchief and added the number.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, can we really provide so many seventh-grade spirit herbs as compensation for the young master?"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>Seventh-grade spirit herbs are very precious, and even many major forces cannot produce so many at once.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a problem."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was not concerned.</p><p></p><p>"If we can't provide them, I'm afraid the young master won't let it go easily."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er frowned.</p><p></p><p>Killing a master with a single palm strike, not blinking an eye when killing people, and making sure to erase all traces, he was definitely not a kind and gentle person.</p><p></p><p>He absolutely would not spare them just because the Miss looked good.</p><p></p><p>"You underestimate the spirit herb storage of our family. This amount of spirit herbs is nothing."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Looking through the window, she saw Xu Yan still listening to the music intently.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, is the young master really going to let the Thousand Illusion Wizard go?"</p><p></p><p>Cui'er asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"He has a proud character, he will definitely keep his word."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened carefully to the Thousand Illusion's music, and suddenly, he seemed to have some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>He became extremely excited, the three golden dragons suddenly merged into one, forming an even larger golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's might was overwhelming, its eyes shining brightly, and suddenly let out a dragon's roar!</p><p></p><p>Aooo!</p><p></p><p>The dragon's roar resounded, the sky and clouds changed, and in an instant, the dragon's might surged, with a thunderous sound, the tea pavilion had already been reduced to powder, and the ground had even sunk down a layer.</p><p></p><p>Pu!</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Illusion Wizard spat out a mouthful of fresh blood, his eyes rolling back, and he fell to the ground, dead.</p><p></p><p>The direction of the giant dragon's head was exactly where the Thousand Illusion Wizard was. The dragon's roar erupted, the terrifying dragon's might pouring down on him, the power of the dragon's roar completely crushing his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>His vision went black, and he fell down, dead without even a final scream.</p><p></p><p>"Miss..."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er looked at her young mistress, not knowing what to say.</p><p></p><p>One word, nine emphases?</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was also dumbfounded, how did he suddenly kill the Thousand Illusion Wizard?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan scratched his head, with an apologetic expression on his face. He didn't mean to kill the Thousand Illusion Wizard, he was just excited after comprehending the true meaning of the Dragon's Roar, and the dragon's roar erupted.</p><p></p><p>He didn't expect it to directly kill the Thousand Illusion Wizard!</p><p></p><p>"Sorry, it was an accident, I didn't mean to kill you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and went to examine the body.</p><p></p><p>His movements were quite skilled.</p><p></p><p>"You're a master, yet you're so weak. Just one dragon's roar and you were killed!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"Cui'er, did you see? He just accidentally killed him!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed in relief.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er didn't say anything, she seriously doubted that this was an accident.</p><p></p><p>After examining the body, Xu Yan confirmed that the Thousand Illusion Wizard was a man.</p><p></p><p>The flute was a good treasure, Xu Yan collected it.</p><p></p><p>He found a few spirit tickets, which were richer than the previous Sect Master of the Evil Cult, with a few thousand spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>There was also a score.</p><p></p><p>He opened it and looked at it, one of the pieces of music seemed to be the Thousand Illusion's music?</p><p></p><p>"Take it back, let the master take a look when he's bored!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>This trip to the Inner Realm had yielded a huge harvest, he had even comprehended the true meaning of the Dragon's Roar.</p><p></p><p>"The master was right, comprehending the essence and integrating it into oneself is what a true martial artist should do!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Thousand Illusion Wizard's corpse, Xu Yan sighed and said, "I didn't want to kill you, but since I accidentally killed you, I'll bury you."</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and struck, creating a large pit in the ground.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the golden dragon wrapped up the Thousand Illusion Wizard's body and buried it in the pit.</p><p></p><p>At the moment of burial, the golden dragon crushed the Thousand Illusion Wizard's body, instantly reducing it to powder, mixing it with the soil.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself, "You're a Sect Master of the Evil Cult, your strength is not weak, and you look quite strange. I better crush you thoroughly to make sure you don't come back to life and pretend to be dead."</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Du Yuying's mouth twitched slightly, and she turned her head away, pretending not to have seen anything.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Thousand Illusion Wizard, the group continued on their way.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that without the Thousand Illusion Wizard's interference, the rest of the journey went smoothly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a lot on his mind.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, why didn't they come to assassinate me? </p><p></p><p>Even the poorest martial arts master would have at least a few hundred spirit crystals, with just a few hundred or a few hundred more, they could quickly accumulate a large amount of spirit crystals, right?</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying heaved a sigh of relief, in three more days, she could return home.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan remained in the carriage, no longer coming out, unable to withstand the blow!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>On this day, the advancing team suddenly came to a halt.</p><p></p><p>Four figures came from four different directions, surrounding the team in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying came out of the carriage, her face extremely grave, looking at the four masters, her heart sank.</p><p></p><p>Four Perfected Realm masters!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were adept at combined attack techniques, working together, they were more powerful than a thousand illusory demon cultivators!</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, the four of you are the Four Peerless Masters of the Luoyun Mountain Villa? Why have you interfered in my Du family's affairs?" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, the Luoyun Mountain Villa? </p><p></p><p>He had never heard of it, Suling Xiu had never mentioned it, but for four powerful master-level experts to appear, and not ordinary masters at that, their strength was clearly not weak.</p><p></p><p>The Four Peerless Masters stepped forward in unison, their footsteps, auras, and spiritual energies all connected.</p><p></p><p>They remained silent.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took a deep breath, "Young master, be careful, these are the Four Peerless Masters of the Luoyun Mountain Villa, they cultivate the Four Peerless Fusion Technique, their minds are connected, their spiritual energies are fused, they can integrate the powers of the other three into one, unleashing the peak power of the four of them..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow raised, the Four Peerless Fusion Technique?</p><p></p><p>"The inner domain martial arts world is truly fascinating, although it is a false martial dao, the techniques are too many, no wonder my master warned me not to underestimate them, but to learn the essence within...</p><p></p><p>"It turns out my master had already foreseen everything, there are countless martial arts techniques in the world, so he did not teach me his techniques, but taught me the Dao, integrating myriad techniques into one's own body, returning all to the One..."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more he felt his master was truly a noble and eminent figure!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>One of them struck.</p><p></p><p>The fist imprint was vast and mighty, as the spiritual energies of the other three constantly empowered the attack power of the one who struck.</p><p></p><p>"Flowery nonsense!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snorted coldly, raising his hand to strike out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>A dragon's roar resounded, a golden giant dragon surged forth, its dragon might overwhelming, directly destroying the fist imprint and charging towards the one who had struck.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The other three's expressions changed drastically, wanting to rush in to provide aid.</p><p></p><p>However, that dragon's roar entered their minds, as if it could make all living beings prostrate, causing their spiritual minds to waver, their auras even pausing momentarily.</p><p></p><p>By the time they wanted to rush in to help, it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>The powerful Descending Dragon Palm force erupted, directly blasting the one who had struck into oblivion!</p><p></p><p>"Brother!" </p><p></p><p>The remaining three were shocked and enraged.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan struck, he no longer held back, unleashing the Descending Dragon Palm, its might unparalleled, the dragon eyes shining brightly, the dragon's roar resounding, the dragon's might shaking their spiritual minds!</p><p></p><p>Bang! Bang! Bang!</p><p></p><p>The renowned Four Peerless Masters were instantly killed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan approached the corpses, his expression disappointed, they actually turned out to be poor wretches, not carrying much spirit stones!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying opened her mouth, momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>The Four Peerless Masters of the Luoyun Mountain Villa were renowned throughout the Great Yue Kingdom, the four of them inseparable, no matter how many enemies they faced, they always struck together.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary masters did not dare offend these four.</p><p></p><p>She realized a problem, the Four Peerless Masters came from the Luoyun Mountain Villa, did that mean the Luoyun Mountain Villa was also involved and had made a decision?</p><p></p><p>If so, now that the Four Peerless Masters were dead, would the Patriarch of the Luoyun Mountain Villa come to attack?</p><p></p><p>He was a great master-level expert!</p><p></p><p>"Hurry up and continue the journey, we must return as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The team's speed suddenly increased, rushing forward.</p><p></p><p>After killing the Four Peerless Masters, Du Yuying was worried that the great master would come to attack, so she urged the team to hurry, Yan Kuan, due to his serious injuries, was greatly distressed by the jolting journey.</p><p></p><p>After several days of hurried travel, Du Yuying removed her veil, her face flushed, slightly panting, as if unable to withstand the rapid and bumpy journey.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly, Du Yuying, a third-grade martial artist, was actually unable to withstand the jolting?</p><p></p><p>He somewhat understood the reason why, despite knowing they would be ambushed, they still chose to travel by carriage, and the speed had been slow the entire way.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had physical problems, that's why she had no choice but to do so!</p><p></p><p>"If you can't withstand it, just slow down a bit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Arriving a day later at the destination, he would gain an extra hundred spirit crystals, missing this opportunity, the next time he wanted to easily earn spirit crystals might not be so easy.</p><p></p><p>"It's nothing!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took a few deep breaths and said.</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch of the Luoyun Mountain Villa is a great master, if he comes to kill us, young master, can you handle him?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart trembled, a great master?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but think of that black-robed person again, who was also a great master.</p><p></p><p>At that time, his strength, although not as strong as now.</p><p></p><p>However, under the might of a great master, he would still be unable to resist!</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, although I have comprehended the second layer of the Saha Sword Intent, my realm is still low, unable to fully unleash it.</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended the Dragon Might Palm Intent and the Dragon's Roar, greatly enhancing the power of the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>"Even so, if I use the Saha Sword Intent and the Descending Dragon Palm at full power, I still cannot match a great master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan assessed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>Helplessly discovering that he could not defeat a great master!</p><p></p><p>Even an ordinary great master, he could not defeat, even though he cultivated the true martial dao, he was still lacking a realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master's single palm shattered a great master, I'm still too far behind!"</p><p></p><p>Whenever he thought of that scene where his master demonstrated how to kill beyond one's realm with a single palm, his heart would be shaken.</p><p></p><p>So powerful!</p><p></p><p>A single palm, destroying the great master without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I break through to the Transcendent Realm, I still won't be able to do it, to kill a great master with a single palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through to the Transcendent Realm, he would no longer fear ordinary great masters.</p><p></p><p>"When I can divide my true qi into ten parts, fully comprehend the profundity of true qi, and then break through to the Transcendent Realm, with such a full-powered palm strike, I might still have a chance of killing an early Transcendent Realm master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan silently summarized to himself.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying saw that Xu Yan remained silent, and she already understood that he was not a great master, but a Martial Ancestor realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Just, his strength was terrifying!</p><p></p><p>"Where did this freak come from?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying was inwardly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The team rushed forward without stopping, fortunately the inner domain horses had remarkable endurance, able to withstand such a long journey without collapsing.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they passed through a pass and entered a wide official road, Du Yuying heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The team's speed slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan relaxed, finally back home.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, the Tianbao Pavilion in the city should have enough seventh-grade spirit medicines, I will purchase them for you, thank you for escorting me on this trip!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying took a few deep breaths, stabilizing her breathing, and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow raised, they had already reached the destination?</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>He nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, Miss Du was able to find a flower protector, but you should still come with me."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice sounded, and a person descended from the sky, dressed in a purple robe, with three long beard strands, a scholarly and refined appearance, holding a folding fan in his hand.</p><p></p><p>His aura was like an abyss, as if a heavenly might had descended with him!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

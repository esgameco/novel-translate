        <h1>Chapter 147</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were both dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan spoke, the two immediately realized who the bald man was - Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Being from the same sect, they were indeed sworn brothers, even their way of introducing themselves was exactly the same!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan swallowed hard and said, "Young master, I'm a bit anxious!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was being hunted by a Grand Master under Hu Shan's name, what on earth had he done? That was a Grand Master! In the future, would he still be able to introduce himself as "I am the Sword Venerable Hu Shan"?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had already approached the few martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xie Lingfeng, no, Hu Shan, being hunted by the Grand Master?"</p><p></p><p>How dare that Grand Master hunt his own disciple brother, was he tired of living?</p><p></p><p>Right now, he was also a bit anxious, not knowing how long Meng Chong could hold out.</p><p></p><p>He must hurry to the rescue.</p><p></p><p>"You are?" </p><p></p><p>The few martial artists frowned, this young man had such a strong anger, asking about Hu Shan's affairs right away, could he be from the Sword Venerable Cliff?</p><p></p><p>"I am the Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands and said.</p><p></p><p>His aura surged, causing the few martial artists to change their expressions, this young man had such powerful strength!</p><p></p><p>The Sword God Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>They had never heard of him, but since he was called the Sword God, he must be a powerful expert from the Sword Venerable Cliff.</p><p></p><p>"I just received news that Hu Shan was indeed being hunted by the Grand Master at the border between Yan State and Great Yue State, but I don't know the current situation."</p><p></p><p>The martial artist who had obtained the latest news swallowed and spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng came over and handed a small token to Xu Yan, saying, "Brother Xu, this is the Flying Swallow Token of our Sword Venerable Cliff, you carry it, and I will have the news spread to all parts of the Sword Venerable Cliff, so that they can soon send you a message.</p><p></p><p>"Since Brother Meng is being hunted under the name of Hu Shan, our Sword Venerable Cliff should also be paying attention and getting news."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the Flying Swallow Token and cupped his hands, "Brother Xie, thank you for the trouble."</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter, I hope Brother Meng can escape the hunt!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng shook his head.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the woman in plain clothes handed over a jade token and smiled lightly, "Young Master Xu, this jade token can be used to buy information from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, if the news from the Sword Venerable Cliff is not timely enough, you can purchase it from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was widespread in the inner domain, with the most timely information.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took it, as it concerned Meng Chong's safety, he didn't want to be picky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Du Yuying felt embarrassed. She found that she could not provide any help at all.</p><p></p><p>The Du Marquis Mansion was still too weak, with limited influence.</p><p></p><p>"I must break through to the Grand Master realm as soon as possible, I must strengthen my own strength!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying silently thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Yan State?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying raised her hand and pointed, "Young Master Xu, in that direction is the border between Yan State and Great Yue State, but the border between the two countries is vast, so finding someone will not be easy!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, after I rescue my disciple brother, let's gather together again!"</p><p></p><p>His figure soared and disappeared into the sky in an instant.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan left, the woman in plain clothes also took her leave.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xie Lingfeng was about to leave, Du Yuying blocked him and stretched out a hand, "The letter!"</p><p></p><p>Under the veil, her jade-like face was slightly flushed.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took out the letter and handed it to her, "Miss Du, I will have someone send those generous gifts back to the Du Marquis Mansion."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying held the letter in her hand, her face a bit flushed, and glared at him angrily, "No need, just give it to Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded, and was about to leave, but suddenly thought of something and said, "Miss Du, actually I think you're overthinking a bit, Young Master Xu's escort for you is probably just for the sake of earning some spirit stones and spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying glared at him furiously, "You don't need to tell me that!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng shook his head and left with Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Young miss."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er's eyes were a bit red, was she not going to become a maid-in-waiting?</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying covered her chest, she felt a bit heartbroken, did Young Master Xu only have the simple intention of earning spirit stones and spirit herbs?</p><p></p><p>Didn't he have any other thoughts? "Since Young Master Xu likes spirit stones and spirit herbs, then I'll become a wealthy person, surely there will be something that can catch Young Master Xu's eye!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's gaze was determined as she silently thought.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After killing the Grand Master and rescuing Meng Shushu, the two set out for the spirit herb treasure land.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the spirit herb treasure land of our family?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked.</p><p></p><p>"It's in Yan State, Mount Tianhammer, I suspect there used to be a sect there that was proficient in cultivating spirit herbs, but I don't know how it fell into ruin or perished. The spirit herbs planted there remain.</p><p></p><p>"After a long period of growth, these spirit herbs have continuously improved, so there are even sixth-grade spirit herbs, and there may even be fifth-grade spirit herbs."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu took a few breaths and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Is there really fifth-grade spirit herbs?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>According to Su Lingxiu's words, sixth-grade spirit herbs were already the highest grade in the inner domain, and fifth-grade spirit herbs might exist, but they were extremely rare, and even the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion might not sell them.</p><p></p><p>"Not too sure, about sixty to seventy percent chance."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the mountain forest, they bought a horse-drawn carriage in the nearest city.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong drove the carriage, and Meng Shushu rested in the carriage to heal her wounds.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, what kind of healing medicine is this, the healing effect is so amazing!"</p><p></p><p>In just half a day, Meng Shushu felt her injuries had healed by five or six tenths.</p><p></p><p>"This is made from eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs, how could the medicinal effect not be good? Remember, you owe me eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong still felt a bit heartbroken as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't have many medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu rolled her eyes, he could actually say that it was made from eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs. </p><p></p><p>But since she owed him her life, a few more sixth-grade spirit herbs didn't matter much.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how did you provoke those people?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"They found me and offered me a generous reward, asking me to find a spirit herb treasure land, as a spirit herb explorer, I've taken on such tasks before, so I directly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"In the end, they found the spirit herbs they needed on Mount Tianhammer in Yan State, but they wanted to directly control me and make me their lackey.</p><p></p><p>"Of course I didn't agree, and found an opportunity to escape."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu gritted her teeth, full of resentment.</p><p></p><p>"As a spirit herb explorer, don't you have any backing?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said dejectedly, "My spirit herb exploration skills are family inherited, my father died while exploring spirit herbs, and my grandfather also perished a few years ago while going to rescue an old friend.</p><p></p><p>"I'm the only one left. Although I'm a Grand Master cultivator, when those people saw me in trouble, the first thing they thought of was to have me join them and explore spirit herbs for them.</p><p></p><p>"I, Meng Shushu, am used to being free and unrestrained, how could I accept being constrained by them? Even when the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion hired me, I refused, let alone them."</p><p></p><p>When talking about this matter, Meng Shushu gritted her teeth, hating those people to the core.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong understood now, he spoke, "My family, although you owe me a life, a storage bag, and eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs, don't worry, I won't control you.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to remember that you owe me the storage bag, and return it to me when you can."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>"As long as you have a goal to strive for, you can still be free and unfettered," he said.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu opened his mouth, but ultimately did not curse. Damn! How could this burly ruffian have so much insight?</p><p></p><p>Back in Iron Mountain County, how did he end up taking a liking to this guy? Meng Shushu felt like crying, but then he thought, if he hadn't found Meng Chong, would he have been able to turn danger into safety this time? That was hard to say.</p><p></p><p>The Yan Kingdom's Iron Hammer Mountain was far away. It would take a month by horse-drawn carriage to get there.</p><p></p><p>So after Meng Shushu's injuries had healed from the two-day carriage ride, the two of them boarded the carriage again and flew directly towards the Iron Hammer.</p><p></p><p>Iron Hammer Mountain got its name from the mountain peaks resembling a giant iron hammer.</p><p></p><p>The steep cliffs had sparse ancient trees growing in the crevices, and there were numerous huge protruding rock formations that looked like natural stone platforms, dozens of them scattered across the mountain.</p><p></p><p>While they appeared natural, closer inspection revealed traces of human workmanship.</p><p></p><p>At the mountain's peak, there were fist-sized cracks and crevices of unfathomable depth, and small openings covered in moss could be seen on the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>At the foot of the eastern slope was a dense grove of large trees, extending up the mountainside for dozens of meters. Behind the particularly thick ancient tree at the top was a stone cave about ten meters high and twenty meters deep. Broken stone slabs were scattered outside the cave, which had once been the cave's door.</p><p></p><p>Lurking in the trees around the cave were five figures in black robes - all martial arts masters.</p><p></p><p>And in the distance, there were more black-robed figures hiding.</p><p></p><p>Two figures approached the Iron Hammer Mountain - Meng Chong and Meng Shushu, who had traveled a long distance to get here.</p><p></p><p>"My kinsman, are you sure the spiritual herb's treasure ground is really here?" Meng Chong looked at the Iron Hammer Mountain with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>The mountain had sparse vegetation, being a vast rocky peak. Aside from the dense forest extending up the lower slopes for dozens of meters, there were only a few trees on the mountain itself, giving it a desolate appearance.</p><p></p><p>"And if the spiritual herbs are really here, why haven't they been harvested?" Meng Chong asked further.</p><p></p><p>"The treasure ground is inside the mountain. There is a clearing there that is not easily discovered, and a key is required to enter the treasure ground. If you try to forcibly break in, the spiritual herbs could be damaged. Each sixth-grade spiritual herb is invaluable, so they don't dare to break in forcibly," Meng Shushu explained.</p><p></p><p>Pointing to the dense forest, he said, "The entrance is over there, but it's definitely guarded by martial arts masters."</p><p></p><p>"As long as there are spiritual herbs, that's all that matters. As for these martial arts masters, if they dare to block me, I'll kill them all one by one with my blade," Meng Chong said, gripping his sword hilt.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Meng Chong said, heading straight for the forest.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu hid himself and followed boldly, emboldened by Meng Chong's presence.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, you dare to walk into the trap? Hand over the key!" As soon as they entered the forest, five figures in black robes appeared, surrounding them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong gripped his sword hilt and said in a deep voice, "Gentlemen, this place is mine now. The wise thing is to leave, lest I hurt the harmony between us!"</p><p></p><p>His powerful aura surged, emanating a faint golden glow, and he swept his gaze across the five black-robed figures. For some reason, he felt a sense of familiarity with them.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, why must you stir up this trouble? Since you dare to stir it up, then be prepared to meet your demise!" one of the black-robed figures said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, one of the black-robed figures immediately attacked, charging towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Heh! Since you're looking for death, I'll be happy to oblige you!" Meng Chong sneered.</p><p></p><p>The flash of a blade, and in that instant, a majestic aura surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body was suffused with a golden glow, revealing his mighty Golden-Bodied Heavenly Slashing Sword! With a single strike, he slew a martial arts master, and his unparalleled sword intent swept forth, directly reducing the opponent to ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" The remaining black-robed figures were horrified.</p><p></p><p>They hastily joined forces and charged forward.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong didn't even bother defending, striking out one blade after another, instantly slaying four more martial arts masters!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was once again stunned. Meng Chong was so overwhelmingly powerful and terrifying.</p><p></p><p>"My kinsman, the people have been dealt with. Let's go collect the spiritual herbs!" Meng Chong said, having killed five martial arts masters without even blinking.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Shushu was about to head towards the stone cave when his expression suddenly changed. He looked up.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The surrounding trees were instantly pulverized and swept away.</p><p></p><p>A majestic, almost divine aura descended.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression changed. "A great master?"</p><p></p><p>Then he frowned, "No, a bit weak?"</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" Three black-robed figures appeared in the air, and the one in the lead had a surging aura, like the descent of divine might.</p><p></p><p>Sensing the battle erupting, he had rushed over, only to find that the five martial arts masters guarding the place had all been killed! He was furious.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Brother, be careful, it's a Half-Step Grand Master!" Meng Shushu said, his heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's brow furrowed. So it was only a Half-Step Grand Master, no wonder he felt a bit weak.</p><p></p><p>"So you're just a half-baked one, yet you dare to be arrogant before me!" Meng Chong's body suddenly expanded, his terrifying aura growing even more fearsome.</p><p></p><p>It was as if wind and thunder were surging around him. His unparalleled sword intent rippled outward, and the blade light surged up, directly charging towards the Half-Step Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>Although not a true Grand Master, the opponent's strength was still immensely powerful. Meng Chong couldn't afford to be careless.</p><p></p><p>As the two powerful figures fought, Meng Shushu hastily retreated to the side, afraid of being caught in the crossfire. Seeing this, the other two black-robed figures tried to sneak past and capture Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>But Meng Chong's unparalleled slash managed to push the Half-Step Grand Master back slightly, and he swung his blade back, slaying one of the black-robed figures!</p><p></p><p>"No!" The black-robed figure was horrified.</p><p></p><p>Poof! He was instantly killed by the single strike.</p><p></p><p>The other black-robed figure turned pale with fear and hastily retreated.</p><p></p><p>"You dare to be distracted while facing me!" The Half-Step Grand Master was furious.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the moment Meng Chong turned his head, he unleashed a powerful punch, the terrifying force like a collapsing mountain bearing down.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong struck out with a punch of his own.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't completely block the attack, but he managed to weaken it by six-tenths, leaving only four-tenths of the power to hit him. Yet even that four-tenths couldn't harm him at all.</p><p></p><p>The invincible might of his physical body was fully revealed.</p><p></p><p>"A mere Half-Step Grand Master, is that all you've got?" Meng Chong's eyes shone with a golden light as he raised his blade, unleashing strike after strike of his Heavenly Slashing Sword.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure's expression was horrified. Meng Chong's physical body was so terrifying. He pulled out a curved blade, and a terrifying blade aura like a storm poured down, trying to engulf Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 544</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan stood in place, but it was as if he had transformed into a peerless divine sword, standing proudly in the blood prison, looking down upon it with contempt.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Madman, who had been howling and screaming to alleviate the pain in his soul, suddenly fell silent. At this moment, a face emerged from the waves of blood.</p><p></p><p>An expression of shock appeared on his face, and even traces of fear began to surface.</p><p></p><p>"What sword technique is this? How can you possibly wield such powerful swordsmanship!" Blood Madman cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike was enough to break open his blood prison realm. This meant that he would suffer severe injuries, while Xu Yan and the other three could safely retreat! But judging from Xu Yan's stance, this sword strike was not meant to break open his blood prison realm, but to kill him! Blood Madman's eyes were filled with terror, knowing that in his severely injured state, he had no way to block this sword strike. Normally, a Supreme Realm martial artist would not be able to pose a threat to the master of a minor world.</p><p></p><p>But Blood Madman knew that Xu Yan and the other three could not be viewed through common sense. Their martial arts had long since transcended what he knew, surpassing imagination.</p><p></p><p>Escape! He must escape! At this moment, Blood Madman no longer had any thoughts of killing Xu Yan, only wanting to flee. With his power as the master of a minor world, surely he could manage to escape?</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was about to flee, Xu Yan's sword strike came slashing down.</p><p></p><p>It was an indescribable sword strike, as if what came slashing down was not just a sword, but an entire world. It was as if this sword strike had encompassed the entire area where he was.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed down with one sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: World Within the Sword!</p><p></p><p>The divine ability born when he broke through to the Divine Ability Realm had evolved from Rivers and Mountains Within the Sword to World Within the Sword.</p><p></p><p>And this sword strike was him using his divine ability to encompass the powers of Meng Chong, Fang Hao, Jiang Buping and the Ancient Sea Turtle, unleashing them together. The four people and one turtle, though their powers were different, were encompassed together, like the four seasons existing in the world, like wind, rain, thunder and lightning, like different living beings, all able to coexist in the world.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword strike was the same, with different powers coexisting within this one strike.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the World Within the Sword divine ability encompassing and fusing different powers, it was also related to Xu Yan's martial way being the purest martial way. Because it was pure and unadulterated, it could encompass different powers without being affected.</p><p></p><p>As the sword fell, it instantly slashed towards Blood Madman.</p><p></p><p>The sword in Xu Yan's hand also shattered at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Casually tossing aside the shattered sword, Xu Yan's gaze was calm, as if what he had unleashed was just an ordinary sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Ah! After a brief scream of agony, the blood prison began to collapse. A special aura appeared on the Unchanging Land, swept up by the violent spiritual energy, and completely disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle was dazed for a moment. Although he knew Blood Madman could not withstand this sword strike, actually seeing Blood Madman killed by a single strike still left him incredulous.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wasn't even the master of a minor world yet, but he had already slain the master of a minor world?</p><p></p><p>Although this slaying of Blood Madman was a joint effort, and also due to Blood Madman's own carelessness, the fatal sword strike was still delivered by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Even though this strike did not rely on Xu Yan's own power alone, it was still incredible.</p><p></p><p>Never before had anyone been able to encompass the power of others and unleash such a lethal strike. This was probably the first time in history! Blood Madman was likely the first master of a minor world in history to be slain by those beneath him.</p><p></p><p>"We've finally killed Blood Madman." Fang Hao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>A master of a minor world, actually slain by their joint efforts.</p><p></p><p>"What was that aura?" Xu Yan was somewhat puzzled. When Blood Madman perished, a special aura had been swept up by the violent spiritual energy of the Unchanging Land and completely disappeared, as if dispersing into the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>"That is unique to the fall of a master of a minor world. It may be related to that purple light from before. It seems that masters of minor worlds who obtained the purple light will have this aura return to the Unchanging Land when they perish," the Ancient Sea Turtle explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan nodded. Masters of minor worlds who obtained the purple light's blessing would all have a unique aura return to the Unchanging Land when they perished, as if in some mysterious way it all came from the Unchanging Land and should return to the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>"The mysterious great Dao? Will everything ultimately return to the Dao?" Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, continue searching for the Hongze World. Blood Madman's appearance here may also have been for the Hongze World," the Ancient Sea Turtle said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I need to forge a flying ship, it must be fast enough. Once we encounter a group of true spirits, or even masters of minor worlds like Blood Madman, we should be able to flee," Fang Hao said gravely.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's speed was ultimately too slow.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, forge a flying ship. Whatever materials are lacking, whatever materials are needed, just say it. If we're short on anything we can spend some time looking. The Unchanging Land has no shortage of all kinds of materials," the Ancient Sea Turtle nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Once the flying ship was ready, he could also take a break, instead of serving as a mount.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, they continued searching for the Hongze World, while Fang Hao began crafting the flying ship, using various materials found in the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>The first flying ship of the Unchanging Land focused on being fast enough. As for the power to propel the ship's flight, it used arrays to condense and absorb the violent spiritual energy of the Unchanging Force, and even applied the Unchanging Force to the ship through restrictive runes.</p><p></p><p>With materials from the Unchanging Land, further enhanced by the Unchanging Force, the flying ship was naturally extremely sturdy, with no need to worry about it disintegrating from being unable to withstand extreme speeds.</p><p></p><p>This was Fang Hao's first time crafting a flying ship outside of a world, and he was extremely excited, putting in a lot of thought and carefully executing each step of the crafting process.</p><p></p><p>They still hadn't found the Hongze World, and the Ancient Sea Turtle had already changed direction to continue the search.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the previous encounter with Blood Madman, they hadn't encountered any other masters of minor worlds, nor had they met anyone from the Unchanging Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps Blood Madman wasn't here for the Hongze World after all, but truly just happened to appear in this area and encountered us by chance?" the Ancient Sea Turtle wondered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A tremor came from the turtle's back. The Ancient Sea Turtle looked back to see a small, light gray flying ship taking shape above Fang Hao's palm.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging flying ship was finally about to be completed. The Ancient Sea Turtle was overjoyed, he would finally no longer have to carry people.</p><p></p><p>Another day passed.</p><p></p><p>"It's done!" Fang Hao's excited voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>A small, light gray flying ship hovered in front of Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the ship instantly enlarged, becoming a ten-zhang long flying ship hovering above the Unchanging Land.</p><p></p><p>The light gray flying ship was not easily detected in the chaos, possessing better stealth capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's board the ship," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle was overjoyed. His body instantly shrank to only half a zhang in size, and standing on his hind legs, he also boarded the ship.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I'll activate the ship," Fang Hao took out some spirit crystals, about to activate the ship for the first time...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To operate the flying boat, it was necessary to activate the formation, and spirit crystals were perfect for activating formations.</p><p></p><p>Hum! As the formation was activated, the flying boat emitted a faint gray light. The violent spiritual energy from the surroundings frantically converged and poured into the formation of the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>The restrictions drawn with immutable qi also lit up slightly at this moment, making the flying boat stable and preventing it from breaking apart.</p><p></p><p>"For the first activation, we'll gather violent spiritual energy. Since this is the first refinement, we'll be conservative for now to avoid failure and the flying boat being unable to fly. Once the spiritual energy is fully gathered, we can control the flying boat."</p><p></p><p>"This time I refined a control formation disk for the flying boat. It can be controlled with the formation disk - simple and convenient, and anyone can operate it."</p><p></p><p>"In addition, I've arranged acceleration formations, concealment formations to a certain extent, and disorienting formations for the flying boat. Most importantly, I've arranged teleportation formations that can instantly transport it a certain distance, as well as shifting formations..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out a formation disk and began explaining the setup of this flying boat.</p><p></p><p>The biggest feature of this flying boat was its speed, especially when activating the teleportation formation. The boat could cross distances, instantly teleporting away from its original location - an excellent ability for escape.</p><p></p><p>Of course, teleporting once would consume half of the accumulated spiritual energy. After teleportation, it would need to regather spiritual energy, and the process of gathering energy would naturally cause some commotion, making it easy to be tracked.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, there are still many aspects of the flying boat that need improvement, but it's sufficient for now. We can adjust and improve it as we discover shortcomings during use."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao tossed the formation disk to the Ancient Sea Turtle and said, "Old Turtle, you seem quite interested. I'll leave the flying boat for you to control. You're more familiar with how to explore the Hongze Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good! I won't be polite then!" The Ancient Sea Turtle was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Taking the formation disk, he operated it a bit. The flying boat instantly started up and shot out with a whoosh, its speed exceeding the Ancient Sea Turtle's expectations.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the flying boat made very little disturbance during flight, much less than when he walked.</p><p></p><p>The gray flying boat was inconspicuous in the primordial chaos.</p><p></p><p>"With this flying boat, exploring the Hongze Realm will be much faster. We can explore farther places," the Ancient Sea Turtle said excitedly as he controlled the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, there's a group of true spirits ahead. The leader is a true spirit comparable to the Realm Lord level," the Ancient Sea Turtle said, preparing to avoid the group of true spirits.</p><p></p><p>"Charge straight through, hunt the true spirits, and also see how fast that Realm Lord level true spirit is, whether it can catch up to the flying boat," Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's be careful," the Ancient Sea Turtle didn't object. They had even killed Blood Frenzy, a minor realm lord. A Realm Lord level true spirit posed no threat at all.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The flying boat charged into the group of true spirits at extremely high speed. Sword light flashed, instantly killing several true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong threw out a punch, like a great sun flashing in the primordial chaos, blasting into the group of true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping pointed his spear, and the souls of the true spirits perished, leaving only intact physical bodies, which he collected.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's weapon box flew out divine weapons, sweeping with a punch.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the true spirits roared angrily and fiercely attacked, spitting out a powerful green light from its mouth.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The flying boat nimbly avoided the attack while drastically increasing speed, instantly fleeing far away.</p><p></p><p>That true spirit roared and chased after them. As expected of a Realm Lord level true spirit, its speed was not slow.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, go faster! Let's test the flying boat's top speed!" Fang Hao said, looking at the pursuing true spirit.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle raised his hand and directly increased the flying boat's speed to the maximum. Except for teleportation and shifting which hadn't been used, this was already the fastest speed of this flying boat.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The flying boat's speed suddenly increased, turning into a gray light and instantly blasting away. The symbols drawn with immutable qi on the flying boat now flickered slightly, reinforcing the boat's stability.</p><p></p><p>As the speed increased, the distance between the flying boat and the true spirit grew larger and larger, until finally they completely shook off that true spirit.</p><p></p><p>"This immutable flying boat's speed is not bad, but it's still not enough. I'll adjust and improve it to make it faster and more concealed," Fang Hao said as he took out materials and condensed immutable qi to start improving the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"Along our way, many places we passed had treasures. Relying on our own exploration is a bit tiring. Let's arrange sensing formations on the flying boat to actively search for treasures, and within a certain range, actively collect treasures. This way it will be much easier."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was very excited. The Immutable Land was truly a treasure trove. For an extraordinary martial artist and refiner like him, it was like entering an inexhaustible treasure mountain.</p><p></p><p>There were numerous treasures of many types, allowing him to study and refine more divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>For the next part of the journey, Fang Hao improved the flying boat, adding exploration formations, collection formations, and storage space.</p><p></p><p>The collected treasures were stored in the flying boat's storage space.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he further reinforced the flying boat, increasing its defensive power to deflect incoming attacks.</p><p></p><p>As the flying boat's improvements were completed, treasures were collected wherever it went, one after another, in great numbers.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many treasures. Let's not take the ordinary ones."</p><p></p><p>After collecting a large pile of various materials, Fang Hao excluded some common materials that were abundant from the formation's collection range.</p><p></p><p>There was no sign of the Hongze Realm, but Xu Yan and the other three didn't mind. Fang Hao was categorizing treasures and studying artifact refining and formations.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping sat cross-legged on the flying boat, perceiving the Immutable Land and their own martial paths.</p><p></p><p>The Immutable Land was in a state of primordial chaos, very different from the normal world. Therefore, cultivating and perceiving the martial path in the Immutable Land brought new insights.</p><p></p><p>Especially for Xu Yan, who was not far from the Realm Establishment realm. Now as he perceived the Immutable Land, using his own realm to resonate with the Immutable Land, he seemed to understand the meaning of establishing a realm, and even had a sense of establishing the Way in chaos to become a realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in a trance, when his own realm resonated with the chaos, he vaguely had some inspiration, the meaning of the Great Way, insights into the primordial realm.</p><p></p><p>But it was as if there was a layer of window paper blocking him, and he could never fully understand the method of the primordial realm.</p><p></p><p>But at least he had an initial insight. Xu Yan believed that when he broke through to the Realm Establishment realm and his martial path further improved, he would surely be able to comprehend how to embody the Great Way in the primordial realm.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle controlled the flying boat, constantly moving forward. He frowned - had the Hongze Realm disappeared?</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a large mountain. Judging by its size, it was formed by a Realm Lord level true spirit. Moreover, this mountain appeared quite ancient, the true spirit that perished to form it was from very long ago.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, this mountain had drifted here from somewhere unknown.</p><p></p><p>As the flying boat flew past the mountain, some treasures from inside the mountain were sensed and collected by the formation.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the Ancient Sea Turtle's expression changed. "Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

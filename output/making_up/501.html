        <h1>Chapter 501</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping asked curiously, "Does Blood Extreme have a grudge against you?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was taken aback, "That's impossible. Blood Extreme is rumored to have perished a very long time ago. How old are you? How could he possibly have a grudge against you?"</p><p></p><p>"From Jiang Tianming to the one just now, his shadow was present in both cases. And the secret techniques he taught were all meant to restrain me. How could this be a coincidence?" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping explained the whole situation and his speculations.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, is that so?" Old Xiao raised his eyebrows, quite surprised. After pondering for a while, he asked, "Are you a descendant of the Jiang family of Taikun?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, I have some guesses. Blood Extreme was killed by Taikun, and the Taikun disciple Jiang Feng was your ancestor. His targeting of you may be to take revenge on Jiang Feng?"</p><p></p><p>But even Old Xiao felt this reasoning was too far-fetched.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not the prodigy of the Jiang family, and I've fallen out with them. Shouldn't he be supporting me more? This doesn't make sense," Jiang Buping frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps he discovered your talent is too monstrous, and wants to nip the bud of Jiang Feng's monstrous descendant to take revenge on Jiang Feng. That's why he's targeting you?" Old Xiao continued to speculate.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so?" Jiang Buping frowned, feeling the possibility was low. No one else knew about his innate divine soul. Could a Blood Lord like him actually see through the special nature of his soul?</p><p></p><p>"We might as well ask him directly instead of guessing back and forth."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's delicate white finger tapped on the jar, and Blood Extreme, confined inside, was able to move.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was decisive. As soon as he realized he could move, his first action was to self-destruct!</p><p></p><p>Puff! The jar turned blood red in an instant. In a flash, Blood Extreme's figure disappeared from the jar, leaving only a cloud of blood mist.</p><p></p><p>"You can't die in the Soul Capturing Jar!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's delicate white finger tapped the jar again. Blood Extreme, who had turned into blood mist, gradually solidified and regained his form.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme now had a shocked expression. Everything he had experienced had completely exceeded his knowledge and imagination. Being confined as a remnant soul and unable to self-destruct, he could understand. </p><p></p><p>However, when the confinement on his remnant soul was lifted and he had already self-destructed, he still couldn't die and was reconstituted. </p><p></p><p>Even though he was once a Realm Lord level expert, he had never heard of such methods. He was so shocked that his soul trembled.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme let out a low roar, and with a bang, he exploded. A thick cloud of blood energy rolled in the jar, shaking the jar.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, you can't die in the Soul Capturing Jar!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's delicate white finger tapped the Soul Capturing Jar again. The exploded blood energy in the jar condensed once more, and Blood Extreme's form reappeared.</p><p></p><p>"What is this? How are you able to prevent me from self-destructing?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was incredibly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Beside them, Old Xiao also had a shocked expression, staring at the Soul Capturing Jar without blinking. Just this small jar not only confined Blood Extreme's remnant soul inside, but even prevented Blood Extreme from self-destructing.</p><p></p><p>It's worth noting that Blood Extreme was a Realm Lord level expert. To be precise, Blood Extreme was the lord of a small world, one of the earliest strong supporters of the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>He had once obtained a strand of purple light, which made Blood Extreme even more powerful than ordinary Realm Lords and difficult to kill.</p><p></p><p>His soul was also somewhat stronger.</p><p></p><p>But such a powerful expert was now confined in a transparent jar like an exhibit, unable even to self-destruct.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu giggled, "I'm an alchemist cultivator! How to treat souls, how to keep souls from dying, these are all my specialties. This Soul Capturing Jar is an artifact I created by combining my skills as an alchemist cultivator with Fourth Junior Brother's artifact refining methods, various restrictions, my Heavenly Divine Furnace, and my divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"It took me quite a while to refine this Soul Capturing Jar. It has a special property: besides confining souls, it can prevent souls from dispersing and consciousness from leaving the jar.</p><p></p><p>"As long as your soul is in the jar, your consciousness cannot leave it. No matter how you try to self-destruct or self-detonate, unless you can shatter the jar, your soul and consciousness will always remain diffused inside the jar.</p><p></p><p>"And I can easily reconstitute the diffused soul and consciousness. Do you understand? The deeper principles are beyond your comprehension. You just need to know that now, unless you can shatter the jar, no matter how you try to self-destruct, you can't die!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme unconsciously swallowed. He looked at the transparent jar with disbelief. What kind of miraculous technique could create such an artifact?</p><p></p><p>Now, upon careful sensing, he realized the special and miraculous nature of this jar.</p><p></p><p>When it needed to confine, it could isolate his consciousness and cut off all perception of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it could lift the confinement, allowing him inside the jar to perceive everything outside, yet still unable to break out of the jar.</p><p></p><p>"I, Blood Extreme, admit defeat. Kill me or torture me as you wish. But confining me in a jar like this, humiliating me like this, is this the behavior of a true man?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme glared angrily.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu blinked her bright eyes and extended a delicate white finger to poke the jar. Blood Extreme immediately felt a slight force, like a small finger, poking his soul body.</p><p></p><p>"Are you blind? How am I a man?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's face darkened. Then he saw Old Xiao and said through gritted teeth, "You little Xiao brat, if you want to kill me then kill me. How dare you humiliate me like this? Let your disciple kill me. I, Blood Extreme, admit defeat!"</p><p></p><p>He instinctively assumed that Su Lingxiu was Old Xiao's disciple, and that this Soul Capturing Jar must have been created by Old Xiao.</p><p></p><p>As the foremost of the Seven Heroes of Taicang, with exceptional talent and most valued by Taicang, it would make sense for him to have such abilities.</p><p></p><p>"You think too highly of me. How could I possibly have the ability to teach such an outstanding disciple?" Old Xiao shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was stunned. Xu Yan and the others were not Old Xiao's disciples?</p><p></p><p>"Then whose disciples are they? Let their master come. Kill me or torture me as you wish. We are beings of the same level, why humiliate me like this!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme then angrily said.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao looked at Blood Extreme with disdain and said, "Don't flatter yourself. How dare you claim to be on the same level as the senior? What are you? Not to mention you, even the Netherworld doesn't qualify to stand on the same level as the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was stunned for a moment, then his pupils contracted as if he had realized something. He exclaimed in a lost voice, "Is it Senior Taicang? He didn't perish?"</p><p></p><p>In this world, those who even the Netherworld's World Lord couldn't stand on the same level with were, in a sense, only two people.</p><p></p><p>One was the expert from the Unmelting Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>The other was Taicang!</p><p></p><p>And from Xiao's words, it obviously couldn't be the one from the Unmelting Divine Palace. Since it was...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Besides Tai Cang, there couldn't possibly be a second person.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, only Tai Cang would have the ability to train such a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>From this, it's clear that Tai Cang has figured out new marvelous methods of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>However, could it be that in that battle, Tai Cang didn't actually perish, but instead stood on equal footing with that figure from the Immutable Divine Temple? Thinking of this, Blood Extreme had a sudden realization. No wonder that although a hole appeared in Tai Cang's realm, the impact wasn't great and the entire realm remained intact. And that figure from the Immutable Divine Temple didn't move to invade Tai Cang's realm.</p><p></p><p>So it turns out Tai Cang isn't dead?! "Since it's Senior Tai Cang, I, Blood Extreme, submit. I'm willing to plead guilty and admit my wrongs. Whether you want to kill me or flay me, I'll accept it. Senior Tai Cang wouldn't humiliate me like this."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Blood Extreme looked at Su Lingxiu and said solemnly: "Young lady, if you want to kill me, then just kill me. Torturing me like this damages your master's dignity!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had a strange expression, and couldn't help but sigh inwardly that Tai Cang was truly legendary - a powerful figure like Blood Extreme immediately thought of Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>"Master is truly too low-key!" </p><p></p><p>She sighed inwardly, but then denied it, "It's not that Master is too low-key, but that Master is too strong. There are few in the world qualified to know about Master, which is why Master seems low-key."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao looked somewhat sad and sighed: "Blood Extreme, you're mistaken. Although I also wish Teacher Tai Cang was still alive, he has after all perished. </p><p></p><p>"The senior I speak of, even Teacher Tai Cang isn't qualified to stand on the same level."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was stunned for a moment, then angrily said: "You little Xiao brat, what do you mean? How could there be anyone in this world that Tai Cang isn't qualified to stand on the same level with?</p><p></p><p>"Even that figure from the Immutable Divine Temple isn't qualified to say such words. Could the senior you speak of be that figure from the Immutable Divine Temple? You, one of Tai Cang's Seven Heroes, have actually joined the Immutable Divine Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's expression was calm, even somewhat smug. In terms of seniority, Blood Extreme was older than him, an even more ancient existence, yet he didn't know about the Ancestor of the Dao. </p><p></p><p>While he himself was fortunate enough to receive guidance from the Ancestor of the Dao! Thinking of this, Old Man Xiao suddenly felt somewhat superior, looking down at Blood Extreme with a gaze as if looking at a country bumpkin.</p><p></p><p>"You little Xiao brat, what kind of look is that?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was furious. He was an ancient existence, from the same era as Tai Cang, yet Old Man Xiao dared to look at him like that, truly detestable!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Extreme, you're unworthy of being an ancient minor realm lord. You haven't even heard of the Ancestor of the Dao, no wonder you've ended up in such a state. You're too ignorant and ill-informed. The level of the Ancestor of the Dao is unparalleled throughout history, he is the ancestor of the great Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme exploded with anger, truly exploded. With a bang, he burst into a cloud of blood qi inside the jar. The shock was so great that the jar shook, and even faint cracking sounds could be heard, as if it might shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu hurriedly pointed a finger to stabilize the jar, glaring at Old Man Xiao and saying: "Stop provoking him. If he really shatters the jar, I'll lose a research subject."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, I'll leave him be." Old Man Xiao apologized with a smile, then left to focus on comprehending the qi of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I need to find Master to help reinforce the jar!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu carried the jar excitedly to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, please help reinforce this jar."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Blood Extreme in the jar. This was a very good remnant soul that would become one of Su Lingxiu's prized collections, used to study the soul of a minor realm lord.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and pointed, and strands of profound meaning appeared, transforming into an abstruse symbol that instantly fell into the jar.</p><p></p><p>The jar trembled slightly, and instantly became different. Let alone Blood Extreme being just a remnant soul, even a complete soul trapped inside would be unable to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme had also reconstituted himself. Hearing Su Lingxiu's words, he suddenly looked up, and was instantly dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence was that? In his eyes, it was as if he saw the vastness of ancient times, the primordial chaos before the mixing of elements, or perhaps the scene before time was born, or at the beginning of time.</p><p></p><p>It was also as if he saw the profound Dao he had once glimpsed by chance when traveling in the Immutable Lands. And these Daos were intertwined, as if he was the embodiment of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>He even saw a wondrous light that even that purple light couldn't reach.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he finally understood that the little Xiao brat's words were true. Even Tai Cang wasn't qualified to stand on the same level as such an existence.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to speak, Su Lingxiu had already moved him away, placing him back on the original table.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's gaze towards Su Lingxiu and the others changed. No wonder they were such prodigies, no wonder they could forge such marvelous and extraordinary treasures.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Buping had already interrupted him, coldly asking: "You're Blood Extreme, right? An old fossil from the Netherworld. Let me ask you, why did you target me? I, Jiang Buping, have no grudge against you, right?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was stunned, with a look of disbelief, then cried out injustice: "It's unjust, I didn't target you!"</p><p></p><p>If Jiang Buping wasn't the disciple of such an unfathomable existence, he wouldn't have bothered to explain himself. But realizing that Jiang Buping was the disciple of such a terrifying powerhouse, he didn't dare to bear these crimes.</p><p></p><p>He had to explain himself!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he truly was wronged. The two times people sought him out just happened to have grudges against Jiang Buping, and he merely went along with it.</p><p></p><p>His main purpose was to restore himself and rise again. If he wanted revenge, it would be against that brat Jiang Feng!</p><p></p><p>"Unjust?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sneered and said: "Jiang Tianming targeted me, and when I sought revenge on him, you were in his soul. Now this person has come to seek revenge on me for Yun Yan'er, and you're in his soul again.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, whether it's Jiang Tianming or the one just now, the martial arts secrets they cultivated were all taught by you. This time, you even taught him methods to resist soul techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Are all these just coincidences?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was almost dumbfounded, but all of this really was coincidence! "Yes, coincidence, it's all coincidence!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was on the verge of tears, and hurriedly added: "You have to believe me, it really is coincidence, truly, I'm not lying to you. Jiang Tianming sought me out to help strengthen him to deal with you, his enemy.</p><p></p><p>"Think about it, I was just left with a remnant soul. I had a chance to make a comeback, even a chance to recover, and could use this to get revenge on that brat Jiang Feng. Why wouldn't I do it? So, this is all coincidence!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme hastily added: "As for this one, he insisted on seeking revenge on you. I couldn't stop him, could I? If I didn't satisfy him, how could I cultivate him as a substitute seed? The more frenzied he became, the more beneficial it was for me. I never imagined you would be so powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping frowned. His intuition told him that Blood Extreme didn't seem to be lying, and all of this really was coincidence!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

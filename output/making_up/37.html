            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 37 - Today the Teacher Will Show a Trick (Seeking Continued Reading)</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, seemingly carefree, but he had some worries in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, Xu Yan still hadn't cultivated the Dragon Subduing Palm. Could it be that the foundation he laid was too broad, making it difficult for him to comprehend?</p><p></p><p>"No need to rush, as long as I can see progress, it means there is still hope."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan comforted himself.</p><p></p><p>"Even if he can't cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm, as long as his cultivation keeps improving, as long as he can reach the Innate Realm, it's fine to say he doesn't have the talent for the Dragon Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>"Teach him the Sword Dao instead?</p><p></p><p>"That should be easier to cultivate, right? Xu Yan seems to have more talent in the Sword Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, if he were to teach Xu Yan the Sword Dao, how should he arrange it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had always worn a treasured sword, indicating that he was quite interested in sword techniques, which meant his talent in the Sword Dao should be relatively strong.</p><p></p><p>How to teach him the Sword Dao, that was the problem. After all, Li Xuan didn't know any sword techniques or sword laws, he could only gesture blindly.</p><p></p><p>How to compile a set of Sword Dao theories that Xu Yan could comprehend, that was the real issue.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer, perhaps one day, a flash of inspiration will come, and he'll cultivate the Dragon Subduing Palm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan focused his mind, trying to explore that golden light, but still found nothing.</p><p></p><p>"This golden finger, how does it work? Can it only appear passively?"</p><p></p><p>He shifted his body to lie more comfortably.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had planned to move house after Xu Yan returned.</p><p></p><p>But now, with the task of imparting martial arts to Xu Yan, he had to continue staying in the small village.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has cultivated the introductory Dragon Subduing Palm you compiled, and you have reached the mastery of the Dragon Subduing Palm, with a power ten times that of the same realm."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuan's mind, the true meaning of the Dragon Subduing Palm surfaced, instantly reaching the Mastery Realm, and its power was ten times that of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, his gaze seemed to reveal the scene of eighteen hundred-zhang giant dragons roaring and circling.</p><p></p><p>"Damn!</p><p></p><p>"My disciple is amazing, he really did cultivate it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>He jumped up from the chair and directly left the small village.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the slope where Xu Yan was cultivating, he could see from afar two seven or eight-zhang scarlet red dragons, circling and flying agilely, crashing into the ground and creating a large pit.</p><p></p><p>His heart started to itch.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, not bad, your Dragon Subduing Palm can be considered as having reached the introductory level."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked leisurely, his tone carrying a hint of gratification.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Xu Yan stopped his practice and respectfully saluted. "It is thanks to your excellent guidance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the ground, with large and small pits densely covering the area, and the surrounding vegetation had been destroyed and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dragon Subduing Palm, although it has form, lacks vitality.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have cultivated it, I no longer need to worry about it affecting your cultivation of the Dragon Subduing Palm. Today, I will show you a trick, and you can see how the Qi and Blood Realm's Dragon Subduing Palm looks when it reaches mastery."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan emphasized that this was the Dragon Subduing Palm of the Qi and Blood Realm, and not his true strength.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Master is going to display the Dragon Subduing Palm of the Qi and Blood Realm, hopefully he can also gain some insights from it.</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully!" Li Xuan raised his hand and struck out a palm.</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>A dragon's roar echoed, and a golden hundred-zhang giant dragon burst forth, actually raising its head and letting out a dragon's roar, as if it were alive.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon flew out, its claws reaching out to tear apart a large tree.</p><p></p><p>Its tail swept across the ground, opening a deep furrow.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon finally crashed heavily into the ground, creating a large pit!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained calm, as if it was just a casual slap, insignificant.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>This palm strike, he had used his full strength.</p><p></p><p>The Dragon Subduing Palm at the Mastery Realm had already...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a somewhat "living" form, coupled with his power ten times greater than his peers, this strike displayed an utterly powerful, fierce, and unparalleled force.</p><p></p><p>Even though Xu Yan had cultivated to the peak, he was still far from possessing such power.</p><p></p><p>This is the powerful might of my teacher!</p><p></p><p>After all, Li Xuan's Descending Dragon Palm was ten times stronger than his peers.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes widened in shock.</p><p></p><p>"This is just the Descending Dragon Palm at the Qi and Blood Realm? It's too terrifying! Such power, one person can easily defeat an entire army.</p><p></p><p>"My teacher just casually slapped, and yet had such might.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, my teacher's Descending Dragon Palm could even emit a roar, like a living dragon.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still far behind!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shaken in his heart, realizing his own inadequacies.</p><p></p><p>His Descending Dragon Palm lacked vitality compared to his teacher's.</p><p></p><p>It still seemed stiff and rigid in comparison.</p><p></p><p>"Dragons have divine abilities, changing with the situation. So this is what the incantation should be like. This is just a dragon at the Qi and Blood Realm, if the realm is higher, would the dragon summoned have true divine abilities?"</p><p></p><p>The deeper Xu Yan pondered, the more he imagined, feeling increasingly awed by the power and profundity of the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p>While his own comprehension of the Descending Dragon Palm incantation was still only superficial.</p><p></p><p>Seeing his disciple's shocked expression, Li Xuan felt content in his heart, and walked away with a leisurely pace, hands clasped behind his back.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, do not be affected by my palm's power. You must comprehend the Descending Dragon Palm that belongs to you."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!" Xu Yan bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, since you've mastered the Descending Dragon Palm, you should also ponder more on the Bagua (Eight Trigrams)."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since the Descending Dragon Palm cultivation was successful, let Xu Yan delve deeper into the Bagua. If he could also gain insights, Li Xuan would receive powerful feedback as well.</p><p></p><p>He had set a very high and profound definition for the Bagua.</p><p></p><p>It was not just something that could be cultivated at the Qi and Blood Realm, but something that could be continuously comprehended and cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Each stage could bring different insights.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this all depended on whether Xu Yan could achieve it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The weather gradually grew colder as autumn deepened, the chill becoming more pronounced.</p><p></p><p>But for Li Xuan, this winter would pass quite comfortably, even if his clothes were thin, he would not feel the cold.</p><p></p><p>These days, Xu Yan had spent more time on the Bagua.</p><p></p><p>He maneuvered nimbly on the Bagua diagram, his body agility and speed greatly improved, but he still had not comprehended a set of body techniques.</p><p></p><p>Watching the nimble and fast-moving Xu Yan stepping on the Bagua, Li Xuan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because there is no incantation, so he cannot gain insights?"</p><p></p><p>"The Bagua I explained contains too much, not just body techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because there is no transmitted incantation for body techniques, so he couldn't comprehend them?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Li Xuan began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try composing two incantation lines."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recalled that his disciple's breakthrough from Bronze Bone to Golden Bone was related to the cultivating technique he had randomly composed.</p><p></p><p>And the successful cultivation of the Descending Dragon Palm was also from the incantation he had provided.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was able to comprehend and cultivate the technique from the incantation.</p><p></p><p>So, while the theoretical framework might be present, it may not necessarily lead to successful cultivation. If accompanied by cultivation techniques and incantations, the chances of success would greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>"How should I compose the body technique incantation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>A gust of wind blew by, and a few yellowed leaves on the distant branches drifted down.</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight struck Li Xuan's mind: "I've got it!"</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

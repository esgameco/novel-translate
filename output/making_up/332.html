        <h1>Chapter 332</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Cerulean Sea City is located in the Cerulean Sea domain, far, far away from the outer sea of Wuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Submerge Sea Boat did not fly in the sky, but fell into the sea, speeding across the surface.</p><p></p><p>Since he had arrived at the Cerulean Sea, if he continued to fly in midair, wouldn't that be a wasted trip to the Cerulean Sea? After sailing for several days, Xu Yan suddenly became interested and took out a fishing rod.</p><p></p><p>"When my master was on Canglan Island, he liked to go fishing in the Cangjiang River. There must be a deep meaning to it. Is he comprehending the Tao of Heaven and Earth?</p><p></p><p>"Or is it a kind of cultivation of the state of mind?</p><p></p><p>"I feel that my master is hinting through his actions that fishing is a way to comprehend oneself, purify the mind, and cultivate the state of mind."</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan thought about it, the more reasonable it seemed.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the fishing rod in his hand, this was the one he had Fang Hao forge for him, just waiting for the day when he could try fishing like his master and see if he would gain anything.</p><p></p><p>"What bait should I use?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself, taking out a medicinal pill and hanging it on the hook.</p><p></p><p>The fishing line and hook were forged by Fang Hao, at the Spiritual Artifact level. Once hooked, there would be no escaping.</p><p></p><p>Without exaggeration, even a sea beast comparable to the Refinement Deity realm would not be able to break free! The overlord of the Cerulean Sea is undoubtedly the Sea Spirit Tribe, but in addition to the Sea Spirits, there are many other sea beasts.</p><p></p><p>According to Cai Lingyi, there are several types of sea beasts in the Cerulean Sea, whose strength in adulthood is comparable to Refinement Deity cultivators, only they do not understand the ways of the Martial Dao, relying solely on brute force.</p><p></p><p>And with their intelligence not yet awakened, despite their formidable strength, ordinary Refinement Deity cultivators would still find it difficult to hunt such ferocious sea beasts alone.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the sea beasts' intelligence is not yet awakened, when faced with danger, they also have the instinct to avoid it, retreating into the depths of the sea.</p><p></p><p>Human cultivators, once they enter the sea, unless their strength is far superior, would be powerless against such powerful sea beasts.</p><p></p><p>And Refinement Deity-level sea beasts are almost the exclusive hunting targets of the Sea Spirit Tribe, and are also the main trading items between the Sea Spirit Tribe and human cultivators in the Cerulean Sea City.</p><p></p><p>The Submerge Sea Boat sped through the Cerulean Sea, until it was far from the coastal waters of Wuzhou, only then did Xu Yan lower the hook to start fishing.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the hook was cast, Xu Yan found that some sea fish had appeared, wanting to bite the bait, but he immediately sent a pulse of spiritual energy, directly blasting the sea fish away.</p><p></p><p>"I'm here to fish for big fish, not small fish."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered.</p><p></p><p>The Submerge Sea Boat continued forward, heading towards the Cerulean Sea domain.</p><p></p><p>After two days of fishing, he still hadn't encountered any sea beasts comparable to the Refinement Deity realm, Xu Yan couldn't help but feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he thought, "My mindset is wrong. Since this is fishing, why should I care about big fish or small fish? Wouldn't that go against the original intention of fishing?"</p><p></p><p>With this realization, Xu Yan no longer paid attention to what kind of sea fish were attracted to the hook.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he hooked a fish about three feet long, Xu Yan changed the bait and continued fishing.</p><p></p><p>After catching a few fish of different sizes, this time Xu Yan cast the hook far away, covering the bait with a spiritual energy restriction, so that only Refinement Deity-level sea beasts could bite the bait and eat it.</p><p></p><p>Sitting cross-legged on the Submerge Sea Boat, Xu Yan continued to cultivate and comprehend the Martial Dao, the boat sailing along the set course, the fishing rod hanging on the small boat, fishing at random.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Xu Yan, who was in the midst of cultivation, suddenly opened his eyes, the fishing rod was shaking, transmitting a huge pulling force.</p><p></p><p>It's hooked! Xu Yan was overjoyed, in front of the Submerge Sea Boat, the waves were surging, a huge brown sea beast was struggling, but it was unable to break free from the hook.</p><p></p><p>"This sea beast's strength is comparable to the late Refinement Deity realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The struggling sea beast suddenly turned and charged towards the Submerge Sea Boat, Xu Yan smiled slightly, raised his hand and pressed down, a force suppressed the charging sea beast.</p><p></p><p>After the sea beast stopped struggling, he released the force.</p><p></p><p>After a few such rounds, the sea beast realized the danger of the Submerge Sea Boat and began to flee frantically, pulling the Submerge Sea Boat speeding across the Cerulean Sea.</p><p></p><p>"This direction is just right for going to the Cerulean Sea domain, let it pull us along."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan directly closed the Submerge Sea Boat, letting the sea beast pull it along on the sea.</p><p></p><p>The sea beast's endurance was astonishing, and its speed was extremely fast, pulling the Submerge Sea Boat in flight. Occasionally it tried to dive into the sea to break free, but it was unable to pull the Submerge Sea Boat down, after a few attempts, the sea beast could only keep fleeing forward.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat on the Submerge Sea Boat, continuing his cultivation and comprehension of his own Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>A day later, the sea beast was still frantically fleeing, and its speed was getting faster and faster, about to charge recklessly.</p><p></p><p>On the big ship, the Blood Knife Bandit leader was excited as he approached the corner where the female cultivator was lying, "You're finally obedient, grandpa's just going to take a little, compared to those who lost everything, you're much luckier!"</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator bit her lip, eyes closed, daring not to say a word, her trembling delicate body revealing the fear in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"My beauty, grandpa's here!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandit hastily undressed, about to pounce, when suddenly a loud crash came, accompanied by a roar! The sudden commotion startled him, causing him to immediately soften, his face turning pale as he looked in the direction of the sound, then hurriedly put on his clothes, knife in hand.</p><p></p><p>The female cultivator was also startled awake by the commotion, she was surprised to see a huge sea beast leaping out from behind the ship, letting out an angry roar.</p><p></p><p>And behind the sea beast, it seemed to be pulling a strange blue little boat.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, kill the sea beast!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandit leader shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>This sea beast seemed to be charging towards the big ship.</p><p></p><p>The sudden turn of events caused the Refinement Deity cultivators who were prepared to surrender, to suddenly become delighted, after a brief exchange, they suddenly took to the air, fleeing in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>Rather than leaving their lives in the hands of the Blood Knife Bandits, they might as well seize the chance to escape! Twenty or so Refinement Deity cultivators, joining forces and breaking out, causing the Blood Knife Bandits in that direction to change color, hastily avoiding the onslaught.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandit leader roared furiously, waving his hand, "Kill them!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh!</p><p></p><p>A group of Blood Knife Bandits charged forward with their knives, intending to chase down the fleeing Refinement Deity cultivators, while two Blood Knife Bandits raised their knives and slashed towards the huge sea beast in midair.</p><p></p><p>This sea beast was not weak in strength, its skin and flesh were thick, its defensive power was astonishing, a single slash might not be able to slay it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was in cultivation, opened his eyes, slightly surprised that the sea beast actually wanted to ram the big ship, trying to use that as a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>"It does know how to use the environment to avoid danger."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the two blood-red sword lights slashing towards the sea beast, Xu Yan gave a tug on the fishing rod, pulling the sea beast that was about to leap onto the big ship back towards him.</p><p></p><p>The two sword lights missed their target.</p><p></p><p>"Apologies, the sea beast I was fishing startled you all!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said apologetically.</p><p></p><p>The Submerge Sea Boat flew up, he waved his hand, a surge of spiritual energy lifting the sea beast into the air, the Submerge Sea Boat flying over the big ship.</p><p></p><p>"Robbery, leave the sea beast and that small boat!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure blocked his path, holding a blood-red long knife.</p><p></p><p>With this angry shout, a group of Blood Knife Bandits...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bandits, including the Blood Knife Bandits who were preparing to hunt down the Refiner's Martial Cultivator, all returned and surrounded Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Knife Bandits' eyes gleamed, staring intently at the Fleeing Sea Boat - this was a treasure!</p><p></p><p>It was fast and could even fly in the air. If they could obtain this treasure, the Blood Knife Bandits would become even more elusive.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback. "Robbing me?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure you want to rob me?" he asked the group of Blood Knife Bandits.</p><p></p><p>The leader of the Blood Knife Bandits spoke in a deep voice, "Young man, the Blood Knife Bandits have always had principles. Leave the sea beast and the small boat, and you can go. We won't take your life. Otherwise, there will be another corpse on this azure sea!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled. Pirates have principles too? Cai Lingér had mentioned that there were some pirates in the Azure Sea, but the chances of encountering them were low, and there were only a few incidents of people being robbed by pirates in a year.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for Xu Yan, pirates were no threat to him at all. Cai Lingér had just mentioned them in passing when introducing the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he had encountered pirates trying to rob him shortly after entering the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>"I'm also a man of principles," Xu Yan said, looking at the group of Blood Knife Bandits with a smile. "Hand over your storage bags, and you can be spared. Otherwise, I'll grind your bones to dust and disperse your souls!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandits were stunned, their faces filled with disbelief. What did this young man mean? Robbing them in return? One person robbing a group?</p><p></p><p>Who gave him the audacity?</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good. In all my life, the Blood Knife Bandits have never encountered someone as arrogant as you. Alone, you actually dare to rob us?" The leader sneered. "You have courage, you have arrogance. Although I admire young people like you, but..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, he was suddenly slapped across the face and sent flying, his head spinning and stars dancing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Enough nonsense, hand over the storage bags!" Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The other Blood Knife Bandits were horrified.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see him strike just now?"</p><p>"No, I only saw the boss fly away."</p><p>"I didn't see it either!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandits whispered to each other, their hearts sinking.</p><p></p><p>"You will die for this!" the Blood Knife Bandit leader roared, his aura erupting, the bloody blade light flashing, his murderous intent palpable.</p><p></p><p>"Attack together, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Although he was shocked, he was not panicked. With their numerical advantage, how could this opponent be their match?</p><p></p><p>But just as he spoke, a sword light descended, and in an instant, he was slain.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Blood Knife Bandits preparing to attack were suddenly chilled to the bone. Their leader had been killed by a single sword strike? Even if they attacked together, the casualties would be heavy. Moreover, with their leader dead, they were now leaderless.</p><p></p><p>"Don't attack, young hero, don't attack. We'll hand over the storage bags, the storage bags!" the Blood Knife Bandits said, their faces pale with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it. I'm not a bloodthirsty person. Hand over the ransom money," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly, the Blood Knife Bandits handed over their storage bags, their faces full of pain. As pirates, all their wealth was carried on them, and the contents of the storage bags were their entire accumulation.</p><p></p><p>Handing them over left them destitute. Xu Yan waved his hand, collecting all the storage bags, then pointed at a few Blood Knife Bandits, saying, "Hand over the hidden storage bags, or die!"</p><p></p><p>Those few Blood Knife Bandits looked unsightly, but could only obediently hand over their second storage bags.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can all leave now," Xu Yan said, waving his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" The group of Blood Knife Bandits frantically nodded and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and the sea beast he had controlled plunged back into the sea, ready to continue pulling the Fleeing Sea Boat towards the Cloud Sky Sea region, conserving his spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful of the Blood Knife Bandits!" a woman's voice came from the large ship.</p><p></p><p>"Die!" The group of Blood Knife Bandits, seeing an opportunity with Xu Yan's momentary lapse, suddenly raised their blades to attack.</p><p></p><p>They had secretly agreed to strike together, and the bloody blade light filled the sky, their powerful attacks seemingly about to engulf Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandits' faces were twisted with ferocity. They had always been the ones robbing others, how could they be robbed?</p><p></p><p>That woman on the ship had dared to give a warning, and after killing this young man, they would make her know the cruelty of the Blood Knife Bandits.</p><p></p><p>"You're just courting death. Why bother?" Xu Yan sighed, raising his index and middle fingers and slashing them backwards. Suddenly, a sword light appeared, slashing through the air and dispersing all the attacks.</p><p></p><p>The blade light scattered, and the sword light came slashing down, transforming into over twenty sword lights, each one targeting a Blood Knife Bandit.</p><p></p><p>With horrified gazes, the Blood Knife Bandits were one by one slain, their bodies turning to ash.</p><p></p><p>On the large ship, the group of martial cultivators were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>Especially the woman who had just given the warning, she had prepared to meet a tragic end at the hands of the Blood Knife Bandits. But not only did this man rob a group single-handedly, he also slew the Blood Knife Bandits with a single sword strike! These Blood Knife Bandits were all at the peak of Refiner's Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sweeping them away with a casual gesture, what tremendous power was this? In the Azure Sea, there couldn't be too many with such strength, could there?</p><p></p><p>The woman suddenly thought of a certain person, the legendary existence whose sword dao was praised as the greatest in the world.</p><p></p><p>After slaying the Blood Knife Bandits, Xu Yan prepared to have the sea beast continue pulling the Fleeing Sea Boat towards the Cloud Sky Sea region.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Knife Bandits' strength was not weak, but they were no longer in Xu Yan's sight at the peak of Refiner's Realm. He could easily slay them with a casual gesture.</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators who had refined the spiritual energy of heaven and earth were not worthy of his attention. The only ones who could truly engage him in a battle to the fullest were experts like the Thousand Martial Hall's Saber Elder.</p><p></p><p>The ones who could truly let him unleash his full strength were only those at the level of Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>He was already not far from reaching the perfect Spiritual Origin Realm, and his strength had far surpassed when he first entered the Spiritual Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to command the sea beast to pull the boat and leave, a woman's voice suddenly called out.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor, please wait!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned back, seeing the woman who had just given the warning.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>The woman's appearance was stunningly beautiful, with a graceful and alluring bearing. She was at the initial stage of Refiner's Realm.</p><p></p><p>The woman's expression was excited. She never expected the legendary number one in the sword dao to be so young and handsome, causing her heart to flutter.</p><p></p><p>"Benefactor, are you the Sword King?"</p>

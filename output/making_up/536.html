        <h1>Chapter 536</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Regarding instilling the idea of "it's for your own good," Stone Two considered himself very familiar with it. Although he had failed with Red Cat before, this time he was absolutely certain he wouldn't fail.</p><p></p><p>After all, Red Cat had cultivated into a demon and gained rationality, which is why he had failed then.</p><p></p><p>But Mu Xie was different. </p><p></p><p>Although Mu Xie was a powerful being, he had been intimidated by the Dao Ancestor's might. The Dao Ancestor's immeasurable power had deeply penetrated his soul.</p><p></p><p>And the Dao Ancestor hadn't killed him, only punished him to sweep the ground and remove his fierce aura. This created room to instill the idea of "it's for your own good."</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although Mu Xie was strong, his powers were now restricted. He was no longer a powerful being, and his judgment, soul acuity, etc. were no longer in a powerful state.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two clasped his hands behind his back and put on a serious expression as he watched Mu Xie sweep the ground, watching him sweep the fallen leaves into a pile.</p><p></p><p>The broom was heavy, and Mu Xie's powers were restricted, so after sweeping once, he was exhausted. Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>This was unimaginable in the past.</p><p></p><p>However, Mu Xie had gotten used to it. After finishing sweeping, he put down the broom and prepared to rest for a while, planning to gather up and remove the leaves after recovering his strength.</p><p></p><p>He didn't know why there were so many fallen leaves every day, but he could only repeat the sweeping daily. Although it was a bit monotonous, it was much better than being captured for dissection.</p><p></p><p>Poof! But then he saw Stone Two wave his hand, and with a whoosh, the swept-up leaves scattered everywhere on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"You!" </p><p></p><p>Mu Xie was instantly enraged.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two glared at him. "What, you want to complain? You think I'm making things difficult for you? Later, sweep the ground clean. If it's not clean, there will be punishment!"</p><p></p><p>Whap! Stone Two pulled out a whip.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie was trembling with anger. In his current old man appearance, this scene was as if Stone Two, the villain, was bullying an elderly person!</p><p></p><p>For several days in a row, Mu Xie was mistreated. He was full of resentment towards Stone Two, and was even whipped a few times by Stone Two for his resentful glares.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Mu Xie began to miss Feng Yan. In comparison, Feng Yan was really a good person!</p><p></p><p>Holding the heavy broom and sweeping the fallen leaves into a pile, Mu Xie coldly watched Stone Two, waiting for him to scatter the leaves again and make him clean up once more to humiliate him.</p><p></p><p>However, to his surprise, Stone Two didn't do that today.</p><p></p><p>"Are you wondering why I'm not making things difficult for you today?" Stone Two said with a serious face.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie was stunned for a moment and nodded unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>"I'm teaching you!" </p><p></p><p>Stone Two clasped his hands behind his back and lifted his head slightly to look at the sky.</p><p></p><p>He felt delighted inside. He had even taught a Lord of Heaven and Earth level powerhouse - what a glorious achievement.</p><p></p><p>"You must think Feng Yan is a good person now, right?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie stared at Stone Two, unable to figure out what this hateful fellow was trying to say.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two lowered his head to look at him and said solemnly: "I'm guiding you, making you understand what a great opportunity the Dao Ancestor has bestowed upon you. You should be grateful!"</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for Mu Xie to speak, Stone Two continued: "Feng Yan was strict with you, but didn't make things difficult for you. I'm not only strict, but also make things difficult for you. Who do you think treats you better?" Naturally, Feng Yan treats you better. You must be missing Feng Yan now, and this is the principle I want to teach you and make you understand.</p><p></p><p>"In the Unmetamorphosed Divine Palace, were you constrained? Were you constantly dealing with affairs and trying to achieve certain goals?" Think about it, what's the difference between being here with the Dao Ancestor and being in the Unmetamorphosed Divine Palace?</p><p></p><p>"Think again, what kind of being is the Dao Ancestor? Any other powerful being would have killed you. For example, would the powerful beings in the Unmetamorphosed Divine Palace kill you?" But the Dao Ancestor didn't kill you. Instead, he's educating you, making you sweep the ground to remove your fierce aura. Once the fierce aura is gone, your mental state will improve and your whole being will be elevated. You won't be far from a breakthrough then.</p><p></p><p>"Sweeping, sweeping - it's sweeping away the dust in your heart, sweeping away the impure thoughts in your soul, purifying yourself. Once you're purified, you can advance further. Think about what an opportunity this is.</p><p></p><p>"This is a great opportunity bestowed by the Dao Ancestor. You must seize it and be grateful. How many powerful beings desire the Dao Ancestor's guidance but can't hope for it? How fortunate you are.</p><p></p><p>"I, Stone Two, couldn't bear to see you miss the opportunity bestowed by the Dao Ancestor. That's why I used this method to enlighten you, to make you fully understand, so you won't miss this opportunity and waste the Dao Ancestor's good intentions. I'm doing this for your own good!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two spoke earnestly with a solemn expression, leaving Mu Xie stunned. Thinking carefully, it did seem to be the case.</p><p></p><p>His situation and state of mind when Feng Yan was in charge of him were completely different from when Stone Two was in charge.</p><p></p><p>Wasn't this just like how his situation and state of mind were different in the Unmetamorphosed Divine Palace compared to being in the Dao Ancestor's courtyard?</p><p></p><p>The Dao Ancestor was so powerful that he could crush him like an ant, yet he didn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>If it were that person from the Unmetamorphosed Divine Palace, if he dared to offend them, he would probably have been suppressed and severely punished long ago.</p><p></p><p>"Is the Dao Ancestor educating me?!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie thought in a daze.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two said in a deep voice: "Although the broom is heavy, it's tempering your will. It also allows you to relax after exhaustion. Can you feel how pleasant it is to relax after being tired..."</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie was stunned. Indeed, after finishing the tiring work, he could finally rest. His whole body felt relaxed and comfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be?" Mu Xie began to speak, somewhat incredulously.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this is one of the Dao Ancestor's teachings, letting you experience various aspects of the mortal world to lay a foundation for your breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"You should be grateful to the Dao Ancestor, grateful for his teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie looked back at the courtyard, as if seeing the mysterious Dao Ancestor teaching and guiding him. Did he have a chance to break through his limitations and increase his power?</p><p></p><p>"Kneel down and show your gratitude. Listen to me, you won't go wrong. I'm doing this for your own good!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two reminded him via voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie knelt down towards the small courtyard. "Mu Xie thanks the Dao Ancestor for his educational grace!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. This Stone Two fellow had learned how to deceive, spinning such a convincing tale that he had fooled Mu Xie completely.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was because Mu Xie's powers were restricted, causing him to ultimately lose the acuity and perception of a powerful being, which is why he could be easily deceived.</p><p></p><p>But regardless, Mu Xie had been fooled by both Stone Two and Feng Yan. He would soon wholeheartedly feel grateful to him, the Dao Ancestor, grateful for the Dao Ancestor's teachings. He would revere the Dao Ancestor from his soul and bones. If anyone dared to disrespect the Dao Ancestor, he would be the first to jump out and punish the disrespectful person!</p><p></p><p>"Sweep the ground well, calm your mind, be introspective, and settle yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice was like the sound of the great Dao, entering directly into the soul.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Dao Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie bowed respectfully before standing up and voluntarily scattering the fallen leaves, then began sweeping again at a steady pace.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Mu Xie became respectful towards Stone Two, almost completely obedient, never showing any contempt due to Stone Two's weak power.</p><p></p><p>"An old man sweeping the ground in front of the Dao Ancestor's door is a Lord of Heaven and Earth level powerhouse. This truly befits the doorstep of me, the Dao Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Cai Ling'er, thinking that for a maid, her strength was too weak. How could the Dao Ancestor's maid be so weak? With this in mind, Li Xuan began instructing Cai Ling'er on cultivation, urging her to quickly increase her strength.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's almost ready," Su Lingxiu said excitedly as she watched the Blood Demon in meditation.</p><p></p><p>"Can Blood Ji's soul seed now contend with the Blood Demon's soul for dominance?" Tianzi asked, stroking his chin.</p><p></p><p>"Even if it can't completely replace the Blood Demon, it can at least stand on equal footing. The Blood Demon won't be able to target the world anymore, even if he wants to. He'll have to focus all his attention on dealing with Blood Ji," Su Lingxiu replied confidently after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"What if the Blood Demon seeks help from that person in the Immutable Divine Palace?" Tianzi asked worriedly. </p><p></p><p>If the truth about the Great Wilderness was exposed, the Blood Demon would surely retaliate furiously. The Immutable Divine Palace would also discover the changes in the Great Wilderness world and take action early. This would cause the Great Wilderness to lose its opportunity to quietly grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I asked my master to add some safeguards for Blood Ji. When the sub-soul is drawn back, Blood Ji will take its place. At first, the Blood Demon won't realize the truth. He'll mistakenly think there's a problem with his sub-soul, that it's trying to betray him and take over.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, to keep it secret, the Blood Demon won't seek help from others. He'll find a hidden place to try to resolve the sub-soul issue on his own.</p><p></p><p>"By the time he discovers the problem and learns the truth, it will be too late for him to seek help. He won't dare to ask for assistance anyway," Su Lingxiu smiled, having already arranged everything.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, let's begin," Tianzi nodded upon hearing this. Since the Dao Ancestor had personally guaranteed Blood Ji's safety, this matter was sure to proceed smoothly. </p><p></p><p>Blood Ji would replace the Blood Demon without anyone knowing.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, the Blood Demon's sub-soul is just half a step away from establishing the Dao. Once it takes that half step, the sub-soul will transform and have the possibility of existing independently from the Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, the Blood Demon must draw back the sub-soul and merge with it before it breaks through, then break through to establish the Dao together.</p><p></p><p>"Let's create an opportunity for the Blood Demon to draw back his sub-soul," Tianzi said with a smile as he began arranging the power of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Neither the Blood Demon's sub-soul nor his main body realized that this was all fake - an illusion created by the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>In the consciousness of the Blood Demon's sub-soul, it had already cultivated the Dao Ancestor's great technique and broken through to the Dao Establishment realm, becoming even stronger than the World Rulers.</p><p></p><p>Now, it was just half a step away from surpassing Dao Establishment.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if some consciousness was telling it that once it broke through, it would become independent. Of course, this was also known to the Blood Demon's main body.</p><p></p><p>Blood Ji, who had been quietly taking root in the Blood Demon's sub-soul waiting for an opportunity, was now extremely excited. The chance had finally come!</p><p></p><p>He was about to contend with a World Ruler for control, to seize everything from a World Ruler and take his place! Just thinking about it was thrilling!</p><p></p><p>Indeed, his choice back then had been incredibly wise. Otherwise, how could he have such an opportunity?</p><p></p><p>In a distant part of the Immutable Realm, inside a mountain formed from fallen true spirits, bubbles rose in a pool of blood. At a certain moment, the Blood Demon's figure emerged.</p><p></p><p>He frowned, his expression grave.</p><p></p><p>"Once the sub-soul breaks through, it will actually become an independent existence, turning into a separate individual, severing its connection to me. It may even try to kill me in return."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Blood Demon grew restless.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was shocked by the profundity and power of the realm beyond Dao Establishment, that it could allow a sub-soul to directly separate from him and become an independent existence.</p><p></p><p>"This won't do. I must draw back the sub-soul before it breaks through, merge with it and gain everything it has, then break through in one go. After I break through, I can return to the Immutable Divine Palace and take over."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon's eyes flashed with a keen light.</p><p></p><p>Just thinking about taking over and becoming the master of the Immutable Divine Palace filled him with excitement. </p><p></p><p>That lofty existence, trampled under his feet, prostrating before him, becoming his subordinate - their positions completely reversed. The exhilarating feeling of rising to power made the Blood Demon so excited that the blood pool began to boil just from his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Mo, once I take over and become master of the Immutable Divine Palace, you won't need to run anymore. I'm not like that person - I don't need to devour worlds. In fact, I hope for a world to exist.</p><p></p><p>"I am a disciple of the Dao Ancestor, not someone narrow-minded like you frogs in a well!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Blood Demon was filled with arrogance.</p><p></p><p>He was a disciple of the Dao Ancestor! How could he be compared to these frogs in a well who didn't even know about the Great Wilderness?</p><p></p><p>"The sub-soul is me. After merging with the sub-soul, my identity won't change. I will still be a disciple of the Dao Ancestor and should still be recognized as such."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Without further hesitation, he sat cross-legged. The blood pool churned and bubbled, red blood energy constantly surging forth, enveloping the entire area around the blood pool.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon's figure vanished into the thick blood energy. At a certain moment, a bubbling sound could be heard, like the sound of water bubbles.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon made hand seals and began to activate the technique for merging分身合一之术 with his分身. Since this was his sub-soul, drawing it back shouldn't be a problem.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blood Demon was shocked to discover that he encountered significant resistance. The sub-soul seemed to be resisting his pull, resisting the merger.</p><p></p><p>"It hasn't even broken through yet, but the sub-soul already has such resistant consciousness. Once it breaks through, not only will it become an independent existence, it will surely find a way to turn the tables and devour me!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Blood Demon frantically activated his secret technique. He had to draw back the sub-soul, otherwise he would surely suffer a backlash.</p><p></p><p>As the secret technique activated, the sub-soul's resistance began to weaken.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon breathed a sigh of relief. As long as he could draw it back, even if the sub-soul was slightly stronger, it wouldn't be able to resist. After all, the sub-soul was fundamentally under his control and suppression.</p><p></p><p>Finally, slowly, the sub-soul began to return. Although the process was somewhat sluggish and slow, it was definitely returning.</p><p></p><p>Drawing back the sub-soul was a slow process, which also meant that the Great Wilderness world was extremely far from this place. Otherwise, why would it take so long?</p><p></p><p>As he drew back the sub-soul, the Blood Demon's face was full of excitement. He had already begun to envision the majestic sight of himself after merging with the sub-soul - his strength greatly increased, breaking through his shackles, returning to the Immutable Divine Palace and sitting high on the throne.</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, at a certain moment, it was as if the sub-soul had broken free from a quagmire. In an instant, it was drawn back.</p><p></p><p>This made the Blood Demon speculate that the area where the Great Wilderness world was located likely contained some special place. Only after the sub-soul left that special area did it return in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sub-soul returned to his body, and blood light burst forth. Strands of profound runes appeared within the sub-soul. The Blood Demon was extremely excited. His spirit moved in an instant, preparing to merge with the sub-soul.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

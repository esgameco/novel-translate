        <h1>Chapter 414</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat motionless, but a figure emerged from him.</p><p></p><p>It was identical to him, but had an extremely powerful aura, with an added sense of dominance.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have now entered the gate, today your master will demonstrate something to let you see what is meant by extreme soul martial arts," the extreme soul body said, looking at Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had a shocked expression on his face. He looked at the extreme soul body, then at his master still sitting leisurely in the chair, unable to tell for a moment what exactly was going on.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu widened her beautiful eyes, staring up and down at the extreme soul body. After looking for quite a while, she found that this did not seem to be a divine element avatar or other type of分身 [fēnshēn, split body/avatar].</p><p></p><p>It was as if this was the master himself.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled calmly and said, "How could you possibly understand your master's techniques? This is not an avatar, this is also your master's body."</p><p></p><p>Without further explanation, the extreme soul body looked towards the location of Dayue Heavenly Cave and said with a smile, "Let's go."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited, and Jiang Buping's face was full of excitement - the master was going to take action.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and the others felt the same way.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan's face was full of anticipation, while also being shocked at how unfathomable this senior expert was.</p><p></p><p>At Dayue Heavenly Cave, although Fang Hao had set up a great formation using the power of heaven and earth, it was still under intense attack, as if it could be breached at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Below Dayue Heavenly Cave, several Blood Sons were taking action. Behind the cave entrance were dense crowds of blood slaves and blood disciples.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a powerful blood-colored light transformed into a crimson long saber, slashing over fiercely. On the saber, it was as if crimson flames were burning.</p><p></p><p>As this slash was unleashed, thousands of blood slaves and over a dozen blood disciples behind it were refined into blood to fuel the power of this strike.</p><p></p><p>"Block it!"</p><p></p><p>Along with this slash came powerful attacks from the Blood Sons.</p><p></p><p>The group of True Kings and Heavenly Venerables hurriedly joined forces, using the power of the formation to resist this mighty slash.</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor's face was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe your Netherworld blood slaves can be endless, that you can refine them into blood at will!"</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Had the Netherworld gone mad? Did they intend to exhaust the Netherworld's strength just to invade the Qinghua Realm?</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, why refine so many blood slaves on such a large scale? Wouldn't they be afraid of damaging the Netherworld's power? He couldn't help but recall the brutal great battle of the past.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld had used similar invasion techniques before. In the end, the Qinghua Realm martial artists had used secret techniques to burn their own lives one after another. At a terrible cost, they had finally driven the Netherworld back.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Netherworld had never used this kind of invasion technique again.</p><p></p><p>Now that they were using this invasion technique again, was it to force Qinghua Realm martial artists to trade life for life, depleting Qinghua Realm's overall strength? He couldn't help but think of Tianshadiying's purpose - this was likely related to Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>"Have all the Netherworld forces that invaded the Nine Mountains Realm's Heavenly Caves been transferred to invade our Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor's face was extremely ugly.</p><p></p><p>Currently, the Nine Mountains Realm was in turmoil, making it difficult for the Qinghua Realm to request aid.</p><p></p><p>And requesting aid from other realms beyond the Nine Mountains Realm would involve a long journey, requiring passage through the Nine Mountains Realm. This meant that even if they successfully sent out a request for aid, it would take considerable time for reinforcements to arrive.</p><p></p><p>"This time, the casualties won't be as severe."</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor looked at the great formation. With the formation's assistance, the casualties shouldn't be as massive.</p><p></p><p>Then his expression changed again.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved instantly, appearing in front of Fang Hao. His great halberd struck out, blocking a crimson blade slashing over from inside the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>This blade was actually formed from dozens of blood disciples refined into blood.</p><p></p><p>Had the Netherworld gone mad?</p><p></p><p>Even with numerous blood disciples, they shouldn't be consumed like this. To tear open the formation at such a great cost - would they refine Blood Sons into blood next time to unleash killing techniques?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Under the combined defense of the formation and the Dayue Emperor's attack, this slash was blocked.</p><p></p><p>However, the Dayue Emperor's face changed drastically again the next moment.</p><p></p><p>At the rear of the Heavenly Cave, a Blood Son was walking forward, approaching the cave entrance. As he got closer, blood-colored flames surrounded him and his aura grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>Then, the blood slaves around him transformed into streams of blood-colored light, pouring into his body.</p><p></p><p>By the time this Blood Son reached the entrance of the Heavenly Cave, he had transformed into a crimson, cold, and murderous long saber.</p><p></p><p>The lead Blood Son raised his hand and grasped this crimson long saber. With a gloomy gaze, he looked at the Dayue Emperor and Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Not good! Brother Fang, retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>The Dayue Emperor's face was pale with shock.</p><p></p><p>This saber formed from one Blood Son and thousands of blood slaves refined into blood was unimaginably powerful. Even he would have difficulty blocking it without using secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the other several Undying Heavenly Venerables also changed. One of them stepped forward, his aura surging, "Your Majesty, this subject will exhaust his cultivation to fight to the death with him!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, they had no choice but to fight desperately. Otherwise, the formation would definitely be breached, and the Netherworld enemies would surely take the opportunity to invade the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also had a shocked expression. Had these Netherworld Blood Sons gone mad? How could they be so crazy?</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he felt somewhat helpless - his strength was ultimately still too weak.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, how could he be threatened by a mere single slash?</p><p></p><p>As these thoughts flashed through his mind, the power of heaven and earth surged like great waves, heavenly laws descended, and light flowed over Fang Hao's body. The Qimen Weapon Box appeared, and various divine weapons flew out one after another.</p><p></p><p>He prepared to set up a great Qimen formation of heaven and earth to resist this slash from the Netherworld Blood Son.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several figures descended.</p><p></p><p>"Master?!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned. He looked at his master, somewhat puzzled as to why his master seemed a bit different.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, looking towards the bottom of the Heavenly Cave, especially at the saber formed by the Blood Son refining himself. He turned back to look at Jiang Buping and said, "Your master will only take action this one time. How much you can learn and comprehend depends entirely on yourself."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression was solemn as he respectfully nodded and said, "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>When the Dayue Emperor and others heard this, they were immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The senior expert was going to take action - Dayue Heavenly Cave would surely be swept clean! Looking at Jiang Buping, they couldn't help but feel extremely grateful. If the senior expert wasn't teaching his disciple, he probably wouldn't have taken action. It was all thanks to Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>At the bottom of the Heavenly Cave, that Netherworld Blood Son holding the crimson long saber had a somewhat grave expression. His gaze was fixed on Li Xuan's extreme soul body, sensing an intense feeling of danger.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, and the Extreme Dao Soul Weapon appeared in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>As soon as the Extreme Dao Soul Weapon appeared, the Dayue Emperor and others had shocked expressions and hurriedly averted their gazes.</p><p></p><p>It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it for a moment gave them a feeling of their souls being torn apart.</p><p></p><p>What kind of divine weapon was this? Jiang Buping looked at the Extreme Dao Soul Weapon in his master's hand, then looked at his own Extreme Soul Divine Weapon, and immediately sighed - the difference was too great, far too great.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Extreme Dao Soul Weapon. You still need to work hard to nurture yours. Your soul weapon can only be considered basic."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gently stroked the Extreme Dao Soul Weapon with one hand.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on that Blood Son with the grave expression. With an expressionless face, he said calmly, "Your Netherworld likes to refine blood. Now I'm giving you a chance - continue refining blood, or you won't have another opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>"You are..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" the Blood Child asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"My name is not one you are worthy to hear!" Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent, as if looking down on ants.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Below the Heavenly Cave, a group of blood slaves transformed into streams of blood, continuously pouring into the long sword in the Blood Child's hand. Even the remaining Blood Children became desperate at this moment, refining their own blood.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth at the edge of the Heavenly Cave's entrance were turbulent. Half of the blood slaves in the cave instantly disappeared, leaving only three Blood Children.</p><p></p><p>Each of them held a crimson long sword in their hands. </p><p></p><p>Their strength had been raised to the limit allowed by the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>And the killing swords refined by blood were even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Li Xuan smiled coldly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze seemed profound as he looked into the depths of the Heavenly Cave. As the blood disciples, slaves and children decreased, the cave could accommodate new Netherworld Blood Children entering.</p><p></p><p>Thus, in the depths of the cave, more Blood Children descended.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme Soul Martial Way focuses on destroying souls and killing bodies, with unmatched offensive power. Soul destruction is primary, body killing is secondary. All techniques are based on soul destruction."</p><p></p><p>"For any living being in the world, when the soul is destroyed, everything becomes void."</p><p></p><p>"The soul is difficult to defend, but also not easy to kill. However, the Extreme Soul Martial Way was born to kill souls. This path uses one's own ultimate soul to kill the myriad souls of all living beings in the world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained to Jiang Buping as he raised his Extreme Dao Soul Weapon and slowly thrust out a spear.</p><p></p><p>This spear thrust was extremely slow, as if any master martial artist could easily dodge it.</p><p></p><p>However, facing this spear, the three Blood Children opposite were terrified. They could not escape at all, and felt a great horror descending upon their souls.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>With a roar, they unleashed their strongest attack with the long swords in their hands.</p><p></p><p>They executed the great killing technique refined by blood!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping gripped the spear in his hand tightly, his eyes wide open, staring at his master's move. This spear thrust seemed ordinary, but it was actually the pinnacle of the Extreme Soul Martial Way.</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Huang and the others were even more shocked.</p><p></p><p>They clearly felt that the elder's spear thrust seemed to be executed only at the Immortal Venerable realm, obviously suppressing his strength, just to teach his disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, when Da Yue Huang and the other Immortal Venerables saw this spear thrust, they had a feeling that it was impossible to dodge or resist, and their souls were in extreme crisis.</p><p></p><p>This spear thrust was not even aimed at them, yet they felt such terror.</p><p></p><p>From this, one can imagine how terrifying it must be for those three Blood Children facing this spear.</p><p></p><p>As the spear thrust out, slow and calm, a cold glint flashed at the entrance of the Heavenly Cave the instant the three Blood Children attacked.</p><p></p><p>This cold glint was not seen by the physical eye, but felt by the soul!</p><p></p><p>Puff! The eyes of the three Blood Children instantly became hollow. Their just-unleashed attacks dissipated, as if their souls and consciousness had been completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stepped forward, holding his spear as he entered the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>As he moved, the bodies of the Blood Children turned to ashes and vanished. The remaining blood slaves and disciples at the entrance of the cave all fell to the ground, their souls and consciousness gone, leaving only empty shells.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan entered, these empty shells also dispersed into ashes.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Huang and the others swallowed hard, their hearts trembling.</p><p></p><p>Such powerful Netherworld martial artists had almost broken through the cave's defenses, yet the elder had defeated all enemies with just one spear thrust.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the elder seemed to have suppressed his own cultivation, striking out only at the Immortal Venerable realm?</p><p></p><p>A true master is indeed a master.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Extreme Soul Martial Way, this is the Extreme Soul Divine Ability?!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping muttered, excited and shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother, you need to work hard on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu came back to her senses from the shock and patted Jiang Buping's shoulder with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then she eagerly followed into the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"I will work hard!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping gripped the spear in his hand, his expression determined. In his mind flashed the scene of himself thrusting out a spear, causing Immortal Venerables to perish.</p><p></p><p>It was too shocking, too exciting.</p><p></p><p>I, Jiang Buping, will surely carry forward the Extreme Soul Martial Way and make it renowned throughout the Divine Realm!</p><p></p><p>"This spear thrust was not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He indeed had not used his true strength, but this spear thrust was powerful enough.</p><p></p><p>With one thrust, the Blood Children's souls were annihilated, completely unable to resist.</p><p></p><p>The way of attacking souls was indeed domineering and powerful.</p><p></p><p>After entering the Heavenly Cave, waves of blood rolled ahead as Blood Children led blood disciples and slaves to attack.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slightly raised the spear in his hand, and a cold glint instantly killed the Blood Children and annihilated most of the blood disciples and slaves. He turned back to look at Jiang Buping and said, "Practice a bit."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was extremely excited as he held the Extreme Soul Divine Weapon and charged into battle.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying spear light split open in mid-air, transforming into countless points of light that attacked.</p><p></p><p>Extreme Soul Divine Ability: Star Extinction!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Jiang Buping's talent was indeed monstrous, worthy of being born with a divine soul, worthy of having great fortune.</p><p></p><p>He had already cultivated this Extreme Soul Divine Ability, Star Extinction, quite well.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Figure after figure fell under Star Extinction, all with hollow eyes, their souls annihilated.</p><p></p><p>However, their physical bodies still remained, though without any trace of life.</p><p></p><p>This was also Jiang Buping's first time using this divine ability, and he was not yet able to instantly destroy both soul and body. Thus, while the souls were annihilated, the bodies had not turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping raised his hand and struck out with his palm. In the center of his palm appeared what seemed to be a black abyss, instantly entering the body of a blood disciple.</p><p></p><p>In this blood disciple's consciousness, it felt as if an abyss had descended. His soul had no power to resist at all in this moment, swallowed by the abyss and annihilated in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. This was another divine ability Jiang Buping had cultivated: Devouring Abyss!</p><p></p><p>So far, Jiang Buping had only cultivated these two divine abilities. As for subsequent Extreme Soul Divine Abilities and methods of the Extreme Soul Martial Way, he would naturally continue to comprehend them as he ventured through the Divine Realm and engaged in constant battles.</p><p></p><p>"Let me practice too!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao watched with boiling blood. He slapped his Extraordinary Gate Weapon Box, and instantly a torrent of myriad weapons poured out, sweeping towards the Netherworld martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The formation of heaven and earth's extraordinary patterns also appeared.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>At the core of the Heavenly Cave, blood light bloomed as three figures descended - three Blood Children.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the Netherworld had also noticed the changes in the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slightly raised his long spear, and the just-descended Blood Children fell to the ground with a thud, their eyes hollow, souls completely destroyed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, leave their bodies behind."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu hurriedly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>She turned back and instructed Feng Yan: "Quick, go bring back the bodies of the Blood Children."</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan perked up when he heard this, finally having a chance to show off.</p><p></p><p>He ran over excitedly, grabbing the three Blood Children's bodies and preparing to return. However, at this very moment, crisis suddenly descended. He felt an intense danger rising in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Above the Heavenly Cave, on the barrier of heaven and earth, a drop of deep red blood was falling.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

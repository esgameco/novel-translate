        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 119 The Thousand Illusion Demonic Sound</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan just couldn't understand, how could these people from the Demonic Sect be so poor?</p><p></p><p>It made it impossible for him to make a quick fortune.</p><p></p><p>"I've helped you kill another Sect Master again, don't you think the price should be increased a bit? One thousand spirit stones to buy the life of a Sect Master, it's a bit insulting to the Sect Masters, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Du Yuying with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Yan Kuan was questioning the meaning of life.</p><p></p><p>When did Sect Masters become so easy to kill?</p><p></p><p>Slapping them to death like swatting mosquitoes, what kind of monster is this?</p><p></p><p>He himself was also a Sect Master, painstakingly cultivating for hundreds of years, experiencing countless dangers, only to reach the honored status of a Sect Master, but now he found that Sect Masters were actually so cheap, that they could be killed for just one thousand spirit stones?</p><p></p><p>He was dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Even the injuries on his body no longer felt as painful.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying looked at the serious Xu Yan and nodded, "Three thousand spirit stones, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the spirit token from Cui'er's hand and said, "I feel that Sect Masters are not just ordinary vegetables, they do have some strength, and it's not easy for me to kill them, it's very tiring."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the others had a strange expression on their faces, killing a Sect Master with a single palm strike, and he said it's not easy?</p><p></p><p>"Using spirit stones to measure the worth of a Sect Master is truly an insult to them, I can't bear it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan secretly nodded, using spirit stones to measure the worth of a Sect Master was indeed an insult to them!</p><p></p><p>Before encountering this person, he had never heard of any Sect Master being killed for just one thousand spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"Then what does the young master mean?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a storage bag? Give me a storage bag, and I guarantee I'll help you kill as many Sect Masters as you want!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Du Yuying with an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>This girl had an extraordinary identity, with Sect Masters from the Demonic Sect coming one after another, perhaps she had a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Ever since he learned that there was such a treasure as a storage bag in the world, he had been coveting it.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and the others were all stunned, a storage bag?</p><p></p><p>That was a treasure that even many great Sect Masters might not possess, and he dared to ask for it directly!</p><p></p><p>"Is it difficult?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw their expressions and looked a bit embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>"Not just difficult, a storage bag is a treasure that many great Sect Masters don't even have, although it sounds harsh, but the fact is, the life of a Sect Master is not worth a storage bag!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying sighed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clicked his tongue, a storage bag was actually so precious, even the life of a Sect Master couldn't compare to it.</p><p></p><p>"I see you're in a lot of trouble, two Sect Master cultivators have come already, did you poke the nest of the Demonic Sect? A mere few thousand spirit stones is not enough for me to kill Sect Masters!"</p><p></p><p>Since arriving in the Inner Realm, he had already killed two Demonic Sect Sect Masters, Xu Yan even suspected that the Inner Realm was full of Sect Masters, not belonging to the top echelon of cultivators at all.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying fell silent, having Xu Yan escort her back home was an unexpected blessing, but she never imagined his strength would be so powerful, killing Sect Masters as easily as swatting mosquitoes, one palm strike to kill one.</p><p></p><p>And the Sect Masters who attacked her this time were actually from the Demonic Sect, there was something unusual behind this matter.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for Xu Yan's escort, she might have already fallen into the hands of the Demonic Sect.</p><p></p><p>"What does the young master mean?"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying asked.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual medicines! I need spiritual medicines!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized, he had already earned a lot of spirit stones, and the purpose of earning the spirit stones was to buy spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, why not directly ask for spiritual medicines as the reward?</p><p></p><p>"Please go ahead, young master."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying felt relieved in her heart, spiritual medicines were after all something that could be bought with spirit stones.</p><p></p><p>"One Grade Six spiritual herb, for killing one Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised a finger.</p><p></p><p>"Grade Six spiritual herbs are rare, even in the ordinary county-level Heaven's Treasure Pavilion, it's difficult to find one, it's something that is hard to come by, to be honest, I don't have a Grade Six spiritual herb to offer."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying looked helpless.</p><p></p><p>Grade Six spiritual herbs were actually so rare and precious?</p><p></p><p>This was beyond Xu Yan's expectations, thinking for a moment, he said, "A Grade Seven spiritual herb, for one great Sect Master, it can't be any less, you should know, that's a Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying agreed.</p><p></p><p>After the conditions were settled, Xu Yan was overjoyed, he didn't even bother to ask Du Yuying how she had provoked the Sect Masters of the Demonic Sect, or what her identity was.</p><p></p><p>After the escort was completed and the reward received, whether they would meet again in the future was unknown, Xu Yan didn't have that much curiosity.</p><p></p><p>After a night's rest, the group continued on their journey.</p><p></p><p>Half a day later, a group of black-robed men came to attack, but they were only at the Third or Second Rank in strength, Xu Yan couldn't be bothered to interfere, these seemed to be similar to cannon fodder, and they probably didn't have any spirit stones on them.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's guards, including the First Rank groom, took care of all the attackers.</p><p></p><p>On the third day after leaving Iron Mountain County, they entered a county town to resupply, and Du Yuying went to the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion as usual to find healing spiritual herbs for Yan Kuan.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion in the county town did not have the spiritual herbs she needed.</p><p></p><p>Leaving the county town, they continued on their journey.</p><p></p><p>In the evening, a figure stood in the middle of the road.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a Sect Master cultivator was unmistakable, with a cold and gloomy aura emanating from the person, another Sect Master from the Demonic Sect!</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's brows furrowed, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's expression also became grave, one or two Demonic Sect Sect Masters attacking was one thing, but why were they coming one after another?</p><p></p><p>The formidable opponent they had expected did not appear.</p><p></p><p>Before Xu Yan could act, Yan Kuan got out of the carriage and said in a deep voice, "My Du family has no enmity with the Demonic Sect, Senior, why have you come? Which Demonic Lord do you serve under?"</p><p></p><p>"Yan Kuan?" </p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sect Sect Master's voice was somewhat shrill and grating.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan cupped his fists.</p><p></p><p>"A third-rate Sect Master, not worthy of speaking in front of me!"</p><p></p><p>"You!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's face turned livid with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, kill him for me, and I'll personally give you a Grade Seven spiritual herb!"</p><p></p><p>Eager not to miss this opportunity, Xu Yan quickly said, "Okay, one Grade Seven spiritual herb!"</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous!"</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sect Sect Master in front was furious.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, and a gloomy aura swept out, turning into ghostly claws that directly attacked.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, Xu Yan would not show any mercy to a Demonic Sect Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sect's killing techniques were all suppressed by Xu Yan's extremely yang and unyielding Descending Dragon Palm. Although this Demonic Sect Sect Master was stronger than the previous two, he was still no match for the fierce power of Xu Yan's palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon burst forth, crushing everything in its path. In the Sect Master's horrified gaze, the mighty palm force instantly engulfed him!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Demonic Sect Sect Master was killed on the spot.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan was not afraid of accidentally destroying the spirit tokens the Sect Master was carrying, causing a loss, this palm strike would have turned him into dust.</p><p></p><p>"I've helped you kill him, remember you owe me a Grade Seven spiritual herb!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily went forward to loot the body.</p><p></p><p>"Tch! These Demonic Sect Sect Masters are all paupers!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cursed as he activated his true qi, instantly crushing the corpse into ashes, ensuring the Sect Master was thoroughly dead.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan watched with a dumbfounded expression.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The hair on his skin stood on end.</p><p></p><p>This young man was truly terrifying.</p><p></p><p>He could defeat a master with just a palm strike - could he be a grand master?</p><p></p><p>The power of the golden dragon, what a terrifying cultivation technique, so overwhelmingly powerful!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after killing his opponents, he even scattered their ashes!</p><p></p><p>The skilled manner in which he did it suggested he had done this many times before.</p><p></p><p>"Are you dead now? Let's see you look down on me!"</p><p></p><p>However, Yan Kuan felt relieved. So he looked down on him as a third-rate master, eh? Where could he be so strong when he was just slapped to death with a single palm strike!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted, he had obtained two seventh-grade spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>"The inner realm is truly exciting, making money is not difficult at all. If I encounter a few more masters, I'll be able to afford all the spirit herbs I need."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought contentedly.</p><p></p><p>In the following journey, the attacks became more and more frequent, mostly from cultivators at the third rank or above, and there was even an instance where six first-rank cultivators attacked.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's guards were no match, so Xu Yan had to step in, sweeping them all away with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The master-level cultivators attacked again.</p><p></p><p>This time, the master was not from the Demon Sect, but a renowned master from the Blue Ping Prefecture. After Yan Kuan called out his name, the opponent dropped the pretense and directly mocked and looked down on Yan Kuan as a third-rate master...</p><p></p><p>So, Yan Kuan owed Xu Yan another seventh-grade spirit herb.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, the attackers became more and more numerous, even resorting to poisoning and traps, slowing down their progress.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't let his guard down, remaining vigilant at all times.</p><p></p><p>One day, the sound of hooves thundered, as if a large army was charging. A dark mass was rushing towards them.</p><p></p><p>"The Blue Ping Prefecture guards!" Yan Kuan gritted his teeth.</p><p></p><p>Although the attackers were all dressed in black, it couldn't deceive the experienced eye - these were the Blue Ping Prefecture guards!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p>A figure flew from the army above, directly attacking Yan Kuan, the master-level cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, 5,000 spirit crystals, help us break through!" Du Yuying said grimly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!"</p><p></p><p>Dealing with a large army was nothing new to Xu Yan. Even if the army from the inner realm was powerful, his own strength had also grown.</p><p></p><p>Channeling his true qi, with a thunderous roar, eighteen golden dragons erupted forth.</p><p></p><p>They charged towards the advancing army, instantly causing chaos and mayhem. Du Yuying's group followed closely behind Xu Yan. The master-level cultivator attacking from midair was swatted away by Xu Yan with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The entire army was brought down. Yan Kuan and the others were deeply shocked, the sight of those eighteen dragons sweeping everything in their path was deeply etched in their minds.</p><p></p><p>"What cultivation technique is this? I've never heard of such a powerful martial art in the inner realm!"</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan was greatly alarmed. As a master-level cultivator himself, he had never even heard of such a formidable technique.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the encirclement, the group continued on their way.</p><p></p><p>The Blue Ping Prefecture guards all lay on the ground, unable to get up for a long time, only rising unsteadily after Xu Yan's group had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>They were all deathly pale. </p><p>That was too terrifying!</p><p>The sight of those eighteen dragons sweeping everything away had deeply shocked every single guard. Perhaps the rumored power of a grand master was no more than this.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Blue Ping Prefecture, they encountered no more attacks for several days. Just as Du Yuying breathed a sigh of relief, thinking they could travel smoothly, a lone teahouse appeared up ahead.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a melodious flute sound drifted over.</p><p></p><p>The flute music was enchantingly beautiful, captivating anyone who heard it, making them want to dance along.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's guards, who had maintained stern expressions and vigilance throughout the journey, now started swaying and nodding their heads, completely entranced by the flute music.</p><p></p><p>Even Cui'er, who had opened the carriage window, had a dazed look in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Danger!" Yan Kuan suddenly shouted angrily, his master-level aura surging, instantly snapping the guards and Cui'er out of their trance.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Thousand Illusion Demonic Flute, quickly block your senses, plug your ears!" Cui'er said, her face pale.</p><p></p><p>The guards hastily tore off pieces of cloth, balling them up and stuffing them into their ears. Even Yan Kuan, the master cultivator, had a grave expression as he did the same.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother, quickly plug your ears, this is the Thousand Illusion Demonic Flute of a peak master-level cultivator from the Demon Sect!" he urgently warned Xu Yan, who was still on his horse, seemingly unaffected.</p><p></p><p>"No need to hurry, the flute music sounds quite nice!" Xu Yan replied, showing a look of curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The flute music was indeed melodious, but it seemed to have a power that gently enveloped the listeners, trying to lure and confuse them.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts of the inner realm have such techniques that use sound to defeat enemies. </p><p>Master was right, I shouldn't dismiss the inner realm's cultivation just because it's considered a false path. This demonic sound technique has its merits too.</p><p>Although it doesn't affect me since I cultivate true martial arts, if I were to comprehend a similar sound-based technique, how powerful could it be?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked interested.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan's expression kept changing, "Young brother, quickly plug your ears!"</p><p>He mistakenly thought Xu Yan was being enchanted by the demonic flute music.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at him, "You're a master yourself, yet your mental fortitude is so weak. A mere tune can unsettle you so much."</p><p>Yan Kuan's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>"Please, young brother, dispel this demonic flute!" Yan Kuan took a deep breath.</p><p>He felt like he was struggling to resist the Thousand Illusion Demonic Flute, with illusions starting to appear before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"No, I haven't heard enough yet, and there's no danger here!" Xu Yan firmly refused.</p><p></p><p>Yan Kuan could only helplessly return to the carriage, guarding his mind against the demonic flute music.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's guards, their faces flushed, were swaying and stumbling as they rode their horses, the group heading towards the teahouse.</p><p></p><p>In the carriage, Cui'er's face was also flushed, seemingly lost in some illusion, murmuring "Young master... Ah, young master..." </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had her hands clasped together, her breathing heavy and her chest heaving violently, struggling to maintain control. Finally, she removed her veil, revealing her breathtakingly beautiful face, now flushed with color.</p><p></p><p>The carriage stopped in front of the teahouse. </p><p>Xu Yan watched the teahouse with interest, unable to tell if the white-robed figure playing the flute was male or female.</p><p>The refined features, the painted lips pressed against the flute, the eyes slightly closed - the figure was exuding a captivating aura from the flute music that permeated the area.</p><p></p><p>The closer one got, the more powerful the demonic flute's effect became.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan observed silently, contemplating deeply, with a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had stepped out of the carriage. Biting her lip, she walked up to Xu Yan's horse, "Young master, three seventh-grade spirit herbs, please help me escape this predicament!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying had realized that as long as she provided enough spirit herbs, there was no problem that couldn't be solved!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

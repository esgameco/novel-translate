        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hu Bubaie, you make the move," the Thousand Martial Palace Master took a deep breath and said sternly to a young man with messy beard beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Hu Bubaie nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Niu Qiangsheng, come back!" the Thousand Martial Palace Master called out in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and did not kill Niu Qiangsheng, directly dispersing the layers of sword light and letting Niu Qiangsheng go back.</p><p></p><p>Holding a long spear, Hu Bubaie was about to go into battle, but the Thousand Martial Palace Master hesitated for a moment and said, "Hu Bubaie, the outcome of the battle, life and death do not matter!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt a lack of confidence. </p><p></p><p>If Hu Bubaie was killed, this would be a big problem, and he would not know how to explain it.</p><p></p><p>Every genius of the spirit realm is extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Hu Bubaie was taken aback, but he dragged the long spear on the ground and walked forward, saying, "Whether it's victory or defeat, life or death, I will fight with all my might."</p><p></p><p>As Hu Bubaie walked out, the power of the laws of heaven and earth seemed to condense into a long spear, merging with the long spear he was dragging on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This person is very powerful!" the Great Zhou Emperor said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Unexpectedly, the Thousand Martial Palace actually has such a genius, he is not far from the next realm," Fu Tianhai sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the Taimiao Sect camp, Du Yuying and Yun Caicai suddenly became nervous, staring intently at the battlefield, and couldn't help but turn back to look at Xin Mengrou beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, is he Hu Bubaie? How is his strength?" Yun Caicai couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, he's not far from the next realm," Xin Mengrou replied.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, what is the next realm?" Du Yuying couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was silent for a moment before speaking, "Refining the laws of heaven and earth into the body, the realm of Refined Law; not just gathering the power of the laws of heaven and earth, but refining the laws of heaven and earth into the body, the two are different, heaven and earth apart.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the power of the laws of heaven and earth means that one's own body possesses the power of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Cultivated Spirit Immortal is the Refined Law Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Caicai were shocked, realizing at this moment that the realm above the Cultivated Spirit Immortal is the Refined Law Venerable! Refining the laws of heaven and earth into the body, one's own body already possesses the power of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestor, are you a Refined Law Venerable?" Du Yuying asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Almost." Xin Mengrou's gaze turned to the Evergreen Pavilion, murmuring softly.</p><p></p><p>The pill given by that senior had made her only a step away from refining the laws of heaven and earth into her body. </p><p></p><p>This was almost unimaginable in the spirit realm. </p><p></p><p>It had already surpassed the limit that the spirit realm could cultivate.</p><p></p><p>In the entire spirit realm, apart from her, there was only one other person who had achieved this step, and that was Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>And Wu Tiannan had also relied on the guidance of that senior.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are strong, but I, Hu Bubaie, have never been defeated in my life. I don't think you can defeat me!" Hu Bubaie said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Then you will have to change your name to Hu Yibaie (Hu One-Defeat) today." Xu Yan smiled. Hu Bubaie's strength was very strong, the strongest he had seen besides Xin Mengrou and Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see about that!" Hu Bubaie shook his long spear and charged over in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thrust out a sword, and mountains and rivers appeared, the Sword of Life and Death Wheel appeared, and a sword formation appeared. In just a moment, Hu Bubaie was already covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>"You have lost!" Xu Yan sheathed his sword, looking towards the Thousand Martial Palace, then around.</p><p></p><p>Silence! No one had expected Hu Bubaie to be defeated so quickly and thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Even Hu Bubaie himself had a look of disbelief on his face. </p><p></p><p>In his view, even if he was going to lose, he should have experienced a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>But the result was that as soon as he made a move, he saw the sword light swirling, and in just a few strokes, he was defeated!</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother is so strong!" Su Ling exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Sitting on the golden throne, the Red Cat looked at the group of demon clan experts and said, "See, this is the might of our demon clan's Supremacy!"</p><p></p><p>The group of demon clan experts all had a dazed expression on their faces.</p><p></p><p>Our demon clan's Supremacy, is he really from the human clan?</p><p></p><p>"The Supremacy is mighty!" </p><p></p><p>"Our demon clan's Supremacy is truly remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Never mind, as long as he is the demon clan's Supremacy, the great demon king is right about everything.</p><p></p><p>The group of demon clan experts praised him with a sense of honor and glory.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this, in the entire spirit realm, except for him, no one was Xu Yan's match.</p><p></p><p>Neither Wu Tiannan nor Xin Mengrou could match him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already reached the peak of the Spirit Origin Realm, and had also accumulated a deep foundation. He was only a step away from breaking through to the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The geniuses of the spirit realm, I am the supreme one. All of you geniuses, come at me together, I, Xu Yan, will subdue you all alone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the group of spirit realm geniuses and spoke arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Although it was very arrogant, at this moment, no one dared to make a move, nor was there an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Because Xu Yan had the qualifications to say this!</p><p></p><p>Seeing that no one responded, Xu Yan suddenly felt bored. These spirit realm geniuses were all cowards.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, ranked first among the geniuses, you don't need to continue fighting. Whoever is not satisfied can challenge you," the Great Zhou Emperor spoke.</p><p></p><p>No one was dissatisfied!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left the battlefield, looked at the Thousand Martial Palace, and also felt bored. Although he now had the strength to subdue the Thousand Martial Palace, it seemed unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the peak of the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master and the others had an unwilling expression, but were also helpless. Even Hu Bubaie had lost, the only thing they could feel relieved about was that Xu Yan did not kill them.</p><p></p><p>"It's strange that Xu Yan didn't kill them," Fu Tianhai said regretfully.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor gave him a disdainful look and said, "Xu Yan is already a strong cultivator, his mentality is different now. In his eyes, these people are just like juniors, so he doesn't bother to kill them.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, Xu Yan and the Thousand Martial Palace don't have any grudges, right? Even if they had conflicts in the past, the resentment should have been vented. He is already the supreme existence in the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"Unlike some people who find pleasure in bullying the juniors."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai rolled his eyes and said, "I just wanted to see a show. I wonder if the shameless fellows of the Thousand Martial Palace will open that virtual bridge after suffering such a big loss."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor didn't bother to say anything to him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu, why didn't you kill the fellows from the Thousand Martial Palace?" Meng Shushu asked curiously on the Evergreen Pavilion's flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"In my eyes, they are just juniors now, killing them would be boring," Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>Is this the mentality of a strong cultivator? Or has Xu Yan already begun to have the mindset of a superior?</p><p></p><p>"It's my turn now!" Meng Chong smiled cheerfully, holding a knife in his hand, instantly descending onto the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As soon as he landed, he instantly transformed into a nine-zhang golden body, with the Indestructible Divine Armor covering his entire body, like a divine deity descending, majestic and imposing.</p><p></p><p>"I am Knife Venerable Meng Chong, the genius of the Spirit Sect. Dare you fight me!" </p><p></p><p>Such a powerful aura shocked the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"It's Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>"Wow, so strong! I wonder if Meng Chong or Xu Yan is stronger?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course it's Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>A person walked out from the Thunder Cloud Mountain Villa, holding a purple hammer in his hand, with thunder clouds surrounding his body, and thunder rumbling above his head.</p><p></p><p>The lightning was raging, brewing a thunderstorm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll experience the might of the Knife Venerable!" </p><p></p><p>"Then come at me!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Violent lightning and thunder burst forth, pouring down and engulfing Meng Chong's massive frame.</p><p></p><p>When the lightning and thunder dissipated, Meng Chong still stood there proudly, chuckling, "Not bad, just a slight tingling sensation. Since you've struck with thunder, then take my Wind and Thunder Fist!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>The Wind and Thunder Fist thundered out, and no matter how the opponent swung their divine weapon, they could not withstand the might of this one punch.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The genius of the Xuelun Mountain Villa was defeated!</p><p></p><p>In the battle of the geniuses, it was no surprise that Xu Yan came first, Meng Chong second, and Su Ling Xiu third.</p><p></p><p>When it was time for Fang Hao to take the stage, the geniuses of the Chaoyuan Spiritual Sect all came out, as this concerned the sect's dominance and the pattern of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Gate Martial Arts also displayed their divine might in the Spiritual Realm for the first time. With the Mysterious Gate Armory unleashed, a myriad of swords emerged, the blades glinting coldly, the formation techniques turning the heavens and earth upside down, trapping one opponent after another.</p><p></p><p>Watching the fierce battle on the battlefield, the geniuses of the Qiwu Palace, the Xuelun Mountain Villa, and the Yuling Manor all tried to intervene, but to no avail against Fang Hao, and even ended up trapped themselves.</p><p></p><p>This made the Chaoyuan Spiritual Sect uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This Fang Hao is no ordinary person, we of the Chaoyuan Spiritual Sect cannot overcome him."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that we have to accept the Wanshi Alliance breaking the pattern of the Spiritual Realm? The dominance of the spiritual sects is the rule, how can it be broken?"</p><p></p><p>The Qiwu Palace Master and the others discussed in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>"Please summon the Venerable!" the Qiwu Palace Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't this a bit reckless?" the Xuelun Mountain Villa Master frowned.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge has opened, there will be a judgment, why summon the Venerable now?" the Yuling Manor Master also said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that you really let them enter that place?" the Qiwu Palace Master raged.</p><p></p><p>The Xuelun Mountain Villa Master and the Yuling Manor Master fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Xuelun Mountain Villa Master sighed, "That place has been too long ago, how much opportunity is left there? What good will it do to enter?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!" the Yuling Manor Master nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Do as you please!" the Qiwu Palace Master snorted and left with a sweep of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>The Xuelun Mountain Villa Master and the Yuling Manor Master also returned to their camps.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how did it go?" the many elders of the Qiwu Palace gathered around and asked.</p><p></p><p>"They did not agree to summon the Venerable!" the Qiwu Palace Master gritted his teeth and snorted.</p><p></p><p>"Is that it? Just like that?" the elders of the Qiwu Palace were unwilling to accept it.</p><p></p><p>"Since they won't summon him, I, the Qiwu Palace, will summon him! Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Fang Hao, these people must die!" the Qiwu Palace Master said with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"You all prepare, I will summon the Venerable!" the Qiwu Palace Master ordered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" the elders of the Qiwu Palace responded in unison.</p><p></p><p>The battle of the geniuses was raging on, with Fang Hao defeating one genius of the Chaoyuan Spiritual Sect after another using the Mysterious Gate Martial Arts, ranking fourth on the Genius List.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the Chaoyuan Spiritual Sect all had grim expressions, and the Qiwu Palace was preparing to have Fang Hao, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Ling Xiu fight each other to determine the final ranking.</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Hao directly admitted defeat when facing Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the top four was not seen, so the spiritual sect geniuses prepared to compete for the fifth place.</p><p></p><p>But then the Crimson Cat appeared.</p><p></p><p>The might of the great demon swept through, the demonic techniques displayed, defeating one genius after another, even defeating Hu Buibai.</p><p></p><p>This made all the spiritual sect warriors have grim expressions.</p><p></p><p>The top five on the Genius List did not include a single spiritual sect genius! The subsequent genius battles began to return to normal, with the battles between the geniuses being exceptionally fierce.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng also took the stage.</p><p></p><p>Shu Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, and Zi Yun also came out one after another, and ultimately ranked among the top hundred on the Genius List.</p><p></p><p>The battle of the geniuses was ongoing, and the Qiwu Palace was preparing to summon the Venerable, while far outside of Rainbow State, in one of the eighteen states of the Spiritual Realm, the Ice State, was undergoing drastic changes.</p><p></p><p>The original location of the Xuexue Palace had become a black cave.</p><p></p><p>A warm but not scorching aura was constantly gushing out from the black cave, spreading across the entire Ice State.</p><p></p><p>The snow-covered Ice State had now lost all its ice and snow, all the snow having melted.</p><p></p><p>The entire Ice State had become warm.</p><p></p><p>The massive melting of the ice and snow in the Ice State caused a torrential flow of water to rush out, first affecting the neighboring Cloud State.</p><p></p><p>Boundless water was rushing from the Ice State, and the crisis had quietly descended.</p><p></p><p>This was a crisis for the entire Spiritual Realm! The renowned experts of the Cloud State had all gone to the Rainbow State to witness the grand event of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire Spiritual Realm was discussing the battle of the geniuses, waiting for news of the genius battle, who would seize the top spot, who would be the number one genius.</p><p></p><p>On a small river near the Cloud State bordering the Ice State, several boats were drifting, and a dozen or so warriors were discussing the battle of the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Rumble! Suddenly, a thunderous sound came, shaking the earth.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>A group of warriors looked up in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, look, what's that?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a warrior pointed ahead in horror.</p><p></p><p>The others looked up, and amid the rumbling sound, a large mountain suddenly collapsed, and a terrifying flood was rushing towards them!</p><p></p><p>The heaven-shaking, earth-shattering scene shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>A cry rang out, and the warriors on the boats took to the air, fleeing backwards.</p><p></p><p>Among these warriors, there were Xiao Tianren cultivators and Zongshi cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with such a terrifying flood, they also felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>It was not just this one place, all the areas bordering the Ice State were experiencing scenes of a catastrophic flood, and even Xiao Tianren cultivators, if they were a bit slower in escaping, were instantly engulfed and disappeared in the raging flood.</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>In a large city, everyone was horrified.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators above the Xiao Tianren realm could only hastily grab their weaker family members and flee into the air.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The city collapsed, submerged in the flood.</p><p></p><p>Those who could not escape in time all disappeared in the flood, even Great Tianren cultivators were in grave danger once caught in the flood.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Quick, flee, this old man will hold off the flood for a while!"</p><p></p><p>In a certain large city, a few Liangshen Tianren cultivators took to the air, their auras surging, trying to resist the onslaught of the flood and buy time for the escape. However, faced with the might of the heaven and earth-shaking flood, even with the Liangshen Tianren cultivators joining forces, they could not withstand it, and in just a short while, they felt their strength waning, about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>"Can't hold on!"</p><p></p><p>"Why is this flood so terrifying? Seems to be from the Ice State?"</p><p></p><p>Some Liangshen Tianren cultivators fled to the white clouds, avoiding the flood and going to investigate the source of the flood.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud State was quickly submerged, with heavy casualties, turning into a living hell, the prosperous scenes no longer there, the warriors who lost their loved ones all stood there dazed, unable to believe what they were seeing.</p><p></p><p>And the flood did not stop, the massive flood was rushing towards the Great Marsh State.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

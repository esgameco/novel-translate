        <h1>Chapter 345</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Hu Bubai, it's your turn to make a move," said the master of the Thousand Martial Palace, taking a deep breath and looking grimly at a young man with messy facial hair standing to the side.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Hu Bubai nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Niu Qiansheng, come back!" the palace master called out sternly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, not killing Niu Qiansheng but simply dispersing the layers of sword light and letting him return.</p><p></p><p>As Hu Bubai held his long spear, about to enter the battle, the palace master pondered for a moment and said, "Hu Bubai, decide victory or defeat, but don't fight to the death!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly felt less confident. If by chance Hu Bubai was killed, it would be a big problem that he couldn't explain away. Every spirit prodigy was extremely precious.</p><p></p><p>Hu Bubai paused, then dragged his spear along the ground as he walked forward, saying, "Victory or defeat, life or death, it's all the same. I'll just fight with all my might."</p><p></p><p>As Hu Bubai walked out, the power of the laws of heaven and earth seemed to coalesce into a long spear, merging with the one he dragged on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This youth is very powerful!" said the Great Zhou Emperor with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"I never imagined the Thousand Martial Palace had such a prodigy. He's not far from reaching the next realm," Fu Tianhai sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Miao Sect camp, Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao immediately became tense, staring intently at the battlefield while also turning to look at Xin Mengrou beside them.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Grandmother, that's Hu Bubai, right? How strong is he?" Yun Miaomiao couldn't help asking.</p><p></p><p>"He's decent. Not too far from the next realm," Xin Mengrou replied.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Grandmother, what is the next realm?" Du Yuying curiously asked.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was silent for a moment before saying, "Condensing the laws of heaven and earth into one's body, the realm of Law Condensation. It's not just gathering the power of heavenly laws, but condensing them into the body. The two are different, as different as heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Condensing the laws of heaven and earth means possessing the might of those laws within oneself.</p><p></p><p>"Above Spiritual Refinement Celestial is Law Condensation Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were shocked, only now realizing that the realm above Spiritual Refinement Celestial was Law Condensation Celestial Lord! Condensing the laws of heaven and earth into one's body meant possessing their might.</p><p></p><p>"Ancestral Grandmother, are you a Law Condensation Celestial Lord?" Du Yuying asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Not quite yet," Xin Mengrou said softly, looking towards Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Law Pill bestowed by that senior had brought her just half a step away from condensing the laws into her body.</p><p></p><p>This was almost unthinkable in the Spirit Realm. It had already surpassed the cultivation limit possible there.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Spirit Realm, besides her, only one other person had reached this step - Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>And Wu Tiannan had also relied on guidance from that senior.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are very strong. I, Hu Bubai, have never been defeated in my life. I don't believe you can defeat me!" Hu Bubai said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Today you'll have to change your name to Hu Yibai (Hu One-Defeat)," Xu Yan smiled. Hu Bubai was very powerful, the strongest he had seen besides Xin Mengrou and Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>"We'll see if you have what it takes!" Hu Bubai shook his spear and instantly attacked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thrust out his sword. Mountains and rivers appeared, the Wheel of Life and Death materialized, sword formations emerged. In just an instant, Hu Bubai was covered in wounds.</p><p></p><p>"You've lost!" Xu Yan withdrew his sword, looking towards the Thousand Martial Palace and then around at the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Silence! No one had expected Hu Bubai to be defeated so quickly and thoroughly.</p><p></p><p>Even Hu Bubai himself wore an expression of disbelief.</p><p></p><p>In his view, even if he lost, it should have been after an intense battle.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he made his move, he saw sword light surrounding him, and with a few flashes, he was defeated!</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother is so strong!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>The red cat sitting on the golden chair looked at the group of powerful beast cultivators and said, "Did you see that? This is the might of our Beast Clan's Supreme One!"</p><p></p><p>The beast cultivators all wore dumbfounded expressions.</p><p></p><p>Is our Beast Clan Supreme One really human?</p><p></p><p>"The Supreme One is mighty indeed!"</p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being our Beast Clan Supreme One!"</p><p></p><p>Never mind, as long as he's the Beast Clan Supreme One it's fine. Whatever the Great Beast King says must be right.</p><p></p><p>The beast cultivators praised admiringly, feeling extremely honored.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this. In the entire Spirit Realm, no one besides him was a match for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Not Wu Tiannan, not even Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already reached the peak of the Divine Origin Realm and accumulated profound foundations. He was just a tiny bit away from perfecting those foundations and breaking through to the Divine Power Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I am supreme among the Spirit Realm's prodigies. All of you prodigies, come at me together. I, Xu Yan, will suppress you all alone!" Xu Yan declared arrogantly, looking at the group of Spirit Realm prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Though his words were arrogant, at this moment, not a single prodigy stepped forward, nor did the crowd surge with anger.</p><p></p><p>Because Xu Yan had earned the right to say this!</p><p></p><p>Seeing no one respond to his challenge, Xu Yan suddenly felt bored. These Spirit Realm prodigies were all cowards.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is ranked first on the Prodigy List. There's no need for further matches. Anyone who objects can issue a challenge," the Great Zhou Emperor announced.</p><p></p><p>No one objected!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left the battle arena, glancing at the Thousand Martial Palace. He felt bored with them too. Although he now had the power to suppress the palace, it no longer seemed necessary.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the pinnacle of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace master and others wore reluctant expressions, but were helpless. Even Hu Bubai had lost. Their only relief was that Xu Yan hadn't killed him.</p><p></p><p>"How strange that Xu Yan didn't kill him," Fu Tianhai said with a somewhat regretful look.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor gave him a disdainful glance and said, "Xu Yan is already a powerful expert. His mentality is completely different now. People like Hu Bubai are like juniors in his eyes - he can't be bothered to kill them.</p><p></p><p>"Besides, does Xu Yan even have a grudge with the Thousand Martial Palace? Even if there were past conflicts, he's vented his anger. He's already at the pinnacle of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"He's not like certain people who take pleasure in bullying juniors."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai rolled his eyes and said, "I just wanted to see a show. I wondered if those shameless Thousand Martial Palace fellows would open that illusory bridge after suffering such a big loss."</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor couldn't be bothered to respond to him.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother Xu, why didn't you kill those Thousand Martial Palace guys?" Meng Shushu asked curiously on the Changqing Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"In my eyes, they're already juniors. There's no fun in killing them," Xu Yan shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>Is this the mindset of a powerful expert? Or had Xu Yan already started to develop the mentality of a great master?</p><p></p><p>"It's my turn to make a move!" Meng Chong grinned happily, holding a knife in his hand as he instantly descended onto the battle arena.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As soon as he landed, he instantly transformed into a 90-foot golden body, covered in indestructible divine armor, like a god descending, majestic and awe-inspiring.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Knife Master Meng Chong, a Spirit Sect prodigy. Who dares to battle me?"</p><p></p><p>Such an imposing aura shook the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>"It's Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>"So strong! What do you think, is Meng Chong stronger or Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"Definitely Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>A person walked out from the Thunder Cloud Manor, holding a purple hammer in his hand. Thunder clouds surrounded his body. As he walked out, the sound of thunder rumbled above his head.</p><p></p><p>Lightning crisscrossed, brewing a thunderstorm.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll experience the might of the Blade Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and make your move!" Meng Chong said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Fierce lightning struck down with a hammer blow, pouring down and engulfing Meng Chong's massive body.</p><p></p><p>When the lightning dissipated, Meng Chong still stood proudly, grinning as he said: "Not bad, just a slight tingling sensation. Since you attacked with thunder, then take my Wind Thunder Fist!"</p><p></p><p>With that, he threw a punch.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Thunder Fist erupted forth. No matter how the opponent wielded their divine weapon, they still could not withstand the power of this punch.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The genius of Thunder Cloud Manor was defeated!</p><p></p><p>In the battle of geniuses, unsurprisingly, Xu Yan took first place, Meng Chong second, and Su Lingxiu third.</p><p></p><p>By the time Fang Hao took the stage, the geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sects had all made their appearances. This concerned the dominance of the Spirit Sects and the structure of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>For the first time, the Qimen martial arts truly displayed their might in the Spirit Realm. When the Qimen Arsenal emerged, countless swords flew out and blade light flashed coldly. The Heaven and Earth Qimen reversed the four directions, and when formations were deployed, they trapped one opponent after another.</p><p></p><p>Watching the battle in the arena, the geniuses of Thousand Martial Palace's Niu Qiansheng, Thunder Cloud Manor, and Imperial Spirit Mansion all made their moves, but none could overcome Fang Hao. Instead, they were trapped.</p><p></p><p>At this point, the Transcendent Spirit Sects could no longer sit still.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This Fang Hao is no ordinary person. We Transcendent Spirit Sects cannot overcome him."</p><p></p><p>"Must we accept the Eternal Alliance breaking the structure of the Spirit Realm? The dominance of the Spirit Sects is the rule, how can it be broken?"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master and others discussed gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Let's request the Venerable to descend!" the Thousand Martial Palace Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Isn't that too rash?" The Thunder Cloud Manor Master frowned.</p><p></p><p>"When the Divine Bridge opens, there will naturally be a decision. Why request the Venerable to descend now?" The Imperial Spirit Mansion Master also said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Do you really want to let them enter that place?" The Thousand Martial Palace Master said angrily.</p><p></p><p>The Thunder Cloud Manor Master and Imperial Spirit Mansion Master fell silent.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, the Thunder Cloud Manor Master sighed and said: "That place is already too ancient. What opportunities could still remain there? What difference would it make if they enter?"</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!" The Imperial Spirit Mansion Master nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Do as you please!" Seeing this, the Thousand Martial Palace Master snorted and left with a flick of his sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, the Thunder Cloud Manor Master and Imperial Spirit Mansion Master also returned to their respective camps.</p><p></p><p>"Palace Master, how did it go?" The elders of the Thousand Martial Palace gathered to ask.</p><p></p><p>"They don't agree to request the Venerable to descend!" The Thousand Martial Palace Master said with gritted teeth.</p><p></p><p>"This... are we just going to let it be?" The elders of the Thousand Martial Palace said unwillingly.</p><p></p><p>"If they won't request it, my Thousand Martial Palace will! Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Fang Hao - these people must all die!" The Thousand Martial Palace Master said with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"All of you prepare. My Thousand Martial Palace will request the Venerable to descend!" The Thousand Martial Palace Master ordered solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Palace Master!" The elders of the Thousand Martial Palace all responded.</p><p></p><p>The final battle of geniuses was proceeding intensely. Fang Hao used Qimen martial arts to defeat one genius after another from the Transcendent Spirit Sects, ranking fourth on the Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Transcendent Spirit Sects all had unsightly expressions. The Thousand Martial Palace was preparing to have Fang Hao, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu fight to determine the final rankings.</p><p></p><p>However, when faced with Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao directly admitted defeat.</p><p></p><p>The battle between the top four would not be seen. So the geniuses of the Spirit Sects prepared to compete for fifth place.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the Red Cat appeared.</p><p></p><p>The might of a great demon surged forth, demonic techniques were displayed, defeating genius after genius, even Hu Bubai was defeated.</p><p></p><p>At this point, all the Spirit Sect martial artists had unsightly expressions.</p><p></p><p>Among the top five of the Genius Ranking, there wasn't a single genius from the Spirit Sects! After this, the genius battles began to return to normal, with exceptionally fierce confrontations between geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng also entered the arena.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, and Zi Yun also entered in succession, all ultimately ranking within the top hundred of the Genius Ranking.</p><p></p><p>While the genius competition was ongoing and the Thousand Martial Palace was preparing to request the Venerable to descend, far beyond Hong Province, in Ice Province, one of the eighteen provinces of the Spirit Realm, dramatic changes were taking place.</p><p></p><p>The original location of the Silent Snow Palace had transformed into a black cave.</p><p></p><p>A warm but not scorching aura constantly poured out from the black cave, continuously spreading throughout Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>The originally snow-covered Ice Province could no longer see any snow or ice, as all the accumulated snow had melted.</p><p></p><p>The entire Ice Province had become warm.</p><p></p><p>As the vast ice and snow of Ice Province melted, the water flowed out of Ice Province in torrents. The first to suffer was Cloud Province, which bordered Ice Province.</p><p></p><p>Endless water came rolling from Ice Province. In the blink of an eye, crisis had descended.</p><p></p><p>This was a crisis for the entire Spirit Realm! The renowned experts of Cloud Province had all gone to Hong Province to witness the grand event of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The entire Spirit Realm was discussing the genius competition, waiting for news of the genius battles to arrive, wondering who would claim the top spot and become the number one genius.</p><p></p><p>On a small river in Cloud Province near Ice Province, several boats were drifting along. Over a dozen martial artists were discussing the genius competition.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a rumbling sound came, and the earth began to shake.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?" A group of martial artists looked up in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"Look quickly, what's that?" Suddenly, a martial artist pointed ahead in horror and asked.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked up. Amidst the rumbling, a great mountain ahead suddenly collapsed, and along with the mountain's collapse, a terrifying flood of water was sweeping towards them!</p><p></p><p>The scene of heaven and earth shattering shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>With a cry of alarm, the martial artists on the boats flew into the air, fleeing backwards.</p><p></p><p>Among these martial artists, some were at the Small Celestial realm, while others were at the Master realm.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with such a terrifying flood, even they felt fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't the only place. All areas bordering Ice Province saw scenes like an apocalyptic flood. Even Small Celestial realm martial artists, if they were a bit slow in escaping, were instantly submerged in the rolling flood, disappearing into the surging waters.</p><p></p><p>"Run quickly!"</p><p></p><p>In a great city, everyone was terrified.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists above the Small Celestial realm only had time to grab their weaker family members before soaring into the sky and fleeing far away.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The city collapsed, submerged in the flood.</p><p></p><p>Those who couldn't escape in time all disappeared into the flood. Even Great Celestial realm experts, once caught in the flood, were in extreme danger.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>"Everyone flee quickly, this old man will hold back the flood for a moment!"</p><p></p><p>In one great city, a few Spiritual Celestial realm martial artists rose into the air, their auras surging as they tried to hold back the flood, buying time for others to escape! However, faced with the might of heaven and earth in this massive flood, even Spiritual Celestial realm experts working together could hardly resist. After just a short while, they felt their strength depleting, on the verge of collapse!</p><p></p><p>"We can't hold on!"</p><p></p><p>"Why is this flood so terrifying? It seems to be coming from Ice Province?"</p><p></p><p>Some Spiritual Celestial realm experts rose above the white clouds to avoid the flood and went to investigate its source.</p><p></p><p>Cloud Province was submerged in a short time, with heavy casualties. It was like hell on earth. The once prosperous scenes were gone. Martial artists who had lost their loved ones were all dazed, unable to believe what they were seeing.</p><p></p><p>But the flood did not stop. The massive flood headed towards Great Marsh Province.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

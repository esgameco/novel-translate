        <h1>Chapter 490</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Did Tai Miao mistakenly think that Tian Zi was Tai Cang's male favorite? No wonder Tian Zi was so angry, cursing endlessly at the thought of it.</p><p></p><p>"That woman Tai Miao, her talent is not as good as Qing Yu's, her strength is not as good as Qing Yu's, she can't compete with her, yet she blames me for it. It's infuriating!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Zi took a sip of tea and continued cursing, recounting how Tai Miao tried to curry favor, how she acted cold and aloof in front of others, yet acted coy and dependent in front of Tai Cang, and so on.</p><p></p><p>It was clear that Tian Zi harbored deep resentment towards Tai Miao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen walked silently through the mountains and forests, making no sound, as if waiting for something.</p><p></p><p>"It should be about time."</p><p></p><p>Based on the timing, those four Tiansha warriors should have already entered the Qinghua Realm. If things went smoothly, they should have captured Xu Yan by now.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was waiting. If the four failed and were all killed, the Qinghua Realm would be off-limits to him. He would have to stay away and only report to his lord. </p><p></p><p>If the four succeeded in capturing Xu Yan, then he would need to take action. The great merit of capturing Xu Yan and obtaining the Dragon Subduing technique could only be his!</p><p></p><p>"It seems they must have failed!"</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Tian Seventeen's expression grew solemn.</p><p></p><p>Four Divine Sovereign realm experts had failed. Could it be that the person behind Xu Yan was a Supreme Being? Or even a Realm Lord?</p><p></p><p>If so, this meant that besides his lord, there were other supreme experts plotting something.</p><p></p><p>What puzzled Tian Seventeen was, if there was a Supreme Being or even a Realm Lord hidden in the Divine Realm, why hadn't his lord sensed anything? And why hadn't any other powerful experts noticed?</p><p></p><p>"Not going to the Qinghua Realm myself earlier was a wise decision."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen felt somewhat relieved.</p><p></p><p>After planning everything in the Nine Mountains Realm, when contact with the Qinghua Realm was lost, he didn't go investigate personally. This proved to be a very wise move.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen continued waiting. He had to wait for definitive news.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, a spirit bird arrived.</p><p></p><p>"So they really did fail!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen let out a breath and issued orders that members of the Divine Realm's Tiansha and Diying were not to approach the Qinghua Realm!</p><p></p><p>"I should report to my lord now!"</p><p></p><p>Going to a hidden location, Tian Seventeen carved out a cave in the mountainside.</p><p></p><p>With a solemn and respectful expression, he took out a statue and placed it on a stone table. He knelt reverently before the table, and his soul force surged out, entering a pearl on the statue's forehead.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The statue emitted a faint glow, rippling like water. At a certain moment, the statue's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Seventeen, how did it go?" </p><p></p><p>The voice was somewhat gruff.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, there may be a Supreme Being or even a Realm Lord behind Xu Yan. The situation in the Qinghua Realm is unclear..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen respectfully reported.</p><p></p><p>He reported everything about the four people's failure to capture Xu Yan to Tiansha.</p><p></p><p>"A Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Tiansha's voice became a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>Then there was a long silence, as if he was pondering something.</p><p></p><p>"If it really is a Realm Lord, among the various Realm Lords, there is only one most likely possibility."</p><p></p><p>Tiansha's voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about the Qinghua Realm matter anymore. After the Diying Realm fully merges with the Tahe Realm, someone will naturally go deal with it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Then, he reported in detail on the current situation in the Divine Realm, including the rampant Mingyu and Wumo, how the Divine Realm's power had greatly decreased, and how the world was in turmoil. Everyone had their own agenda, leading to an inability to unite against the Mingyu and Wumo chaos.</p><p></p><p>After reporting on the Divine Realm situation, Tian Seventeen respectfully said: "Please instruct me, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Tiansha's voice carried a hint of coldness as he said: "Mingyu and Wumo have gone too far. This world is ultimately not their world. We can cooperate, but they can't overreach.</p><p></p><p>"Calm down the Mingyu and Wumo chaos a bit. They should stay in the Heavenly Abyss, or near it."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen respectfully agreed.</p><p></p><p>"You've completed your tasks very well. There will be great rewards. When the Divine Realm and Dao Realm reunite, you can return."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"If there are any other situations, report immediately!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The statue's glow began to fade, and its bright eyes dimmed.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen respectfully put away the statue. His expression showed some fatigue as he took out a divine herb and put it in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>Although he could contact the Dao Realm through the statue as a bridge, each time consumed a significant amount of soul force.</p><p></p><p>"Suppressing Mingyu and Wumo, driving them back to the Heavenly Abyss, what kind of cooperation did my lord reach with them?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen wondered.</p><p></p><p>However, he only needed to complete the tasks assigned by his lord. Since his lord ordered Mingyu and Wumo warriors to be driven back to the Heavenly Abyss, he didn't need to know the reasons. He just had to follow orders and complete the task well!</p><p></p><p>"Should I take action personally?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen hesitated.</p><p></p><p>If he acted personally, wouldn't that expose the existence of a Divine Sovereign realm expert in the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Although the Diying Realm hasn't fully descended yet, the Dao Realm's aura has already poured down. The upper limit of the Immortal realm has been opened. Since that's the case, let a few Tiansha break through to the Tianhe realm, then suppress the Mingyu and Wumo chaos."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Tian Seventeen began to take action.</p><p></p><p>With the strength of Tianhe realm warriors, it would be enough to end the Mingyu and Wumo chaos. After all, up to now, the power limit for those entering the Divine Realm from the Heavenly Abyss was still the Immortal realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tahe realm was the most turbulent of the Divine Realm's 36 realms, and the falling Diying Realm was connecting with the Tahe realm.</p><p></p><p>Powerful spiritual energy storms were spreading from the Diying Realm.</p><p></p><p>The current Tahe Sect no longer had the ability to handle the current chaos in the Divine Realm. Among the Divine Realm's 36 realms, only a few realms like Tai Miao and Da Yan had not yet been ravaged by Mingyu and Wumo.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heavenly Venerable from various realms had now gathered in the Tahe realm.</p><p></p><p>"Those Mingyu and Wumo bastards are running rampant in our Divine Realm. Are we just going to let them be?"</p><p></p><p>Among the many Immortal Heavenly Venerables, a burly man holding a giant axe roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Our Divine Realm's strength has greatly decreased, almost fatally wounded. How can we resist the Heavenly Abyss chaos? The only solution now is to wait for Dao Realm experts to descend before we can sweep away this chaos."</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Heavenly Venerable sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit! If we join forces to sweep through, how can we let Mingyu and Wumo be so arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>The burly man raged.</p><p></p><p>"How can we sweep through? Are Mingyu and Wumo's forces weak? Unless Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Jiang Buping take action!"</p><p></p><p>Another Immortal Heavenly Venerable said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>At these words, everyone fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other two had the power to crush Immortal Heavenly Venerables, but no one dared to force the three to act. And those powerful experts from Mingyu and Wumo didn't seem to have any intention of provoking the three.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A spiritual energy storm blew in, and suddenly someone in the crowd soared into the air, flying towards where the falling Diying Realm was located.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, the Immortal realm bottleneck has probably been opened. We can break through to the Tianhe realm now. As long as we break through to the Tianhe realm, mere..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What are those bastards from the Netherworld and the Demon Witches worth?"</p><p></p><p>As soon as these words were spoken, the crowd of Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords became extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, with the Domain of the Way falling and merging with the Divine Realm, the bottleneck limit has naturally been broken. We can now break through in the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Another Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lord flew towards the direction of the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>The burly man holding a giant axe frowned. Those two people from earlier seemed to be powerful figures from the Heavenly Bane Shadow Realm? Although he didn't know what schemes the Heavenly Bane Shadow Realm had, what those two said was true - the upper limit bottleneck of the Immortal Realm had indeed been opened, and breakthrough was now possible in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm had not completely fallen yet, but the spiritual energy and Dao rhythms of the Domain of the Way had already poured down. Moreover, at the site of the fall, the laws of heaven and earth were emerging and Dao rhythms permeated the air, making it the perfect place for breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>He immediately moved and flew towards the direction where the Shadow Realm was falling.</p><p></p><p>The other Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords who heard this all showed delighted expressions. After carefully sensing, they indeed discovered that the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had become more active.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that soon after, those at the Grand Unity Realm would have the conditions to break through the upper limit of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords headed towards the site where the Shadow Realm was falling.</p><p></p><p>Although the upper limit bottleneck of the Immortal Realm had been opened, not all Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords had the strength to break through.</p><p></p><p>At minimum, one had to be at the peak of the Immortal Realm and have touched the bottleneck of the Heavenly Unity Realm, or even gained some insights into breaking through. Otherwise, breakthrough would not be possible.</p><p></p><p>The tremors in the Divine Realm continued, while the chaos from the Netherworld and Demon Witches ran rampant everywhere. Gradually, Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords joined forces to form alliances to resist the turmoil from the Netherworld and Demon Witches.</p><p></p><p>The battles grew increasingly fierce, with casualties among Divine Realm martial artists becoming more and more severe.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Hundred Battles Hall, a top power in the Divine Realm, charged into the army of Netherworld warriors with high morale. The killing shook the heavens, with blood energy rippling for hundreds of miles around.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of the Hundred Battles Hall had always been known for their formidable combat power. They had honed their fighting will and condensed the intent of a hundred battles through years of killing in the Heavenly Abyss. Thus, they were familiar foes to the warriors of the Netherworld and Demon Witches.</p><p></p><p>After one great battle, the Netherworld suffered heavy casualties. The Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords of the Hundred Battles Hall fought fearlessly and ferociously, with one person battling two Blood Sons alone.</p><p></p><p>Puff puff!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, in the midst of the great battle, the forms of the Blood Sons froze for an instant. In that instant, they were slain by the experts of the Hundred Battles Hall!</p><p></p><p>With the fall of the Blood Sons, the remaining Blood Disciples of the Netherworld were naturally slaughtered in a one-sided massacre.</p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen silently lurked in the distance, quietly observing this battle. The fall of those two Blood Sons just now was due to his secret intervention.</p><p></p><p>His actions were very covert. Even the Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords of the Hundred Battles Hall could not detect him.</p><p></p><p>"It should be about time!" </p><p></p><p>Sky Seventeen looked towards the direction of the Grand Unity Realm.</p><p></p><p>According to the calculated timing, the first martial artist to break through to the Heavenly Unity Realm was about to appear.</p><p></p><p>This martial artist was an Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lord of the Heavenly Bane. He was already at the peak of the Immortal Realm and had gained insights into the Heavenly Unity Realm. He only lacked the right environment for breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Near the location of the Shadow Realm, an aura soared to the sky, becoming one with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Unity Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Today, I have broken through to the Heavenly Unity Realm. I shall go forth to suppress the Netherworld and Demon Witches!"</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, the martial artist who had just broken through to the Heavenly Unity Realm instantly disappeared, heading straight beyond the Grand Unity Realm.</p><p></p><p>As news spread of the first martial artist breaking through to the Heavenly Unity Realm, more martial artists who had been stuck at the Immortal Realm rushed over to break through to the Heavenly Unity Realm. This included experts from the Great Flame Dynasty and even the Sect Master of the Supreme Ethereal Sect.</p><p></p><p>Who wouldn't want to break through early and increase their strength in this turbulent world?</p><p></p><p>Naturally, there were also experts coming from the Supreme Kun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among these experts were those who had grudges against Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>With Heavenly Unity Realm martial artists taking action, the chaos from the Netherworld and Demon Witches was gradually suppressed and forced back into the Heavenly Abyss. Order began to return to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the tremors in the world continued unabated. As time passed, people finally grew accustomed to the tremors and were able to find ways to cultivate with peace of mind amidst the shaking.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in the Grand Unity Realm became increasingly active, with spiritual qi surging and Dao rhythms permeating outwards. More and more martial artists began breaking through to the Heavenly Unity Realm.</p><p></p><p>With greater strength came greater confidence, and people became more arrogant.</p><p></p><p>Especially when suppressing the Netherworld and Demon Witches, they had an overwhelming advantage. This meant that Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords were now as weak as little grasshoppers to them.</p><p></p><p>"How can our Myriad Treasures Alliance let this great humiliation go? We must have revenge on Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>"Well said!"</p><p></p><p>Several Heavenly Unity Realm martial artists of the Myriad Treasures Alliance gathered together, speaking with cold expressions.</p><p></p><p>"We originally thought we would have to wait for envoys from the Domain of the Way to descend before we could avenge the humiliation of our Myriad Treasures Alliance. But now we can take action ourselves, without troubling the envoys from the Domain of the Way!"</p><p></p><p>The speaker was Yan Shanhe!</p><p></p><p>The conflict between Meng Chong and the Myriad Treasures Alliance had started with him. Therefore, he most wanted to see Meng Chong suppressed. Otherwise, if Meng Chong held a grudge and came looking for him, he would surely die!</p><p></p><p>Now that he had broken through to the Heavenly Unity Realm, his confidence had greatly increased. It was time to join forces with the other Heavenly Unity Realm martial artists of the Myriad Treasures Alliance to seek revenge on Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"That brat Xu Yan is too overbearing, actually daring to threaten and rebuke us. How can we not avenge such a great humiliation?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right! That brat Xu Yan is too arrogant. It's time to kill his arrogant气焰!"</p><p></p><p>In another location, over a dozen Heavenly Unity Realm martial artists gathered together.</p><p></p><p>They all had cold and fierce expressions, with anger in their eyes, as if they had suffered a great humiliation! Without exception, these martial artists were all here for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Back then when Xu Yan subdued the dragon, they had clamored to divide up the true dragon. As a result, they were forcefully suppressed by Xu Yan, so frightened they didn't dare to breathe. Now that their strength had increased, their confidence suddenly grew. Thinking back on it, they felt it was a great shame and humiliation, and all wanted revenge! However, Xu Yan's strength was formidable. They lacked confidence to act alone, so they gathered together, preparing to join forces to demand an explanation from Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>In the Grand Unity Realm, near a certain location where the Shadow Realm had fallen, a young man sat cross-legged on the ground. His aura surged, revealing the cultivation of the peak Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, if you want to become stronger, the ordinary path won't work. Even if you break through to the Heavenly Unity Realm, you probably won't be a match for Jiang Buping. Before breaking through to the Heavenly Unity Realm, you need to undergo blood refinement."</p><p></p><p>A gloomy voice sounded in the young man's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"How do I undergo blood refinement? As long as I can avenge Yan'er, I'm willing to die!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of Yun Yan'er, the young man's breathing became heavy and his eyes turned red.</p><p></p><p>That pearl of the Cloud Peak Sect, the peerless goddess in his heart, had actually been killed by Jiang Buping! Jiang Buping deserved to die!</p><p></p><p>Did he know that Yan'er had stopped scolding him so much, and her words to him had become gentler? This meant he would soon be able to gain Yan'er's favor! He finally had a chance to gain Yan'er's approval, and even win her heart!</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Buping killed her! Killing intent ravaged his mind, his eyes blood-red as if he wanted to devour someone.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, as long as you do as I, the Blood Extreme Ancestor, say, you can not only get revenge, but also avoid death. There's even a sliver of chance to revive that little girl."</p><p></p><p>A voice full of temptation echoed in the young man's soul.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

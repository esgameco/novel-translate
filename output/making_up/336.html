        <h1>Chapter 336</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Lishao and Haibo joined forces but were both defeated, and with the fall of the two great geniuses of the Azure Sea, it also meant that Xu Yan had suppressed all the geniuses of this generation in the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>From today on, the name of the Sword God Xu Yan will shake the Azure Sea!</p><p></p><p>After defeating Lishao and Haibo, Xu Yan did not linger, and the Submerge Sea Boat appeared. He stood on the Submerge Sea Boat and waved to Xie Lingfeng, and the Submerge Sea Boat turned into a faint blue light and disappeared from the sight of the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"First go to the nearest Azure Sea treasure land, then go to the Azure Sea Abyss, and finally go to the Azure Sea Black Pool, and then it should be time to go back to the Eighteen States and participate in the battle of the geniuses."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood on the Submerge Sea Boat, looking at the sea map in his hand, and made a decision on the exploration route ahead.</p><p></p><p>As for Xie Lingfeng, he was now looking at the former defeated subordinates with a smile, knowing that from today on, these former defeated subordinates would be trampled on by him again.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was searching for divine objects in the Azure Sea, while Meng Chong was also walking in the Spiritual Domain, comprehending his own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>In the Tian Ling State, after the Demon Clan was established, its control over the Tian Ling State was constantly increasing, and it even began to train an army.</p><p></p><p>In the Demon Clan Holy Palace, in the residence of the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Red Cat was embracing Zhu Xingzheng's shoulders, and his sharp claws were unconsciously extending out, swinging in front of Zhu Xingzheng's chest, making Zhu Xingzheng's scalp tingle with fear!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, Brother Zhu is indeed a person who knows how to do business. Let's make a big move next, and get rich together!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat said very satisfactorily.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng, however, was on the verge of tears. He felt that if he continued to cooperate with this fat tiger, he might be beaten to death!</p><p></p><p>It's too despicable.</p><p></p><p>"Qing State is a prosperous place, and next we need to expand the market to Qing State. What do you think, Brother Zhu?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's claws swung a few times as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"I think it's a very good idea, I will definitely open up the Qing State market."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, then I'll leave it to Brother Zhu."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat raised his paw and patted Zhu Xingzheng's shoulder, revealing a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this kind of business can't last long. Why don't we change the way we do it?"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng thought for a while and forced a smile to say.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't need to last long, this is a one-time deal, so you need to find a large batch of customers at once."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Okay then!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng resigned himself to his fate.</p><p></p><p>Hopefully this time, it will go smoothly.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat handed him a storage bag and said, "There are three hundred imperial tokens in it, six of which are above the sixth rank. I'm sure you know what to do, right?"</p><p></p><p>"I know!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng took the storage bag, his hands trembling slightly, but he had no choice.</p><p></p><p>Damn, they've already boarded the pirate ship, it's not easy to get off.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng left Tian Ling State and entered the Qing State, beginning to sell imperial tokens and spiritual beasts!</p><p></p><p>That's right!</p><p></p><p>The thing Zhu Xingzheng is cooperating with the Red Cat to do is to sell spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>If it was a normal sale, Zhu Xingzheng wouldn't be so anxious, but the deal is not normal.</p><p></p><p>The imperial tokens are fake and cannot be used to control spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>And after selling the spiritual beasts, the Red Cat would lead a group of spiritual beasts to attack the buyers' homes, accusing them of kidnapping the Demon Clan's members and demanding compensation for the losses.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who bought the spiritual beasts were scared to death. A group of spiritual beasts above the sixth rank came to attack, and they were lucky to survive, let alone bargain.</p><p></p><p>They ended up buying a spiritual beast at a low price, but their entire family fortune was lost, and the spiritual beast was gone, making them feel utterly defeated.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng seriously doubted that he, as a spiritual beast dealer, might be beaten to death! Qing State is the territory of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect's Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, an extremely prosperous state, and the cultivators here love to control spiritual beasts and capture spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng sold the spiritual beasts at low prices, naturally receiving a warm welcome, and the spiritual beasts he sold were all sixth-rank spiritual beasts, and even some above the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>This made the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion in Qing State uneasy. What methods did they use to control spiritual beasts above the sixth rank? After all, in the entire Qing State, only the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion had spiritual beasts above the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>Finally, an elder of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion found Zhu Xingzheng and wanted to buy all his spiritual beasts, and Zhu Xingzheng agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>The transaction took place in a branch of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual beasts that Zhu Xingzheng summoned came, and a few of the spiritual beasts above the sixth rank were cursing and scolding all the way, making the people of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion suddenly realize that this guy was actually so good at deceiving spiritual beasts?</p><p></p><p>Even spiritual beasts above the sixth rank were deceived?</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion even wanted to buy his skill of deceiving spiritual beasts, but Zhu Xingzheng could only muddle through.</p><p></p><p>After the transaction was completed, Zhu Xingzheng hurriedly fled.</p><p></p><p>Because these spiritual beasts were never really controlled, and they would soon cause a big trouble.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, a shocking event happened in Qing State! A spotted fierce tiger, claiming to be the Demon King, led a group of spiritual beasts above the sixth rank to invade the branch of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, scolding the elder of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, accusing them of kidnapping the Demon Clan members and demanding compensation for the Demon Clan's losses!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Clan directly detained the elder of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion and even threatened to make the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion give an explanation, and must compensate the Demon Clan for the losses!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Clan!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qing State was shaken, and the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion was shaken.</p><p></p><p>When did the spiritual beast clan become the Demon Clan? The powerful cultivators of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion were furious and would not submit, so they naturally took a strong stance.</p><p></p><p>However, what they didn't expect was that the Demon King was so powerful that he was not inferior to the master of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion, and his Demon Arts were even more profound.</p><p></p><p>For example, he could instantly create a disorienting and confusing illusion, causing two elders of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion to be unaware and be captured by spiritual beasts above the sixth rank! The strength of the spiritual beast clan was already powerful, and the Demon King was even stronger, and he seemed to be a bit shameless, with unbelievable methods, so the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion was caught off guard and suffered a big loss.</p><p></p><p>In the end, the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion used spiritual beasts to try to forcefully suppress the Demon Clan, but that Demon King used some unknown method to actually break the binding of a spiritual beast above the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>And under the Demon King's smooth talk, that spiritual beast above the sixth rank became fanatical and directly betrayed them, howling to dedicate itself to the revival of the Demon Clan!</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Talisman Pavilion was really scared.</p><p></p><p>In a hurry, they had no countermeasures and could only pinch their noses to negotiate.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they sent people to hunt down Zhu Xingzheng, this despicable spiritual beast dealer.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the news about Zhu Xingzheng, the spiritual beast dealer, colluding with spiritual beasts to deceive people was exposed, and there were bounties on him all over Qing State.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng's face turned green, and he was so scared that he hid in Tian Ling State and didn't dare to go anywhere, not even daring to go back to the Myriad Worlds Alliance, after all, he had also cheated some of the powerful cultivators of the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to cheat the people of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, but unfortunately they were targeted by the Red Cat, and under the threat of the Red Cat's claws, he could only grit his teeth and do it.</p><p></p><p>Now, there's no turning back.</p><p></p><p>"It's retribution!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng was on the verge of tears, after cheating and deceiving so many spiritual beasts, he ended up being cheated himself.</p><p></p><p>At the border between Tian Ling State and Qing State, the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion and the Demon Clan were in negotiations, and this time even the master of the Spiritual Talisman Pavilion came to negotiate in person.</p><p></p><p>On the Demon Clan side, the Red Cat's body was as huge as a small mountain, sitting on a...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The huge chair had its two front paws resting on the armrests, overlooking the powerful cultivators of the Yuling Manor.</p><p></p><p>On its left was Jade Little Dragon, and on its right was Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>The three great demonic kings had emerged.</p><p></p><p>Behind the three demonic kings were a group of demonic clan cultivators above the sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>In the Yuling Manor camp, Cui Huayu looked at the great demonic king with a puzzled expression, wondering why it seemed so familiar? Could it be that big cat?</p><p></p><p>"Yuling Manor, you have bullied our demonic clan too much, kidnapping and using our demonic clan disciples, this is a great humiliation. Today, the Yuling Manor must give an explanation."</p><p></p><p>The mighty voice of the Red Cat Demon resounded.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Yuling Manor twitched at the corner of his mouth, always feeling that this fat old tiger seemed to love to put on airs and show off its might.</p><p></p><p>But what is this demonic clan? What's going on?</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Beast King..."</p><p></p><p>"I am the Great Demonic King!"</p><p></p><p>"Great Demonic King, there has been some misunderstanding between our Yuling Manor and your spiritual and demonic clans, and these misunderstandings were all created by that spiritual beast trafficker..."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, what misunderstanding? That trafficker must be your Yuling Manor's person, don't try to make excuses, you must give an explanation!"</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Yuling Manor's face turned black.</p><p></p><p>The negotiation between the demonic clan and the Yuling Manor was ongoing.</p><p></p><p>While the negotiation was in the background, on a mountain peak, a flying boat was hovering.</p><p></p><p>"This Red Cat has learned to be cunning!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>This cultured tiger has actually learned to cheat people.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cat looks mighty and majestic."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"I still prefer the chubby little Red Cat."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling murmured.</p><p></p><p>The negotiation was ongoing, the tension was escalating, the Red Cat's appetite was too big, and it demanded the Yuling Manor to compensate ten thousand spiritual grade medicinal herbs.</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Yuling Manor almost exploded, ten thousand spiritual grade medicinal herbs, this fat tiger really dares to ask for so much!</p><p></p><p>After further negotiations, the Red Cat and the lord of the Yuling Manor had a fierce battle, the lord of the Yuling Manor's expression was very unsightly, he almost couldn't withstand the Great Demonic King's violent attacks.</p><p></p><p>After much bargaining, an agreement was reached, and the Red Cat was very satisfied, this deal was worth it.</p><p></p><p>As for the Yuling Manor's retaliation, it was not afraid of it.</p><p></p><p>Tianliang State was the best barrier, even if the Yuling Manor allied with other supreme spiritual sects, they could not exterminate the demonic clan, but would suffer heavy losses instead.</p><p></p><p>The Yuling Manor brought back the captured elder, and the demonic clan, including the Red Cat, retreated to Tianliang State.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>After arranging the tasks for the demonic clan, the Red Cat, Jade Little Dragon, and Little Ha came to the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>As always, the Red Cat turned into a chubby cat, excitedly running to Li Xuan's feet, currying favor with the master, and then going to curry favor with Su Ling.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, it handed over the spiritual herbs obtained from the Yuling Manor to Su Ling.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, you've really made it big!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling rubbed the chubby Red Cat's head and smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was very proud.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon circled around, but did not see Xu Yan, feeling a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha did not see Fang Hao either, so they did not stay in the flying boat for long and returned to the Demonic Clan Holy Palace to handle demonic clan affairs.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat drifted around Tianliang State, and the Red Cat took this opportunity to stay in the flying boat to curry favor with the master and Su Ling, and replenish the consumed medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>"Your great demonic techniques still have a lot of room for improvement, such as the demonic clan's divine abilities, you should also ponder on them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan lightly tapped the Red Cat's head with the jade talisman in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded!</p><p></p><p>"You have already surpassed the other spiritual beasts, step by step, you can start to learn the Demonic Martial Dao. Since you want to establish your own demonic clan, you should also comprehend the transformation technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and transmitted the self-created transformation technique to the Red Cat's consciousness through the point demon technique.</p><p></p><p>Since it was a demonic clan, if it did not know how to transform, it could only be in a beast form, which would be a bit different from the impression of the demonic clan.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat pondered, transformation? </p><p></p><p>It recalled the scene of standing upright and hugging Zhu Xingzheng, if it transformed, with a mighty tiger head, muscular and powerful, holding Zhu Xingzheng with a big hand, it would be quite majestic.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after transformation, the Demonic Martial Dao would also be different, it could use martial techniques and skills like a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded, it must transform!</p><p></p><p>"Master, I think the Red Cat is still so cute, it won't be cute after transforming!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling giggled.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat hurriedly expressed that it would always be cute, it would only transform outside!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled wryly, the Red Cat was really smart, knowing how to get better treatment!</p><p></p><p>The flying boat drifted in Tianliang State, the Red Cat had the demonic clan collect and send many spiritual herbs, before leaving Tianliang State, Su Ling gave the Red Cat a pile of medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>With these medicinal pills, the strength of the demonic clan will be further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>And the Red Cat also began to cultivate demonic clan geniuses, nurturing its own demonic clan disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to Yunshan State."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling said.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Caicai were in Yunshan State at the Taicai Sect, it would be a good opportunity to visit old friends.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat headed to Yunshan State, and landed just outside the nearest major city to the Taicai Sect. The news reached the Taicai Sect, and Du Yuying and Yun Caicai came down from the Taicai Sect and went to the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Cui'er and Wushuang were naturally there as well.</p><p></p><p>Old friends reunited, naturally there was a round of catching up. Li Xuan also infused a divine ability into the jade talisman from before, enhancing its power.</p><p></p><p>Time flowed like running water, hurriedly not waiting for anyone.</p><p></p><p>The competition among geniuses had entered the final stage, the Spiritual Domain Genius Ranking had listed the genius spots.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Fang Hao, Su Ling were ranked in the top four.</p><p></p><p>On the day the ranking was established, Su Ling made a move and defeated the originally ranked fourth genius, replacing that spot.</p><p></p><p>Aside from this genius ranking, the core disciples of the supreme spiritual sects were not listed.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not listed, they still had the qualification to participate in the final battle, this was the privilege of the supreme spiritual sects, which no one could shake.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield for the genius competition's final battle had been determined, in Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>Hongzhou was also a coastal state, like Wuzhou, it belonged to the states connected to the Cyan Sea, and was the traditional battlefield where the geniuses of the ages fought for spots.</p><p></p><p>In this genius competition, the top hundred would obtain a spot, as well as an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>As for what the opportunity was and what the spot was used for, the major supreme spiritual sects had not revealed.</p><p></p><p>Three months later, the genius battle would begin.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses and powerful cultivators from all sides were gathering towards Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>The entire martial dao world of the Spiritual Domain was attracted by this genius competition's final battle. In this genius competition, there was no genius from Bingzhou, and they were also overlooked.</p><p></p><p>The supreme spiritual sects were naturally preoccupied with the affairs of the Myriad World Alliance, and the other sects also did not pay much attention to these matters.</p><p></p><p>Unaware that Bingzhou had already undergone a drastic change.</p><p></p><p>The crisis was silently approaching.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

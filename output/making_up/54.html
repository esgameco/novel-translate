        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 54 Has His Majesty Gone Mad? (Seeking Continued Reading)</p><p></p><p>Jin'an, the capital of Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The struggle for the crown prince is about to be settled, and Chen, the senior minister who supported the Third Prince, has submitted his resignation and obtained the permission of the Qi Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Chen's resignation and departure from the capital is no easy feat, closely related to his revered status as an elder statesman of two dynasties.</p><p></p><p>As for Guo Rongshan, the Vice Minister of Personnel who was considered one of the Third Prince's confidants, his ultimate fate remains undecided, with the best-case scenario being dismissal from office.</p><p></p><p>The worst-case scenarios are exile or even the execution of his entire family!</p><p></p><p>It is widely known in the court that the faction of the Crown Prince is taking action in Donghe Prefecture, and the final outcome will determine Guo Rongshan's fate - whether he will be imprisoned on the charge of his son-in-law colluding with the Tianmu Sect, or if some other pretext will be used to decide his fate.</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Study, the Qi Emperor is trembling as he reads the secret edict from Donghe Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As the supreme ruler, the Emperor is experiencing fear for the first time.</p><p></p><p>A single person sweeping away an entire army! Is this something a mortal can accomplish?</p><p></p><p>But the secret edict does not lie!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's grandson, Xu Yan, single-handedly defeated an entire Shenwei Army without a scratch, and even had the composure to hold back from slaughtering them all.</p><p></p><p>"Guo Rongshan's grandson, isn't he supposed to be feeble-minded? Yet the entire court is talking about how this is the so-called feeble-minded person?"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor is shaking with rage, his face turning ashen.</p><p></p><p>A feeble-minded person has cultivated such formidable martial arts?</p><p></p><p>Who is the one truly feeble-minded here?</p><p></p><p>The legends are true! There are truly extraordinary hidden masters in the world, possessing unimaginable martial prowess!</p><p></p><p>"Guo Rongshan must die! Exterminate his entire family! Drag Guo Rongshan's whole clan down with Qi Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor's eyes flash with ruthlessness. </p><p></p><p>Since Qi Kingdom is doomed, he will have Guo Rongshan's family executed before they can reach the capital, and take them down with the kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right."</p><p></p><p>Just as he is about to issue the order for the extermination, the Qi Emperor suddenly realizes something.</p><p></p><p>He re-examines the secret edict carefully.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Junhe did not rebel, he only defeated the Shenwei Army, and he did not let the Tianmu Sect occupy the prefecture office..."</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the Qi Emperor understands.</p><p></p><p>Whether the Xu family rebels or not depends on his own attitude, on how he treats the Guo family!</p><p></p><p>If Guo Rongshan dies, the Qi royal house will be annihilated!</p><p></p><p>But if Guo Rongshan remains a minister of Qi, then Qi Kingdom will still be Qi Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor takes a deep breath, his expression grave. This decision will determine the fate of Qi Kingdom, and he cannot afford any carelessness.</p><p></p><p>"Summon my Third Son to the palace. Summon the Vice Minister of Personnel, Guo Rongshan, to the palace. Prepare for the ceremony of the Third Prince taking Guo as his teacher..."</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor issues the order with a stern demeanor.</p><p></p><p>Everything must be handled properly before the news from Donghe Prefecture reaches the capital.</p><p></p><p>The chief eunuch bows and hurries to carry out the orders.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince receives the summons and rushes to the palace, while Guo Rongshan, somewhat surprised by the sudden imperial summons, wonders if this means his family will emerge unscathed from the struggle for the crown.</p><p></p><p>He hastens to the palace.</p><p></p><p>However, upon arrival, he finds that the Qi Emperor has not summoned him to the Imperial Study, but to the Ancestral Temple.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan is perplexed - why would an ordinary minister like himself be summoned to the Ancestral Temple?</p><p></p><p>Guided by the eunuch, he arrives at the Ancestral Temple.</p><p></p><p>There, he sees the Third Prince, and the arrangements in the temple seem unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan is about to pay his respects, but the Qi Emperor, with a warm smile, supports him and says, "Guo Esteemed One, no need for formalities, please, have a seat!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this..."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan is bewildered as the Qi Emperor leads him to sit in the main seat of the Ancestral Temple.</p><p></p><p>"Guo Esteemed One, you are a peerless talent in the world. For my Third Son to have your favor is a great blessing. Today, let my Third Son formally take you as his teacher!"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor declares solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this cannot be!" </p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan is shocked, as the one before him is the Prince, how can there be such a teacher-student relationship?</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor, without further ado, presses Guo Rongshan's shoulders to seat him, then turns and sternly rebukes the Third Prince.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Why are you just standing there? Quickly perform the three bows and nine kowtows to pay respects to your revered teacher!"</p><p></p><p>"Father Emperor..."</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince was completely dumbfounded. What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Seeing the stern gaze of Emperor Qi, he trembled in fright, hastily kneeling down with a thud, performing the three bows and nine kowtows, and offering tea respectfully: "Disciple pays respects to the revered teacher!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was bewildered the entire time.</p><p></p><p>His mind was in a daze, like a muddy mess, and he was completely stupefied.</p><p></p><p>What was Emperor Qi trying to do?</p><p></p><p>"Guo Aiqing, quickly drink the tea!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi urged.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan took the tea and took a sip, still in a state of bewilderment the entire time.</p><p></p><p>"Third son, you must remember that a teacher for a day is a father for life. From now on, when you see Guo Aiqing, you must respect him as you would your own father!</p><p></p><p>"You must go pay your respects to Guo Aiqing every day, and if there is any disrespect, you will be severely punished!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi's tone became extremely stern towards the end.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince's body trembled, his face turning pale, and he hurriedly said, "Yes, yes, Father Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>His mind was in a muddy mess, feeling that the Emperor might have gone mad, otherwise how could he have done such a thing.</p><p></p><p>"Now get out of here!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi glared, and the Third Prince hastily took his leave.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Guo Aiqing, come, come, come, there are still matters of the court that require Guo Aiqing's assistance. With a capable minister like you, I am at ease!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi held Guo Rongshan's hand and strolled through the imperial garden, as if they were old friends, chatting casually, occasionally mentioning his grandson Xu Yan, and frequently praising Guo Rongshan for his loyalty and dedication to the court.</p><p></p><p>Among all the civil and military officials, only Guo Aiqing was truly loyal and patriotic!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's mind was in a muddy mess, and he even suspected that he might be dreaming.</p><p></p><p>After strolling around the imperial garden, Emperor Qi then led Guo Rongshan back to the ancestral temple, where they performed the ritual of becoming sworn brothers of different surnames.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's face turned pale, his body trembling, almost fainting.</p><p></p><p>The only thought in his mind was: "Has the Emperor gone mad?"</p><p></p><p>Thud, thud, thud!</p><p></p><p>The kowtows, the blood-drinking, the becoming of sworn brothers!</p><p></p><p>After going through the entire process, Guo Rongshan felt completely drained, both physically and mentally.</p><p></p><p>As for Emperor Qi, he felt slightly relieved in his heart.</p><p></p><p>His reasoning was simple: Since I and your grandfather are sworn brothers of different surnames, then you, Xu Yan, are also a sort of senior relative. I should be a bit gentler in my dealings with you.</p><p></p><p>After the oath-taking ceremony, Emperor Qi escorted Guo Rongshan out of the palace. Along the way, they encountered one of Emperor Qi's favorite concubines, who approached them gracefully.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's mind was still in a daze, and he instinctively looked up and even glanced at her a few more times.</p><p></p><p>This would normally be considered a grave offense of disrespect, but in his current state of confusion, he had no awareness of it.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi, seeing this, was delighted and asked, "Brother Guo, what do you think of Empress Cloud?"</p><p></p><p>"Empress Cloud is beautiful and virtuous, of course..." Guo Rongshan faltered, his heart suddenly racing. How could he be commenting on the Emperor's concubine?</p><p></p><p>Beads of cold sweat appeared on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Then, he heard Emperor Qi's excited voice: "Since Brother Guo likes her, bring Empress Cloud to Guo Aiqing's residence!"</p><p></p><p>What?!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was horrified, hastily saying, "That cannot be, that cannot be, Your Majesty! My wife is fierce, and I am terrified..."</p><p></p><p>"If that's the case, then never mind," Emperor Qi said, with a look of disappointment.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's wife was none other than Xu Yan's grandmother. If he angered her, wouldn't that bring him trouble?</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Empress Cloud had already fainted in terror on the ground...</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan returned home in a daze, his mind a muddy mess. His visit to the palace felt like a surreal dream!</p><p></p><p>"Father, what matter did His Majesty summon you for?" Guo Yun asked with a worried expression, following his father into the study.</p><p></p><p>His father had returned from the palace, and something seemed off about him.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked up and after a moment, uttered, "His Majesty seems to have a mental illness, with a slight loss of sanity."</p><p></p><p>Guo Yun: ???</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 340</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw that Jing Popo's expression was off, and he couldn't help but frown slightly. Did the other party realize that he was impersonating a Lingzong identity?</p><p></p><p>"There are many Lingzong in the Lingyu Domain. Could she really recognize them all? Or is it that my Lingzong attire is not realistic enough in its forgery?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The guardians of the Lingyu Domain Gate were not strong. As long as he slightly revealed his aura of a powerful cultivator, they would not dare to look him in the eye, let alone scrutinize the Lingzong insignia on his clothes. </p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan was confident that he could easily deceive them without being exposed.</p><p></p><p>However, he never expected to encounter Jing Popo midway, and that the other party seemed to have a keen eye and had actually detected the discrepancy.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was pondering whether to avoid Jing Popo and change into another set of attire before heading to the Lingyu Domain Gate -</p><p></p><p>Jing Popo coldly spoke, "What a presumptuous low-level cultivator, daring to impersonate a Lingzong identity! You deserve to die a thousand deaths!"</p><p></p><p>As a Lingzong cultivator with a not insignificant status in the Water Star Palace, Jing Popo could not sit idly by upon discovering a mere cultivator impersonating a Lingzong identity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, she realized that Xu Yan's strength was not powerful, so she prepared to casually kill this audacious imposter.</p><p></p><p>She raised her crutch, intending to strike at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The might of a Great Celestial Realm cultivator was undoubtedly displayed.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon wrapped around Xu Yan's wrist was somewhat dumbfounded. Did this old woman want to die too soon?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled. He had just been contemplating on avoiding this old woman and changing his attire before heading to the Lingyu Domain Gate. Now it seemed unnecessary.</p><p></p><p>Since she wanted to die so eagerly, he would oblige her!</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Yan gained a deeper understanding that the cultivators of the Lingzong and the Aristocratic Families were so lofty and contemptuous of low-level cultivators from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivators like Senior Shen are truly too rare among the Aristocratic Families!"</p><p></p><p>In comparison, Shen Haizhou could be considered a good person among the Aristocratic Families.</p><p></p><p>"If you insist on seeking your own death, then I shall grant it to you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't even bother to draw his sword. He simply extended his index and middle fingers, unleashing a sword intent that enveloped the heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Jing Popo's expression turned horrified. "You..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Her spiritual consciousness was instantly torn apart by excruciating pain, her vision darkening as the sword light engulfed her.</p><p></p><p>Jing Popo died.</p><p></p><p>She died even faster than Jiao Ming and Ping'er, not even making it to the Lingyu Domain Gate before being killed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grabbed the remnant storage bag and opened it, finding a jade token inside.</p><p></p><p>"Water Star Palace?"</p><p></p><p>This old woman was from the same Lingzong as that Jiao Ming.</p><p></p><p>"It seems she was also planning to go to the Inner Domain, perhaps because Jiao Ming has been missing for too long and she wanted to investigate?"</p><p></p><p>What business did the cultivators of the Water Star Palace have in the Inner Domain?</p><p></p><p>Next time he returned to the Lingyu Domain, he would ask Shen Haizhou about the status of the Water Star Palace.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the storage bag, Xu Yan headed towards the Lingyu Domain Gate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the grand hall in front of the Lingyu Domain Gate, two guardians were seated in meditation, seemingly diligently cultivating.</p><p></p><p>In reality, they were engaged in a secret transmission.</p><p></p><p>"Old Ke, what do you think about the Dai Family's situation?"</p><p></p><p>The guardian on the right asked through the transmission.</p><p></p><p>Although they were guarding the Lingyu Domain Gate, they also received news about some major events in the Yuzhou Martial Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The left guardian, Ke, spoke in a solemn tone, "The Dai Family is likely to be ruined, and the Yuling Sect and the Su Family may also be in danger."</p><p></p><p>He continued heavily, "Old Nai, no matter whether he is the Blood Demon or not, the fact that he came from the Inner Domain - the fact that we let him in must never be revealed to the outside."</p><p></p><p>He emphasized, "Not only the Transcendent Lingzong, even the Yuling Sect and the Su Family would not spare us if they found out."</p><p></p><p>Nai the guardian nodded.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, their only choice was to pretend to know nothing and not disclose any information. Otherwise, not only would those Cultivated Spirit Celestials vent their anger on them, even that certain individual might not spare them.</p><p></p><p>After discussing and reaching an agreement, the two guardians quietly resumed their cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Guarding the Lingyu Domain Gate was an easy task, and the conflicts within the Yuzhou Martial Dao Realm did not affect them here. Whoever wanted to enter the Inner Domain could simply open the gate.</p><p></p><p>"The deadline set by those Transcendent Lingzong is almost here, isn't it? I wonder if there will still be any Jade Token holders entering the Lingyu Domain."</p><p></p><p>Nai the guardian asked.</p><p></p><p>"After this time, the Lingyu Domain Gate will likely be completely closed. It may take countless years before the Inner Domain can enter the Lingyu Domain again."</p><p></p><p>Ke the guardian nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Why completely close the Lingyu Domain Gate? Is it because of fear of the Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. Perhaps they think the Inner Domain is a lowly place with limited talents, so there's no need to pay attention to it anymore. Completely separating the two, not interfering with each other. Or it could be to prevent the Lingyu Domain from interfering with the Inner Domain."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, for the lowly Inner Domain, this may be a blessing in disguise."</p><p></p><p>The two fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure walked in.</p><p></p><p>Ke and Nai's expressions changed, and they hurriedly stood up, respectfully greeting, "Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was at least a Great Celestial Realm cultivator, and a powerful one from a certain Lingzong. The two guardians dared not look directly at him, keeping their heads slightly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I need to go to the Inner Domain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>The two guardians hastily opened the Lingyu Domain Gate, not daring to delay even a moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the two pillars in the grand hall, which emitted a faint glow and rotated slightly, causing the Lingyu Domain Gate to open.</p><p></p><p>"So this is how the Lingyu Domain Gate is opened."</p><p></p><p>After memorizing the method of opening the gate, Xu Yan remained silent and stepped through the grand hall, returning to the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>The two guardians were shaken in their hearts. What business did this Lingzong Senior have in going to the Inner Domain?</p><p></p><p>"We shall mind our own business and not spread any information. If anyone asks, other than that certain individual, we know nothing about who entered the Inner Domain!"</p><p></p><p>Ke the guardian spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Nai the guardian nodded gravely.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Li Xuan had systematically refined and perfected the theoretical framework of the Meaning Realm in the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Among his three disciples, only Su Lingxiu had not yet grasped the Meaning Realm. Although her Pill Dao Martial Dao was not focused on this aspect, Li Xuan still hoped that she could also comprehend the Meaning Realm unique to Pill Dao cultivators.</p><p></p><p>So he took the time to impart the relevant theories of the Meaning Realm to Su Lingxiu, guiding her to try to perceive the Meaning of the Pill Dao Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Su Lingxiu, Li Xuan continued to ponder how to further perfect the martial dao he had created. The Mysterious Gate Martial Dao had already been formulated, and all that remained was for his disciples to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>Should he also start contemplating the development of the fifth martial dao system? He should also prepare the theoretical framework and boundaries for martial dao realms beyond the Spiritual Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the martial dao is truly arduous."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Even with the assistance of the Dao Scriptures of the Great Dao, thoroughly refining and perfecting the martial dao was still not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu continued her cultivation, preparing for her breakthrough to the Profound Perfection realm, while also comprehending the Meaning Realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Unique Realm of the Alchemist Martial Artist?</p><p></p><p>"Refining elixirs requires fire, which purifies impurities and extracts the essence..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was contemplating this, and the first thing that came to her mind was the elixir fire. Her true essence was flowing and vibrant, yet it could also be transformed into elixir fire to refine medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>This was a special talent of the alchemist martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The elixir fire appeared in her hands, and Su Lingxiu stared at it, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, it was calm and peaceful.</p><p></p><p>However, the Great Wilderness Martial Dao was flourishing. The Great Wilderness martial artists were increasing in number every day, and the grand masters were cultivating the Innate Techniques. Under Li Xuan's guidance in the past two days, Peng Yuan had perfected his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even without relying on medicinal pills, they could still cultivate, but the speed would be more difficult. The Heaven and Earth Bridge formed after the cultivation would also be relatively fragile, requiring more time to consolidate.</p><p></p><p>But it was still a tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation technique had already spread throughout the Great Wilderness Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Now, the grand masters were all cultivating the Martial Dao, while the great grand masters found it more difficult, as they could only rely on medicinal pills for their cultivation, and after the cultivation, they would only reach the Innate Realm, not the Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Profound Techniques had not yet been widely disseminated.</p><p></p><p>Of course, not all grand masters and great grand masters chose to cultivate. There were still many who were observing or had given up due to their own talent limitations and other reasons.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already reached the Profound Realm Perfection, and he was now accumulating a foundation to break through the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body. However, the spiritual herbs in the Inner Realm were of a relatively low grade, so even if he refined them into medicinal pills, the speed of accumulating the foundation would not be very fast.</p><p></p><p>At this rate, it might take one or two years for him to accumulate enough foundation to support the transformation and ascension of his body.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was not in a hurry, as he was already an unrivaled existence in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was learning to read every day, wanting to become a cultured tiger, and it was also studying the array diagram every day, although it did not understand it, it felt the profundity of the array.</p><p></p><p>It spent every day with Lady Xu, and Lady Xu was naturally also familiar with the array diagram and was very curious about it, so she would occasionally study it when she had nothing to do.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Innate Realm, the lifespan increased greatly, and Lady Xu, who had no martial ambitions, reduced her cultivation time even further, only cultivating for an hour a day.</p><p></p><p>She even skipped a day or two occasionally.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe still had not broken through the bottleneck and could not reach the Profound Realm, still accumulating in the Innate Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying and Shi Er were the same.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Shushu cultivated the Martial Dao, she had also reached the Innate Realm Perfection, but she still had not grasped the opportunity to break through.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this, as this was the normal state of martial cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Talents like Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu were rare. Most martial artists, even after reaching the peak of a realm, might not be able to break through to the next realm.</p><p></p><p>They might even be stuck at that realm forever, unable to break through.</p><p></p><p>This was the case in the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, and the same was true in the Taiyang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Many First-Grade martial artists were stuck at this level, unable to break through to become grand masters.</p><p></p><p>And there were also many grand master martial artists who were stuck, unable to break through to become great grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Among the cultivators of the Great Wilderness Martial Dao, there would also be many martial artists who were stuck at the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the Qi and Blood Realm of the Great Wilderness Martial Dao was stronger, and the martial artists lived longer, so the appeal of the Great Wilderness Martial Dao was naturally greater than the Taiyang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"For martial cultivation, talent, comprehension, and opportunities are the necessary conditions to reach the peak," Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had both talent and comprehension, and they were very strong.</p><p></p><p>As for opportunities, being able to become his disciple and cultivate successfully, rising unstoppably in the martial dao, he naturally did not lack opportunities.</p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan possessed all the necessary conditions to reach the pinnacle of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Who can obtain the opportunities of the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao?" Li Xuan wondered.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu reduced her elixir refinement cultivation and focused more on comprehending the realm. She wanted to explore the unique realm of the alchemist martial artist.</p><p></p><p>After researching the elixir fire without any harvest, she turned her attention back to elixir refinement and the medical dao.</p><p></p><p>"The core of the alchemist martial artist is elixirs and medicine, and whether it is elixirs or medicine, one needs to thoroughly understand the properties and effects of spiritual herbs in order to formulate suitable medicinal pills..."</p><p></p><p>"But there are countless spiritual herbs and spiritual objects in the world. How to discern their properties and effects when encountering unfamiliar ones?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu suddenly had an epiphany.</p><p></p><p>She picked up a spiritual herb and began to carefully sense it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already studied the third page of the Taiyang Book, occasionally taking the time to guide the cultivation of Xu Junhe and the others. He had already given up hope of finding a fourth disciple in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has awakened the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense, and your Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense has reached perfection."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Golden Dao Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. Su Lingxiu had finally comprehended the unique talent of the alchemist martial artist.</p><p></p><p>Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense!</p><p></p><p>This was a wonderful realm, a kind of innate talent.</p><p></p><p>The Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense was not for combat, but to discern the properties and effects of spiritual objects. What effects did this spiritual herb have? What were its medicinal properties? How should it be combined?</p><p></p><p>As long as one had awakened the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense, any unfamiliar spiritual object could be easily understood in terms of its properties and effects, and then utilized to the best of its potential.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has grasped the initial form of the third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic. You have obtained the third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic!"</p><p></p><p>After Su Lingxiu awakened the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense, her talent was triggered, and she had comprehended the initial form of the third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic. Li Xuan immediately obtained the complete third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic.</p><p></p><p>The third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic was more abundant, more complete, and more powerful in terms of elixir refinement techniques, medical dao, alchemist martial arts, and elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>"The Alchemist Martial Dao is becoming stronger and stronger, and the application of medicinal pills is also becoming more powerful," Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's talent in the Alchemist Martial Dao was truly extraordinary. She had awakened the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense so quickly, and with that, she had also comprehended the initial form of the third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already mastered the third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic, and he should pass the complete version to Su Lingxiu. As for how many layers the Alchemist Martial Classic would ultimately have, Li Xuan did not know.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps Su Lingxiu could continue to comprehend it?</p><p></p><p>When Su Lingxiu's cultivation was complete, Li Xuan would summon her.</p><p></p><p>"Your comprehension of the Alchemist Martial Classic has taken another step forward. Today, I shall pass on to you an even higher level of the Alchemist Dao. With your awakening of the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense, you can now carry forward the Alchemist Martial Dao to new heights."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu respectfully replied, "Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>She marveled inwardly, "Master's realm is truly high, that I can only look up to it in awe."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan passed the third layer of the Alchemist Martial Classic to Su Lingxiu, allowing her to continue her comprehension and explore the profound mysteries hidden within the Alchemist Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>After awakening the Wondrous Heart Spirit Sense, Su Lingxiu immediately selected spiritual herbs and combined them to create medicinal pills with stronger effects, and she refined them.</p><p></p><p>She was now close to reaching the Profound Realm Perfection.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

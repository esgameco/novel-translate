            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 80 Innate Spiritual Bone, Vajra Fist of Wind and Thunder</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong broke through, stepped into the door of the martial dao, and the familiar golden light emerged, brilliant and beautiful.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has successfully cultivated the technique you compiled, stepped into the martial dao, and your Great Sun Golden Bell Covering has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>With the feedback from the golden finger, the complete technique of the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering appeared in Li Xuan's mind, and his physical body also became stronger at that moment.</p><p></p><p>Although he was at the Innate Realm, the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering could still be used by him.</p><p></p><p>Driving the true qi to activate the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, the defense was unparalleled and extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the martial dao of the physical body had already been solidified.</p><p></p><p>The jade bone emitted a luster of glass, containing a Vajra-like aura.</p><p></p><p>This was the fusion and integration of the Vajra Glass Bone and the Jade Bone, as if a certain transformation was taking place.</p><p></p><p>"Your Jade Bone + Vajra Glass Bone has obtained the Innate Spiritual Bone!"</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared, and the feedback from the golden finger came.</p><p></p><p>Innate Spiritual Bone!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Li Xuan felt that his entire being had been elevated, the flawless jade bone emitting a glass-like luster, and the spiritual charm lingering, as if it was a naturally endowed spiritual bone.</p><p></p><p>And with the appearance of the Innate Spiritual Bone, Li Xuan's entire innate true qi was also purified and became stronger.</p><p></p><p>Due to the loss of the spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth, the violent spiritual energy of heaven and earth, after entering his body, became more gentle.</p><p></p><p>"Jade Bone + Vajra Glass Bone, actually obtaining the Innate Spiritual Bone, this is beyond my expectations!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He had been pondering whether the superimposition of the Jade Bone and the Vajra Glass Bone would undergo a transformation and become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, he received the feedback and obtained the Innate Spiritual Bone, which immediately elevated this level.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Jade Bone or the Vajra Glass Bone, they were ultimately refined from the mortal realm, and compared to the Innate Spiritual Bone, they were still lacking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Innate Spiritual Bone of his was superimposed with the characteristics of the Jade Bone and the Vajra Glass Bone.</p><p></p><p>"I must take on a new disciple, I must take on a new disciple! I have the Jade Bone, I have the Vajra Glass Bone, what kind of bone should I compile next?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes shone with light, and he once again had the idea of taking on a new disciple.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, Li Xuan finally calmed down his excited heart.</p><p></p><p>Taking on a new disciple was not something that could be done casually, and he had to compile a new technique and create a new type of bone.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Shi Er was swinging his precious sword, slashing at Meng Chong's body one strike after another, making a "thud, thud" sound, but unable to harm Meng Chong in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was wielding a precious sword, it was no exception.</p><p></p><p>He had been deeply shocked, with Meng Chong's current powerful strength, even if he were surrounded by thousands of soldiers, he would not be harmed at all.</p><p></p><p>Slashing until his hands went soft, Shi Er stopped.</p><p></p><p>"Too strong!"</p><p></p><p>His face was full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was excited at the moment, clenching his fists and feeling his own strength, and this was only the beginning of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, let's go and spar!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't wait to spar with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two of them directly left the city and went to a mountain forest outside the county.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er excitedly followed to watch the battle.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a step forward and also arrived in the sky above the mountain forest, watching his two disciples spar.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, you have just entered the martial dao, and I, your senior brother, will only use the strength of the Entrance Realm to spar with you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, suppressing his own blood qi, only revealing the blood qi of the Entrance Realm.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to see how powerful the martial dao of the physical body was.</p><p></p><p>And whether his pure martial dao, at the same level, could suppress him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had refined the Vajra Glass Bone, while Xu Yan had the Jade Bone, theoretically their martial dao foundations were the same.</p><p></p><p>The strength and weakness would depend on the individual.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cultivated the Sword Dao and the Descending Dragon Palm, while Meng Chong had not yet cultivated any martial art techniques, but before cultivating the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, he was already comparable to the top masters in the jianghu.</p><p></p><p>He was not truly a novice, and he also knew some hand-to-hand martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, come on!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body emitted a glass-like golden light, his entire person becoming more robust, his muscles bulging, like a Vajra Arhat, exuding a fierce and powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was solemn, and as his blood qi surged, it was as fierce as fire. His blood qi was extremely pure, unlike Meng Chong's, which was like a bell, transformed into a glass-like golden light.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A palm strike was sent out, directly hitting Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound rang out, and Meng Chong's body swayed a bit, but he was unharmed!</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, come again!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, like a glass-like golden man, patted his chest and said.</p><p></p><p>He cultivated the Great Sun Golden Bell Covering, and to defeat him, one must break through his defense, be able to harm him, otherwise they would not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>This was the prerequisite for defeating him!</p><p></p><p>No matter how agile the opponent's attacks were, no matter how they dragged and consumed him, as long as they could not break through his golden bell covering, they could not defeat him.</p><p></p><p>In a war of consumption, how could a martial dao practitioner like him be afraid?</p><p></p><p>In this sparring session, to determine the winner, there was no need for an intense battle. In terms of martial art techniques, in terms of speed, Meng Chong was currently inferior to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>But if Xu Yan could not break through his defense, he could not defeat Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Even if he wanted to rely on consumption to wear down Meng Chong, it might not be possible, as their martial dao foundations were actually similar.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's blood was boiling, and he became excited.</p><p></p><p>He was also a self-confident person.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he would not rely on his own advantages to bully his junior brother.</p><p></p><p>So he suppressed his own realm, only revealing the strength of the Entrance Realm, and he would not use the Descending Dragon Palm or the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Just pure blood qi attacks.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck again, his blood qi erupting, but this time he did not use the blood qi to attack Meng Chong, but instead gathered the blood qi in his palm, moved his body, and came forward with a palm strike, hitting Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Bang!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong directly staggered back, the glass-like golden light on his body flickering, as if it was about to collapse at any moment!</p><p></p><p>But it eventually stabilized.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his eyebrows, this didn't break the defense?</p><p></p><p>This Great Sun Golden Bell Covering was truly powerful beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>He could feel Meng Chong's powerful physical body, that palm strike on his chest, if it was any other martial artist, they would probably have been shaken by the recoil force.</p><p></p><p>His Jade Bone was flawless, and his martial dao foundation was solid, his blood qi was strong, so he would not be affected by the recoil.</p><p></p><p>"Come again!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath, planted his feet, and the glass-like golden light on his body became even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Faintly visible, a golden bell covered his physical body.</p><p></p><p>"Then come again!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath, raised his palm, and the blood qi condensed without dispersing, without any blood qi emanating from his body.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, he raised his hand and slapped it onto Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had been silently watching, and as soon as Xu Yan struck this palm, he knew the result.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Great Sun Golden Bell Covering was about to be broken, although the golden bell covering was broken, Xu Yan's palm strike had also been completely neutralized.</p><p></p><p>Unable to cause any harm to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Chong's powerful physique, he naturally could withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Martial dao of the physical body was not that once the golden bell covering was broken, he would suffer heavy injuries. This was just a layer of defense for the physical body.</p><p></p><p>The truly powerful thing was still in the physical body.</p><p></p><p>As expected!</p><p></p><p>Under the palm strike, the glass-like golden light on Meng Chong's body cracked...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The cracking sound was broken, and Xu Yan's palm was imprinted on Meng Chong's chest.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong staggered a bit, but his blood and qi surged, and the jade-like golden light was restored.</p><p></p><p>"Come, junior brother, let's spar!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Although this palm strike broke through the golden bell defense, the palm force had already been mostly neutralized and could not cause any damage to Meng Chong's formidable physical body. </p><p></p><p>This attack and defense could only be considered evenly matched!</p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded and stepped forward, unleashing a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>He used the punching and kicking martial arts he had learned, although he could not fully unleash the power of his blood and qi, the techniques were still effective.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not use the Descending Dragon Palm either, but used a palm technique he had learned before.</p><p></p><p>The two began to spar and fight.</p><p></p><p>Boom, boom, the trees collapsed one by one, the jade-like golden light and the intense blood and qi collided with each other. In less than a quarter of an hour, half the mountain forest had turned into scattered debris.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was already stunned.</p><p></p><p>Covered in tree debris, he no longer cared, watching the increasingly fierce battle, feeling that if he got a little closer, even just brushed by the aftershock, his tendons would be severed and bones broken, and he would die on the spot!</p><p></p><p>"Now I feel like an ant!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er thought helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently watched, and he had already seen the strengths and weaknesses of this sparring match.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is still a little stronger. His martial arts are pure, he is truly pure, and the foundation of this martial art also started from him!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was certainly powerful, his physical martial arts defense was unparalleled, and his Vajra Jade-like Bone was not inferior to Jade Bone. However, he was still a step behind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the purity of martial arts and the foundation of martial arts, Xu Yan was still stronger.</p><p></p><p>After all, the source of this martial art was derived from the cultivation method Xu Yan had fabricated, in terms of being a prodigy, Xu Yan was stronger, and Li Xuan was not surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this world, it was impossible to find a disciple stronger than Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His position as the senior brother was firmly established, and his strength was undoubtedly the strongest.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong panted, with a few palm prints left on his body, and his whole body was in pain.</p><p></p><p>"I can't do it anymore, I can't hold on!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a look of helplessness on his face.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped, sighing, "Junior brother, your physical martial arts are truly formidable!"</p><p></p><p>He was only a little weaker than Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At the same level, except for him, no one else could break through his junior brother's defense.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, well, at this level, I'm second only to my senior brother!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Although he lost a step, he was not disappointed.</p><p></p><p>His talent was in his physical body, if he cultivated his senior brother's orthodox martial arts, he would not have this strength.</p><p></p><p>After the sparring was over, the two brothers returned to the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to refine himself, preparing to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, he came to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have entered the door, see?" </p><p></p><p>He said, stroking his bald head and chuckling sheepishly.</p><p></p><p>His senior brother cultivated the Descending Dragon Palm, so he should also cultivate a powerful martial arts technique.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I don't want to learn the palm, I want to learn the fist!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong then spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Good, I will teach you tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, as he had already prepared for this.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>The mountain forest where Meng Chong and Xu Yan had sparred had already turned into a bare land, with no grass or trees.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood sideways, one hand behind his back, a mysterious aura enveloping him, his image of a profound and lofty senior elevated infinitely.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood respectfully beside him.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, I will only teach the Dao, not the technique. The fist I will teach you is not a fist technique, but the Dao of the Fist."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao lies in enlightenment, in understanding its meaning. You must understand that only by comprehending the Dao within can you continue to grow stronger, and all techniques are within the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I will teach you the Dao of the Fist, and if you comprehend it, as your cultivation and realm improve, it will also improve, and you will continue to understand its true meaning.</p><p></p><p>"The martial Dao is boundless, so I have always emphasized that you must go and understand, go and comprehend its true meaning, rather than focus on the form and the techniques."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully replied, "Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, turning to look at his second disciple, and said, "The technique I will teach you is the Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist. Look closely, focus on its meaning, and you can ignore the techniques."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he sighed, "Master's martial Dao is truly the true martial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, clenched his fist, and circulated his true qi. Then he unleashed a powerful punch.</p><p></p><p>He used his strong true qi to unleash this punch, and the power was naturally terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, under his conscious control, the true qi was like thunderous roar, as if a bolt of lightning had flashed across.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was shocked, as if he had seen a furious thunderbolt shoot out, and the trees in the distance instantly turned to dust.</p><p></p><p>So fast!</p><p></p><p>So fierce!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction. He was no longer as weak as before. Since he had the strength, he naturally had to display it, to give his disciple a shocking impression, and to better help his disciple comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After all, with his absolute strength, even without any martial techniques, the power would still be terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Then he swung his fists, but this time there was no fierce and thunderous power.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it was like a violent wind, the fists swift and penetrating, as if there was no place they could not reach.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes were dazzled, and he felt a little dizzy.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!</p><p></p><p>"Master just demonstrated it, and the power is already so formidable, it's truly unbelievable!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan finished his punches and looked at the stunned Meng Chong, extremely satisfied in his heart. With a stern teacher's expression, he spoke, "Disciple, this is the Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist. I displayed it at the peak of the Blood Qi Realm."</p><p></p><p>Without blushing or panting, he lied without blinking an eye, casually boasting that he was so powerful, that the Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist he displayed at the Blood Qi Realm was already comparable to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Let the disciple know that the teacher is an insurmountable mountain, that he can never climb over!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes widened, Master displayed the Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist at the peak of the Blood Qi Realm?</p><p></p><p>This was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Even with his own Blood Qi Realm cultivation, he was still far from being able to display such power!</p><p></p><p>"Master is truly the Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly, "The Wind and Thunder Golden Vajra Fist, its meaning lies in the words 'wind' and 'thunder'. The thunder's swiftness and fierceness, the wind's formlessness and penetration.</p><p></p><p>"What you need to comprehend is this wind and thunder, the fierce and swift, the formless and penetrating power within the fist."</p><p></p><p>He had displayed the thunderous swiftness and fierceness, as well as the formless and penetrating power of the fist in front of his disciple. Now it was up to Meng Chong to comprehend it himself.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 175</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even the other peak grand masters, no matter which force they belong to, have not been heard from.</p><p></p><p>However, it is likely either the Black Robe faction or the Evil Sect.</p><p></p><p>As for whether a third force has intervened, it is unknown.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, it doesn't matter which peak grand masters come, they will all be killed!</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglan Island, on the Cangjiang River, there are numerous small boats drifting. Each boat is far from Canglan Island, but this distance is nothing to the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>On each small boat, there is a grand master who has come to witness the battle.</p><p></p><p>The battle on Canglan Island is a major event in the martial arts world of the inner domain that has not occurred in thousands of years - on one side is the suddenly risen peerless genius, and on the other is the notorious Evil Sect's Evil Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Martial artists at the grand master level no longer have the qualifications to come and watch.</p><p></p><p>On one small boat, the Matchless Grand Master and Yun Miaomiao are present, along with two other grand masters from the Matchless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The royal family of the Great Yue Kingdom has also sent someone," the Matchless Grand Master said, looking towards a purple-patterned small boat in the distance.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao frowned and said, "Will the Great Yue Kingdom intervene?"</p><p></p><p>Canglan Island is within the territory of the Great Yue Kingdom, as it was previously Yin Hong's domain and later came under Xu Yan's control. However, in the inner domain, the strong are respected, and even the Great Yue Kingdom would not rashly claim this as their territory against a grand master.</p><p></p><p>"It's hard to say whether the Great Yue Kingdom will act against the Evil Venerable or Xu Yan," the Matchless Grand Master shook his head.</p><p></p><p>On the small boat from the Great Yue Kingdom, a young man in purple robes looked towards Canglan Island and said, "This island may be on the surface Yin Hong's, but in reality it belongs to me. We shall see if Xu Yan is qualified to possess it."</p><p></p><p>The Second Prince of the Great Yue Kingdom! Beside him was a middle-aged man with a tall stature and sharp gaze, a peak grand master.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, shall I take action?" the middle-aged man asked.</p><p></p><p>"No need, just observe," the Second Prince shook his head.</p><p></p><p>As a prince of the Great Yue Kingdom, his status is noble, but the peak grand master is the true powerhouse. The middle-aged man's duty is only to protect him, and beyond that, he does not have to follow any of the prince's orders. Generally, peak grand masters are not completely obedient, but the prince can only request their assistance, not command them.</p><p></p><p>This is the treatment accorded to peak grand masters - even the mighty Great Yue Kingdom and its noble prince must show them great respect.</p><p></p><p>On another small boat, Fu Yuntian silently gazed towards Canglan Island, with an unkempt old man beside him who was engrossed in reading a book. This old man was also a peak grand master.</p><p></p><p>Among the many small boats, there was one boat made of precious treasure materials, belonging to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. All the major forces in the inner domain have sent powerful experts to witness this battle.</p><p></p><p>Even the Yan Kingdom and the Purple Cloud Kingdom have grand masters present.</p><p></p><p>There was an old, shabby wooden boat quietly drifting by the Cangjiang River, with a person sitting cross-legged on the bow, a black-sheathed sword resting on his lap. This small boat did not attract the attention of the many powerful experts on the river.</p><p></p><p>After all, there were too many grand masters present, and those who kept a low profile were not few in number. Only the experts from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion noticed the person on the old wooden boat.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Hai from the Sword Saint Cliff has actually come. Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng are very close, could it be that Hu Hai wants to intervene?"</p><p></p><p>"Hu Hai alone can only stop one person at most. Unless Xie Tianheng shows up, the Evil Venerable won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>"Xie Tianheng has been in seclusion for a long time, it seems. If he comes, the Evil Venerable will surely flee."</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion experts were discussing, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had already arrived at the small wooden boat.</p><p></p><p>"Father, are you alone?" Hu Shan asked, looking around.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Hu," Xie Lingfeng called out.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Hu Hai opened his eyes and nodded, looking towards Canglan Island. "There are at least three peak grand masters. If I intervene, I can stop one and delay two for a while."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng let out a sigh and said, "Since Brother Xu dares to come, he must have the confidence. There's no need for Uncle Hu to intervene."</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai smiled and said, "I'm also curious about what kind of peerless genius can make even the young master feel inferior."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gave a wry smile. "Uncle Hu, Brother Xu's prodigy is beyond my reach. My only wish in life is to master the sword path."</p><p></p><p>Hu Hai frowned and said, "Young master, what are you saying? Even if your strength is not as good, you are far from just a beginner in the sword path."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng shook his head with a smile, not saying anything more. Not only himself, but the entire Sword Saint Cliff, including his own father, could not be considered to have truly mastered the sword path.</p><p></p><p>There was no need to say these things. Hu Hai, being a peak grand master of the Sword Saint Cliff and Xie Tianheng's disciple, was naturally proud of his own sword skills. Ordinary people telling him otherwise would be useless - he had to realize the truth himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"It's really lively," Xu Yan said, looking around at the surroundings of Canglan Island. His gaze fell on the old wooden boat, where Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were present. This time, the Sword Saint Cliff has sent experts to intervene if necessary.</p><p></p><p>However, for Xu Yan, there was no need for that at all.</p><p></p><p>His gaze turned to Canglan Island, where the aura of the Evil Venerable was not at all concealed.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, how many peak grand masters do you think will be here?" Meng Chong asked in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>"No less than three," Xu Yan smiled and his expression gradually became solemn. "Today, let the martial artists of the inner domain know what true martial dao is!"</p><p></p><p>This battle is not only to intimidate the major forces and display his powerful strength to protect the Evergreen Pavilion, but also to temper his own martial dao and prepare for the breakthrough to the Penetrating Mystery realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he enters the Penetrating Mystery, he will be at the peak of the inner domain!</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I feel there might be ambushes underwater. Let me take care of that," Meng Chong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He also wants to refine his physical martial arts in this battle, to prepare for the breakthrough to the Perfected Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He stepped lightly on the water's surface, walking with a graceful and carefree manner, reminiscing about his master's unhurried and natural steps.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt like he had found the bearing and detachment that a true powerful expert should have.</p><p></p><p>"I'm still so far from my master's realm, unable to achieve that kind of carefree and natural gait," Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's figure disappeared into the Cangjiang River, waiting for the ambushers to reveal themselves so he could strike.</p><p></p><p>"They're here!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The many powerful onlookers were stirred at this moment.</p><p></p><p>That handsome and graceful young man strode forward, leisurely and carefree, as if the place before him was not a den of dragons and tigers, but a secluded fairyland.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu..." </p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao narrowed her eyes, muttering to herself.</p><p></p><p>The peerless grand master facepalmed, thinking his disciple was beyond saving!</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglan Island, on the Cangjiang River.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped in his tracks. "Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign, come out and die. Don't destroy my Canglan Island."</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant brat!" </p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign sneered coldly, his figure soaring into the air and leaving the island.</p><p></p><p>As the Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign appeared, his crimson red hair fluttered, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surged, instantly transforming into a scarlet red around his body.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a bloody tide was surging around him, with hissing sounds constantly ringing out. The terrifying bloody tide seemed to be polluting the spiritual energy, becoming thicker and more viscous.</p><p></p><p>A faint bloody stench began to drift out.</p><p></p><p>The surging bloody tide gradually transformed into blood-colored flames, as if it wanted to refine all living beings.</p><p></p><p>"Infernal Blood Refining Technique!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, the powerful onlookers all had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>One of the supreme demonic arts, and the technique that made the Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign famous - the Infernal Blood Refining Technique, was a true killing art that cultivated using the essence blood of living beings. </p><p></p><p>Especially the blood of martial artists was the best.</p><p></p><p>For the Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign to have cultivated it to the peak grand master level, it was clear how many martial artists he had killed and refined their essence blood to gain such terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"Little boy, your blood will be taken by me today."</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign held a hooked sickle in his hand, the blood-red curved blade seeming to be soaked in blood, as if it had disemboweled countless martial artists before.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained calm as he spoke, "Where's the map to your treasure trove? Hand it over. After I kill you, I'll have to go find it, which would be such a hassle. Isn't that right?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you insolent brat! This lord will tear out your heart and eat it!"</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign's eyes burned with fury.</p><p></p><p>With a rumbling sound, a blood cloud appeared in midair, instantly transforming into raging infernal blood flames, exuding a sinister, bloody aura.</p><p></p><p>The hooked sickle slashed out, and the terrifying infernal blood flames ran rampant, directly covering Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign struck with ruthless and fierce attacks, showing no signs of underestimation, unleashing his full power.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure flickered, shifting positions, and in an instant, he had evaded the attack, appearing at another location.</p><p></p><p>"Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign, how do I know you haven't lied and really don't have the map to your treasure trove?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke calmly, unperturbed by the Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign's powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign's expression grew serious. That previous strike, the opponent's strange movements had actually allowed him to evade it.</p><p></p><p>"This lord never goes back on his word. The map is on the island."</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"What if someone takes it while we're fighting?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked towards Canglan Island and said with a smile, "Why hide it? Bring the map over."</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign's gaze sharpened. Xu Yan actually knew there were others on the island besides him, and yet still dared to come and fight. Was he relying on that strange movement to escape unharmed?</p><p></p><p>Two figures appeared on the island, dressed in black robes with only their eyes visible.</p><p></p><p>One of them raised a hand and tossed a scroll over.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's true qi surged, and the scroll opened in front of him, revealing a map.</p><p></p><p>He immediately collected it, completely ignoring the black-robed figures spreading out to surround him.</p><p></p><p>Two of the black-robed figures had red leaf emblems on their chests - guardian-level experts.</p><p></p><p>The other one had a crescent moon emblem on their chest - an even stronger expert.</p><p></p><p>Three peak grand masters! The many onlookers all had changed expressions. Besides the Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign, there were two other hidden peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful Xu Yan was, even if he could defeat the Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign, how could he possibly contend with three peak grand masters?</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign was already a powerful figure among the peak grand masters, and one of the other two was not weaker than him, perhaps even slightly stronger.</p><p></p><p>The other one, while slightly weaker, was still a peak grand master.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you're in danger!"</p><p></p><p>The onlooking experts all had this thought.</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao's expression immediately became tense, and she tugged at her master's hand, "Master, you have to step in!"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master sneered, "That kid is quite impressive, he can kill a peak grand master with just two or three sword strikes. Three peak grand masters are nothing, he won't even need ten sword strikes. Why are you so anxious?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, this isn't the time to be stubborn."</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao said urgently.</p><p></p><p>"That kid dares to come, do you think he has no plan? Daughter, don't worry about it."</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Three peak grand masters, what do you think?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian looked at the elder and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Use your eyes to see."</p><p></p><p>The elder said impatiently, "That kid isn't stupid, if he can't win, he'll escape. What are you worried about? There's someone over there, if the situation turns bad, they'll definitely intervene."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian followed the elder's gaze, and saw an old, dilapidated wooden boat, with a person sitting cross-legged on it, a black-sheathed long sword resting across their lap.</p><p></p><p>"He actually came."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian was both surprised and not too surprised, after all, Xu Yan had entered the Seven Star Academy's Treasure Vault using Xie Lingfeng's name, indicating a close relationship between the two.</p><p></p><p>The elder looked towards Canglan Island and coldly said, "As long as it's not that old bastard from the Hidden Palace, this is just a small matter. If that old bastard comes, then it'll be a big deal."</p><p></p><p>"Who is that person?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The elder closed his mouth, seemingly quite wary of the one from the Hidden Palace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around with a bright smile. "So it's you lot again, hiding and lurking. Is that all you've got?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue spoke in a deep voice, "Xu Yan, just tell us where that girl is, and we'll spare your life today!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not surprised by this, he was only more curious. Why did these black-robed people so desperately want to capture his shijie?</p><p></p><p>And it seemed they were willing to pay any price to get her.</p><p></p><p>"Spare my life? With just the three of you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold, a faint killing intent emanating from him.</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword, staring at Yin Jue and coldly laughing, "You rats in the sewers, not even daring to reveal your names, yet you dare to speak such arrogant words? Today, I, the Sword Saint Xu Yan, shall slay all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>The Fiery Exterminator Demon Sovereign coldly snorted, his hooked sickle slashing out, and a torrent of infernal blood flames surged forth, turning the entire sky a scarlet red, with hissing sounds echoing.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it was corroding the entire space.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue raised his hand and unleashed a sword strike, the sword light merging with heaven and earth, forming layer upon layer of sword barriers, rushing towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The other black-robed figure also joined the attack.</p><p></p><p>The three peak grand masters attacked in unison, causing the heavens and earth to change color, and the vast Cangjiang River to be pressed down, its surface sinking.</p><p></p><p>From afar, the battlefield seemed to have erupted with world-ending might.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

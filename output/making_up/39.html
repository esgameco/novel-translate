        <h1>Chapter 39</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 39: Transmitting the Technique of the Innate Realm</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped his practice, his face beaming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Ethereal Body Technique combined with the Descending Dragon Palm, my combat power has greatly increased. With my current strength, even in the midst of a hundred thousand-strong army, I can come and go as I please, and slaying generals in the midst of a myriad army would be as easy as turning my hand over!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself, and at this moment, a sense of arrogance arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He hummed to himself: "So you broke off the engagement, huh? Thought my brain wasn't working well and that I was a disgrace, huh? I told you, one day the Jiang family wouldn't be able to match up to me, and now the Jiang family can't match up to me.</p><p></p><p>"And what of the Great General of the Eastern River? Even if he's the old emperor of the Qi Kingdom, I can simply disregard him now."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a young man with a fiery temperament. Having been jilted and mocked, how could he not have a trace of resentment in his heart?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, having entered the path of the martial dao and greatly increased in strength, in his eyes, the military power of the Qi Kingdom was nothing more than chickens and dogs.</p><p></p><p>The arrogance of the young man naturally surfaced.</p><p></p><p>His current mentality was that he felt those who had mocked him were pitiful, like frogs at the bottom of a well, unaware of the vastness of the heavens and earth. Their mocking words no longer entered his ears.</p><p></p><p>They were no longer people of the same world.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, that you were able to comprehend the body technique in such a short time, and even thought to combine it with the Descending Dragon Palm, not bad!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a voice sounded from behind him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled and hurriedly turned around, only to see his master standing there calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when did you arrive?"</p><p></p><p>"I came when you were practicing the body technique and the Descending Dragon Palm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shocked in his heart: "I didn't notice him at all. Master always appears like an ordinary person, but just this slight display, I feel how insignificant I am!"</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to be like Master, appearing like an ordinary person?</p><p></p><p>"This is what Master meant by returning to the original and following the natural way."</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more unfathomable his master seemed.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, with your current strength, not only can you come and go as you please in a common army of a hundred thousand, but you can also wipe them out with little effort."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then spoke with a serious expression: "But disciple, you must remember that the martial dao is not about slaughter. To kill indiscriminately is to fall into demonic obstacles, and in the end, you will be reduced to ashes."</p><p></p><p>He was worried that his disciple, with his arrogant youth and great strength, had become an existence unrivaled in the Qi Kingdom, and his heart had become inflated.</p><p></p><p>This was not a good thing.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan was not too worried that Xu Yan would go down the wrong path, as this disciple's heart was still quite good, and he knew his limits.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his determination in the martial dao was firm.</p><p></p><p>And with him, the master, guiding him, no matter what, he would not lose himself because of the weakness of the external martial power.</p><p></p><p>After all, the martial power in this world might not be as low as that of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Fiery-Maned Wolves were an example.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will remember this in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, although you cannot indulge in slaughter, you also cannot be weak. When you should kill, then kill. Distinguish between good and evil, do not bully the weak, and maintain a sense of propriety in your heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said in a gentle tone.</p><p></p><p>He could not let his disciple's mentality become inflated and cause indiscriminate killing.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he also couldn't let his disciple be too soft-hearted, hesitating between killing and not killing.</p><p></p><p>Those who deserve to die should be killed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Good, continue to cultivate diligently, and strive to reach the minor accomplishment of the Qi-Blood Realm within half a month. Then I will transmit to you the cultivation method of the Innate Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Master, don't worry, I will strive to break through to the minor accomplishment of the Qi-Blood Realm within half a month!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, in half a month, I will transmit to you the technique of the Innate Realm."</p><p></p><p>After giving his disciple a boost of morale, Li Xuan was extremely satisfied.</p><p></p><p>In half a month, he could transmit the Innate Realm technique, and let Xu Yan begin to comprehend it, and take the next step on the path of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The innate realm's cultivation method was comprehended.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Over the next half month, Xu Yan immersed himself wholeheartedly in arduous cultivation, temporarily suspending the further comprehension and cultivation of the Ethereal Gait and the Descending Dragon Palm.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>Diligence is never in vain.</p><p></p><p>After half a month, Xu Yan's qi and blood surged thirty zhang into the sky, reaching the initial stage of the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Li Xuan sat in a chair, looking at the gloomy sky, as if it was about to snow.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to leave."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with emotion, it was time to leave this remote little village.</p><p></p><p>After transmigrating to this world, he had not taken a single step outside the small village, and was completely unaware of the interpersonal relationships and customs of the outside world.</p><p></p><p>He only knew that he was within the territory of Qi State, in the East River Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has reached the initial stage of the Qi and Blood Realm, and you have directly reached the Perfected Qi and Blood Realm, with a strength a hundred times greater than that of the same realm."</p><p></p><p>The Perfected Qi and Blood Realm! </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt that his qi and blood suddenly surged.</p><p></p><p>With just a thought, his qi and blood soared three hundred zhang into the sky!</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple is quite capable, reaching the initial stage of the Qi and Blood Realm in half a month. It's time to pass on the innate realm's cultivation method to him.</p><p></p><p>"If he can comprehend the innate realm's cultivation method before breaking through the innate realm, can I directly advance to the innate realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The golden finger's feedback was based on the disciple's cultivation results.</p><p></p><p>If he had not yet reached a certain realm, but comprehended the cultivation method of that realm, would he still be able to receive the feedback?</p><p></p><p>Now that he was passing on the innate realm's cultivation method to Xu Yan, it was a good opportunity to verify this.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've broken through!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned excitedly and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, still sitting in the chair, his gaze slightly raised, and said, "I will pass on the innate realm's cultivation method to you. You should ponder it, but you must not be overly ambitious or hasty. Cultivation must be step by step.</p><p></p><p>"You must be down-to-earth, solidify your foundation, otherwise, if the foundation is not solid and you blindly pursue breakthroughs, you will ultimately ruin your martial dao path."</p><p></p><p>To avoid the disciple obtaining the innate realm's cultivation method and neglecting the cultivation of the Qi and Blood Realm, becoming overly ambitious and attempting to break through the innate realm without perfecting the Qi and Blood Realm, thereby encountering problems, Li Xuan sternly and earnestly instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will certainly be down-to-earth and carefully refine the foundation of the Qi and Blood Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmed his mind and respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I believe you have a sense of propriety in your heart."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, stood up, clasped his hands behind his back, and slightly raised his head, gazing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Li Xuan felt particularly comfortable with this posture, exuding the aura of a stern teacher and a lofty figure.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Qi and Blood Realm is the Innate Realm. What is the Innate Realm? To shed the mortal and return to the true, to cleanse the mortal frame, that is the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Entering the Innate Realm, in a certain sense, is to transcend the mundane..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recited the introduction to the Innate Realm that he had prepared in advance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened attentively, his heart filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>To enter the Innate Realm was to, in a certain sense, transcend the mundane and no longer be an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>And this was only the second realm of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to imagine how powerful the realms beyond would be.</p><p></p><p>"To break through the Innate Realm, one needs to have perfected qi and blood, connected the two bridges to the heavens and earth, linked with heaven and earth, and guided the spiritual energy of heaven and earth into the body, opening the cinnabar field and refining the qi and blood into innate true qi...</p><p></p><p>"When the qi and blood throughout the body transforms into innate true qi, then one has entered the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Innate Realm is to exhale and inhale the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, refining it into innate true qi..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the cultivation method of the Innate Realm that he had prepared, including what the two bridges to the heavens and earth were, and where the cinnabar field was located, etc.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

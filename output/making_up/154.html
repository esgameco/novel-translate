        <h1>Chapter 154</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Shasheng Kulou was a powerful expert under the command of the Demon Slaughter Venerable, a mid-level Grand Master. He had killed countless martial artists, using them as nourishment for his cultivation. </p><p></p><p>The Skeleton Cudgel was his renowned weapon, an extraordinary treasure.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the crisis approaching, Shasheng Kulou was a decisive person. He directly unleashed his Killing Life Secret Art, shattering his robe as a blood-colored aura surged into the Skeleton Cudgel.</p><p></p><p>His body instantly shriveled up.</p><p></p><p>Shasheng Kulou was confident that by using this Killing Life Secret Art, he could definitely repel Xu Yan and buy himself time to escape. Even if he couldn't escape, he would rather die together. Even if he couldn't kill Xu Yan on the spot, with his malicious cultivation method, Xu Yan would never be able to recover from the injuries.</p><p></p><p>Even if he miraculously survived, his martial dao would be ruined, leaving him a half-crippled person.</p><p></p><p>But at least he wouldn't have died in vain!</p><p></p><p>In the past, when he was surrounded and attacked by four or five Grand Masters, he had used this Killing Life Secret Art. Although the cost was quite heavy, he managed to break out of the encirclement, and the Grand Masters who had attacked him were all severely injured, their cultivation nearly crippled.</p><p></p><p>With the help of the Demon Venerable, he had slowly recovered by absorbing the essence blood of over a dozen Masters.</p><p></p><p>This time, coming to kill Xu Yan, although Xu Yan's strength exceeded his expectations, Shasheng Kulou was still confident that he could escape with his life.</p><p></p><p>It would only cost him some time and the essence blood of a few martial artists to gradually recover.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan suddenly erupted in rage, and the terrifying murderous intent made Shasheng Kulou's whole body shiver with cold, his consciousness seemingly impacted.</p><p></p><p>The Killing Life Secret Art he was about to unleash was delayed, unable to be executed instantly.</p><p></p><p>In front of him, the mountains and rivers were shrouded, the living beings turning into evil ghosts, wielding swords to attack him! Shasheng Kulou couldn't understand, he had only shattered his robe, why was Xu Yan so furious?</p><p></p><p>It was his own robe, not Xu Yan's! Spirit Tickets? Were those Xu Yan's Spirit Tickets? None of this mattered anymore. As Shasheng Kulou faced death, he suddenly realized his biggest mistake - he shouldn't have shattered his robe.</p><p></p><p>Nor should he have destroyed the money pouch he was carrying along with the robe.</p><p></p><p>As a Grand Master of the Demon Sect who had killed countless people, why would he care about the Spirit Tickets he was carrying? He could just go and slaughter some people to get them back.</p><p></p><p>So he had destroyed it decisively!</p><p></p><p>But this had completely enraged Xu Yan, and without the money, Xu Yan had no more restraints and attacked in fury.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying sword strike descended, and Shasheng Kulou couldn't even manage to unleash his Killing Life Secret Art before being slain by the sword.</p><p></p><p>His body shattered, turning into flying ashes.</p><p></p><p>Only the Skeleton Cudgel, imbued with the blood-colored qi, fell to the ground in a blood-red color.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raged, cursing, "Damn demon sect brat, you've gone too far! The Demon Slaughter Venerable, huh? You wait, if you don't compensate me with a few hundred million spirit crystals, you're doomed!"</p><p></p><p>The nearby Meng Shushu was dumbfounded, the whole person shocked, and a bit panicked. "Xu Shixiong's anger is so terrifying, it's too frightening. I can't continue to be lazy, I must strive hard, search for spirit herbs, and try to buy back the storage bag I owe Xu Shixiong as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>Originally, Shasheng Kulou could have resisted for a while. But because he had shattered his robe and destroyed the money pouch he was carrying, including the Spirit Tickets, he had enraged Xu Yan. That furious strike was simply terrifying.</p><p></p><p>With a single sword, the Shasheng Kulou who was prepared to fight to the death couldn't even manage to unleash his secret art before being completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>After dealing with Shasheng Kulou, Meng Shushu heaved a sigh of relief. Although they had encountered a Grand Master, Xu Yan was as invincible as always, easily resolving the threat.</p><p></p><p>Returning to Xu Yan's side, Meng Shushu and Meng Chong heard Xu Yan cursing angrily, "I'm so angry, I gained nothing from this. This debt must be placed on the Demon Slaughter Venerable's head. If he doesn't compensate me with a few million, no, a few tens of millions of spirit crystals, or make him work as a laborer to earn money, he won't be allowed to live!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, feeling that the Demon Slaughter Venerable might end up in trouble because of this, offending Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, but you haven't gained nothing. Look at that Skeleton Cudgel, it's not an ordinary treasure, its value is not low."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu looked at the Skeleton Cudgel on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and drew the Skeleton Cudgel to himself. The blood-red Skeleton Cudgel looked exceptionally evil, as if it had absorbed the essence of countless lives.</p><p></p><p>When Shasheng Kulou unleashed his secret art, the blood-colored qi had just merged into the Skeleton Cudgel before he was killed. This caused the Skeleton Cudgel to contain the power of that secret art, greatly increasing its value.</p><p></p><p>"You say this Skeleton Cudgel, how much do you think it's worth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt a little better, at least he hadn't gained nothing.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure, but it's definitely valuable."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan examined the Skeleton Cudgel, thoughtfully saying, "This Skeleton Cudgel contains Shasheng Kulou's secret art. If it's activated, it would be equivalent to a Grand Master's full-power strike. </p><p></p><p>"It must be worth at least a few hundred million spirit crystals, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong seemed to have thought of something, saying, "Shixiong, maybe you should give this Skeleton Cudgel to Shimei? Perhaps she can make use of it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt it made sense. His Shimei was a medicinal martial artist, skilled in refining elixirs. The blood-infernal fire power contained in the Skeleton Cudgel might be useful for her.</p><p></p><p>Even if she couldn't utilize it, it could still serve as a protective treasure for her, as it contained the secret art power of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll give it to Shimei!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Shushu spoke up, "Shixiong, in fact, the three major countries and some other major powers have all offered bounties for killing Shasheng Kulou. Whoever kills him can go and claim the reward."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirit immediately lifted as he hurriedly asked, "How much is the bounty?"</p><p></p><p>"Added up, it should be around two or three million spirit crystals. Shasheng Kulou had killed a lot of people, so the various powers all had martial artists killed by him and have been offering the bounty. </p><p></p><p>"No one has been able to claim it so far. Since you've killed him, Shixiong, if you bring the token, you should be able to claim the bounty, right?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"The token for killing Shasheng Kulou?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the Skeleton Cudgel. That would naturally be the best token, but he wanted to give it to his Shimei, so it wouldn't be suitable as a token.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around and saw the shattered robe fragments on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out, he took one of the torn pieces, on which a damaged pattern was embroidered.</p><p></p><p>"Can this be used as a token?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu hesitated, how could this be used as a token? Others wouldn't believe it!</p><p></p><p>"I've got it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Meng Shushu's shoulder, saying, "I'll give you a task. You go spread the news that I, the Sword Immortal Xu Yan, have eliminated this demon for the bounties offered by the various powers, even at the cost of offending the Demon Slaughter Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Do you understand? I killed Shasheng Kulou for their bounties, I can't just go back on my word, right?</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, have gone through so much trouble, offending the Demon Slaughter Venerable, for their bounties. They should..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"There's no way to back out of this, right?" Xu Shixiong said reassuringly, "Don't worry, I'll make sure this matter is handled properly. I'll let the entire inner domain know that you killed the Slaughter Skeleton Demon for those forces, even at the cost of offending the Fiery Exterminator Venerable."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu hurriedly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Tell them that I'll be visiting them one by one in the days to come."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed an excited smile, so his previous actions were not in vain.</p><p></p><p>The three continued on their journey, arriving at the Blue Peace Prefecture. Meng Shushu disguised himself and left, agreeing on a method of communication before parting ways. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong then headed to Iron Mountain County, suppressing their auras and avoiding populated areas to avoid being tracked.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the journey was uneventful, and they returned to Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, you should head back first and tell Father and Shimei that I'll be back within a month. I need to go collect the bounty, retrieve the stored spirit medicines, and purchase the spirit medicines on Shimei's list."</p><p></p><p>As they parted, Xu Yan instructed Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, don't worry. Once Shimei has finished refining the medicinal pills, I'll take them to deliver to Uncle and Aunt."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you. Shidi, you should head back now. I'll stay here and keep watch, in case anyone tries to track us down."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, carrying a large bag of spirit medicines with the Heaven-Dripping Marrow and other sixth-grade spirit medicines in a small bundle on his chest, his waist carrying a sword and the other hand holding a skeletal club, flickered and disappeared into the boundless mountains, returning to the remote border region.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat down under a large tree, silently waiting in case anyone tried to track him down. Three days passed without any pursuit, so Xu Yan glanced towards the border region and then left without looking back, his next destination being to collect the bounty for slaying the Slaughter Skeleton Demon.</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, the martial arts world was in an uproar. The notorious and ruthless Demonic Sect Grand Master, the Slaughter Skeleton Demon, had actually been destroyed! The killer was the Sword Deity Xu Yan, the prodigious and monstrous genius from the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that Xu Yan, seeing the bounties placed by the three major countries and many forces for the Slaughter Skeleton Demon's atrocities, had boldly defied the Fiery Exterminator Venerable to track down and slay the Slaughter Skeleton Demon.</p><p></p><p>According to an unnamed witness who had the fortune to observe the battle, it was an intense fight. Xu Yan, hating the Slaughter Skeleton Demon's cruelty, unleashed his peerless sword techniques in his fury, and with a single sword strike, reduced the Slaughter Skeleton Demon to ashes. </p><p></p><p>All that remained was a tattered robe fragment bearing the incomplete insignia of the Fiery Exterminator Venerable's faction, which Xu Yan had deliberately left behind as a token.</p><p></p><p>Many geniuses and grand masters were shocked. Did the Sword Deity Xu Yan truly not fear the Fiery Exterminator Venerable? Was he perhaps a prodigy from the Sword Saint Cliff, which was why he did not fear the Demonic Sect?</p><p></p><p>The exploits of Xu Yan slaying the Slaughter Skeleton Demon were spreading like wildfire, and the protagonist, Xu Yan, had already set out to collect the bounty, arriving at the gates of the first sect.</p><p></p><p>In a small courtyard of the Seven Star Academy, Du Yuying was in the midst of cultivation. Her aura had become somewhat unusual, her body emanating a faint white glow, giving her an aura of sanctity. Her cultivation had also reached the First Realm of the Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>At this age, with such strength, she could be considered a peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Du Yuying coughed lightly, her complexion paling slightly, her brows furrowing. She slowly concluded her cultivation and opened her eyes.</p><p></p><p>She had a contemplative expression. "My body still has some issues. Breakthrough to the Sect Master Realm is still far away."</p><p></p><p>She sighed inwardly, and involuntarily, the image of that handsome and imposing young man surfaced in her mind, causing her heart to flutter.</p><p></p><p>Stepping out of the cultivation room, Cui'er came running over, her face flushed, her joy evident.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, Miss, the Slaughter Skeleton Demon is dead! He was killed by Young Master Xu. The outside world is all abuzz, saying that Young Master Xu couldn't stand the Slaughter Skeleton Demon's cruelty, so he killed him.</p><p></p><p>"But I think Young Master Xu might have done it for you, after all, he did previously intervene in the Marquis Mansion's affairs."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's eyes brightened momentarily, but then dimmed again as she replied bitterly, "Cui'er, how could it be for me? When Young Master Xu escorted me, it was simply for the spirit medicines and spirit crystals, nothing more."</p><p></p><p>Back then, Xu Yan was still a novice, very poor!</p><p></p><p>"But I still feel that Young Master Xu did it for you. He used Shiling Feng's name to intimidate those people before, and now that his identity is revealed, he must be worried that those people will cause you trouble again. </p><p></p><p>"So he decisively struck down the Slaughter Skeleton Demon to deter those scoundrels."</p><p></p><p>Cui'er spoke with conviction.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying's eyes lit up, feeling that Cui'er's words were not without merit. Thinking about it this way, her heart soared, her jade-like face flushing as she said, "Cui'er, I'm going to open a business, earn spirit crystals and spirit medicines, and try to buy Young Master Xu a storage bag as soon as possible!"</p><p></p><p>She remembered that Xu Yan really liked storage bags.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, you'll definitely succeed!" </p><p></p><p>Cui'er nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Du Yuying's gaze was resolute, a determined light shining in her eyes. For the sake of the figure in her heart, she would become a... wealthy and influential person! The pinnacle of the Peerless Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>A woman in plain clothes sat by a small stream, her delicate white jade-like feet kicking the stream water as she looked at her teacher beside her. "Teacher, now you should know how wise I was in advising you not to interfere, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master's expression was extremely grave. The Slaughter Skeleton Demon's strength was indeed not as great as hers, but to kill him would not have been an easy task. After all, at that level of power, even if defeated, there were still means of escape.</p><p></p><p>What was even more terrifying was Xu Yan's feat of easily crushing a Grand Master with a single palm strike at the Seven Star Academy. That was a Grand Master, and although only a junior, they were still incredibly powerful. Yet Xu Yan had effortlessly destroyed one with a single palm. Even she would be unable to accomplish such a feat.</p><p></p><p>"Good disciple, Teacher has become a bit infatuated with Xu Yan. What should we do about this?" The Peerless Grand Master said with a sly expression.</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes seemed to have her tail stepped on, jumping up as she retorted, "Teacher, how old are you? Have you no shame? You're drooling over him?"</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master chuckled. "Oh, my little girl, are you jealous? You even lent him your jade token, hoping he'll come back to return it so you can see him again, hmm?"</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes snorted and turned her head, sulking.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master sighed. "My child, that young man is beyond your reach. He came to the Peerless Pavilion to refine his spiritual cultivation, and I feel his martial dao is pure, with no interest in romantic entanglements."</p><p></p><p>The woman in plain clothes smiled sweetly. "Teacher, you just don't understand. He likes spirit crystals, he likes spirit medicines, and I have plenty of those here. He doesn't need to have feelings for me, as long as he's infatuated with the spirit crystals and medicines, that's enough.</p><p></p><p>"And I'll find a way to get him a storage bag as well."</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Grand Master was left dumbfounded, suddenly feeling that her disciple had become a rather... obsessive type, commonly known as a 'simp'.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

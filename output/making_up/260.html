        <h1>Chapter 260</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao walked over with the military chest on his back, revealing an excited expression. This place was like a natural prototype of the grand pattern of heaven and earth. By laying down the mysterious gates of heaven and earth here, he could draw the great momentum of heaven and earth into his body, and draw the qi of the mountains into his body. This was the place of breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>With a slap on the military chest behind him, several beams of light flew out and scattered in all directions.</p><p></p><p>Then he took out the mysterious treasure instruments for setting up the mysterious gates, and began to arrange them.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was watching silently in the dark. Although the military chest had been successfully refined, Fang Hao had not yet refined the divine will, so he could not open the military chest with just a thought, and needed to rely on his own true essence to activate it.</p><p></p><p>"This breakthrough of Fang Hao, the mysterious patterns of heaven and earth that he has refined, should be in the Niwan (a point in the brain). This is the divine will pattern, giving birth to the divine will of the mysterious gates."</p><p></p><p>"However..." Li Xuan pondered for a moment. Although Fang Hao had the power of penetrating the mysteries upon entering the door, this was because he was originally a grand master before cultivating the mysterious martial arts. Theoretically, the realm of a grand master corresponds to the realm of penetrating the mysteries.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was the first practitioner of the mysterious martial arts, and belonged to the pioneer of the mysterious martial arts, so he had some special characteristics, and his entry-level realm was on par with his original martial arts realm.</p><p></p><p>Normally, the first heavenly and earthly mysterious pattern should correspond to the pre-heaven realm.</p><p></p><p>"If my guess is not wrong, Fang Hao's breakthrough this time will refine two heavenly and earthly mysterious patterns, making up for the one mysterious pattern that originally corresponded to the realm of penetrating the mysteries."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had already arranged the heavenly and earthly mysterious gates and began to draw the great momentum of heaven and earth into his body, refining the next mysterious pattern.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The momentum of the mountains gathered, and the momentum of heaven and earth also came like a gentle breeze, constantly being drawn and gathered towards Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>This place was located in a remote wilderness, with sparse human habitation.</p><p></p><p>Although there was some movement, it was not noticed by anyone.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has refined the second heavenly and earthly mysterious pattern, and you have obtained the second pre-heaven mysterious pattern."</p><p></p><p>Just as Li Xuan had guessed, Fang Hao's breakthrough this time made up for the heavenly and earthly mysterious pattern that originally corresponded to the realm of penetrating the mysteries.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Hao was still in the midst of his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Is it because of the Great Dao Golden Book that every pioneer of a martial art has some special characteristics?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Great Dao Golden Book on the spiritual platform, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Chicat, the pioneer of the demonic martial arts, was the first great demon, and therefore also had some special characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Above the mountains, the mist surged and gathered towards Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of heaven and earth also became more fierce, as if a will of heaven and earth was gathering.</p><p></p><p>In the mist, lightning flashed, as if a thunder tribulation was about to come.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed, somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The divine will realm, the one I originally wrote, refining the will of heaven and earth as my will... When Fang Hao breaks through, the divine will of the mysterious gates is also refining the will of heaven and earth, so the will of heaven and earth is gathering?"</p><p></p><p>Watching the mist getting closer and closer, with the flashing of lightning, it truly had the appearance of a thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was just a phenomenon caused by the gathering of the great momentum of the mountains and the great momentum of heaven and earth being drawn and refined into the will of heaven and earth, and not a real thunder tribulation.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the mysterious martial arts or the physical martial arts... Even if the cultivation is different and the system is different, the root is still following the pure martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan successfully comprehended the divine will realm by refining the will of heaven and earth as his will, so he had broken through this realm. Later practitioners could also refine the divine will.</p><p></p><p>Even if the martial arts system is different, it is the same.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's breakthrough was smooth sailing. Although he would suffer some mental pressure and even pain when refining the third heavenly and earthly mysterious pattern, as long as he gritted his teeth and persisted, he would be able to break through smoothly.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has refined the third heavenly and earthly mysterious pattern, and you have obtained the third pre-heaven mysterious pattern."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>On Li Xuan's spiritual platform, an abstruse mysterious pattern appeared, as if it was born of pre-heaven, existing on the spiritual platform.</p><p></p><p>"Your mysterious martial arts have advanced to the Divine Origin Realm."</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the third pre-heaven mysterious pattern, Li Xuan's originally very strong divine will experienced another great improvement, and the mysterious martial arts also advanced to the Divine Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, the four martial arts were all at the Divine Origin Realm, and his overall strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>After his breakthrough, Fang Hao stabilized his realm for a while, then excitedly activated the mysterious military chest.</p><p></p><p>With a thought of his divine will, the military chest opened, and various mysterious military weapons flew out. Within his divine will, formations, sword arrays, and the mysterious gates of heaven and earth all unfolded as he wished, changing with the situation.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao truly experienced the great power of the mysterious martial arts.</p><p></p><p>One thought, a great formation arises, burying the enemy!</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, now that you have refined the divine will, the path of the mysterious martial arts in the future will be much smoother. Try to forge your own unique path of the mysterious martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan appeared and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The master had been secretly protecting his breakthrough all along.</p><p></p><p>"In the future, before a breakthrough, set up a formation to protect yourself during the breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked around the place and said.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and turned to return to the manor.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations on your breakthrough, junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Back at the manor, Su Ling smiled brightly.</p><p></p><p>"If it weren't for the pills from senior sister, I wouldn't have been able to break through so quickly. I have to thank senior sister for that."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said modestly.</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, the next step was to take action against the Yushan Sect.</p><p></p><p>And he would also take on the role of the Jade State Alliance's Jade State Master, leading the members of the Jade State Alliance to carve out a place for themselves.</p><p></p><p>He took out the communication talisman and contacted Yu Gao to obtain news from the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Then Fang Hao began to study the Talisman Dao.</p><p></p><p>After refining the divine will, whether it was forging tools or setting up formations, there was a huge improvement, and he could use some mysterious techniques, exerting their basic power.</p><p></p><p>After five days of research and repeated experiments, the first talisman formation was born.</p><p></p><p>This was a Mist Formation Talisman! Once activated, it would generate a layer of mist, enveloping the person inside, with the effect of blocking vision, sensing, and spiritual power.</p><p></p><p>"I finally succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Although the Mist Talisman was a very common and inexpensive jade talisman, this was a breakthrough from zero to one.</p><p></p><p>The successful refinement of this Mist Talisman meant that his understanding of the Talisman Dao was correct.</p><p></p><p>The other jade talismans with different effects could also be refined using this method.</p><p></p><p>At the moment Fang Hao refined the Mist Talisman, the Great Dao Golden Book on Li Xuan's spiritual platform turned a page.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has comprehended the Talisman Dao, and you have obtained the true understanding of the Talisman Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly delighted. The method of refining jade talismans that Fang Hao had figured out was to place formations within the jade talismans, and then seal the formations with restrictions, locking the formations within the jade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Once activated, the restrictions would open, and the sealed formations would be triggered and activated.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said that Fang Hao's talent in forging was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, Brother Meng, another...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So we've finally met!"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou looked at Xu Yan and Meng Chong, sighing deeply in his heart.</p><p></p><p>These two sworn brothers were truly good at hiding. The Yushen Sect and the Shu family had searched all over Yuzhou, but they couldn't even find a trace of them. Instead, they discovered a hidden cultivator force.</p><p></p><p>And within this cultivator force, there were even Refining Spirit Celestials, not just one, shocking all the spiritual sects and noble families in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>After a round of attacks, this cultivator force seemed to have collapsed.</p><p></p><p>It was rumored that the leader of the cultivator force, a late-stage Refining Spirit cultivator, was severely injured by the Grand Elder of the Yushen Sect, Zhu Liang, and was left half-crippled, if not dead.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, do you have any information on the spiritual ore mines of the Yushen Sect?" Xu Yan asked directly, without beating around the bush.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was delighted to hear this and took out a prepared map, spreading it out on the table. "This is the location of the Yushen Sect's spiritual ore mines. Among them, these two mines are the ones the Yushen Sect openly owns, but they are just small mines.</p><p></p><p>"These two are the core spiritual ore mines of the Yushen Sect, and there is a high possibility that the Spirit Soil Flowers are growing in the mines.</p><p></p><p>"This is the most crucial spiritual ore information I can currently provide. Whether there are even larger and more secretive mines, I'm not sure."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou pointed out the marked mines on the map as he introduced them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong's gazes fell on the two large mines. Their target must be the Yushen Sect's core large mines, especially since these two large mines were suspected to have Spirit Soil Flowers, a precious spiritual herb.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, Brother Meng, the Yushen Sect's core large mines are guarded by Refining Spirit Celestials, so it's not possible to quickly empty the spiritual crystals. In my opinion, it's better to take these small mines first. Even that would be a significant loss for the Yushen Sect," Shen Haizhou said, swallowing hard.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong stared intently at the large mines, making Shen Haizhou feel uneasy.</p><p></p><p>If they really succeeded in seizing those large mines, the Yushen Sect would go crazy. They might even go so far as to seek outside help at any cost! Shen Haizhou was also worried that the information he provided might be leaked.</p><p></p><p>Although no one knew about his contact with Xu Yan and Meng Chong so far, and no one knew the information he had revealed, there was no such thing as an airtight wall in this world. He was afraid that if it was somehow leaked, he would be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>"The small mines are not interesting. Let's go for these two large mines," Xu Yan said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou swallowed again and said, "The mines are too large to empty completely. The person I'm looking for is nowhere to be found, and without his Swallow Mountain Toad, how can we quickly remove so many spiritual crystals? Unless... are you two after the Spirit Soil Flowers? But the existence of the Spirit Soil Flowers is just a rumor, not confirmed yet.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Spirit Soil Flowers are deep within the mines. Once you enter, you may get trapped and be in grave danger if you can't get out quickly."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Shen Haizhou's shoulder and said, "These are just minor issues, Brother Shen. You don't need to worry. Your friend is no longer needed, as my sworn brother and I have a plan.</p><p></p><p>"If there are indeed Spirit Soil Flowers inside, we'll make sure to save you a share of the medicinal pills refined from them."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou wiped the cold sweat from his forehead, almost able to imagine the Yushen Sect going crazy. He warned, "After this operation, Brother Xu and Brother Meng, you should leave Yuzhou quickly. Otherwise, the Yushen Sect will go mad."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grinned and said, "The Yushen Sect going mad is exactly what we want. These two mines are nothing. Our ultimate goal is to plunder the Yushen Sect's treasure trove."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's heart sank when he heard this. This was too reckless and bold. Where did they get the confidence? The Yushen Sect was renowned as the number one sect in Yuzhou, and their strength and foundation were truly terrifying. Even if the Yushen Sect was weak, they could still seek outside help. They had connections with powerful sects from other regions, and one could even say the Yushen Sect had a powerful backer.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, please help us gather information on the Yushen Sect, especially the movements of Zhu Liang and the Refining Spirit cultivators, as well as the situation around the large mines. We'll meet up again in a few days," Xu Yan said as he put away the map.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou gritted his teeth and nodded, "No problem, leave it to me!"</p><p></p><p>He had already boarded the pirate ship, so to speak. Jumping off at this point would make him look useless. Moreover, toppling the number one sect, the Yushen Sect, would be quite thrilling!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong bid farewell and returned to the manor with the map.</p><p></p><p>"So these are the Yushen Sect's large mines, and the Spirit Soil Flowers, a divine-grade spiritual herb!" Fang Hao was extremely excited. As someone from a humble background, he was finally going to seize the large mines of a sect!</p><p></p><p>"Is there really Spirit Soil Flowers? I have a medicinal formula that's missing this precious spiritual herb. If I can refine it, it can greatly enhance my Spiritual Sense, and the cultivation of Spiritual Sense can also be accelerated," Suling Xiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"The possibility is quite high," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect's bounty had mentioned the Spirit Soil Flowers, and they were known to grow in spiritual ore veins.</p><p></p><p>After some discussion and planning, the three sworn brothers summoned Yu Gao to come.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Spiritual Sense Realm, Fang Hao had re-forged the communication talisman, which could now transmit messages over at least 100,000 li, perhaps even hundreds of thousands of li.</p><p></p><p>He had also forged some jade talismans, such as the Mist Talisman, which could be used to confuse the enemy and buy time for escape in critical moments.</p><p></p><p>Hearing Xu Yan's plan, Yu Gao felt his scalp tingle. These three sworn brothers were truly audacious and crazy. Not only did they plan to seize the Yushen Sect's spiritual ore mines, but they also intended to create an opportunity to infiltrate the Yushen Sect and plunder their treasure trove! As a late-stage Refining Spirit cultivator, even he felt his heart pounding with fear.</p><p></p><p>"Are you really going to do this?" Yu Gao asked, his face covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>The three sworn brothers of Xu Yan looked at him disdainfully. "Yu Protector, if the Myriad World Alliance keeps hiding like this, I'm afraid it will lose its fighting spirit, its passion, and its courage. Even if the alliance emerges, it will lack the spirit of struggle. We must not forget to secretly cause trouble while developing," Fang Hao sighed.</p><p></p><p>As the new alliance master, he had to ensure the Myriad World Alliance's development.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I will follow the orders of the alliance master!" Yu Gao gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>The alliance master was right. They couldn't lose their fighting spirit and courage.</p><p></p><p>"That's more like it," Fang Hao said, taking out dozens of jade talismans and handing them to Yu Gao. "These are Mist Talismans. When activated, they will create a large area of confusing mist, hindering the enemy's perception and spiritual power, giving you a chance to escape."</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao received the Mist Talismans, his expression filled with shock. In addition to the communication talisman, there were actually such miraculous items?</p><p></p><p>"You can try them out and get familiar with them," Fang Hao reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, alliance master!" Yu Gao fired out the jade talisman, and with a boom, a large cloud of mist instantly appeared, covering dozens of meters in radius. He tried to probe it with his spiritual power, but found he could not penetrate the mist.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

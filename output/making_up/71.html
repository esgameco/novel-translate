        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 71 The Drained Corpses (Seeking Subscriptions)</p><p></p><p>Burp!</p><p></p><p>A sound came from within Blood Heartless' body, as if he had just finished eating his fill and let out a burp.</p><p></p><p>A flush of color appeared on his pale face.</p><p></p><p>The web-like blood vessels retracted back into his body from the numerous corpses, and an ominous aura permeated around him. The flushed color on his face faded, returning to a sickly pale hue.</p><p></p><p>"The people from the Borderland have impure blood. I need to refine and purify it. But after absorbing the essence of so many people, my injuries have recovered by about fifty to sixty percent."</p><p></p><p>Blood Heartless muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He lifted his head and looked towards the boundless mountains, his eyes gleaming with excitement.</p><p></p><p>The Borderland must be the place for his rise to power.</p><p></p><p>"I'll find a place to refine the blood essence and recover my strength. Only by regaining my full power can I perform the great blood sacrifice to purify the blood essence for my cultivation."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, just wait for my revenge, Blood Heartless!"</p><p></p><p>In high spirits, Blood Heartless took to the skies and vanished in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>Left behind on the hillside were over a hundred shriveled corpses, their faces still etched with an expression of terror.</p><p></p><p>The craze to seek out immortal cultivators had swept through the Qi Kingdom, and those who came to the boundless mountains in search of them were not limited to just the group led by the son of the Minister of War.</p><p></p><p>The boundless mountains were fraught with danger, so the seekers all traveled in large groups, accompanied by guards or having recruited skilled experts to venture into the mountains together.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a group of such seekers arrived at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Let's rest up here for a bit. We still don't know where the immortal cultivators are hiding."</p><p></p><p>"That Xu Yan sure is lucky, being able to find an immortal cultivator. But we shouldn't be discouraged, as immortal cultivators are not easy to come by. Even Xu Yan has been deceived before."</p><p></p><p>Under the protection of their guards, the group of young masters began ascending the hillside.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a shrill scream rang out.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? You startled this young master!"</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Aren't you supposed to be a top martial artist? How can you be so timid?" another voice cried out in alarm.</p><p></p><p>The cries continued in succession.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the scene on the hillside, and a chill ran down their spines, their scalps tingling.</p><p></p><p>Sprawled on the hillside were over a hundred corpses, emanating a faint aura of gloom. Each corpse was shriveled, as if their blood had been drained.</p><p></p><p>Their sunken faces still bore the expression of terror they had experienced in their final moments.</p><p></p><p>"This is... this is..."</p><p></p><p>Someone recognized the identities of the corpses.</p><p></p><p>"The eldest son of the Minister of War!"</p><p></p><p>"The second son of the Minister of Rites!"</p><p></p><p>"And more..."</p><p></p><p>Overwhelming fear gripped the hearts of the group, and they instinctively looked around, as if an evil spirit might strike at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"How did they die?"</p><p></p><p>A brave martial artist stepped forward to examine the corpses, and the more he saw, the more horrified he became.</p><p></p><p>"The bodies are shriveled, turned into dried corpses..."</p><p></p><p>It was too bizarre!</p><p></p><p>How long had the Minister of War's son and the others been in the boundless mountains?</p><p></p><p>Even if they had died, they shouldn't have turned into dried corpses like this. Moreover, the expressions of terror on their faces suggested they had witnessed something terrifying before their deaths.</p><p></p><p>"This is the One-Sword King, a renowned top expert from the capital. He's dead too!"</p><p></p><p>One person after another recognized the identities of the corpses, many of them being famous top-tier martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred people, with numerous experts and fully equipped, had all died on this hillside. Yet there were no signs of any battle.</p><p></p><p>It was as if they had all died at the same time!</p><p></p><p>And their bodies had turned into dried corpses!</p><p></p><p>This eerie scene horrified everyone, and they no longer had the heart to continue their search for immortal cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Let's get out of here, quickly!"</p><p>"The boundless mountains are too dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>The group hurriedly descended the mountain, not daring to linger.</p><p></p><p>"Bring the corpses of the Minister of War's son and the others back to the capital. Their deaths are too bizarre, and we need to investigate. Xu Yan is a martial artist, maybe he can shed some light on this."</p><p></p><p>Someone suggested, and the others agreed, thinking they could get rewards for bringing back the bodies. As for whether they would be suspected of foul play, that was impossible. The bizarre state of the corpses and their own martial prowess made that unthinkable.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital, Xu Yan had broken through to the peak of the Blood and Qi Realm and had also comprehended the cultivation method of the Innate Realm. He was in high spirits.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor sent people to congratulate him and wanted to hold a celebratory banquet for his great martial advancement, but Xu Yan declined.</p><p></p><p>After staying in the capital for a few days, Xu Yan set out to return to the East River Commandery.</p><p></p><p>Soon after Xu Yan left the capital, the news of the mysterious deaths of the Minister of War's son and the others in the boundless mountains spread among the officials.</p><p></p><p>The bodies were brought back, and even the Qi Emperor himself came to examine them.</p><p></p><p>The shriveled corpses and the lingering terror on their faces were highly unsettling.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Guo, please have your grandson come back and take a look. This is too bizarre!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Lord Guo, this is too strange!"</p><p></p><p>The officials were in a panic. Many of their own sons were out searching for immortal cultivators, and most of them had gone to the boundless mountains.</p><p></p><p>The Minister of War and the Minister of Rites were deeply shaken by the tragedy.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan realized that this matter was too bizarre. Could there be some kind of monster in the boundless mountains?</p><p></p><p>He immediately sent a message to Xu Yan, utilizing the newly established falcon messenger system between the East River Commandery and the capital.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ensuring smooth and swift communication between the Eastern River Commandery and the Prince of Qi's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng hurried back to the Eastern River Commandery, and as soon as he arrived home to have a meal with his parents and guide them in their cultivation, he received a message from his grandfather via a messenger falcon.</p><p></p><p>Shriveled corpses? </p><p></p><p>Mysterious deaths?</p><p></p><p>He became curious at once.</p><p></p><p>"I once read in an ancient storybook about a legend of a monster called the Corpse Ghoul, who loves to devour human blood. Could it be that they encountered the Corpse Ghoul?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng thought this way, and his interest was immediately piqued.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Corpse Ghoul is fierce and bloodthirsty, possessing immense strength. I have already reached the peak of the Qi and Blood Realm, and my strength is vastly superior to the past. I'm looking to find someone to practice my skills on.</p><p></p><p>"If it is indeed the Corpse Ghoul, I can give it a try."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng showed an excited expression and immediately headed to the capital city.</p><p></p><p>He had only seen a description of the Corpse Ghoul in an ancient book, and the legend was not widely known among the common people. There were probably very few who knew of this legendary monster.</p><p></p><p>The capital city.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng returned shortly after leaving.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the corpses? Where are they?"</p><p></p><p>He hurried to the morgue as soon as he arrived.</p><p></p><p>He saw the several shriveled corpses.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi and his ministers had all gathered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng looked at the corpses, furrowing his brows. From the appearance of the corpses, it seemed they had been drained of blood and turned into dried-up bodies.</p><p></p><p>There was a faint yin energy lingering around the corpses.</p><p></p><p>But unlike the description in the storybook of how the Corpse Ghoul's victims were killed, there were no bite wounds visible.</p><p></p><p>According to the storybook, the wounds would be on the neck.</p><p></p><p>Also, those killed by the Corpse Ghoul would not directly become dried-up corpses, but rather turn a bluish-black color, containing a corpse toxin.</p><p></p><p>However, these corpses were not bluish-black, nor did they contain any corpse toxin.</p><p></p><p>They had completely turned into dried-up bodies, like they had been scorched by the sun, and even after such a long time, they had not decayed at all.</p><p></p><p>"How is it? Have you noticed anything unusual?" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng continued examining the corpses, shaking his head and saying, "I had thought it was the legendary Corpse Ghoul that killed them, but from the appearance of the corpses, it doesn't seem to be the work of the Corpse Ghoul."</p><p></p><p>"What is this Corpse Ghoul?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi and the ministers looked at each other, having never heard of such a monstrous creature.</p><p></p><p>"It is a bloodthirsty and extremely savage monster."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng briefly explained.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi and the ministers felt a chill run down their spines, realizing there was such a terrifying monster in this world.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, how do you know about the Corpse Ghoul?"</p><p></p><p>One of the ministers couldn't help but ask curiously.</p><p></p><p>He considered himself well-versed in various fields, from astronomy and geography to history and artifacts, yet he had never heard of the Corpse Ghoul before. He couldn't help but suspect that Xu Yanfeng had made it up.</p><p></p><p>"I read about it in an ancient storybook, a very old one that is said to be a rare copy."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng replied.</p><p></p><p>Storybook?</p><p></p><p>The minister paused, instinctively about to say, "How can one believe the things in storybooks?"</p><p></p><p>But then he suddenly remembered the rumors that Xu Yanfeng had believed in the legends from storybooks and sought out high-level cultivators, only to be mocked behind his back for his foolishness. </p><p></p><p>Yet, Xu Yanfeng had actually succeeded in cultivating an incredibly powerful martial art.</p><p></p><p>Thinking about it this way, the legends from storybooks might not be entirely unbelievable after all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng continued examining the corpses, stripping off their clothes and turning them over repeatedly.</p><p></p><p>The Minister of War watched with tears in his eyes, his lips trembling, about to speak up, but a cold glare from Emperor Qi silenced him.</p><p></p><p>They could only let Xu Yanfeng continue rummaging through the corpses.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, if it's not the work of the Corpse Ghoul, then what could have done this?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng pondered, recalling the storybooks he had read but finding no similar accounts.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his gaze sharpened as he noticed a small hole on the chest of the dried-up corpses.</p><p></p><p>As if something had pierced their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"This is..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng frowned, gently touching the wound. It was a very small hole, as if pierced by a thin spike.</p><p></p><p>"A mosquito?"</p><p></p><p>The blood had been drained, turning the bodies into dried husks, and there was a small wound on the chest.</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, an image flashed through Xu Yanfeng's mind - a giant mosquito-like creature pouncing on the Minister of War's son, using its proboscis to pierce his heart and drain his blood, turning him into a dried corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some kind of blood-sucking demonic creature, similar to a mosquito?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng couldn't help but think of the Fire-Maned Wolf, which had already transcended the realm of ordinary beasts. What kind of powerful creature could have killed these people in such a way?</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, he spoke up, "I don't know what the culprit is, but it might be some kind of demonic creature. I'll go back and ask my master. Perhaps my master knows what it is."</p><p></p><p>His master was a hidden cultivator, and he should know what kind of demonic creature was responsible.</p><p></p><p>The boundless mountains must be hiding such demonic creatures.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng suddenly became interested in the boundless mountains and these unknown demonic creatures. He decided to go back and ask his master if he could venture into the mountains to hunt these creatures, given his current strength.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go back and ask my master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yanfeng left excitedly, ready to return to the Eastern River Commandery and inquire with his master about what kind of creature had drained the people's blood, and whether he would be able to handle it.</p>

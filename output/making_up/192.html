        <h1>Chapter 192</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The woman in purple robes frowned slightly and coldly snorted, "What, is there a problem?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan cautiously asked, "I don't know, Miss, what business do you have with Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was a member of the Changqing Pavilion, and not many people mentioned him, even though he was very powerful. However, in the inner domain martial arts world, more attention was focused on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The woman in purple robes did not seem very skilled at gathering information, and it was highly likely that she was not from the vicinity of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, she would not have been unable to learn about Meng Chong's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, the other party had seen Meng Chong's battle on the Cang River and knew that Hu Shan was with Xu Yan and Meng Chong, so she came to inquire about Meng Chong's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"Don't ask about things you shouldn't. You just need to tell me where Meng Chong is," the woman in purple robes said unhappily.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know where Meng Chong is either. If you're not in a hurry, you can wait here. Meng Chong should be coming to Canglan Island soon, so you can wait for him there," Hu Shan carefully suggested.</p><p></p><p>"He's coming to Canglan Island?" The woman in purple robes' eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it should be in the next few days," Hu Shan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if Meng Chong comes, tell him I have an important matter to discuss with him and that I'll be waiting here," the woman in purple robes said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem!" Hu Shan readily agreed.</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to get back to Canglan Island now and not come out again until Meng Chong arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you can go now!" The woman in purple robes levitated and said, "Remember, bring Meng Chong here to meet me."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan heaved a sigh of relief, patting his chest, "No problem, I'll definitely pass on the message and bring Meng Chong here!"</p><p></p><p>The woman in purple robes nodded in satisfaction and left.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan hurriedly set out to return to Canglan Island, but before he had gone far, the woman in purple robes came back.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, do you have something else?" Hu Shan asked with a pounding heart.</p><p></p><p>The woman in purple robes seemed to have ill intentions.</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid you won't bring him, so I'll give you something." The woman in purple robes said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"What is it?" Hu Shan was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>The woman in purple robes produced a hair pin in her hand, a translucent and lustrous pin that emanated a faint glow - it was a precious treasure.</p><p></p><p>She raised her hand, and the pin suddenly shot out.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's heart raced, and he tried to dodge, but it was too late. A Grand Master's strike left him no chance to evade.</p><p></p><p>Puck! The pin pierced his shoulder, with only the head protruding, glowing faintly.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's face turned green. He felt a cold sensation in his shoulder, but no pain. However, he was very anxious, for this hair pin was no ordinary item.</p><p></p><p>Embedded in his body, it seemed to contain a certain power. If he forcibly pulled it out, it would likely inflict severe injury.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you give this pin to Meng Chong. I've stabbed you with it, so you'll definitely want to take revenge, and then you'll be sure to bring him here," the woman in purple robes said satisfactorily, clapping her hands.</p><p></p><p>With that, she left.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was in a terrible state, cursing inwardly at this woman's audacity.</p><p></p><p>But he had to admit that he would indeed want to take revenge, and then summon Meng Chong to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>Back on Canglan Island, Hu Shan originally wanted to go find Xu Yan, but then he thought that Xu Yan was cultivating the Sword Dao, so he didn't disturb him.</p><p></p><p>Peng Yuan, the peak Grand Master, was immersed in his martial arts research and had no time to deal with him.</p><p></p><p>As for Young Master Xie Lingfeng, he simply lacked the ability to handle the woman in purple robes.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was in a terrible state, all he could do was wait for Meng Chong to come to Canglan Island. As for the pin in his shoulder, he couldn't remove it for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to contemplate the Sword Dao, but the Sword Dao was not easy to comprehend, especially the Sword Dao related to the spiritual soul. Although he had gained some insights, he was still far from mastering it.</p><p></p><p>A large ship sailed on the Cang River, and Li Xuan enjoyed the scenery on both banks of the river, feeling at ease.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sat at the stern, still perfecting his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan saw a figure flash by on the shore of the Cang River.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be someone trying to ambush us?" He smiled. What kind of person would be foolish enough to try and rob a ship from the Changqing Pavilion?</p><p></p><p>However, apart from the fleeting figure, there was nothing unusual. It seemed to be just a passing martial artist.</p><p></p><p>That night, mist shrouded the Cang River, obstructing the vision to some extent.</p><p></p><p>The ship's speed slowed down.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan still sat in his chair, appreciating the night scenery of the Cang River.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked up.</p><p></p><p>On the shore of the Cang River, there seemed to be a figure in white robes, with a blue-colored face.</p><p></p><p>The distance was far, and the mist obscured the view. Even with Li Xuan's abilities, he could not see clearly, but he vaguely saw the blue-colored face.</p><p></p><p>His brow furrowed. A blue face? Could there be a ghost in the inner domain?</p><p></p><p>Just as he was considering whether to use the Hundred Martial Arts Shadow to investigate, the figure suddenly retreated and left the shore.</p><p></p><p>"Wearing a mask?" Li Xuan muttered to himself, but he didn't dwell on it.</p><p></p><p>No matter what the other party's intentions were, they were simply courting death in the face of absolute power.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the ship approaching Canglan Island, Hu Shan was almost in tears with excitement. After longing for so long, he had finally brought the person he was waiting for.</p><p></p><p>He quickly went to find Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng Chong, there's an emergency!" Hu Shan exclaimed as soon as he reached the stern.</p><p></p><p>"What's the emergency?" Meng Chong asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the pin in Hu Shan's shoulder, and he had a strange expression, "Hu Shan, why do you have a pin stuck in your shoulder?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's expression faltered, and he said mournfully, "It's all because of you. There's a woman who insists on finding you, and she was afraid I wouldn't bring you, so she stabbed a pin into my shoulder and said it's a gift for you..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's gaze sharpened, "What happened?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know either. This pin is no ordinary thing. If I try to pull it out carelessly, it will cause me serious injury," Hu Shan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go find her, and see if she's tired of living!" Meng Chong sneered.</p><p></p><p>"But this pin..." Hu Shan pointed to the pin in his shoulder, looking distressed.</p><p></p><p>"This pin seems to be somewhat unusual," Meng Chong frowned. It was clearly the other party's weapon, and the material it was forged from was not ordinary. If it was embedded in the body and one didn't know how to remove it, forcibly pulling it out would cause the pin to explode and inflict severe injury.</p><p></p><p>Scratching his head, he said, "I'm not skilled in such clever techniques. You'll have to find my senior brother or my master."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan's face fell. "Senior Brother Xu is cultivating the Sword Dao, I don't dare disturb him. As for the elder..."</p><p></p><p>He didn't dare bother the elder for such a small matter.</p><p></p><p>Just as he spoke, a force penetrated his shoulder and directly pushed the pin out.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, elder!" Hu Shan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The pin fell into Li Xuan's hand, and he examined it, marveling at the exquisite craftsmanship of this pin.</p><p></p><p>The pin was not a single piece, but an assembly. It appeared to be a seamless whole, but it contained mechanisms. When launched, it would contain a certain force.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the hairpin, there was a contained power. If forcibly pulled out, the power within the hairpin would instantly burst forth, causing severe injury.</p><p></p><p>The material used for the hairpin was extraordinary, actually containing true qi and true essence within it.</p><p></p><p>Of course, while the hairpin was ingenious, in the face of absolute strength, taking it out would be easy.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan directly wrapped it in true essence, suppressing the power within the hairpin so it could not burst forth, and then took the hairpin out.</p><p></p><p>"It's a good thing, take it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tossed the hairpin to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm a big burly man, it's not suitable for me to wear. Give it to your disciple sister."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the hairpin and said disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Decide after you meet the person."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled, what did he mean by sending the hairpin to the woman Meng Chong would meet? Could it be that he had taken a liking to Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded and left the boat with Hu Shan.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, it was bustling.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had also finished comprehending the Sword Dao. When Li Xuan saw Xu Yan, he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, are you comprehending a new sword intent? And this sword intent seems to be somewhat extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had not yet fully comprehended the sword intent, he had still gained some harvests, with a faint aura like a gentle breeze surrounding him, which Li Xuan could not conceal.</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before I can harvest a new sword intent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>He saw Peng Yuan and the other Martial Dao scholars, and couldn't help but have a strange expression on his face. These guys had dark circles around their eyes, looking like panda bears.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Xu Yan wanted to lure these Martial Dao scholars to the Qingqing Pavilion. Judging from their dark circles, they are people who are single-mindedly focused on the Martial Dao, pure-hearted and easily deceived."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>These were all cultivators above the Patriarch realm, especially Peng Yuan, who was a peak Grand Patriarch. For such powerful cultivators to have dark circles around their eyes showed that these dark circles had been accumulated over the years from their weak cultivation, and could no longer be removed.</p><p></p><p>After the Qingqing Pavilion moved to Canglan Island, Peng Yuan and the other Martial Dao scholars, after coming into contact with the medicinal pills, were almost driven crazy. Every day they would smile obsequiously and follow behind Su Ling Xiu, eagerly doing all kinds of chores, just wanting to learn a bit about pill refining and delve into the mysteries of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>The inner domain cultivators who had turned to cultivate the Great Desolate Martial Dao had started researching it again, and Su Ling Xiu had dissected the living corpses of the Hidden Palace cultivators, gaining a deep understanding of the inner domain cultivators.</p><p></p><p>After researching, she had finally made a breakthrough regarding how to replace the Heaven and Earth Bridge of the Great Desolate cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu had researched and refined a medicinal pill that could assist in the condensation of the meridians into a Heaven and Earth Bridge. Although it was only a false Heaven and Earth Bridge, it could allow the inner domain cultivators to truly cultivate the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the method of this transformation was mastered by the Qingqing Pavilion. Without the medicinal pill, they would be unable to condense their meridians into a Heaven and Earth Bridge.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the position of the Qingqing Pavilion in the Great Desolate was unshakable.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also drawbacks. The downside was that many powerful cultivators, in order to cultivate the Great Desolate Martial Dao, would keep an eye on the Qingqing Pavilion, trying to force them to hand over the medicinal pill formula or the method of refining this pill.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this so-called downside would be insignificant in the face of absolute strength.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, who had left with Hu Shan a few days ago, had finally returned. </p><p></p><p>By his side was a purple-robed woman.</p><p></p><p>She was looking at Meng Chong with an adoring expression, which even made Li Xuan feel puzzled.</p><p></p><p>A female simp? Unexpectedly, the burly bald Meng Chong also had an admirer.</p><p></p><p>"One million spirit crystals, how about it, Meng Chong?" </p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I don't lack money now!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Two million spirit crystals!"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman continued to raise the price.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was somewhat tempted, but ultimately shook his head and said, "You leave, I'm busy!"</p><p></p><p>Now that the Qingqing Pavilion was not lacking in spirit crystals, he naturally would not accept the purple-robed woman's employment.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, what's going on?" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng curiously pulled Hu Shan and asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others also gathered around, the purple-robed woman could see that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"She wanted to hire Meng Chong to escort her to a place, but Meng Chong didn't agree."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan also had a strange expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but recall the time when he first entered the inner domain and accepted Duan Yuying's employment, earning his first batch of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Over there, the purple-robed woman continued to raise the price: "Three million spirit crystals!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were stunned, this woman was truly wealthy! Three million spirit crystals, she didn't even blink an eye.</p><p></p><p>"I said I won't accept the employment!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned, directly reaching out his big hand, grabbing the woman's shoulder, and tossing her into the air.</p><p></p><p>However, the purple-robed woman soon ran back, her jade-like face flushed red, the whole person extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're so fierce!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong knitted his brows and said, "If you don't leave, don't blame me for punching you to death!"</p><p></p><p>"I won't leave, just accept my employment, okay? That place is a treasure land, although it's a bit dangerous, but with your strength, you can definitely break through."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman was persistent.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, irritated, "Alright, if you want me to agree, I don't want the spirit crystals, unless you give me a storage bag, otherwise I won't agree."</p><p></p><p>A storage bag, it could be considered a true treasure in the inner domain. Until now, Meng Shu still hadn't bought one for him.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the purple-robed woman would definitely not be able to provide one.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought, the purple-robed woman heard this and was overjoyed, "No problem."</p><p></p><p>She actually took out a small bag from her bosom.</p><p></p><p>A gray little bag, like a toad.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was stunned, she was actually willing to give him a storage bag to hire him? His gaze fell on the storage bag, and he couldn't help but be tempted. But the purple-robed woman was so eager to hire him, was there a plot behind it? He couldn't help but hesitate.</p><p></p><p>"Here, I've given you the storage bag, can you accept my employment now?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman directly stuffed the storage bag into Meng Chong's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so insistent on hiring me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath and asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Because I like you!" </p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman blushed as she said.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his bald head, looking a bit dumbfounded. "Just because of that?"</p><p></p><p>"And you're very strong, especially your physical defense, which can give me a sense of security. You are the most suitable person to go to that place."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about it!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the storage bag in his hand, his heart stirring. </p><p></p><p>However, the other party's intentions were unclear, and the place she mentioned must be very dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"That place is not that dangerous, with your strength, you can walk through it easily, just agree to me, okay?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman stared at him eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at his master, then at his senior brother, seeking their advice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke up, "Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed woman thought for a moment and said, "My name is Zi Yun."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan heard this and immediately widened their eyes, revealing expressions of shock.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends here.)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 60: Meng Chong Gains Enlightenment, the Great Sun Golden Bell Covers Him</p><p></p><p>Back in the Imperial Study, Emperor Qi fell into deep contemplation. When did it all start, that he, the mighty Emperor of the Qi Kingdom, had fallen to such a state?</p><p></p><p>It was the struggle for the crown prince position, with his third son losing the precious jade and being defeated in the succession battle, while the eldest son emerged victorious and began his actions in the Donghe Prefecture, starting to purge Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>It was the ministers who supported the eldest son, preparing for him to ascend the position of Crown Prince by eliminating the Tianmu Sect in Donghe Prefecture and establishing his merits.</p><p></p><p>The root of it all began with the raid on Xu Yan's household...</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Emperor Qi became furious and felt deeply wronged. This hadn't even been a household raid yet, and he was the Emperor - how could he care about a mere merchant like that? He didn't even know about this matter.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the blame for the household raid had been placed on him.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an edict, the Crown Prince has acted improperly, give him thirty heavy strokes of the cane, punish him severely for me!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi gritted his teeth as he issued the edict.</p><p></p><p>Since he couldn't vent his anger on Xu Yan, he could only take it out on his own son.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was dumbfounded, as he had done nothing wrong, yet received thirty heavy strokes - a great injustice!</p><p></p><p>He cursed his father the Emperor in his heart: "That old thing, taking out his anger from outsiders on his own son!"</p><p></p><p>In the Qi Prince's Mansion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged on the bed, his mind clear, having entered a state of oneness with the world, fully immersed in comprehending the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>After a significant elevation of his mental state, he could almost enter this state of oneness at will, single-mindedly contemplating the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Flashes of enlightenment surfaced in his mind, and Xu Yan felt that he was not far from fully comprehending the innate realm cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Three days had passed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong still had not gained enlightenment, still pondering the cultivation technique. Li Xuan sat in a chair, watching this scene, and couldn't help but start to consider how to guide his disciple.</p><p></p><p>He would try to make the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Bell as detailed as possible, so that Meng Chong could more easily gain enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my second disciple has rather poor aptitude?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Outwardly, Meng Chong seemed like a reckless fellow.</p><p></p><p>But his thought processes were unusual, thinking of things that ordinary people couldn't, so his aptitude shouldn't be low.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>a golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple has frequently entered the Empress's palace to refine his mental state, and his marvelous mental state of being free from the entanglement of women has been elevated. You have attained a clear and tranquil mental state."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. His foolish disciple entered the Empress's palace to refine his mental state? </p><p></p><p>Just to refine his mental state?</p><p></p><p>"Ah, this disciple of mine..." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed. Xu Yan, this disciple of his, had such unique aptitude and powerful imagination that he had actually interpreted Li Xuan's words "being free from the entanglement of women" as a metaphor for a cultivational mental state.</p><p></p><p>"Well, at least he hasn't truly become free from the entanglement of women, he's just using it as a metaphor for his cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was now clear, unperturbed by external matters, able to fully immerse himself in a certain state.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the clear and tranquil mental state? Unaffected by external things, seeing through illusions, with a steadfast mind..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan discovered that the clear and tranquil mental state could make one's thinking more focused and agile, and able to remain calm even when facing a collapsing mountain.</p><p></p><p>"Now my mental state is more like that of a sage."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan narrowed his eyes slightly, ready to ponder how to further refine and pass on the Great Sun Golden Bell technique to Meng Chong, guiding him on how to gain enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he entered the state and found the direction for refinement.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the benefit of the clear and tranquil mental state?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly,</p><p></p><p>he looked up at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked up at the sun in the sky, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The great sun? The golden bell of the great sun? From the inside out, or from the outside in? I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Meng Chong seemed to have gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>He excitedly took off his clothes, exposing his muscular, bare upper body.</p><p></p><p>He walked under the sun, stood in a horse stance, took a deep breath, and then entered a state of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ???</p><p></p><p>Whether Meng Chong had the right idea or not, as long as he had gained some enlightenment and had some thoughts, that was a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to observe quietly without interfering with Meng Chong's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He was not afraid of his disciple going down the wrong path, what he feared the most was a disciple without any ideas. Even Xu Yan, back then, had all sorts of misunderstandings and self-imagination, but that was how he eventually succeeded in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>So being misguided was not scary. What was scary was having no ideas at all!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan secretly looked forward to whether Meng Chong could successfully cultivate the golden bell of the great sun.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sun. It was already winter now, the weather was cold, and although there was sunlight, it was not scorching hot, and he wouldn't get heatstroke.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know what Meng Chong had enlightened himself to.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had no intention of interfering. Since his disciple had gained some enlightenment, he would just observe quietly. With his cultivation at the peak of the Blood Qi realm, as a martial artist, his keen senses would be able to detect any changes.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood under the sun, and the sunlight shone on him, giving him a faint sense of warmth.</p><p></p><p>"First, I need to sense the blood qi. How do I sense the blood qi? The golden bell of the great sun should be under the great sun, to comprehend the scorching heat, and in this way, from the outside to the inside, make the blood qi seep into the bones and flow into the viscera...</p><p></p><p>"Since I cannot sense the blood qi from the inside, I will not be able to refine it from the inside out, then I shall rely on the scorching heat of the great sun to stimulate the blood qi, and then refine it from the outside to the inside..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong carefully contemplated. After basking in the sun for a while, he gradually began to sense the warmth on his skin, and a faint warm qi started to emerge in his breathing.</p><p></p><p>"I've sensed the blood qi!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>As the blood qi flowed bit by bit, it gradually gathered around his body's membranes, and surprisingly, it formed a wonderful resonance with the sunlight shining on his skin.</p><p></p><p>"From the outside to the inside, seeping into the bones, and then flowing into the viscera, this is the basic tempering method of the golden bell of the great sun. Cultivating the golden bell of the flesh, and then erupting the blood qi, turning it into the golden bell of the blood qi, this is the way to enter the Blood Qi realm..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong understood the cultivation process of the technique.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi had been tempered once on the membranes, but now it was circulating inward, dispersing throughout the bones.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, he felt as if there were ants crawling on his bones, and a sense of soreness and pain suddenly surged.</p><p></p><p>All the muscles in his body couldn't help but tremble slightly.</p><p></p><p>However, he endured it, not making a sound, only his breathing becoming slightly heavier.</p><p></p><p>"So this is bone refining? It's a bit uncomfortable, but I feel like there have been some changes..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi, after being tempered around the bones, slowly dispersed and flowed into the viscera, refining the fragile viscera.</p><p></p><p>The first time refining the viscera required controlling the blood qi, not rushing it, but slowly and carefully tempering it.</p><p></p><p>So Meng Chong focused all his attention on circulating the blood qi, strand by strand, flowing through the viscera.</p><p></p><p>The process of tempering the viscera was slower than refining the skin and bones combined. It would take more time than the first two. After the first viscera tempering was complete, and the blood qi returned to the bones and then back to the membranes, forming a cycle.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was delighted to discover that his body seemed to have an indescribable, round feeling, as if the inside and outside were one, with no leaks, as if a large bell covered his body, or as if he had become a flawless great bell himself!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

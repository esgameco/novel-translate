        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 72 The Clash of Martial Arts (Big Chapter Sought)</p><p></p><p>The journey from the capital city to the East River Prefecture was long and arduous. On the official road, there was a remote and desolate section that stretched for dozens of miles without any sign of human habitation. In the middle of this section, Qi State had established a relay station.</p><p></p><p>The relay station was adjacent to the boundless Great Mountains, more than a hundred miles from Yunshan County. Due to the fervent search for immortals that had swept through Qi State, many distinguished officials from the capital would pass through here to enter the boundless Great Mountains.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the relay station had increased its staff to serve these distinguished officials. </p><p></p><p>On this day, a figure emerged from the boundless Great Mountains, descending directly onto the relay station.</p><p></p><p>"You are..." </p><p></p><p>A minor official at the relay station, seeing the descending Blood Xin Heart, was startled, but then overjoyed!</p><p></p><p>"My chance has come!" he thought.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>He immediately knelt on the ground and kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable immortal, Little Second Li pays his respects to the immortal, and humbly requests the immortal to take me as a disciple..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart was taken aback. "Are the people on the edge of the wilderness all so direct?"</p><p></p><p>Chuckling ominously, he said, "Blood Food, you are not worthy of becoming my disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The minor official was puzzled. "Blood Food?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sharp pain pierced his heart. Looking down, he saw a thin thread piercing his heart, as if his blood was being drained away.</p><p></p><p>"Help..." </p><p></p><p>Greatly alarmed, just as he was about to call for help, he collapsed to the ground, becoming a shriveled corpse.</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart furrowed his brow. "The vitality is too poor. On the edge of the wilderness, the spiritual energy has dissipated, and even the people here have impure vitality."</p><p></p><p>From his body, a network of threads extended, instantly piercing the hearts of the other minor officials in the relay station.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>Shriveled corpses fell to the ground. There was not a single living soul left in the relay station.</p><p></p><p>"The vitality is not pure. Each time, I have to refine it before I can use it. In this way, the required blood will be a massive quantity. Even sacrificing tens or hundreds of millions of people may not be enough to break through a minor realm."</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>"Now, I can only endure. If one million is not enough, then ten million..."</p><p></p><p>"The edge of the wilderness is not lacking in people. Even if I sacrifice them all, what does it matter?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart's eyes gleamed with a bloodthirsty light.</p><p></p><p>However, to sacrifice so many people and then refine the vitality would take a considerable amount of time.</p><p></p><p>"First, I will slaughter a city, restore my injuries, and then find a few suitable seedlings to cultivate as blood disciples to sacrifice and refine the vitality for me.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years! Within ten years, I must break through to the Great Master Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart looked towards the boundless Great Mountains, his eyes filled with malice.</p><p></p><p>"Within ten years, I must return to the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>Leaving the relay station, he was about to head to the nearest city to slaughter and sacrifice the people to restore his injuries.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had left the capital city, brimming with questions, and was eager to find his master to get answers.</p><p></p><p>He directly unleashed his movement technique, rushing from the capital city towards the East River Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even the fastest horse would be far inferior to his speed. Xu Yan did not choose to ride a horse, and with the circulation of his vital energy, his figure moved like the wind, rushing towards Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>"It's not the corpse-devouring beast, so what kind of demonic creature could it be?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was still pondering what could have drained the bodies of their blood.</p><p></p><p>"I'm almost at Yunshan County."</p><p></p><p>Ahead was a relay station, and just beyond it was Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>"I'll rest here and calm down a bit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slowed his pace, intending to stop at the relay station, and also inquire with the officials if they had heard any news of a blood-sucking demonic creature.</p><p></p><p>As the relay station was adjacent to the boundless Great Mountains, the officials there would certainly have more information about the legends of the Great Mountains than ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>After rushing non-stop from the capital city, his vital energy had been depleted. He couldn't meet his master in this state, lest the master think he was hasty and impatient.</p><p></p><p>"One must not be rash in the face of events!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>As he stopped using his movement technique, the depletion of his vital energy was quickly being restored. His jade-like physique seemed to be shimmering with radiance, demonstrating the great strength of his jade-like foundation.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan stepped into the relay station, his vital energy had almost fully recovered to its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan's expression slightly darkened.</p><p></p><p>The keen senses of a martial artist made him immediately detect the abnormality. His vital energy surged, entering a state of vigilance, ready to face any danger.</p><p></p><p>He felt a dangerous presence lurking nearby.</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the martial way and becoming a martial artist, this was the first time he had experienced this sensation.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately realized that there was danger within the relay station!</p><p></p><p>And this danger could even threaten him!</p><p></p><p>"What is it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt his blood boiling, and a surge of fighting spirit arose in his heart. He eagerly anticipated a confrontation with this unknown danger.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he entered the relay station.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>His pupils constricted as he saw a shriveled corpse!</p><p></p><p>The body of a minor official at the relay station!</p><p></p><p>The withered form was exactly the same as that of the young master of the Ministry of Personnel and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Is it that monster?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened, his keen senses vigilantly scanning the surroundings. He gradually detected the source of the danger, in a room within the relay station, the other party was standing behind the door!</p><p></p><p>"It's not a monster, but seems to be a person!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan's heart raced. Could it be a fellow martial artist, like himself?</p><p></p><p>Where did this person come from?</p><p></p><p>Why did they kill the minor official at the relay station?</p><p></p><p>And... they had drained the official's blood!</p><p></p><p>What kind of martial artist was this?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>An icy, almost transparent thread shot out from the room, piercing towards Xu Yan's heart with lightning speed, its power extremely formidable!</p><p></p><p>In the room of the relay station, Blood Xin Heart was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"How could there be a martial artist in this remote wilderness?"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this young martial artist seemed to have something unusual about him.</p><p></p><p>Just as Blood Xin Heart was about to leave the relay station and head to the nearby city to slaughter and sacrifice the people to restore his injuries, he had sensed a powerful aura approaching on the official road.</p><p></p><p>That vital energy was so vigorous and surging, it made him feel a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>"Is this a martial artist being pursued from the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>No, that couldn't be right. How could there be such a terrifying vital energy?</p><p></p><p>"If I could devour his vital energy, I could instantly recover my injuries, and even advance my cultivation further!"</p><p></p><p>The more Blood Xin Heart thought about it, the more excited he became.</p><p></p><p>"The edge of the wilderness, where the spiritual energy has dissipated, it's impossible for there to be martial artists. But this martial artist from the inner domain doesn't exist either. How could there be such a terrifying vital energy, even for a Great Master?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart was increasingly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the edge of the wilderness has also gained the ability to cultivate the martial way?"</p><p></p><p>"No, that's impossible!"</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan entered the relay station, even though he had stopped using his movement technique and concealed his vital energy, with Blood Xin Heart's keen sense of blood energy, he could still detect the massive vital energy within Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The more he sensed it, the more shocked he became.</p><p></p><p>"Is this vital energy? But it feels different, and there's a scorching, boundless quality to it. This isn't just vital energy, is it?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart's mind was filled with questions.</p><p></p><p>"I must kill him. I can feel that if I can devour his vital energy, not only can I recover my injuries, but my foundation will also be strengthened, and I may even be able to break through!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Xin Heart's eyes gleamed with a murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The eyes revealed a bloodthirsty gleam.</p><p></p><p>With a flick of the fingers, the Bloodsucking Vampire Threads suddenly shot out, aiming straight for Xu Yan's heart.</p><p></p><p><div class="contentadv"><script>loadAdv(7,3);</script></div></p><p></p><p>In the moment he struck, the young man was seen slapping out a palm, with a thunderous boom, a huge crimson dragon, wrapped in a terrifying might, came rushing to attack.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin was shocked and lost his color.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The room collapsed, with debris flying everywhere. Xu Yan raised his hand and pushed out another palm, the crimson dragon sweeping down horizontally.</p><p></p><p>The scorching and domineering Descending Dragon Palm force directly vaporized the Bloodsucking Vampire Threads, but Xu Yan's face was grave, with a hint of confusion in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the Xue Wuxin who had evaded the attack and risen into the air, he was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"A Xiantian realm cultivator? Is that true qi?"</p><p></p><p>That cold thread seemed to be condensed from true qi.</p><p></p><p>"No! Something's not right, true qi is not this weak!</p><p></p><p>"Even a Xiantian realm cultivator shouldn't be this weak, what's going on with him?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin stared at Xu Yan, becoming more and more shocked!</p><p></p><p>"A cultivator! He is truly a cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>"From the Inner Domain? No! That's not right, if he was from the Inner Domain, he would have already known it was me."</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin denied it, this was not the thinking of an Inner Domain cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Clearly, this young man was a cultivator from the Borderland!</p><p></p><p>"Is he a Third-Grade cultivator? No, stronger than a Third-Grade, a Second-Grade? Also not right, a Second-Grade shouldn't be this strong, a First-Grade cultivator?</p><p></p><p>"A First-Grade cultivator this young?</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, what kind of cultivator is he? A First-Grade cultivator shouldn't be this powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin was shocked and puzzled at the same time.</p><p></p><p>"Qi and blood like a raging storm? What kind of cultivator, what martial dao, what cultivation method is this? A First-Grade cultivator refining storm energy, but not with such vast and domineering power, not with such might."</p><p></p><p>"Why does he give the feeling of a grandmaster of inner cultivation?</p><p></p><p>"But this is not the inner qi of a grandmaster either, it seems to be just qi and blood? Why would the qi and blood be so strong?"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin felt his mind was in a mess.</p><p></p><p>What the hell is going on here?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also puzzled, Xue Wuxin had an icy aura, that powerful force seemed to be true qi, yet weaker than true qi, without the great strength of innate true qi.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the opponent was able to float in the air, which was clearly a feat only Xiantian realm cultivators could accomplish.</p><p></p><p>If he was a Xiantian realm cultivator, why was he so weak?</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that my cultivation method is too powerful?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>"But that's not right either, why do I feel his physical body is not strong? It seems his martial foundation is not solid, and he may not have cultivated qi and blood before?</p><p></p><p>"Strange, is he really a Xiantian realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Judging from his appearance, he doesn't seem to be a good person, I better be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood surging, a huge dragon coiled around his body, another huge dragon hovering above his head, and one dragon each on the left and right, ready to strike at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Facing a powerful enemy, Xu Yan dared not be careless in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's pupils constricted, that terrifying qi and blood, scorching like fire, gave him a strong sense of threat, and also a hint of craving.</p><p></p><p>His instinct told him that as long as he devoured the opponent's qi and blood, not only would his injuries heal, but he could also break through in strength!</p><p></p><p>A bloodthirsty gleam flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>His already pale face became even paler, a cold aura permeating around him.</p><p></p><p>A long, icy-cold glowing knife was drawn from his robe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze sharpened, he sensed a threat from that knife.</p><p></p><p>"It's a treasure!"</p><p></p><p>That knife had similarities to the one and sword he had obtained from the Qi Kingdom's imperial treasury, not an ordinary steel blade.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have a sword on me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened slightly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll have to learn the sword art when I go back!"</p><p></p><p>He made up his mind, he would find his master and learn a sword art when he returned.</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>The long knife in Xue Wuxin's hand emitted a gloomy hum, the blade glowing, the icy aura spreading, and around the long knife floated numerous fine threads, like long thin needles.</p><p></p><p>"Strike first!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw this and immediately pushed his palm, with a thunderous boom, the Descending Dragon Palm force surging out.</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's eyes were cold, he brought the knife down in a slash.</p><p></p><p>The icy knife qi, wrapped in the fine threads, was extremely sharp, directly slashing through the Descending Dragon Palm force.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The knife qi raged, the icy aura permeating the area, the temperature dropping.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hands, unleashing the Descending Dragon Palm, in an instant nine long dragons swept from all directions towards Xue Wuxin, his terrifying qi and blood like a raging fire.</p><p></p><p>The icy aura was directly vaporized under his scorching qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"I cannot let this youth live!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin's heart was filled with killing intent, the opponent's scorching qi and blood actually had a suppressing effect on his inner qi, causing his strength to drop by more than 20%.</p><p></p><p>If not for his higher realm, he would have been crushed.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the knife light swept, the fine threads like spider silk constantly coiling, as if condensing into a huge net.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The nine huge dragons swept from all directions, the tyrannical palm force layer upon layer, seemingly endless, yet Xue Wuxin's knife light was even more vicious and ruthless.</p><p></p><p>Slash after slash, he cut through the huge dragons, his figure shifting as he constantly advanced.</p><p></p><p>The inn had already turned into ruins in the fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened, the opponent's knife technique was ruthless, and the knife qi raged, actually slashing through his Descending Dragon Palm. But he did not retreat, instead he was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he had met an opponent.</p><p></p><p>He could fight to his heart's content!</p><p></p><p>Against the Divine Might Army, he was still unable to fully unleash himself.</p><p></p><p>Now, he could!</p><p></p><p>Cultivators, they were meant to fight!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood surging, the Descending Dragon Palm force becoming stronger and stronger, with a thunderous boom, the tenth huge dragon was slapped out, the ten dragons coiling and sweeping, the might further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel he is not that strong? A Xiantian realm cultivator shouldn't be this weak."</p><p></p><p>Although the opponent currently had the upper hand, Xu Yan was not panicked at all, instead he was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>The opponent was far too weak, completely lacking the strength a Xiantian realm cultivator should possess.</p><p></p><p>If his qi and blood were complete, he would definitely be able to defeat the opponent!</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin fought harder and harder, he was indeed occupying the upper hand, but to defeat the opponent was extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>That dragon-shaped palm force, tyrannical and scorching.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the dragon-shaped palm force could even change its attack, the dragon head originally rushing in, but then half-way it coiled and became a tail whipping over!</p><p></p><p>What kind of palm art could achieve this?</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right, what cultivation method is he practicing? Based on my judgment, he seems to be a First-Grade cultivator? But a First-Grade cultivator, how could he have such strength, and possess such powerful might!"</p><p></p><p>Xue Wuxin took a deep breath, he must decide this battle quickly!</p><p></p><p>He slashed out a knife, countless Bloodsucking Vampire Threads constantly entangling the huge dragons, hindering the dragons' changes and agility, obstructing the attack speed.</p><p></p><p>As he shifted his figure, he suddenly grasped the opening in Xu Yan's Descending Dragon Palm strike, rising into the air, and in mid-air stabbed down with a knife!</p><p></p><p>4,000 chapters update, try to maintain a stable pace of two updates per day; please vote for monthly tickets ^_^</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

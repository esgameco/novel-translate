        <h1>Chapter 461</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, seeing the terrifying power of the Ten Directions Extinction Sword from afar, in an instant, Blood King Li's avatar was destroyed, the Heavenly Cave was leveled, and that streak of blood light had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>They were shocked, recalling the lingering aura from that sea area where the Boundary Gate was located. Only now, witnessing it firsthand, did they understand how truly terrifying Xu Yan's sword was.</p><p></p><p>Gao Xueming's words were not exaggerated, but rather insufficient to describe the might of this sword technique! Sword God Xu Yan was truly unparalleled in the world! One sword strike leveled the sea area, destroyed the Blood King's avatar, and suppressed the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even Immortal Heavenly Venerable beings would feel a sense of danger if they approached the lingering sword aura.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a rumbling sound came from a distant place.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder's expression changed. The other great Heavenly Caves in the Azure Sea Realm were in turmoil, at risk of falling at any moment.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Xu Yan, gritted his teeth, and flew in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"This old one is the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan. I implore Sword God Young Master Xu to lend a hand in eliminating the danger of the Heavenly Caves in our Azure Sea Realm. Our Sea Spirit Clan's treasures will be opened to Young Master Xu, free to choose any items you need!"</p><p></p><p>"Free to choose any treasures?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but look at the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder with newfound respect.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master Xu is free to choose any treasures he needs!" </p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>He then added: "Although our Sea Spirit Clan has declined, we still have some ancient relics left behind. Perhaps they might catch Young Master Xu's eye."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but think of Cai Ling'er, his master's maid who was from the Sea Spirit Clan and possessed the bloodline of the Sea Spirit Emperor. Under his master's guidance, she had activated her bloodline and received the Sea Spirit inheritance.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's treasury contained ancient artifacts - perhaps there were things his master would be interested in? Moreover, if his master had these Sea Spirit treasures, he would have suitable items to reward his maid.</p><p></p><p>"Master's realm is too high, there are almost no things that can catch his eye anymore. However, some small trinkets could be used by Master to reward others."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan nodded and said, "Alright, I agree!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Xu!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>For him, the Sea Spirit Clan had already declined, and those ancient artifacts might not necessarily be good for the clan.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Divine Realm was in turmoil and the situation was unpredictable, powerful beings might set their sights on these things at any time. Since that was the case, it was better to use them to build goodwill with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>If they could establish a friendship, Xu Yan might come to the Sea Spirit Clan's aid if they faced trouble in the future.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's power, as long as he intervened, the Sea Spirit Clan's crisis would surely be easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>"The crisis in the Azure Sea Realm is still unclear. What do you think, Young Master Xu?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder asked with a hopeful expression.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll go and quell the turbulent Heavenly Caves right away!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, sent a message to Xie Lingfeng saying they would meet again on Cloud Sky Island, and instantly departed with the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder to the nearest turbulent Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"The crisis in the Azure Sea Realm has been averted!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng came to his son's side and said with a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Too powerful! After many years, Xu Yan's fame had spread throughout the Divine Realm. Only now, seeing it with their own eyes, did they truly understand Xu Yan's strength.</p><p></p><p>Killing Immortal Heavenly Venerables was as easy for him as squashing an ant.</p><p></p><p>"Let's return to Cloud Sky Island and wait for Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said happily.</p><p></p><p>The crisis in the Azure Sea Realm came suddenly but was suppressed in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The name of Sword God Xu Yan resounded throughout the Azure Sea Realm. With his power alone, he quelled the turmoil of the Heavenly Caves. After this incident, the Heavenly Caves in the Azure Sea Realm would not be able to erupt into turmoil for a long time.</p><p></p><p>On Cloud Sky Island, in a small courtyard, Xu Yan and Xie Lingfeng reunited. Meanwhile, in a certain sea area of the Azure Sea Realm, at the bottom of the sea, a mile-wide Heavenly Cave opening was emitting a dark gray aura.</p><p></p><p>A giant turtle was lying on top of the Heavenly Cave opening, completely covering it.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom boom! Sounds of impacts came from inside the Heavenly Cave, but the giant turtle paid no mind. Instead, it raised its head to look at the sky.</p><p></p><p>"What a monstrous talent!"</p><p></p><p>The crisis in the Azure Sea Realm had been quelled so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"This young man might be able to take that step. With the Primordial Turtle Shell I gifted him, even if he encounters danger, he can use it to escape and avoid perishing prematurely."</p><p></p><p>"If he can take that step one day, I won't have misjudged him. Once he obtains that opportunity, he will surely be able to contend against it to some degree."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's eyes were full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"But can the Cang Huang World hold out until he takes that step?"</p><p></p><p>Then, the Ancient Sea Turtle fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Boom boom!</p><p></p><p>Feeling the impacts coming from the Heavenly Cave below, the Ancient Sea Turtle shifted its body slightly, stretched its head into the Heavenly Cave for a moment, then raised it back up and lay down on the opening again.</p><p></p><p>"Those unformed true spirits are still too weak, their level is too low. If some unformed true spirits with higher bloodline levels came in, eating one would allow me to recover a bit."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle looked somewhat helpless.</p><p></p><p>"This place is not bad, I'll continue hiding here. Occasionally eating some unformed true spirits, this life is manageable. I won't go out wandering aimlessly. If some fellows discover me, given my current condition, it wouldn't be easy to deal with them."</p><p></p><p>Still severely injured, with strength not even one ten-thousandth of its peak, the Ancient Sea Turtle was quite helpless.</p><p></p><p>"I hope this Xu Yan kid can bring me a pleasant surprise soon."</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle retracted its head, its shell blending with the seabed mud. In an instant, this place became a small underwater mountain. No one could discover that it was actually a giant turtle in disguise.</p><p></p><p>This was the best hiding place. The Ancient Sea Turtle decided that unless Xu Yan came to find it after absorbing the Dao rhyme of heaven and earth, it would not venture out again.</p><p></p><p>The current situation in the Divine Realm was unclear, and the Cang Huang World was at a certain critical point. If it carelessly exposed itself, it could easily invite trouble.</p><p></p><p>Because the crisis in the Azure Sea Realm was resolved so quickly, the call for help had not been sent out. The outside world did not know about the crisis the Azure Sea Realm had faced.</p><p></p><p>But some people, as if receiving a signal, began to take action.</p><p></p><p>In the Dragon Mountain Realm, on a peak beside Dragon Abyss, Wind Spirit Tiger was sitting bored in a chair, dozing off while waiting for news from Tian Seventeen.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Tian Seventeen, who had been gone for some time making certain arrangements, returned.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, the time has come," </p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen said in a deep voice after exhaling.</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger immediately perked up.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen waved his hand, and a jade platform rose from the bottom of Dragon Abyss. Some patterns were engraved on the jade platform, and it was suffused with a certain Dao rhyme.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, one could even sense a majestic aura emanating from the jade platform.</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger was startled.</p><p></p><p>That majestic aura was very familiar to it - it was tiger might, and even stronger tiger might than its own. The bloodline was also of a higher level than its own. The spirit beast that left this tiger might surpassed it in both bloodline rank and strength.</p><p></p><p>"The remnant might of the Celestial Tiger will help you activate your bloodline and break through its limitations. Lie down on the jade platform and wait for the Celestial Tiger's remnant might to stimulate your bloodline."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"This will fully activate your Celestial Tiger bloodline," Tian Seventeen said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger looked at the jade platform, then at Tian Seventeen, and said in a deep voice: "Tian Seventeen, you're being so kind, helping me activate my bloodline? There's no trick to this, is there?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen smiled, "Of course I'm not letting you work for free. As I said, it's to use your Celestial Tiger bloodline to unleash the might of the Celestial Tiger and summon a certain treasure to descend.</p><p></p><p>"What I need is that treasure, while you can gain a bloodline upgrade. We each get what we want. Of course, you can't covet that treasure, otherwise..." </p><p></p><p>At this point, Tian Seventeen stared at it with a deep gaze.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Wind Spirit Tiger immediately felt relieved. That treasure must be extraordinary, which is why Tian Seventeen was willing to help upgrade its bloodline in exchange for using it to summon the treasure's descent.</p><p></p><p>This was reasonable!</p><p></p><p>"No problem, I, Wind Spirit Tiger, am not a greedy person," the Wind Spirit Tiger said, patting its chest with a tiger paw.</p><p></p><p>"That's for the best!" Tian Seventeen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go!" The Wind Spirit Tiger couldn't wait any longer. It soared into the air and instantly descended onto the jade platform above Dragon Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As soon as it landed on the jade platform, its aura couldn't help but burst out. The tiger's might was imposing, its huge tiger body standing on the jade platform, unable to resist letting out a tiger's roar!</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen revealed a smile and raised his hand. Mist rose from Dragon Abyss, and white chains descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit Tiger, cultivate on the jade platform. When the time comes, the treasure will surely descend!" Tian Seventeen said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" came the Wind Spirit Tiger's voice.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, on the jade platform, the Wind Spirit Tiger's eyes widened. It discovered that inside the jade platform was a fist-sized brownish-red liquid, emitting an imposing aura.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, deep in its heart, it was filled with desire for this liquid!</p><p></p><p>"Celestial Tiger essence blood? And it's true spirit level Celestial Tiger essence blood!" The Wind Spirit Tiger was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This was truly a great opportunity! It lay on the jade platform, breathing in the tiger's might from the platform, constantly stimulating its own bloodline. As time passed, the Celestial Tiger essence blood inside the jade platform slowly took on the shape of a tiger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it seemed to be rising, as if about to leave the jade platform and enter its body.</p><p></p><p>"What a great opportunity! If I swallow this drop of essence blood, I can break through my bloodline limitations and even have the chance to advance to true spirit level!"</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger lay on the jade platform, constantly staring at that drop of essence blood, continuously stimulating its bloodline and tiger's might, forgetting everything outside the jade platform.</p><p></p><p>It didn't even realize that once on the jade platform, it could no longer leave, nor could it see the true scene outside the platform.</p><p></p><p>Above Dragon Abyss, the tiger's might grew stronger and stronger. The faint image of a giant tiger appeared, while those chains slowly tightened, as if pulling something down.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen silently watched. A beam of light shot across the sky, and a fist-sized spirit bird landed on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>This was a messenger spirit bird, and it was no ordinary one. Its speed was extremely fast, almost transcending the spirit beast level.</p><p></p><p>However, even if this type of spirit bird reached true spirit level, it would only be fast in speed and messaging. Its strength in other aspects was not outstanding.</p><p></p><p>It was purely a true spirit that was fast and convenient for messaging.</p><p></p><p>"It's Xu Yan again!" After reading the message, Tian Seventeen frowned slightly. The plan for the Azure Sea Realm had not succeeded because Xu Yan had intervened, eliminating all dangers.</p><p></p><p>He had even killed the avatars of Blood Kings Ju and Li, thoroughly offending the two Blood Kings of the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld failed on their own, it can't be blamed on us." Tian Seventeen smiled. The Netherworld had done what they were supposed to do. As for their failure to occupy a corner of the Azure Sea Realm, that was their own problem.</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Tian Seventeen left a message, and the spirit bird swiftly departed.</p><p></p><p>"It's about to descend. The Earth Cloud Heavenly Cave must also be prepared." Tian Seventeen looked in a certain direction, snorted coldly, and suddenly disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Outside Dragon Abyss, an Immortal Venerable frowned, his eyes showing surprise and doubt.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening in Dragon Abyss? This pressure is very strong, something's not right. What are those chains pulling?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought, the more alarmed he became.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to leave, suddenly a hand grabbed him.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" The Immortal Venerable's expression changed drastically. His aura exploded, and he used all his secret techniques at once.</p><p></p><p>However, that hand simply gripped once and annihilated him!</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"The matters of Dragon Abyss must not leak out. For the next period of time, I must stay here to oversee until the summoning is successful. As for the other tasks of Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow, they're not so important now."</p><p></p><p>His form disappeared into the clouds, silently guarding. A few days later, an Immortal Realm spirit beast came to investigate Dragon Abyss and was killed with one palm strike.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was currently at some kind of turning point, and turmoil continued.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Caves became peaceful, with few disturbances. Many of the powerful beings who originally guarded the Heavenly Caves were now free.</p><p></p><p>All signs indicated that the situation in the Divine Realm was unusual, as if at some critical point.</p><p></p><p>In the Wind River Realm, Jiang Buping entered a certain Heavenly Cave, one with unchanging energy.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping has entered the Heavenly Cave!"</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to act. Success or failure depends on this."</p><p></p><p>Several Immortal Venerables said in deep voices.</p><p></p><p>"Elders of the Cloud Top Sect, elders of the Tai Kun Jiang Clan, do you have any objections to sharing Jiang Buping's secret techniques?"</p><p></p><p>"No objections. We just need to cripple him and let us take him back to the Tai Kun Realm. If necessary, bringing back a corpse is also fine."</p><p></p><p>"Very well!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the Heavenly Cave, it had already been cleared of people. Even the large city not far from the Heavenly Cave was empty.</p><p></p><p>Powerful figures appeared at the entrance of the Heavenly Cave, each holding divine artifacts, working together to seal off the entrance.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping is about to be trapped in the Heavenly Cave. He was too careless!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not carelessness, it's overconfidence. He thinks he's invincible!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, Jiang Buping will surely die."</p><p></p><p>Some well-informed martial artists sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Should we lend Jiang Buping a hand?" Hong Er asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No need. If Jiang Buping can't overcome this obstacle, it means he doesn't have the strength to deal with Meng Chong," Hong Yi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was even more terrifying than expected. With just one person and one sword, he had directly broken through two realms, suppressed the turmoil, entered the Heavenly Cave, and killed all the Immortal Realm enemies from outside, extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings who learned of this news silently watched, awaiting the imminent world-shaking battle. Would Jiang Buping single-handedly sweep through numerous powerful beings, or would he fall here?</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 304</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures from the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Great Families gathered solemnly around the mountain gate, intimidating the other strong ones and maintaining order.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu yawned and murmured, "Xu Yan will either die or swell the face of the Qianwu Palace, but the probability of him dying is too high. </p><p></p><p>The fellows of the Qianwu Palace won't just swallow this. Even if Xu Yan wins now, he won't live long.</p><p></p><p>It's said that the Qianwu Palace is the most shameless, often resorting to underhanded tactics behind the scenes. Not only against the unaffiliated cultivators, but even against their fellow peak Xuan Sect members, they've used foul play.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu felt that Xu Yan would likely just shine briefly before falling.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if any experts from the Wanshi Alliance will come."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu poked his head out again, searching around.</p><p></p><p>For now, there's no news that Xu Yan is a genius of the Wanshi Alliance. But since he's an unaffiliated cultivator, the Wanshi Alliance should send some experts, lest the shameless Qianwu Palace break the rules.</p><p></p><p>After all, they need to guard against the Qianwu Palace's lack of integrity.</p><p></p><p>"How did they swallow their pride last time?" Cui Huayu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Given the Qianwu Palace's temperament, when Xu Yan blocked their gate last time, their experts should have stepped in to suppress him. But they didn't! Could it be that with everyone watching, it would be too shameless and damage the Qianwu Palace's reputation? "There must be some hidden reason."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Not finding any Wanshi Alliance experts, he was about to pull his head back in when he suddenly turned his head to the sky, his expression slightly startled.</p><p></p><p>"Why is she here?"</p><p></p><p>A woman with her face veiled in a light veil had quietly arrived and was standing on a large tree not far from him.</p><p></p><p>"The people of the Taixuan Sect are also joining the commotion? Even if they're joining in, it should be their disciples, not her."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was Yurong, a disciple of Xin Mengrou from the Taixuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>"She's at the peak of the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm, and she's Xin Mengrou's disciple, so she can't be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu muttered to himself, pulling his head back into the palace to wait for Xu Yan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>The time came to the appointed half-month period.</p><p></p><p>Everyone was eagerly awaiting Xu Yan's appearance.</p><p></p><p>On the Qianwu Palace gate, a group of geniuses gathered, their expressions cold and ruthless. The Qianwu Palace Master's gaze was indifferent as he also waited for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Has Xu Yan retreated?"</p><p></p><p>"It's possible. After the previous battle, even though he won, he was likely severely injured, so he set the half-month period to heal."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>The gathered cultivators, seeing that Xu Yan had not appeared, started discussing.</p><p></p><p>"You know, there's a possibility that Xu Yan said he'd come back in half a month just to mislead the Qianwu Palace, and he actually fled and is hiding now?"</p><p></p><p>"Now that you mention it, that's quite possible!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xu Yan had not shown up, many cultivators believed that he was seriously injured from the previous battle, so he couldn't heal in time. Some even thought that Xu Yan had set the half-month period to confuse the Qianwu Palace and then fled to hide.</p><p></p><p>As more people discussed this, even the Qianwu Palace itself couldn't help but become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>Their expressions turned extremely gloomy. </p><p></p><p>They had put in so much effort, using all kinds of resources and secret techniques to boost their geniuses' strength, even converging the Burning Soul Killing Intent, all just to defeat Xu Yan. But now the person had already fled?</p><p></p><p>Was he just toying with the Qianwu Palace?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's continued absence made them increasingly convinced that he had fled, their expressions growing darker and the killing intent surging, wishing they could devour Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace's elders also had extremely unsightly expressions.</p><p></p><p>The eager cultivators who had prepared to fight to the death also looked at each other in bewilderment. They had worked hard for half a month, preparing their secret techniques for a decisive battle, but now the target had run away? They felt a little relieved, not having to fight to the death, and they had also gained the identity of Qianwu Palace disciples, which was a huge opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In fact, they should be grateful to Xu Yan, as otherwise, it would not have been so easy for them to become Qianwu Palace disciples. Their strength had also increased substantially, which was a great fortune.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a figure rapidly approached from the sky.</p><p></p><p>All sounds fell silent as everyone looked over, only to be disappointed again.</p><p></p><p>It was not Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"A person from the Wanshi Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"This person is very strong, a powerful expert from the Wanshi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>Among the spectators, someone recognized the newcomer's identity.</p><p></p><p>"Seems to be Tian Ji, the Grand Protector of the Wanshi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's him. Unexpectedly, the Wanshi Alliance has sent him, but it's a pity that Xu Yan has retreated."</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji hurriedly arrived, landing on a large tree without getting too close to the Qianwu Palace. His expression was solemn and grave as he looked towards the arena, only to be startled.</p><p></p><p>Where's the person?</p><p></p><p>After learning the news, he had rushed over, fearing that the shameless Qianwu Palace would take advantage of the situation. But now, where was Xu Yan? Could it be that he had arrived too late and Xu Yan had already been killed by the Qianwu Palace's despicable actions?</p><p></p><p>"Where is Xu Yan? You shameless ones from the Qianwu Palace, how dare you violate the rules of the Genius Confrontation!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji was furious.</p><p></p><p>He slapped his hand, and the massive halberd on his back flew up, which he then gripped in his hand.</p><p></p><p>This was one of the Wanshi Alliance's divine artifacts, the Myriad Mountain Halberd!</p><p></p><p>Each strike was as heavy as a thousand mountains, with terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>"Whew! So strong!"</p><p></p><p>As Tian Ji's aura erupted, the cultivators all had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, as the Wanshi Alliance's Grand Protector, his strength was truly extraordinary, and he had even brought a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>But it seems he might have misunderstood the situation, as the Qianwu Palace hadn't even made a move, and it was just that Xu Yan had retreated.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Master and the elders were almost furious to death! Damn it, in their eyes, was the Qianwu Palace so despicable? Did they really enjoy bullying the weak?</p><p></p><p>They were burning with murderous intent, wishing they could just kill Tian Ji.</p><p></p><p>"What, are you Qianwu Palace people too cowardly to face it?" Tian Ji roared angrily.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! The Qianwu Palace's Saber Elder roared, "Tian Ji, don't talk nonsense. How esteemed is our Qianwu Palace? How could we stoop to the level of a lowly unaffiliated cultivator? It's Xu Yan who retreated and didn't come!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji was taken aback. Xu Yan retreated and didn't come? He looked at the surrounding spectators, and from their expressions, he got the answer.</p><p></p><p>His face flushed red with embarrassment.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! How awkward!</p><p></p><p>He silently put the Myriad Mountain Halberd back on his back and cleared his throat, "Young people are just unreliable, dragging things on like this, causing a misunderstanding!"</p><p></p><p>All the cultivators were speechless.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they weren't surprised by Tian Ji's reaction, as the Qianwu Palace's style did tend to easily mislead people.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Master and the others had black faces.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's mouth twitched, and he asked one of the spectators who had also observed last time about the time Xu Yan left.</p><p></p><p>The cultivator, without much thought, told Cui Huayu the time.</p><p></p><p>"Why is everyone in such a hurry? It's not even the appointed time yet!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu muttered to herself, "Is Xu Yan the type to back down? No, that's impossible. He's a punctual person, so he'll definitely show up on time."</p><p></p><p>"Looks like there won't be any excitement to witness. Xu Yan must have hidden somewhere after trampling on the Qianwu Palace," a cultivator said dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the other cultivators nodded in agreement. "The Qianwu Palace really messed up this time. Xu Yan came and trampled on them, becoming the first in the Lingyu Realm's history to do so, and then he just hid away. I bet the Qianwu Palace will have a hard time finding him now."</p><p></p><p>"The Qianwu Palace is going to become a laughingstock!" another cultivator said gleefully.</p><p></p><p>But their joy was short-lived. Mocking the Qianwu Palace right at their doorstep was akin to courting death. Suddenly, an attack thundered from the Qianwu Palace gates, instantly killing the cultivator who had been mocking them. The rest were struck with terror, daring not to utter another word or show any signs of schadenfreude.</p><p></p><p>They now realized that the Qianwu Palace was an eminent sect, and they couldn't just casually slander or mock it, even if it had been trampled by Xu Yan. The powerful cultivators from the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families glared at the remaining cultivators, their murderous auras palpable. Anyone who dared to speak disrespectfully would be met with their wrath.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators quietly retreated, knowing the show was over. The Qianwu Palace was furious, and they didn't want to become their punching bags.</p><p></p><p>"If Xu Yan does not show up by sunset, order all the sects in the Lingyu Realm to hunt him down! He has broken his word and disregarded the rules. The rules of the Genius Showdown do not apply to him. He shall be executed!" the Qianwu Palace Master said grimly before turning and leaving.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu anxiously poked her head out, worried that her guess might be wrong and Xu Yan had indeed backed down. Tian Ji felt awkward, unsure if he should leave.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cultivator exclaimed, "Look, what's that?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone followed his gaze and were stunned. In the distance, trees were rising up and transforming into towering swords, suspended in the air and radiating a chilling sword aura. A figure was stepping onto the swords, one by one, as they continued to rise from the ground.</p><p></p><p>When the figure approached the Qianwu Palace gates, the swords formed a circular formation, their blades piercing the arena around them. It was Xu Yan, the handsome and majestic young man.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators were all shocked by this extraordinary display of power. "I knew Xu Yan was a punctual person!" Cui Huayu murmured.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's grand entrance had stunned everyone. Those who had earlier claimed that he had backed down now felt their faces burning with embarrassment, pretending they had never said such things.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace Master had returned to the gates, his expression grave. Xu Yan's arrival and the display of his formidable abilities meant that the Qianwu Palace's geniuses would have to fight for their lives.</p><p></p><p>Yalang, standing on a tree, watched the young man with admiration. "Such an unparalleled young master, no wonder he has become the object of affection for two young ladies. I wonder what kind of master could have cultivated such a disciple."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood on the arena, surveying the Qianwu Palace gates. This time, he must trample all of the Qianwu Palace's geniuses underfoot.</p><p></p><p>"I've reached the Spirit Element Realm. Ordinary Refine Spirit Grand Perfection cultivators are nothing. I hope the Qianwu Palace's geniuses can put up a decent fight," Xu Yan thought.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, regardless of whether the Qianwu Palace's elders intervened, he would set out to roam the Lingyu Realm and challenge the martial artists of the world.</p><p></p><p>"Within ten years, I will break through to the Spirit Dao Realm." Xu Yan had set himself this goal. The higher the cultivation realm, the more time it would take, but he was confident he could achieve the Spirit Dao Realm in ten years.</p><p></p><p>"Once I reach the Spirit Dao Realm, I will be unrivaled in the Lingyu Realm!" Xu Yan thought excitedly, anticipating the powerful spirit techniques his master could unleash.</p><p></p><p>"I, the Sword Immortal Xu Yan, challenge the Qianwu Palace's geniuses," he declared boldly.</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Palace's Saber Elder signaled to one of their geniuses, indicating that he should step forward to fight.</p><p></p><p>"The Qianwu Palace's geniuses are not to be challenged as you please. You'll have to get past me first," the genius said as he leaped down from the palace gates and onto the arena.</p><p></p><p>"Shall we decide this by victory or by life and death?" Xu Yan asked calmly, leaving the choice to his opponent.</p><p></p><p>"By life and death!" the genius replied coldly, knowing he had no other choice.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

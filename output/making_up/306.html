        <h1>Chapter 306</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He wanted to thoroughly suppress the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>He didn't believe that this time he would still be unable to force out the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, he would travel through the Spiritual Realm, roam the four corners, comprehend the mountains and rivers, and await the final showdown between the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Even if this time he forced the strongest experts of the Thousand Martial Hall to take action, he wouldn't care.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and make your move, your lives aren't worth much in the Thousand Martial Hall anyway," Xu Yan said indifferently with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, your provocation is useless. We are able to fight today for the honor of our sect, and dying gloriously!" said one of the geniuses coldly.</p><p></p><p>"No!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and said, "Your glorious deaths are not for the sake of the Thousand Martial Hall, but because you are dying at my hands. You can become one of the stepping stones for me to reach the peak of the Spiritual Realm. That is truly a glorious death."</p><p></p><p>Damn it! The five people's faces turned green with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Here we go again, Xu Yan is as arrogant as ever!" sighed Cui Huayu.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were all speechless, they had witnessed Xu Yan's arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled indifferently and said, "The name of Sword Deity Xu Yan will one day resound through the four corners of the world, and you will be remembered as the stepping stones in my rise to power.</p><p></p><p>"To become the stepping stones of a supreme expert is something that will be recorded in the history of the martial dao, even after countless years, people will still talk about the stepping stones of the Sword Deity."</p><p></p><p>Silence! The martial artists were dumbfounded, what kind of absurd theory was this?</p><p></p><p>"He's too arrogant, doesn't Xu Yan think about whether he can even survive after leaving the Thousand Martial Hall?"</p><p></p><p>"If we're talking about who is the most arrogant in the world, I'd say Xu Yan is second to none!"</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, my heart is stirred, I wish I was born a few hundred years later!" </p><p></p><p>After their dumbfounded silence, the martial artists began to discuss in low voices.</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji was completely dumbfounded, Xu Yan was this arrogant?</p><p></p><p>"I thought the Sect Master was already very arrogant, but today I realize the Sect Master is nothing compared to Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong frowned, not knowing how to evaluate Xu Yan at the moment.</p><p></p><p>As for the five people surrounding Xu Yan, they were almost about to explode with anger.</p><p></p><p>Becoming stepping stones, and that's considered an honor?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Today, I must kill you!"</p><p></p><p>The five people's mentality was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>This arrogant fellow, just by opening his mouth he treated them as stepping stones? "Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The five people struck. Violent attacks came from all directions, trying to block any chance of Xu Yan's escape.</p><p></p><p>Sword lights surged, mountains and rivers appeared, sweeping across with Xu Yan at the center. All the attacks were shattered within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>This scene left the onlookers completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, the five attacking knew that without unleashing their life-consuming killing intent, they would not be able to inflict any harm on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>His strength was far beyond their imagination! And Xu Yan, how old was he? Much younger than them! What a prodigy? At this moment, they even doubted whether the true geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall could match Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Bloody killing intent surged in an instant, the five killing intents instantly converged towards Xu Yan, sealing off all his escape space.</p><p></p><p>The five people with their life-consuming killing intent glared wide-eyed, wanting to see how Xu Yan would be annihilated. However! In that instant, they seemed to see a mountain and river suddenly emerge, and they were within the mountain and river, while Xu Yan was outside! No! Xu Yan was the master of the mountain and river!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the life-consuming killing intent kept dissipating, the mountain and river surging, the gentle breeze, the sword lights rippling, constantly washing away the life-consuming killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battlefield trembled, a lingering wave swept in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The five people's physical bodies disintegrated, turning into ashes!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still stood there arrogantly, the wind and clouds light, his sword radiating a crisp light, the gentle breeze circling the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>The five terrifying killing intents had disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword dao is this? An illusion? A martial art?" </p><p></p><p>Someone murmured in the silence.</p><p></p><p>That sword mountain and river, what kind of technique was it? In an instant, the five geniuses who thought they had surrounded Xu Yan, turned out to be the ones trapped within the sword mountain and river?</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan was the master of the mountain and river!</p><p></p><p>The sword intent was formless, merged with the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood there arrogantly, from the beginning, the battlefield had been within his sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall's Sect Master and the group of elders had gloomy expressions, Xu Yan had exceeded their expectations time and time again.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that with the five people joining forces to assassinate him, even if they couldn't defeat Xu Yan, he should at least be injured and appear disheveled. But he was still calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>It was as if slaying five geniuses was just a casual flick of the wrist for him.</p><p></p><p>And they still hadn't seen Xu Yan's true depths, they didn't even know if he had already exerted his full strength.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, let our Thousand Martial Hall's geniuses take action," the Saber Elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall's Sect Master nodded.</p><p></p><p>He then said, "Have Wu Yuan prepare, he has mastered the Cold Cruel Saber, I don't believe this won't be able to injure Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yuan was one of the openly acknowledged geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall, he could already wield the divine artifact Cold Cruel Saber. This was the strongest genius the Thousand Martial Hall had prepared to deal with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As for the five core geniuses, the time for them to appear had not yet come, and they would not easily take action.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the Thousand Martial Hall to send someone to challenge him, Xu Yan still stood there arrogantly in midair, coldly looking at the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Where are the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall? Are they all weaklings who don't dare to fight?</p><p></p><p>"If you're afraid of dying, we can decide the outcome without risking life and death. I, Xu Yan, am not a bloodthirsty person!"</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he continued, "If you think one person can't defeat me, then send five more. After all, I, Xu Yan, am the supreme genius in the world, it's only right that I give you a chance."</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists looked towards the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The mighty Spiritual Sect, being challenged at their own mountain gate, setting up a stage for a competition. The geniuses didn't come out to fight, instead sending subordinate forces to take the test. The result was that all of them were defeated.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that even now, the Thousand Martial Hall's geniuses still wouldn't show up?</p><p></p><p>Or was it really as Xu Yan said, that the Thousand Martial Hall's geniuses were all weaklings?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, since you're so eager to seek death, then I'll oblige you!" the Saber Elder sneered.</p><p></p><p>Another five people huh?</p><p></p><p>This time the five people were the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall, not comparable to the geniuses from the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families.</p><p></p><p>Five figures stepped out from the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate, their cultivated martial arts all different - saber, fist, spear, halberd, axe. They had deliberately avoided the sword dao, obviously the Thousand Martial Hall recognized that their sword dao was inferior to Xu Yan's, and feared his mysterious sword dao.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>As the five people appeared, the martial artists couldn't help but be greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>This was the Thousand Martial Hall's geniuses?</p><p></p><p>Although it wasn't one-on-one, but a five-on-one battle...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>1. It seemed to have lost the lofty and aloof bearing of the Superb Spiritual Sect, but it had to be admitted that the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall were far stronger than the geniuses of the Seven Great Sects of the Three Kingdoms era.</p><p></p><p>The refined aura, the vast momentum, and the powerful might formed by the intertwining of the spiritual energies, all far surpassed the previous five people.</p><p></p><p>Each of them was at the peak of the Refined Spirit Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the five martial arts techniques combined seemed to make their combat power even more formidable and difficult to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are indeed very strong. Any one of us would not be your match, but to face five of us is simply courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The young man holding the sword said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The five did not disperse in four directions, but gathered together, their auras merging, their spiritual energies intertwining, as if they possessed a joint attack technique.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned as he looked at the five, feeling a little disappointed. It seemed that the Thousand Martial Hall was still hiding something, for unknown reasons, and had not sent out their true geniuses.</p><p></p><p>There had always been rumors that the geniuses of the Superb Spiritual Sect were all spiritual body cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But these five people were not spiritual body cultivators.</p><p></p><p>This meant that they were not the core geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Although there were differences in the strength of spiritual bodies, not even being a spiritual body cultivator, no matter how much of a genius they were, they were not among the top-ranked geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"It seems I need to put some pressure on the Thousand Martial Hall."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes narrowed slightly.</p><p></p><p>"The true geniuses are unrivaled within their realms, one person can easily defeat thousands, let alone you five."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>He remembered that his master had said that when one reached the same realm, they could easily defeat thousands. Although he might not be able to do that yet, pushing back a thousand people of the same realm was his current goal!</p><p></p><p>The martial artists, although already accustomed to Xu Yan's arrogance, could not help but roll their eyes at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Being unrivaled within the same realm could be understood, but pushing back thousands of people of the same realm, that was absolutely impossible! No matter how strong the geniuses were, they could not possibly fight against thousands of people of the same realm with their own power.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention thousands, even a hundred would be impossible.</p><p></p><p>That was the power of the same realm, not the pressure of realm superiority!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, even within the same realm, there were geniuses. Even if they were a little weaker, they were still geniuses, and could defeat one or a few people, but to defeat tens or hundreds was absolutely impossible, let alone pushing them back.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant fool!"</p><p></p><p>The young man with the sword sneered.</p><p></p><p>"I, Xu Yan, am not arrogant. If you think I'm arrogant, then you are the frog at the bottom of the well, ignorant of the profundity of the martial dao. Today, I will let you see what true martial dao is!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled proudly.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Spirit Element Realm, he could now manifest the Spirit Element Clones. Today, he would let these people see the wonders of the martial dao, and further put pressure on the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The crowd had become numb to this.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is truly a genius, his arrogant words one after another. I now understand, the truly arrogant are those who speak the most arrogant words in the most calm manner, like letting us see what true martial dao is, isn't that implying that the martial dao we cultivate is false?"</p><p></p><p>"Haha, you're right!"</p><p></p><p>"If I had such talent and strength, I would be even more arrogant than Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't even think about it, if you had such talent and strength, you scoundrel, you'd be the first to go serve the Spiritual Sect as a dog!"</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for death!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists whispered and discussed, even causing a small commotion.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, we are the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall, and we won't hide from you. Let you strike first!"</p><p></p><p>The young man with the sword said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Their auras merged, their spiritual energies connected, the five martial arts techniques seemingly forming a joint attack. Their offense gathered the power of the five, and their defense was also the gathering of the five.</p><p></p><p>They were confident that they could not be matched in one-on-one combat, but with their joint attack technique, it would be different!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the auras of the five, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"A joint attack technique? The martial dao of the Spiritual Realm has no formations, and they don't even know the concept of formations.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to manifest four Spirit Element Clones and form a Sword Formation, what kind of power would that be? It's a good time to try it out."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an idea.</p><p></p><p>The five geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall were using their joint attack technique against him.</p><p></p><p>Then he would use the Spirit Element Clones to form a sword formation, letting these people experience the wonders of the martial dao, the power of the sword formation, far beyond their joint attack technique.</p><p></p><p>"A joint attack technique is just a minor skill. Today, I will let the Thousand Martial Hall, who think they are superior to the Superb Spiritual Sect, experience what the formation dao is, experience the might of the sword formation.</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully, don't blink!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled cheerfully, his body shining with divine light. In an instant, four figures split off and went in four directions.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, there was originally only Xu Yan! But now, there were five Xu Yans!</p><p></p><p>Silence! The entire field was deathly quiet!</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this? Could the martial dao have such wondrous arts?</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were all shocked, their eyes wide open, disbelief written all over their faces.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>On the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall, the Thousand Martial Hall Master and the elders were horrified.</p><p></p><p>They were the pinnacle existences of the martial dao in the Spiritual Realm, and were also elders of the Superb Spiritual Sect, with ancient lineages and deep understanding of the secrets of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Yet, this scene had shocked them.</p><p></p><p>How did those four Xu Yans appear?</p><p></p><p>How could one person split into four?</p><p></p><p>The martial dao did not have such wondrous arts!</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the powerful experts of the Thousand Martial Hall had a hint of fear and wariness in their eyes, not even they knew, and there was even a trace of terror!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan must die!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master said solemnly, his killing intent palpable.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists were all dumbfounded, their eyes wide open, not blinking at all!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji's expression was grave, tightly gripping the divine artifact Myriad Mountain Halberd.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall would never allow Xu Yan, who had displayed such a wondrous martial art, to live. They would surely try every means to eliminate Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, unbelievable, this is too terrifying. If Xu Yan doesn't die, he will eventually become the supreme existence in this Spiritual Realm. We cannot offend him, absolutely cannot offend him.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Blood Demon could resurrect three times, but the even more monstrous and demonic Xu Yan, would be even harder to deal with.</p><p></p><p>"I must tell the old fellows in the Imperial Spiritual府, try their best not to provoke Xu Yan, or else it will be troublesome!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu wiped the sweat from his brow, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene of Xu Yan's duel with Lu Xingtian flashed, the young man sitting on a giant cat, sipping tea. With a wave of his hand, the great momentum of the heavens and earth descended, how grand and imposing that was.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xu Yan had revealed this wondrous martial art technique. As Xu Yan's mysterious master, how terrifying must that person be?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan dared to come to the Thousand Martial Hall and challenge them, in addition to his own monstrous strength and talent, the greater backing must be from his mysterious master!</p><p></p><p>"This... how can one person become four?"</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong was also shocked.</p><p></p><p>The inheritance of the Taiyi Sect was ancient, and their knowledge of martial dao secrets and legends even surpassed the Thousand Martial Hall. Yet, they had never heard of such a wondrous technique before.</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of person is Xu Yan's master? A supreme expert? Could it really be a supreme expert?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Ya Rong was starting to believe that Xu Yan's master was indeed a supreme expert.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

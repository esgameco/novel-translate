        <h1>Chapter 484</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>After a brief gathering with Wan Tianlin, Xu Yan prepared to continue his journey, crossing the border gate to return to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Having been away adventuring for so long, he was starting to miss his master.</p><p></p><p>"These demon races..."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao frowned deeply, looking towards various parts of the Nine Mountains Realm, especially in the direction of Lingzun Mountain. </p><p></p><p>Those spirit beasts seemed different now, with a special aura about them that he had never seen before. It must be the demonic qi of the demon races.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he looked at it, something felt off.</p><p></p><p>How did these demon races suddenly appear within the Cang Heaven and Earth? When he first heard of the demon races, he thought it was just the spirit beasts changing their name and establishing their own faction.</p><p></p><p>But what he saw now was not the case.</p><p></p><p>The demon races had already transcended the category of ordinary spirit beasts. Could the rumored demon cultivation method that ignored spirit beast bloodlines and allowed continuous cultivation like human martial artists not be fabricated after all?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Old Xiao felt restless.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he looked at it, the demon races seemed like a huge potential threat. It was very likely an influence from the Unmelting Lands, prepared to invade the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the demon races. Founded by Red Cat. I didn't expect that big cat to really make the demon races so impressive," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"You know about the demon races?" Old Xiao looked surprised. "Who is this Red Cat?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled, "Red Cat is a tiger raised by my master. You can think of it as a fat cat if you want. My junior sister fed it many pills, and it also comprehended the Great Demon Martial Way that my master passed on to it.</p><p></p><p>"Come to think of it, I'm actually the Demon Supreme."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was a very sensible tiger, a very clever big cat, and also very good at pleasing Xu Yan's mother. It was a cultured tiger - it learned to read and write from Xu Yan's mother.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao's eyes widened, his heart extremely unsettled.</p><p></p><p>It was one thing that the three prodigies Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Jiang Buping had the same master. But to think even the demon races were related to Xu Yan's master!</p><p></p><p>The founder of the demon races was actually a pet raised by Xu Yan's master?!</p><p></p><p>For some reason, Old Xiao now had a feeling that there was an invisible hand within the Cang Heaven and Earth, controlling everything and driving its changes. </p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, guiding the changes of the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>And this invisible hand seemed to be Xu Yan's master!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Old Xiao was eager to meet Xu Yan's mysterious master and see what kind of figure he really was.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see who you are, and which one is planning all this here," Old Xiao thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful Xu Yan claimed his master to be, Old Xiao was unconvinced. He didn't think Xu Yan was blatantly lying, but rather felt that Xu Yan's master was just putting on an act to deceive the young Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>In Old Xiao's view, Xu Yan was also a victim of deception! "I know all seven lords of the great realms. Even if you're a powerful figure from the Unmelting Divine Palace, you're far from having such terrifying power."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao sneered inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's master was boasting too much. Unable to bear the karmic consequences of just a name? </p><p></p><p>What a joke!</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, back to the Qinghua Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't go look for Red Cat, but headed straight back to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Crossing the border gate and stepping into the long-absent Qinghua Realm, Xu Yan's group couldn't help but marvel at how much it had changed. The spiritual energy had become more abundant, and the world's spiritual mechanisms were more active.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the entire Qinghua Realm had undergone a transformation.</p><p></p><p>The great city where the border gate was located was now protected by layers of grand formations. It had also been expanded several times over. Without permission, outsiders could not cross the border gate to enter.</p><p></p><p>Even Immortal Venerable realm experts were no exception!</p><p></p><p>"Fourth junior brother's attainments in formations have greatly improved. These grand formations can easily kill Immortal Venerable realm experts!" Xu Yan exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword God Xu Yan has returned!"</p><p></p><p>"And the Celestial God Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>"That must be the Spear Demon Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists in the great city instantly erupted in excitement.</p><p></p><p>Sword God Xu Yan, Celestial God Meng Chong, Spear Demon Jiang Buping - all were renowned figures with deep ties to the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>All were disciples of the Qinghua Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao's eyes were wide with disbelief.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Among the 36 realms of the Divine Domain, the Qinghua Realm was a frontier realm bordering the Spirit Domain. Its spiritual energy and world spiritual mechanisms were supposed to be thinner than other realms.</p><p></p><p>However, the current Qinghua Realm's abundance of spiritual energy and activity of world spiritual mechanisms surpassed the other 35 realms. Even more shocking to him was that the Qinghua Realm seemed to have broken through the Immortal realm limit!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of method is this?"</p><p></p><p>Sensing the grand formations at the border gate, Old Xiao was full of shock and doubt. This was another technique he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>"No, why does the Qinghua Realm seem to exist in an independent world?"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was shocked again.</p><p></p><p>It was as if some invisible force, no, some kind of rule power, had enveloped the Qinghua Realm, making it seem independent from the world.</p><p></p><p>The most obvious feeling was that while the other realms of the Divine Domain were in turmoil, the Qinghua Realm was perfectly stable, without the slightest sense of worldly tremors.</p><p></p><p>"This is a grand formation, set up by my fourth junior brother," Xu Yan explained.</p><p></p><p>"Grand formation?" Old Xiao was shocked and confused.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, formations. My fourth junior brother cultivates the Extraordinary Martial Way, which includes extraordinary arrays, formations, artifact refining, restrictions, and more!" Xu Yan explained as they traveled.</p><p></p><p>The more Old Xiao heard, the more shocked he became. He couldn't help but ask, "Were all these passed down by your master?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Xu Yan nodded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"What I cultivate is the pure Martial Way. Second junior brother cultivates the Physical Body Martial Way. Third junior sister cultivates the Medicine Martial Way. Fourth junior brother cultivates the Extraordinary Martial Way. Fifth junior brother cultivates the Extreme Soul Martial Way.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat the pet cultivates the Great Demon Martial Way. They were all passed down by my master.</p><p></p><p>"Each Martial Way is different, and our Martial Ways are also called the Great Wilderness Martial Ways. Of course, this name wasn't given by my master, he just sort of approved of it.</p><p></p><p>"My master's realm has already reached near the Great Dao. His every move seems ordinary and mundane, but actually contains profound Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>"If you can comprehend some of it, it would be an immense opportunity for you!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao listened with his scalp tingling. Xu Yan's master was so terrifying, passing down a different Martial Way to each disciple, and each Martial Way was incredibly powerful, worthy of being called monstrous.</p><p></p><p>His heart wavered a bit, but then he firmed his inner thoughts, "It's impossible, how could there be such a powerful expert in the world? Even that one from the Unmelting Divine Palace couldn't do this.</p><p></p><p>"But Xu Yan and Meng Chong's Martial Ways are truly mysterious. I've never heard of or seen anything like them."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao couldn't help but ask again, "How did you cultivate your sword dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword dao was truly unfathomable, beyond his martial understanding.</p><p></p><p>"Of course it was passed down by my master." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a reminiscent look as he said, "My sword dao, and the Dragon Subduing Palm, were both passed down by master. In my eyes, the sword dao practitioners of the Cang Heaven and Earth haven't even entered the gate of sword dao!"</p><p></p><p>"How..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You know?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was also considered a sword practitioner, although not a pure sword cultivator. But one of his martial arts specialties included swordsmanship.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know about the enlightened sword heart? Do you know about the sword mind realm? Do you know about sword intent?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an arrogant look on his face. Although Old Man Xiao was currently stronger than him, when it came to swordsmanship, he was far inferior.</p><p></p><p>Then, Xu Yan explained what the enlightened sword heart was, leaving Old Man Xiao stunned and feeling it was very profound.</p><p></p><p>"How can one achieve the enlightened sword heart?" </p><p></p><p>He finally couldn't help but ask.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, then said: "To understand the enlightened sword heart, the most important thing is of course to cultivate one's mental state. As long as you can reach the state of having no women in your heart, you can touch upon the enlightened sword heart."</p><p></p><p>After all, that was how he had tempered his mental state back then.</p><p></p><p>"No women in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Are you sure?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao, Old Man Xiao expressed doubt about Xu Yan's words.</p><p></p><p>This kid, he couldn't be making fun of him, could he?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a serious face: "Of course!"</p><p></p><p>Staring at Old Man Xiao, he said solemnly: "Master said, 'With no women in your heart, cultivation is like having divine assistance.' This state is profound - it is both having no women in your heart and not having no women in your heart. It's a mental state, you wouldn't understand!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was completely confused listening to this. He thought to himself, "I really don't understand!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but ask: "Your swordsmanship is so strong, does that mean you already have no women in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded affirmatively: "Of course! I have long since had no women in my heart, I have long since comprehended this mental state!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao looked again at Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao, these two extremely beautiful women, and couldn't help but retort: "You call this having no women in your heart?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at him with disdain, "Your comprehension is too poor, you are destined to never enter the door of swordsmanship!"</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension is poor?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao scratched his beard a bit, and said angrily: "Then explain, if you have no women in your heart, what's going on here?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and said: "You are truly foolish. Having no women in your heart doesn't mean having no women by your side!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was dumbfounded. Could it be interpreted like this?</p><p></p><p>"It's a mental state. You are unable to comprehend this profound mental state. But for you to have cultivated to this level of strength is already quite remarkable!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao felt completely deflated!...</p><p></p><p>"The disciples are coming back."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a smile on his face. His disciples were returning, and they were all about to break through to the next realm.</p><p></p><p>This meant he could pass on martial arts techniques beyond the Establishing the Way realm.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through beyond the Establishing the Way realm will truly give them a solid foundation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky, his gaze penetrating heaven and earth, landing on that chaotic, unformed region beyond the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Although the experts of the Unformed Divine Palace are certainly powerful, once I advance beyond the Establishing the Way realm, I should be able to surpass them."</p><p></p><p>According to his assessment, beyond the Establishing the Way realm, his strength would certainly surpass Tai Cang.</p><p></p><p>Although Tai Cang was dead, the Tai Cang world still existed. From this, it could be inferred that even if the other party was stronger than Tai Cang, the difference was limited. Or perhaps Tai Cang had used some method to severely injure the other party.</p><p></p><p>"A Realm Lord, that's quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat leisurely in his chair, waiting for his disciples to return, as well as Old Man Xiao, this Realm Lord level expert.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, subduing a Realm Lord would be effortless.</p><p></p><p>"No need to use the Dao Ancestor Halo, let's try the Heavenly Dao Seal. Let you experience what the Heavenly Dao truly is!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was attending to him by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm back!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said respectfully and joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping followed Xu Yan in greeting their master.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, his smile gentle.</p><p></p><p>Except for Xie Tianheng and Xie Lingfeng, father and son, all the other old acquaintances had arrived.</p><p></p><p>Including Xin Mengrou, who was relatively less familiar.</p><p></p><p>That fellow Wu Tiannan, his luck was indeed unusual, but Li Xuan didn't say anything. That unusual luck was related to Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao bowed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and Xin Mengrou also bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother... Fifth Junior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu came running over.</p><p></p><p>"Third Junior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Following that, Fang Hao also hurried over.</p><p></p><p>The senior and junior disciples reunited joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun also rushed over, directly hanging onto Meng Chong, extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>The courtyard was filled with the joy of reunion after a long separation. At this moment, Old Man Xiao was staring at Li Xuan, looking him over again and again, his brow gradually furrowing, filled with doubt and suspicion.</p><p></p><p>This person looked completely ordinary, just like a common person, without any aura of a powerful expert. He sat there leisurely and at ease, with a stunningly beautiful Sea Spirit Clan woman attending to him by his side.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Old Man Xiao was even more suspicious.</p><p></p><p>The master of Xu Yan and the others could not possibly be an ordinary person. He must be extremely powerful, likely not weaker than himself.</p><p></p><p>Yet with his strength, he couldn't see through this person at all. This meant that this person's strength was very likely even greater than his own!</p><p></p><p>What shocked Old Man Xiao even more was that he didn't recognize this person! There wasn't a single powerful expert in the Tai Cang world that he didn't know, not one that he hadn't seen before!</p><p></p><p>But this person was completely unfamiliar!</p><p></p><p>If he had come from outside this world, how could he have entered the Tai Cang world without a sound?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Tai Cang world had no reaction at all? All these signs were unusual!</p><p></p><p>He couldn't see through him, not even a little bit!</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Old Man Xiao's expression became solemn. He stepped forward, gradually revealing his aura.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others instantly looked over, the courtyard becoming tense.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xiao Yao. May I ask, sir..."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao began speaking seriously.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's smile didn't diminish. He twirled a jade ruyi scepter in his hand, saying, "Young man, don't be so impetuous. Calm and composed, not startled, not angered, not disturbed by external things - this is the cultivation that a successful martial artist should have..."</p><p></p><p>His tone was calm, with a hint of lecturing a child.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's face immediately darkened, the aura around him growing even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I, Old Man Xiao, am no longer a young man. For you to speak like this..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish, a hand landed on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>It just lightly patted his shoulder twice.</p><p></p><p>"Little one, be calm and composed. Don't be impetuous. Although you've made yourself look like an old man, it doesn't mean your age is great. This entire world is but a newborn infant in my eyes, let alone you?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's heart was struck by huge waves of shock!</p><p></p><p>He hadn't sensed at all how that hand had come to pat him. Even more terrifying was that the aura he had built up dissipated like smoke the instant the hand touched his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a vast, unfathomable, incomprehensible majestic aura gently fell upon him, seemingly falling on his very soul.</p><p></p><p>It fell gently, but to him, it felt like an ant facing the majestic might of heaven!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

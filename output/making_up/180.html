        <h1>Chapter 180</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Even someone as powerful as Bai Yunkong had only caught a fleeting glimpse of the elderly man. </p><p></p><p>According to the current information, the master of the Hidden Pavilion has always appeared to be extremely old. Those who know him secretly call him "the immortal". "The master of the Hidden Pavilion cannot be underestimated. With your current strength, you may not be his match," Bai Yunkon said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big problem. Even if I'm not his match now, he won't be able to kill me. In less than a month, I'll be able to kill him," Xu Yan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkon's mouth twitched. In less than a month, he could kill the master of the Hidden Pavilion? Wouldn't that mean he could also kill Bai Yunkon in a month? Where did he get such confidence?</p><p></p><p>However, Bai Yunkon did not feel that Xu Yan was arrogant, as the facts had proven that Xu Yan was never arrogant - everything he said was true.</p><p></p><p>The more this was the case, the more uncomfortable Bai Yunkon felt. He felt that half a lifetime of his cultivation might have been in vain. Looking at Xu Yan, his strength increased as easily as eating and drinking.</p><p></p><p>The first time he came to the Seven Star Academy, he passed the Arena Stage, but his strength was still not enough to defeat an entry-level Grand Master. Yet, in just a few days, he had directly defeated a Grand Master. </p><p></p><p>It had not been long since then, and he had already killed several peak Grand Masters. In another month, he would not even be Xu Yan's match!</p><p></p><p>He was truly a prodigy! "White Pavilion Master, do you know what the Hidden Pavilion's purpose is?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Pavilion was going to great lengths to capture his shijie (sworn sister). Was it because of a deep grudge? Was it related to his shijie's origins?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. The Hidden Pavilion has always been mysterious, and this is the first time they have acted so openly," Bai Yunkon shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a falcon descended. Bai Yunkon took the envelope and said, "Disciple Leng Qiu of the Sword Saint Cliff is anxiously waiting for you outside the academy. Do you want to go see him?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled. If there was no urgent matter, he would not be so anxious to see him. So he stood up and said, "Then I'll take my leave first. Find an opportunity to go to Canglan Island and wait for me."</p><p></p><p>"Okay," Bai Yunkon nodded.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Seven Star Academy, Xu Yan met Leng Qiu. After Xu Yan had guided him last time, Leng Qiu's sword dao had made a huge breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Why are you in such a hurry to find me?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Leng Qiu handed him a letter, saying, "This is a letter that Shixiong (senior martial brother) Xie asked me to deliver to you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened the letter and his expression immediately turned cold. The Great Yue Kingdom was truly arrogant, and although the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion had not taken any action, they were waiting for the right moment, seemingly waiting for the Long Qing Pavilion to call for help.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you," Xu Yan clasped his hands.</p><p></p><p>He must return to Iron Mountain County to deal with the impending crisis. Since the Heavenly Robe Guard from the Great Yue Kingdom had already arrived, the other forces would gradually become aware of the location of the Long Qing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Robe Guard had been annihilated, but the Great Yue Kingdom would not give up so easily. As one of the three great powers of the Inner Realm, its foundation and strength were extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan went to the Depository to find Meng Chong, and the two of them immediately set out to return to Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Imperial Study of the Great Yue Kingdom's capital, the Great Yue Emperor's expression was gloomy. The Heavenly Robe Guard he had sent out had all been wiped out without a single survivor, except for the one Grand Master killed by Hu Hai of the Sword Saint Cliff. The other martial artists had all been slaughtered by the experts in the Long Qing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Saint Cliff!" The Great Yue Emperor's gaze was ominous.</p><p></p><p>"Do they really think they can easily bully the Great Yue Kingdom?" Although the Sword Saint Cliff was extremely powerful, the Great Yue Kingdom was not weak either. Moreover, the Sword Saint Cliff would have to contend with many other forces, and they would not rashly go to war with the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order to the four Princely Dukes - Pang, Zheng, Hong, and Ma - to join forces to obstruct the experts from the Sword Saint Cliff from going to Lan Ping Prefecture, in order to demonstrate the attitude of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order to the Heavenly Robe Guard and Heavenly Guard Commanders to immediately proceed to Lan Ping Prefecture and await orders.</p><p></p><p>"Issue an order to the Divine Spear Army to go to Lan Ping Prefecture and blockade Iron Mountain County."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor angrily issued the orders.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Robe Guard and Heavenly Guard were the two major imperial guards of the royal family, and their strength was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>As for the Divine Spear Army, it was the army that guarded the Great Yue Kingdom. The minimum cultivation requirement to enter the Divine Spear Army was Fifth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Great Yue Kingdom was shaken, and many officials were shocked. Why had the Great Yue Emperor suddenly mobilized the Divine Spear Army, and why were the Heavenly Robe Guard and Heavenly Guard also being deployed?</p><p></p><p>Four out of the five Princely Dukes were mobilizing to demonstrate their stance towards the Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The news then spread that the Long Qing Pavilion was in Iron Mountain County of Lan Ping Prefecture, and the first attempt by the Heavenly Robe Guard to recruit the Long Qing Pavilion had failed.</p><p></p><p>The major families of the Great Yue Kingdom began to mobilize their experts to participate in this operation. The Great Yue Emperor had allowed it. Recruiting the Long Qing Pavilion meant something - if successful, the strength of the Great Yue Kingdom would undoubtedly soar. It would only take a few decades to a hundred years to possess the power to unify the other two kingdoms and the entire Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>When the elite forces of the Great Yue Kingdom were mobilized, the Great Yue Emperor personally came to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Will your pavilion intervene this time?" the Great Yue Emperor asked directly.</p><p></p><p>The expert from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion smiled slightly and said, "Our Heavenly Treasure Pavilion only does business, and does not interfere in the power struggles of the Inner Realm, just as we did not interfere with the establishment and collapse of dynasties."</p><p></p><p>"Are you really not going to intervene?" the Great Yue Emperor stared at him.</p><p></p><p>The importance of the Essence Qi Elixir was self-evident. How could the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion truly have no desire to get involved?</p><p></p><p>"Our Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has principles. Unless the other party joins our Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and becomes one of us, we will not take action. The Great Yue Emperor can rest assured," the expert from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion continued to smile.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor stared at him intently. The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's meaning was very clear - if the Long Qing Pavilion could not hold out and sought aid, joining the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, then it would become one of their members. If the Great Yue Kingdom continued to take action, it would be against the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, and the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion would certainly respond.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if the Long Qing Pavilion never sought aid and did not join the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, then the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion would not intervene.</p><p></p><p>However, since the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion had said so, they must be confident that the Long Qing Pavilion would ultimately seek aid and join the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has taken too much. The Essence Qi Elixir is not something that can be monopolized by a single party, not even the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion," the Great Yue Emperor stood up and left.</p><p></p><p>He knew that in this battle for the Essence Qi Elixir, the Great Yue Kingdom alone could not contend with the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. Only by uniting the major powers could they balance the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>They could no longer allow the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to monopolize the Essence Qi Elixir.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the top powers of the Inner Realm, under the coordination of the Great Yue Kingdom, joined this operation.</p><p></p><p>This was an unspoken agreement - they could not let the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion continue to enjoy the benefits of the Essence Qi Elixir alone!</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy still had no intention of getting involved in the conflict, maintaining its neutrality and the principle of teaching the martial dao, without interfering in the power struggles of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The situation is turbulent," Bai Yunkon sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, can Xu Yan withstand it?" Fu Yunian asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but he won't die. In a month, when he is able to kill the master of the Hidden Pavilion, the royal family of the Great Yue Kingdom will be in danger.</p><p></p><p>"All the forces that have taken action will be in danger," Bai Yunkon shook his head, but he was certain that Xu Yan would not die, even if the Long Qing Pavilion might suffer heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>While Xu Yan is still alive, any force that dares to make a move will be killed.</p><p></p><p>"Will the Sword Sovereign Cliff make a move?" </p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Tianheng has closed his door, and Xie Lingfeng is still young, so he can't make the decision. But haven't they already made a move? They've blocked many powerful experts."</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"I do admire the Sword Sovereign Cliff, they won't seize the opportunity to divide the benefits."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yuntian sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Sovereign Cliff already knew about the Essence Qi Elixir, but they didn't have any other intentions.</p><p></p><p>Aside from Xie Lingfeng and Xu Yan's close relationship, the people of the Sword Sovereign Cliff are much more noble than the others.</p><p></p><p>"Those who cultivate the Sword Dao, especially under Xie Tianheng's control in the Sword Sovereign Cliff, are inherently proud. They won't do something like seizing others' treasures," Bai Yunkong smiled.</p><p></p><p>Hidden Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Seven peak Grand Masters gathered on the top floor.</p><p></p><p>"Master, we've found the person!" </p><p></p><p>The Hidden Pavilion Master's eyes gleamed, and he became excited, "Where is she?"</p><p></p><p>"In the Great Yue Kingdom, in Tieshan County of Lanping Prefecture, in the Changqing Pavilion, which seems to be the one she founded, and the Essence Qi Elixir was also researched by her."</p><p></p><p>A peak Grand Master respectfully reported.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good, she is truly extraordinary with the Spiritual Domain bloodline!" </p><p></p><p>The Hidden Pavilion Master exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, many forces in the Great Yue Kingdom are gathering in Lanping Prefecture, preparing to divide the Changqing Pavilion and control the Essence Qi Elixir, to prevent the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion from monopolizing it."</p><p></p><p>The Hidden Pavilion Master stood up and said, "Follow me to Tieshan County, Suling Xiu cannot fall into others' hands, she belongs to my Hidden Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>As he walked out, he ordered, "Tell the Withered Demon Sovereign that we've found the person, if he wants to enter the Spiritual Domain, let's join forces."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>A peak Grand Master respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>The mountain peak where the Hidden Pavilion was located opened a portal, and eight figures walked out.</p><p></p><p>The aged Hidden Pavilion Master, after surveying the surroundings, took to the air, leading the seven peak Grand Masters towards Lanping Prefecture's Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a falcon flew out from the Hidden Pavilion, heading towards a certain place.</p><p></p><p>In a misty and miasmic ravine, a withered-looking man was sitting cross-legged on a large boulder. </p><p></p><p>Around him were numerous corpses, both human and beast, all dried and shriveled.</p><p></p><p>Everything around - every plant and tree - was withered.</p><p></p><p>A green poisonous toad hopped over, but as soon as it approached the boulder, it instantly shriveled up and became a dried dead toad.</p><p></p><p>A falcon descended from the sky, but before it could get close, it fell down with a thud, turning into a dried dead bird.</p><p></p><p>The withered, mummy-like man on the boulder opened his eyes, reached out, and took the letter attached to the falcon's leg.</p><p></p><p>"Lanping Prefecture, Tieshan County?" </p><p></p><p>The Withered Demon Sovereign's eyes gleamed with excitement, and his figure soared into the sky, heading towards Lanping Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Yue Kingdom, the winds were stirring, and the gazes of many martial artists converged on Lanping Prefecture, on the desolate Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Spear Army arrived in force, sealing off the roads leading to Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>They also sealed off anyone trying to leave Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>In the Lanping Prefecture City Lord's Mansion, a middle-aged man in a purple robe with three long beard strands and a resolute appearance sat high on the main seat.</p><p></p><p>"Our Great Yue Kingdom has joined forces with all of you, in order to prevent the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion from monopolizing the Essence Qi Elixir. Otherwise, in the future, we will have to go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to purchase the Essence Qi Elixir, and the supply may not even be guaranteed.</p><p></p><p>"The Changqing Pavilion is within our Great Yue Kingdom's borders, so it belongs to us. But I hope to share the Essence Qi Elixir with all the participants, we just need to work out a distribution plan."</p><p></p><p>The man in the purple robe said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Prince Ziyi, please speak plainly."</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Prince Ziyi, a renowned prince of the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family, was a peak Grand Master of immense strength, and also the supreme commander of the Divine Guard.</p><p></p><p>To seize the Changqing Pavilion's Essence Qi Elixir, the Great Yue Kingdom has mobilized the elite Divine Guard and Divine Spear Army, whose strength surpasses any single force present.</p><p></p><p>But to counter the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and not let them monopolize it, they have joined forces with the other major powers.</p><p></p><p>"Our Great Yue Kingdom will take 50% of the share, and the remaining 50% will be divided equally among you all."</p><p></p><p>Prince Ziyi said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from the various forces fell silent for a while, but eventually nodded, seeming to accept this distribution plan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the final distribution would only be determined after they controlled the Changqing Pavilion and obtained the formula for refining the Essence Qi Elixir.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, a formidable power, also existed in this.</p><p></p><p>"Then follow me to seize control of the Changqing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>Prince Ziyi stood up.</p><p></p><p>The experts gathered here were all Grand Masters, with several peak Grand Masters among them.</p><p></p><p>But this was just the openly displayed power. </p><p></p><p>No force dared to underestimate the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, otherwise the Great Yue Kingdom would not have chosen to share and join forces.</p><p></p><p>It's better for everyone to have a share than for the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion to monopolize it!</p><p></p><p>Tieshan County, a desolate and obscure place in the Great Yue Kingdom, suddenly became renowned throughout the kingdom, and then spread to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion was located in Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>And the Essence Qi Elixir was researched and developed by the Changqing Pavilion! With the mobilization of the Great Yue Kingdom's Divine Guard and Divine Spear Army, sealing off Tieshan County, the gaze of the martial arts world converged here.</p><p></p><p>Top forces and powerful experts from various factions rushed over, wanting to get a share, including the Yan Kingdom and the Purple Cloud Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>However, most external forces were blocked by the Sword Sovereign Cliff. </p><p></p><p>The might of the Sword Sovereign Cliff made even the experts from the Yan Kingdom and Purple Cloud Kingdom retreat.</p><p></p><p>But not all experts could be stopped.</p><p></p><p>The forces that took action were all peak Grand Masters. In this moment, peak Grand Masters gathered in Lanping Prefecture of the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Martial Lords, even Grand Masters at the Perfection stage could only tuck their tails and behave, daring not to act recklessly.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect there to be so many peak Grand Masters in the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>"Whew, this is the first time in a millennium that so many peak Grand Masters have gathered, even if the Changqing Pavilion is destroyed, it will be a legend!"</p><p></p><p>"Not just in the past millennium, since the collapse of the dynasties, this is the first time so many peak Grand Masters have gathered for a single event!"</p><p></p><p>"The Essence Qi Elixir is truly miraculous, no wonder all these peak Grand Masters have shown up. I heard that even the two peak Grand Masters rumored to have perished on Mount Yichuan have appeared."</p><p></p><p>"Just for the Essence Qi Elixir, why is there such a commotion?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. If there is the Essence Qi Elixir, is there perhaps an even more miraculous cultivation resource suitable for Grand Masters? Moreover, such a precious cultivation resource cannot continue to be monopolized by the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>A martial artist said with a look of enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion has infiltrated various aspects of the martial arts world. Although they don't interfere in the internal conflicts of the inner domain, all the major forces have a thorn in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>And the Essence Qi Elixir, such a precious cultivation resource, if it continues to be monopolized by the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, then the inner domain will truly be under the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's control.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Great Yue Kingdom has contacted the various forces, and they have formed a tacit alliance. As for the distribution plan, they can negotiate again after seizing the Changqing Pavilion, based on each side's strength.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Filled with rage, he thought that after the people returned, he must severely punish them, otherwise where would his authority be? But he was completely unaware that Jiao Ming and Ping'er had already died.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>One of the eighteen states of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Kingdom was the largest dynasty in Yuzhou, and although it was not the strongest, the Zheng royal family was the guardian of the gate to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Due to this special task, the Zheng Kingdom did not belong to any Spiritual Sect, but was directly governed by several supreme Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that although the Zheng Kingdom was not the strongest in Yuzhou, no force or Spiritual Sect dared to overthrow the Zheng Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Zheng royal family was also very sensible, as long as they did not violate the principles, they would agree to the demands of the Spiritual Sect forces.</p><p></p><p>And they acted low-key, as if they only cared about the task of guarding the gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>They only listened to the tasks assigned by the several supreme Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Of course, apart from the several supreme Spiritual Sects, no other Spiritual Sects dared to assign tasks to the Zheng royal family, as this was the exclusive power of the supreme Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Any force that dared to do so would be equivalent to offending the dignity of the supreme Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>They would be waiting to be destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The opening of the gate of the Spiritual Realm did not attract much attention in the Zheng Kingdom, as half of the martial arts world in Yuzhou was attracted by a treasure land.</p><p></p><p>The rumor was that it was the tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon!</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon, the strongest of the Spiritual Beast clan, was once renowned, but no one knew where it died.</p><p></p><p>Recently, it was rumored that the tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon was within the borders of the Zheng Kingdom, and a third-grade spiritual plant, the Azure Flood Dragon Tree, was growing in the tomb, and it was even rumored that there was a second-grade spiritual fruit, the Dragon's Eye Fruit, in the tomb.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the forces turned their attention to the tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, wanting to obtain the treasures within.</p><p></p><p>After a series of disputes, under the coordination of the Zheng royal family, the various parties reached an agreement, allowing only the younger generation of martial artists to enter the tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>The age was limited, but not the strength.</p><p></p><p>Although, in name, there was no restriction on the entry of low-level forces' martial artists, the low-level martial artists simply did not have the strength to enter, and if they did, they would be eliminated immediately.</p><p></p><p>This was almost a consensus in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whenever such a major event occurred, many low-level forces' martial artists would tacitly not participate.</p><p></p><p>Because once they entered, they would be targeted and eliminated by the martial artists of the high-level Spiritual Sect forces, and would not be given the opportunity to compete for the treasures.</p><p></p><p>Around the tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, there was a layer of poisonous miasma, and it was not yet time to enter. The young talents of the major forces in the Zheng Kingdom were all eager to display their might and make a name for themselves in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Some even went so far as to find low-level martial artists to use as cannon fodder to pave the way.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family of the Zheng Kingdom, although only a second-rate family, had a granddaughter, Dai Yingying, who had extraordinary talent and was born with a precious physique, making the Dai family quite renowned.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Dai Yingying was betrothed to the second prince of the Zheng royal family, and this marriage alliance with the royal family had allowed the Dai family to establish a weak connection with the supreme Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>Even so, the Dai family was still extremely honored, and their eyes were raised a little higher, after all, they had a slight connection with the supreme Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>The other second-rate families and second-rate Spiritual Sects were all envious, and greeted them with smiling faces whenever they met.</p><p></p><p>Although the Dai family currently did not seem to have any connection with the supreme Spiritual Sects, who knows, maybe one day when the opportunity came, they would truly be connected to the supreme Spiritual Sects? The affairs of this world are always full of surprises.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes, when the opportunity comes, it cannot be blocked.</p><p></p><p>There were once third-rate families or Spiritual Sects that, when the opportunity came, managed to climb up to the top Spiritual Sects, and then soar to new heights, dominating a region.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying had high talent and was the fianc√©e of the second prince of the Zheng Kingdom, so the whole family pampered and spoiled her, naturally cultivating her arrogant personality.</p><p></p><p>Especially towards the low-level martial artists, she was extremely aloof and contemptuous.</p><p></p><p>She also participated in the exploration of the tomb of the Azure Sky Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was looking for low-level martial artists to use as cannon fodder, causing an uproar, and there were even rumors that an enlightened Transcendent was furiously willing to sacrifice himself to defend the dignity of the lower-level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>After the rumors came out, the Dai family hurriedly sent an elder of the Celestial Race to protect Dai Yingying, and also paid spirit crystals to recruit the lower-level martial artists, gradually calming the situation.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the strong experts of the Dai family were still searching for that enlightened Transcendent, and could only be at ease after killing him, after all, a mere muddy-footed person dared to threaten a noble family, he was just asking to die!</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying was very angry. She heard that the gate of the Spiritual Realm had opened, so she thought of going to capture the inferior people from the inner domain to use as cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of it, Dai Yingying immediately set out for the gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Xu Yan was cultivating and comprehending the cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>To Li Xuan's surprise, Xu Yan had not yet comprehended the technique of concealing his aura and presence, but had already comprehended the martial dao technique of the Spirit Element Realm, which was unexpected and delightful.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the martial dao technique you compiled for the Spirit Element Realm, you can break through to the Spirit Element Realm."</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual platform, the Great Dao Golden Book opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan felt as if his entire being was undergoing a transformation.</p><p></p><p>He narrowed his eyes and carefully contemplated the profundities of the Spirit Element Realm. With a thought, he divided a portion of his Spirit Element and transformed it into a Spirit Element Avatar.</p><p></p><p>A figure identical to him walked out of his body and disappeared from the spot without attracting anyone's attention.</p><p></p><p>On the Cangjiang River, the Spirit Element Avatar strolled along.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Spirit Element Avatar, truly profound. If I explore some dangerous places, I don't even need to enter with my true body, so even if there is danger, it won't threaten my true body."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly excited.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao technique he had compiled for the Spirit Element Realm was profoundly mysterious, far surpassing the Taihuang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Element Avatar was connected to the true body within a certain range, and Li Xuan, though sitting on a chair on Canglan Island, had his spiritual awareness linked to the Spirit Element Avatar.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Element Avatar continued to walk further and further away from Canglan Island, and Li Xuan wanted to test how far the Spirit Element Avatar could go before losing the connection with the true body.</p><p></p><p>Once the connection with the true body was lost, the Spirit Element Avatar would only have the abilities and combat instincts bestowed by the true body, without any independent consciousness and thought.</p><p></p><p>It would appear more rigid and inflexible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, after breaking through to the Spiritual Enlightenment Realm and refining the Primordial Spirit, the Spirit Element Avatar would no longer be so rigid after infusing a wisp of the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty miles."</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Element Avatar went about twenty miles away, and Li Xuan felt that the things seen by the Spirit Element Avatar were gradually becoming blurred in his consciousness, reaching the limit.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the Spirit Element Avatar vanished from the spot and instantly returned to his body as a wisp of Spirit Element.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty miles is enough."</p><p></p><p>He had just entered the Spirit Element Realm, and as his strength increased, the distance would become even greater.</p><p></p><p>"If I were to infuse the Thousand Martial Shadows into the Spirit Element Avatar, how would it be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly had an idea.</p><p></p><p>A figure emerged and merged with the Spirit Element Avatar.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Within the divine shadow, Li Xuan discovered a change at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The divine shadow of the Thousand Martial Arts did not seem to have changed much, still as illusory as a shadow, but after merging with the divine incarnation, its strength had clearly become stronger.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it also possessed some divine realm power.</p><p></p><p>"The more divine shadows I have, the more divine incarnations I can separate, which means my incarnations will be more and more numerous and powerful. And if I explore dangerous lands, the divine shadow and divine incarnation can merge. If I encounter danger, I can sacrifice the divine shadow to protect the incarnation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited, discovering the powerful aspect of the Thousand Martial Arts divine shadow merging with the divine incarnation.</p><p></p><p>"I've reached the divine realm, with my current strength, I'm not afraid of the Refining Divine Celestials either!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immediately felt a great sense of security.</p><p></p><p>Even if Refining Divine Celestials were to attack, he would not be worried, for the divine realm power was even stronger than he had estimated.</p><p></p><p>With the divine realm power, combined with the Annihilation Sword Dao and the Xun Wind Sword Intent, killing the Refining Divine Celestials would not be too difficult, right? Li Xuan looked up at the peak of Canglan Island, where Xu Yan was still cultivating and comprehending the Dao. He was hoping that Xu Yan could also comprehend the divine technique realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he broke through to the divine technique realm, not only would he be invincible in the spiritual domain, but even killing the Refining Divine Celestials would be as easy as a snap of the fingers.</p><p></p><p>With the divine technique, who could stop him?</p><p></p><p>"The divine technique realm is still beyond my reach for now, unless I break through the divine will realm, then there might be a chance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head inwardly, even though Xu Yan was prodigious, it was impossible for him to comprehend the divine technique Dao while still at the Profound Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>The divine technique realm was ultimately too profound and abstruse.</p><p></p><p>Being able to comprehend the divine realm cultivation method without breaking through the divine will realm was already extremely prodigious.</p><p></p><p>"The Concealment Dao, I still haven't comprehended it yet. Should I pass this Concealment Dao to Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Let's wait a bit longer, this Concealment Dao is still somewhat lacking."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to wait a little longer.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan was able to comprehend the divine realm martial Dao, he should also be able to comprehend the Concealment Dao soon.</p><p></p><p>That day, Li Xuan was looking at the second page of the Taicangshu, constantly studying and trying to memorize the patterns of the heavenly and earthly principles on it.</p><p></p><p>"Where did the Red Cat go?"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly remembered that the Red Cat had been unusually quiet these days, when it usually helped train Stone Two in the name of "for your own good".</p><p></p><p>Tormenting Stone Two, asking Suling Xiu for medicinal pills, going to Xu's mother to act cute, and then coming to him to act cute.</p><p></p><p>Spreading his divine sense, he was somewhat surprised to see the Red Cat staring at a one-third complete formation diagram, seemingly pondering something.</p><p></p><p>Its little paws were still holding a pen, and Xu's mother was teaching it to write and read! It wanted to become a cultural cat - no, a cultural tiger!</p><p></p><p>"If you can truly comprehend something, that would be a pleasant surprise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled wryly, it was definitely Stone Two who had tricked the Red Cat with the formation diagram, as he was tired of being tormented.</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother was happily teaching the Red Cat to read, while curiously looking at the incomplete formation diagram and asked, "Red Cat, have you comprehended anything?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat shook its head, holding the pen with its little paws and scribbling on the paper, "I don't know enough characters yet, so I can't comprehend the true meaning."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled, seeing the Red Cat, now cat-sized, holding a pen and writing was quite adorable and endearing.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu's mother was delighted, patting the Red Cat's chubby head while popping medicinal pills into its mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat ate them happily.</p><p></p><p>Since the Red Cat was interested in the formation diagram, Li Xuan had an idea. Perhaps the Red Cat could truly gain some insights and further develop the great demon martial Dao?</p><p></p><p>So he drew out the complete formation diagram.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, this is the complete formation diagram. You must ponder it carefully. As a great demon, if you can comprehend its subtleties and incorporate them into yourself, you will gain another transformation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan handed the formation diagram to the Red Cat, patting its head.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat looked at the formation diagram, its head getting bigger and bigger, but since the master had instructed it, it couldn't not study it. It felt like it might have been tricked by Stone Two.</p><p></p><p>Holding the formation diagram, it left, continuing to learn characters and scripts, while occasionally taking the time to refine Stone Two's martial Dao!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, sipping spiritual tea and studying the heavenly and earthly principle patterns on the second page of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>The patterns on the second page were more difficult to remember and more profound, clearly involving deeper levels of heavenly and earthly principles.</p><p></p><p>"The formation diagram has been passed out for some time, yet no one has shown any comprehension of it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Finding disciples who cultivate the Esoteric Martial Dao would be difficult in the short term.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual platform, the Golden Book of the Dao opened, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Merge with the World technique from the Concealment Dao you compiled. Your Merge with the World technique has reached mastery!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>Merge with the World! Li Xuan revealed a smile, his great disciple would never disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>Even for an extremely difficult cultivation method, he could still comprehend it! Looking up, Xu Yan on the mountain peak had changed.</p><p></p><p>If not for his mastery of the Merge with the World technique, Li Xuan might have overlooked him at a glance, as if he were just a rock.</p><p></p><p>The divine sense spread out, and Li Xuan smiled, Xu Yan sitting there seemed to be one with the plants, trees, and stones, his aura indistinguishable from them.</p><p></p><p>His aura was united with the plants and stones. This was the Merge with the World technique!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan retracted his divine sense, still smiling, and continued to delve into the heavenly and earthly principles in his Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, it's time to go to the Spiritual Domain!</p><p></p><p>With the Merge with the World technique, even if he provoked a powerful force and was pursued, he could easily evade them.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Concealment Dao is too profound and abstruse, I can't find the clue to comprehend it. What should I do?"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's hair was disheveled as she gripped Li Xuan's shoulders, her face full of distress.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled, Suling Xiu's talent was not in this area, so it was understandable that she could not comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Even if Meng Chong were to comprehend it, he would probably take a very long time, and the Concealment Dao he comprehended would likely be weaker than Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>"This Concealment Dao, you can try to comprehend it. It's a relatively ordinary technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and passed the Concealment Dao he had compiled to Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>This Concealment Dao was not actually that difficult to comprehend, and with Suling Xiu's talent, she soon grasped it.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suling Xiu has comprehended the Concealment Dao you compiled, and your Concealment Dao has reached mastery."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu's aura was concealed, and she looked ordinary, even her temperament had become more common, not drawing any attention.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've learned it!" </p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu squinted her eyes and hurriedly left, saying, "I'll go try it on my senior brother, see if he can detect my presence."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, since Xu Yan had comprehended the Merge with the World technique, Suling Xiu and Meng Chong no longer needed to continue comprehending it.</p><p></p><p>After all, even if they comprehended it, it would still be inferior to Xu Yan's. Why waste time and effort on it?</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

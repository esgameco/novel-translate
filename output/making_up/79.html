        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 79: Xu Yan's Breakthrough, Meng Chong's Entry into the Martial Dao</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, his expression solemn, and said, "My disciple, your sword heart is clear, but that is only the foundation of the sword dao. You still have a long way to go, for the sword dao is endless, so do not be impatient!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression became serious, and he took a deep breath, respectfully saying, "Yes, Master. I will certainly calm my mind and steadfastly advance on the path of the sword dao."</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Li Xuan nodded with a look of contentment. "Now that your sword heart is clear and you have entered the door of the sword dao, I shall point out the direction of the sword dao for you today."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened attentively, his heart filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"After the sword heart, the second realm of the sword dao is the Heart Sword realm. 'My heart has a sword, and all things in heaven and earth can be my sword. When I encounter a mountain, the mountain becomes my sword; when I encounter rivers and lakes, they all become my swords... Even a single blade of grass or a tree can be my sword. The mountain has the might of the sword, the water has the might of the sword... All things in heaven and earth are the swords of my heart.'"</p><p></p><p>The second realm of the sword dao is the Heart Sword realm! Xu Yan's heart was stirred. All things in heaven and earth can be his sword? Mountains can be his sword, and rivers can be his sword as well? This was truly profound. In this moment, he felt a sense of his own insignificance.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Sword realm was so distant from him. What kind of sword dao realm was that?</p><p></p><p>Involuntarily, images emerged in his mind of raising his hand and summoning a great mountain to become a sword that would sweep away his enemies.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, to break through to the Heart Sword realm, you must first comprehend the essence of the sword," Li Xuan said with a slight smile, seeing Xu Yan's flushed face and eager, passionate gaze.</p><p></p><p>Sounds quite profound, doesn't it? But the more profound it is, the more motivated Xu Yan becomes. He will never doubt that such profound things can be achieved. He will simply charge forward towards this goal, like a rooster that has been fed some stimulant.</p><p></p><p>Truly a good disciple! Li Xuan sighed, thinking that taking Xu Yan as his disciple in this lifetime was the best decision he had ever made.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the sword! Comprehending the essence of the sword!</p><p></p><p>"All things in heaven and earth can be used to comprehend the essence of the sword, but you must remember that when cultivating realms, attachment is the greatest enemy. Too much attachment will trap you in a cage and prevent you from truly comprehending the essence.</p><p></p><p>"And you must not blindly try to comprehend the essence of the sword, neglecting your own cultivation. Since your sword heart is clear, comprehending the essence of the sword is only a matter of time. Perhaps one day, while cultivating the Descending Dragon Palm, you will suddenly comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"The essence of the sword is not something that can only be comprehended during sword cultivation," Li Xuan patiently instructed.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't let his disciple neglect the cultivation of the Descending Dragon Palm in his pursuit of the sword dao. Mastering both the palm and the sword was Xu Yan's true path.</p><p></p><p>"If you comprehend the essence of the Descending Dragon Palm, you may be able to apply it to the sword dao as well. And conversely, if you comprehend the essence of the sword, you may also be able to understand the Descending Dragon Palm. How much you can comprehend depends on you, my disciple."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, thinking that he should also have Xu Yan try to comprehend the essence of the Descending Dragon Palm. If he truly grasped it, his strength would surely soar.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master," Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good, continue your cultivation." Li Xuan sat back down.</p><p></p><p>He would teach Xu Yan the realms beyond the Heart Sword realm after Xu Yan had mastered that realm. Passing on too much at once might hinder his disciple's comprehension. It was better to take it step by step, firmly grounded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Meng Chong and said, "Your shidi (younger martial brother) has encountered a bottleneck. Go and spar with him, to stimulate his qi and blood and help him break through the bottleneck."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was momentarily taken aback, then turned to look at Meng Chong, understanding immediately.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan had broken through his own Gold Bone bottleneck and successfully tempered his Jade Bone, it was with the help of the Fire-Maned Wolf.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cultivated the Flesh Dao, and was stuck at the peak of the Gold Bone realm, unable to further temper his Gold Diamond Vajra Bone. He needed external force to refine his flesh, stimulate his qi and blood, and break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cultivated the Flesh Dao, and to break through his bottleneck, the best method was external refinement to stimulate his potential and break open the bottleneck. The method was actually quite simple.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it depended on one's aptitude. If the aptitude was not good enough, no matter how much refinement and extraction, it would only end up harming one's foundation, and not break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's flesh aptitude was clearly very high, so he would not suffer any backlash. He would only have his potential ignited and his qi and blood boiling in the refining and extraction, breaking through the bottleneck and tempering his Gold Diamond Vajra Bone.</p><p></p><p>Previously, when Meng Chong broke through the Copper Bone bottleneck, it was because he was stimulated by Blood Wuxin's cold inner qi, igniting his potential and allowing him to break through.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, come, let's spar," Xu Yan beckoned to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two of them left the city of Yunshan County and went to the mountains outside to spar.</p><p></p><p>Ostensibly it was sparring, but in reality Xu Yan was refining Meng Chong's flesh, stimulating his potential to break through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>In the mountains outside Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>Booming sounds rang out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's qi and blood surged, and he struck out palm after palm, the scorching qi and blood continuously pounding against Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong activated the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor, his flesh like a golden bell, emitting a humming sound as the qi and blood struck it, his entire body trembling.</p><p></p><p>"Not enough, make it stronger," Meng Chong said, flexing his muscles.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Xu Yan's brow furrowed. His shidi's flesh was truly formidable, worthy of the Flesh Dao.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood increased, enveloping Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>After half an incense stick's time, Meng Chong finally couldn't hold on any longer, panting heavily, his entire body flushed red, his muscles trembling, his bones making slight sounds.</p><p></p><p>Refining the flesh, extracting potential, and breaking through a bottleneck was not something that could be accomplished in one or two tries.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, that's enough for today, we'll continue tomorrow," Xu Yan said, withdrawing his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, thank you, Shixiong (elder martial brother)!" Meng Chong replied.</p><p></p><p>The two returned to the courtyard, and Li Xuan glanced at them, silently nodding.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had not yet broken through the bottleneck and entered the tempering of the Gold Diamond Vajra Bone stage, but he had made some progress, the bottleneck loosening a bit.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few days, Meng Chong underwent Xu Yan's qi and blood pounding, but he still fell just short of breaking through the bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought that if they continued this method, Meng Chong would eventually break through, but it would take a long time.</p><p></p><p>So when Meng Chong returned from another round of flesh refinement, the bottleneck had loosened further, but still lacked that final push to break through completely. He needed a little stimulation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took out a spirit crystal, recalling the method of absorbing essence blood from the Blood Demon Classic, and slightly adjusted it to absorb the spiritual energy from the spirit crystal using his true qi.</p><p></p><p>For Li Xuan's current strength, this was not a difficult task at all.</p><p></p><p>A wisp of spiritual energy was extracted from the spirit crystal, and Li Xuan flicked his finger, sending it into Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>Sizzle!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Meng Chong's qi and blood began to boil, as if stimulated, or as if receiving a supplement. Rumbling sounds echoed within his body.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He hastily circulated his qi, beginning to cultivate the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>*Poof!*</p><p></p><p>A muffled sound seemed to come from within his body, the bottleneck had been broken open, and the blood and qi were once again tempered onto his bones.</p><p></p><p>At this time, a faint jade-like luster began to emanate from his golden bones.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivate well and enter the dao soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He put away the spirit crystals. These two spirit crystals were precious things to him now. </p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan broke through to the Xiantian Realm and encountered some bottlenecks, perhaps he would also need to absorb the spiritual energy from these spirit crystals to help him break through faster.</p><p></p><p>The faster his disciples' strength increased, the faster he could increase his own strength.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded excitedly. </p><p></p><p>"Shidi, once you enter the dao, we'll spar again."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said expectantly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I need to go home for a bit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, he should also try to break through the Blood Qi Realm these past few days.</p><p></p><p>He should also go home to guide his family's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Go then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not far from fully breaking through the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>This would happen in the next few days.</p><p></p><p>However, fully breaking through the Blood Qi Realm did not mean he could immediately break through to the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>He would need to settle for a period of time before he could begin to break through.</p><p></p><p>And the breakthrough itself would also take time.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was tempering his Vajra Jade Bones, growing stronger every day. Likely within a month, he would complete the tempering of the Vajra Jade Bones.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er watched enviously.</p><p></p><p>He had also started to cultivate his bones, only after personally cultivating bones did he realize how difficult it was.</p><p></p><p>In the initial stages of bone cultivation, that painful sensation of being gnawed by countless ants was truly unbearable. Those with weaker willpower would even cry out in agony.</p><p></p><p>Once they cried out, their blood qi would be disrupted, and the bone cultivation would stop.</p><p></p><p>In this way, completing bone cultivation became extremely difficult, extremely difficult.</p><p></p><p>He, Shi Er, also had strong willpower, but he had almost been unable to endure it several times.</p><p></p><p>However, in the end, he gritted his teeth and persevered through the most arduous stage.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could feel the changes brought about by bone cultivation, his strength had increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't dare to hope for golden bones, my goal will be copper bones!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er set a goal for himself.</p><p></p><p>Those who know their own family affairs know that the goal of golden bones is too high for him, he does not have that talent and aptitude.</p><p></p><p>Copper bones still have hope.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has fully broken through the Blood Qi Realm, your true qi has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had fully broken through the Blood Qi Realm, the feedback from the Spiritual Sense had also arrived.</p><p></p><p>"He's just one realm away, the feedback is a bit less, but the true qi has increased by about twice."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although the true qi had increased by twice, he was still at the initial stage of the Xiantian Realm. However, his strength had further increased.</p><p></p><p>"My Sword Heart has reached great perfection, the foundation of the Sword Dao has been mastered. Should I try to comprehend the Sword Intent?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he still had no clue about the Sword Intent, and could only put it aside.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, such a laborious task, it's better to leave it to my disciples."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had fully broken through the Blood Qi Realm, the Xiantian Realm was not far away. Li Xuan looked forward to Meng Chong entering the dao, hoping that he could break through the Blood Qi Realm before Xu Yan broke through to the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for the second disciple, cultivating the newly compiled cultivation method, how much feedback would he gain upon entering the dao?</p><p></p><p>More importantly, the physical martial dao, with the protection of the Great Sun Golden Bell, his defense would be enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Standing still, even Martial Realm masters in the Inner Domain would be unable to breach his defenses.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan fully broke through the Blood Qi Realm, he returned to the small courtyard and began to consolidate his realm, preparing to break through to the Xiantian Realm.</p><p></p><p>He would often go outside Yunshan County, sit on the mountain, and try to comprehend the Sword Intent, also cultivating the Descending Dragon Palm, attempting to grasp its essence.</p><p></p><p>However, for now, there had been no major breakthroughs.</p><p></p><p>Ten days had passed since Xu Yan broke through the Blood Qi Realm. On this day, the cultivating Meng Chong's entire body was suffused with a faint jade-like golden light.</p><p></p><p>His aura was undergoing a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently watched, his second disciple was about to enter the dao.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er watched from afar, his face filled with envy. Meng Chong was about to enter the dao, while he was still far from entering the dao.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder the Master accepted him as a disciple, his talent is truly too strong. I also have a great opportunity, to be able to come into contact with the martial dao, to cultivate the martial dao, to serve the Master."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong was enveloped in the jade-like golden light, gradually, the jade-like light seemed to transform into a golden bell that enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, Meng Chong seemed to have become a golden man, with an unyielding and mighty aura that was coalescing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, "My second disciple has the appearance of the Arhat Golden Vajra, transmitting the Great Sun Golden Bell to him is truly so fitting."</p><p></p><p>*Crack!*</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a sound of bones and sinews resounded.</p><p></p><p>The jade-like light on Meng Chong's body grew even more intense, his muscles were trembling, and a series of thunderous sounds began to resonate within his body.</p><p></p><p>The blood qi transformed into jade-like light, refining into a golden bell, merging with his physical body.</p><p></p><p>A fierce aura, like a raging storm, was manifesting on Meng Chong's body.</p><p></p><p>*Rumble!*</p><p></p><p>Thunder roared, the golden bell appeared!</p><p></p><p>*Boom!*</p><p></p><p>With the appearance of the golden bell, it was as if the sound of a bell was also ringing out.</p><p></p><p>The golden bell of blood qi, the jade-like golden light, enveloped Meng Chong, the thunderous sounds growing louder and louder.</p><p></p><p>The neighbors had already started poking their heads out to look at the sky, their faces filled with puzzlement. How could there be thunder on such a clear day?</p><p></p><p>Was it because the county lord had fallen into depravity?</p><p></p><p>So the clear sky was rumbling with thunder?</p><p></p><p>Or was there a great injustice in Yunshan County?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan furrowed his brows, flipping his palm, the true qi surged out, covering the courtyard, shielding the commotion of Meng Chong's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>*Roar!*</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong let out a loud roar, the bones and sinews thundered and exploded, the blood qi congealing into a golden bell, his entire body emanating a jade-like golden light. His muscles became even more robust, and as his blood qi circulated, his entire person grew taller.</p><p></p><p>His already burly and muscular figure became even more robust, almost bursting the cowhide pants he was wearing.</p><p></p><p>"I, have entered the dao, the Great Sun Golden Bell, I have entered the dao!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could feel his own immense strength.</p><p></p><p>Even steel would be no match for his physical body.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the golden bell would envelop him, any attack would be ignored.</p><p></p><p>His entire body had no weaknesses or vulnerabilities, apart from brute force breaking through his defenses, there was no other way to harm him.</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling of being unrivaled within his realm, able to sweep away everything.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was stunned by Meng Chong's overwhelming aura, this was just the initial stage of entering the dao, yet it was so terrifying?</p><p></p><p>He had a feeling that even if he reached the peak of the Blood Qi Realm, he would still be no match for the just-entered-the-dao Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The gap was too large.</p><p></p><p>"Come, use the precious sword to strike me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly waved to Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>Directly letting Shi Er use the precious sword that Xu Yan had given him.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>This time, Shi Er did not hesitate.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the sword, he charged forward and used all his strength to viciously slash towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's second disciple had finally entered the dao, and he revealed a radiant smile, not bothering to pay attention to Meng Chong testing his physical body with the sword, eagerly awaiting the long-awaited feedback from the Spiritual Sense.</p>

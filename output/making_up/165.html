        <h1>Chapter 165</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Suli's golden needles, while swift and powerful, were still small and difficult to defend against. Moreover, their penetrating power was extremely strong, and ordinary martial artists' qi and blood could not easily withstand them.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the golden needles were highly variable - if you could defend against one, you couldn't necessarily defend against ten or even hundreds.</p><p></p><p>However, for Xu Yan and Meng Chong, they ultimately posed little threat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Suli's comprehension of the golden needles was also partly thanks to the two of them, so she already had some understanding of the techniques.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Great Sun Golden Body didn't even need to deliberately defend against them, as the golden needles could not break through his defenses.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, while Suli's golden needles were indeed formidable, they could not pose the slightest threat to him, even if she tried to ambush him.</p><p></p><p>"Sister disciple's golden needle techniques are easy to deal with against other martial artists," Xu Yan smiled as he returned the needles to her.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother's strength is just too powerful," Suli said, looking dejected. She felt her golden needles were already so strong, yet they were easily broken.</p><p></p><p>"I'll call this technique the 'Gentle Wind Divine Needles'!" Suli said excitedly, then picked up an iron shovel she had brought, saying, "Next, I want to comprehend an iron shovel technique, specialized in burying people!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, as if she thought of something, she hurriedly left, saying, "I'm going to try the golden needles on Hu Shan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, thinking Hu Shan was in for some trouble.</p><p></p><p>Although Suli had not yet broken through to the Xiantian realm, her strength was far beyond that of an ordinary First-Grade Martial Artist. Even common Sect Masters could not be her opponents.</p><p></p><p>The comprehension of the Bagua had reached a temporary conclusion.</p><p></p><p>Next, it was time to temper oneself, strengthen the foundation, and strive for an early breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>After reaching Xiantian Perfection, even peak Grand Sect Masters would be easily killed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was full of fighting spirit. He wanted to prepare to break through the Great Sun Golden Body Perfection. As long as he broke through the Great Sun Golden Body Perfection, he would no longer fear Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>He had been chased by the Black-Robed Grand Sect Master for a while and was still holding a grudge.</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, he should go kill some Grand Sect Masters to vent his anger.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the Thunder and Lightning Golden Ape Fist had a breakthrough, and the Heavenly Earth Dominator Sword Technique was also about to have a breakthrough, comprehended from the Bagua.</p><p></p><p>He also wanted to try his fist and sword against the Grand Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to punch a Grand Sect Master to pieces with one blow.</p><p></p><p>The elder brother going to the Inner Realm was so majestic and domineering, killing Sect Masters and defeating Grand Sect Masters one after another.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought about going to the Inner Realm, where at first he could kill Sect Masters as easily as slaughtering chickens, but later he was chased by the Black-Robed Grand Sect Master! He didn't earn that many spirit stones either.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, there were many spiritual herbs in the spiritual herb ground, so the trip to the Inner Realm was not entirely in vain.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Suli has comprehended the 'Gentle Wind Divine Needles' from the Bagua, and your 'Gentle Wind Divine Needles' has reached completion," the golden light flashed, and Li Xuan remained calm.</p><p></p><p>However, this 'Gentle Wind Divine Needles' technique did not stir any waves in his heart, and he would not even use it.</p><p></p><p>As a great elder, the image of him wielding golden needles and scattering them about was somewhat at odds with his lofty and immortal demeanor. Involuntarily, he couldn't help but think of a certain character named Dongfang Bubai, whose hands flew like embroidery needles...</p><p></p><p>Suli began to teach the group of young men and women the steps of pill refining. She selected the most talented ones to learn the final step of refining the pills and condensing them.</p><p></p><p>Learning pill refining, even just one step, required repeated practice, so the consumption of medicinal materials would not be small.</p><p></p><p>In the practice stage, they used ordinary medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>Once they became proficient, they would practice with precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they would use spiritual herbs, while controlling the failure rate and improving the success rate.</p><p></p><p>This all required time to accumulate, and the refining methods for qi blood pills, nourishing qi pills, and healing pills had slight differences in each step.</p><p></p><p>However, the differences were not significant. Once the refining method of one pill formula was mastered, learning the refining methods of the other pill formulas would be much easier.</p><p></p><p>They started with refining low-grade pills, such as those that could assist in refining bones, organs, or even perceiving the flow of qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>This naturally resulted in the production of many low-grade pills in the pill refining chamber every day, as well as numerous failed pills. However, as the pill refining became more proficient, the number of failed pills began to decrease.</p><p></p><p>The completed pill medicines were naturally used by the members of the Changqing Pavilion to assist in their cultivation, or sold to the martial artists in the Frontier to obtain medicinal materials, or to recruit suitable martial artists to join the Changqing Pavilion as outer members.</p><p></p><p>Under the powerful allure of the pill medicines, many aspiring martial artists wanted to join the Changqing Pavilion, but the conditions for joining were extremely strict, with limitations on age and talent.</p><p></p><p>As for the failed pills, following the principle of not wasting, they were all fed to the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was somewhat disdainful, as it was used to eating the waste pills refined from spiritual herbs. These ordinary waste pills were not something it wanted to eat, but since Suli gave them to it, it couldn't refuse. To please Suli, the Red Cat simply gulped them all down.</p><p></p><p>Only after achieving a 100% success rate for each type of pill would they start refining the next type of pill, in order to reduce the failure rate when refining new pills.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual herbs, although seemingly abundant, could not withstand such wastage. The senior brothers had traveled a lot to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, to minimize the failure rate when refining spiritual herb pills, Suli had very strict requirements for the success rate.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had entered the martial dao and broken through to the Blood Realm. He was excited, finally becoming a true martial artist.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, I've broken through!" Kou Ruozhi immediately came to report his breakthrough to Suli.</p><p></p><p>"Good, for now, hand over the affairs of the Changqing Pavilion to Yunshan. You should go to the Inner Realm, as I have some matters for you to handle there," Suli nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Pavilion Master!" Kou Ruozhi solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Yunshan was the County Magistrate of Yunshan County, and he had some capabilities to be able to control Yunshan County for the former Tianmu Sect, so he was one of the core members of the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After Kou Ruozhi had arranged the affairs of the Changqing Pavilion, Suli began to instruct him on the matters in the Inner Realm. The first task was to prepare the Changqing Pavilion's entry into the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>First, he needed to investigate the strength of the martial artists in Tieshan County and determine where to establish the Changqing Pavilion and how to operate it.</p><p></p><p>Another very important matter was to try to establish an intelligence system for the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Suli explained the general situation of the Inner Realm to Kou Ruozhi in detail, and how he should proceed would depend on Kou Ruozhi himself.</p><p></p><p>Suli believed that with Kou Ruozhi's abilities, he should be able to complete the task quickly. She had left him behind precisely because she recognized his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful in your actions, and don't expose the Frontier for now. You should know how to do it," Suli said finally.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, don't worry, I know what to do. The Changqing Pavilion will definitely make its name resound throughout the Inner Realm and stand at the peak," Kou Ruozhi said with a soaring spirit and great ambition.</p><p></p><p>"You..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"If you truly have this capability, your name Kou Ruozhi will surely leave a deep mark in the history of the martial arts!"Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi became even more excited upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>That day, Kou Ruozhi took the few spirit crystals and spirit tickets given by Su Lingxiu, and left the Frontier Wilderness, heading towards the Iron Mountain County in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>The spirit crystals and spirit tickets were naturally brought back by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu looked towards the direction of the Inner Domain, a flash of killing intent flickering in her bright eyes.</p><p></p><p>She was about to return to the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>She must uproot and completely exterminate the force of the Black-Robed Man!</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had entered the Blood Qi Realm, which theoretically corresponded to a Third-Grade Martial Artist, but he was much stronger than the Third-Grade Martial Artists in the Inner Domain. Except for the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, there were definitely no Grandmaster Martial Artists in Iron Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>"There might not even be any Third-Grade Martial Artists. Once they break through to the Third Grade, the martial artists in Iron Mountain County would all leave this barren land," Su Lingxiu thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>With Kou Ruozhi's strength and methods, she believed he could quickly establish a foothold in Iron Mountain County and complete the task she had assigned him. Of course, building an intelligence network would be very difficult. It was absolutely impossible to achieve in the short term.</p><p></p><p>"I should break through to the Innate Realm now!" Su Lingxiu prepared to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Her foundation was already sufficient, her comprehension of the Medicinal Martial Arts Classic had deepened, and she had also grasped the Thousand Butterfly Illusion Body Technique and the Xun Wind Spirit Needle. It was time for her to break through.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm going to break through to the Innate Realm," Su Lingxiu said as she poured tea for her teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded, playing with a jade ruyi scepter.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you have any advice for my breakthrough to the Innate Realm?" Su Lingxiu asked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment. Xu Yan had broken through to the Innate Realm by integrating sword intent into his body, undergoing a transformation into a Spirit Bone. Meng Chong was similar, also experiencing a significant transformation.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan were to break through to the Profound Realm, Li Xuan even suspected that he might undergo further transformation, with his Spirit Bone becoming even stronger, or perhaps even transforming into a Spirit Body. As for Su Lingxiu, who cultivated the Medicinal Martial Arts, she had not comprehended sword intent, blade intent, or needle intent. How would she undergo a transformation upon breaking through to the Innate Realm?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had long suspected that Su Lingxiu had a special physique. After learning about her origins and that her mother, a Grandmaster Martial Artist, had passed away due to excessive consumption after giving birth to her, Li Xuan suspected that Su Lingxiu's special physique was not complete, and her breakthrough to the Innate Realm would be an opportunity for her to transform and refine her physique.</p><p></p><p>He then spoke, "You cultivate the Medicinal Martial Arts. To undergo a transformation upon breaking through to the Innate Realm, you should focus on the Medicinal Arts. Refine the Long-Lived Bone, which has a continuous flow of vitality, and use it as the foundation to elevate yourself.</p><p></p><p>"Your two senior brothers transformed by tempering their sword intent and blade intent, but this is not your forte. Since you do not possess the comprehension of sword intent or blade intent, you should instead focus your efforts on the Medicinal Arts."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pondered for a while and then nodded, "Thank you, Master. I know what to do now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. The fact that Su Lingxiu could comprehend the method meant that her breakthrough to the Innate Realm would also result in a transformation. Perhaps it would elevate her special physique to a new level.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu began preparing for her breakthrough to the Innate Realm. She spent a few days contemplating the medicinal formulas and eventually concocted one.</p><p></p><p>The main ingredients were three Sixth-Grade spirit herbs, with the auxiliary ingredients being Seventh-Grade herbs as well.</p><p></p><p>This was the highest-grade elixir she had ever refined, so she was extremely careful, not daring to be distracted in the slightest. If the refinement failed, the loss would be substantial.</p><p></p><p>Finally, the elixir was successfully refined, a total of nine pills, with an intertwining green-blue luster and a smooth, lustrous appearance, as if brimming with vibrant life force.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched with a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, under a large tree on the mountain peak, Su Lingxiu sat in a cross-legged position, about to break through to the Innate Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Xie Lingfeng, and Hu Shan were all watching from a distance.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was both nervous and delighted, her doting gaze fixed on the young woman.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Innate Realm was not difficult for Su Lingxiu, but whether she could use this opportunity to undergo a transformative ascension was the unknown.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Earth Bridge connected, and the Heaven-Earth spiritual energy entered her body. A faint blue glow began to emanate from her, containing a vibrant life force, and the tender buds of the large tree seemed to start growing rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan looked on with envious expressions. In the Frontier Wilderness, they could cultivate and guide the Heaven-Earth spiritual energy into their bodies, as well as break through realms. This was the true essence of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao should not be constrained by rules and regulations.</p><p></p><p>In the Frontier Wilderness, they relied on medicinal pills to refine and cultivate the Qi-Condensing Elixir, and their cultivation speed was not slow either. However, they could never sense the Heaven-Earth spiritual energy, which left them feeling somewhat frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's blue glow grew stronger and more prolonged. Even from a distance, one could feel the vibrant life force emanating from her. Her aura was also undergoing a transformation. At the moment she was about to break through to the Innate Realm, a peculiar situation seemed to arise. The spiritual energy flooded into her body, but it did not condense into true Innate Qi.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned, silently observing and examining Su Lingxiu's condition.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying couldn't help but ask anxiously, "Young Master Xu, what's wrong with Miss?"</p><p></p><p>Even though she had only just reached the Blood Qi Realm, about to break through to the Greater Blood Qi Realm, she could still sense that something seemed amiss with Su Lingxiu's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that my shijie's body is passively absorbing the Heaven-Earth spiritual energy, like a thirsty person frantically drinking water," Xu Yan said, furrowing his brows in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying couldn't help but feel worried. "Then what should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"Shijie has prepared some medicinal pills, so it should be fine," Xu Yan said, though he was also somewhat concerned.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had also noticed the situation in her body and was puzzled. She hastily placed a medicinal pill into her mouth. The pill instantly dissolved, and a vibrant life force began to emerge within her.</p><p></p><p>She took a deep breath and continued to operate her cultivation technique. The Medicinal Martial Arts Classic flashed through her mind, and she swallowed another pill, beginning to refine the Long-Lived Bone.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, numerous golden needles appeared, piercing into the acupoints all over her body. The needles trembled, as if connecting to the Heaven-Earth spiritual energy, stimulating the spiritual power of the acupoints.</p><p></p><p>Another pill was consumed, and the rich vitality, as well as a prolonged and intense energy, began to circulate within her body, stimulating the Long-Lived Bone.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the Long-Lived Bone began to emit a faint blue glow, and its vitality became even more continuous.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu discovered that her body seemed to be undergoing a transformation, and she felt a sense of affinity with the surrounding trees, as if she could control them with a mere thought.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Earth spiritual energy flooded into her body, no longer scattering but instead rushing towards her dantian, opening up a spiritual sea within her dantian.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked over with a leisurely pace, watching the breakthrough of Su Lingxiu. Just as he had suspected, Su Lingxiu had a special physique, but it was not complete, limited by her environment and innate deficiencies.</p><p></p><p>However, she had refined the Long-Lived Bone, and now, with the assistance of the medicinal pills, her special physique not only became complete but was also undergoing a transformative ascension, about to transform into an even stronger physique.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

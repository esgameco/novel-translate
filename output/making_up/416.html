        <h1>Chapter 416</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Mo, you came a bit faster this time," Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he and Meng Chong, who had regained his normal form, instantly vanished from their spot and fled far away.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how long you can run!" Blood Son Mo's gaze was cold.</p><p></p><p>He immediately gave chase. Soon after, he lost track of Xu Yan and Meng Chong's auras, which he had anticipated.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of miles away in the clouds, Xu Yan and Meng Chong concealed their auras, seemingly merging with the clouds. They watched Blood Son Mo's figure disappear in the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Son Mo is relentless. We can only shake him off temporarily, unless we leave the Nine Mountains Realm," Meng Chong said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>"No rush, we'll kill him sooner or later!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow is truly capable, actually letting the Blood Sons of the Netherworld Prison enter the Divine Realm. And they have people in all the major factions of the Nine Mountains Realm, including the Immortal Lords."</p><p></p><p>"That big tiger Red Cat has become increasingly shrewd."</p><p></p><p>The situation in the Nine Mountains Realm was chaotic. Even Spirit Veneration Mountain, which could have stayed out of it, was drawn in. The sect leader of Spirit Veneration was even "injured".</p><p></p><p>As for whether the injury was real or fake, only he himself knew.</p><p></p><p>The Wind Spirit Tiger of Spirit Veneration Mountain had shown its might once, intimidating many Immortal Lords. This prevented major chaos at Spirit Veneration Mountain, but minor disturbances continued.</p><p></p><p>As for how this chaos was created, only Red Cat knew.</p><p></p><p>"Is that Heaven Seventeen still tracking us?" Meng Chong asked gravely.</p><p></p><p>Heaven Seventeen was much stronger than Blood Son Mo. If they encountered him, it would not be easy to escape.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps," Xu Yan exhaled and looked around. "Next, we should clean up those Blood Disciples. After that's done, we'll leave Big Lid Mountain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't like owing favors. His cooperation with the Wan family should come to an end.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Wan family was under tremendous pressure now. It was uncertain how long they could hold out and continue shielding him and Meng Chong from the Immortal Lords' targeting.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>The two of them moved and began clearing out the Blood Disciples who had infiltrated Big Lid Mountain.</p><p></p><p>At the Wan family compound, Wan Tianlin looked up at the sky, his face showing a hint of unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>As a prodigy of the Wan family with high expectations, a seedling of an Immortal Lord, he could now only stay in the family compound. Immortal Lords were constantly watching him to prevent assassination attempts.</p><p></p><p>For his safety, Wan Tianlin couldn't take a single step outside the compound now.</p><p></p><p>"Sometimes I really envy Brother Xu, so free and unrestrained, not even caring about threats from powerful experts," Wan Tianlin sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was clearing out Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow from Big Lid Mountain, continuously rooting out and killing many of their members. He even forced some of them to retreat from Big Lid Mountain.</p><p></p><p>This was good news for the Wan family, but the Blood Disciples of the Netherworld Prison had infiltrated Big Lid Mountain. Especially Blood Son Mo, who was killing indiscriminately on Big Lid Mountain while pursuing Xu Yan and Meng Chong, causing significant losses.</p><p></p><p>And the Wan family's Immortal Lords couldn't spare any manpower to deal with it.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to escape from the Blood Sons' hands, Brother Xu and Meng Chong are truly the real prodigies of this age!" Wan Tianlin had to admit that in terms of talent, he was far inferior to Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>If he were in their situation, he would have been killed long ago. How could he have any chance of escape when faced with Blood Son Mo's pursuit?</p><p></p><p>"I hope Brother Xu can escape," Wan Tianlin sighed helplessly. At this moment, he couldn't offer much help.</p><p></p><p>Being able to persuade the family's Immortal Lords to fend off the Immortal Lords from Thousand-Layer Mountain and横峰 Mountain was already the most he could do.</p><p></p><p>"Boom!" Meng Chong's fist exploded, blasting a Blood Disciple to pieces.</p><p></p><p>"Seven Blood Disciples left," Xu Yan said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>A blood-colored light appeared on the horizon - Blood Son Mo was pursuing them again.</p><p></p><p>The two instantly departed.</p><p></p><p>Of the Blood Disciples who had infiltrated Big Lid Mountain, only seven remained after the two's extermination.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, the last location has all seven Blood Disciples. It seems suspicious," Meng Chong said, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled coldly, "Blood Son Mo isn't there. And now that battles between Immortal Lords have erupted, the energy is chaotic. An Immortal Lord skilled in stealth could take advantage to sneak into Big Lid Mountain undetected. It must be an Immortal-level Earth's Shadow."</p><p></p><p>"Could it be Heaven Seventeen?"</p><p></p><p>"Heaven Seventeen is Heaven's Bane. He's extremely powerful. If he appeared, the Wan family would definitely notice."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Let's probe this Immortal-level Earth's Shadow's strength. If possible..."</p><p></p><p>A fierce light flashed in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>They had killed so many Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow members, but the losses weren't that significant to the organization. If they could kill an Immortal-level expert, that would truly be a major blow to Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Defeating an Immortal Lord as juniors, make Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow feel the pain!" </p><p></p><p>A fierce light also appeared in Meng Chong's eyes.</p><p></p><p>They had just entered the Nine Mountains Realm when Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow started hunting them. This grudge couldn't be settled just by killing some lackeys.</p><p></p><p>In a cave, seven Blood Disciples sat cross-legged, seemingly refining and absorbing essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Everything looked normal.</p><p></p><p>Dozens of miles away, two figures appeared silently.</p><p></p><p>"No Immortal Lord present?" Meng Chong was surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes glowed as he scanned the surroundings. His eyebrows raised slightly, then he looked towards the clouds in the sky.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong's eyes became like two small suns, also scanning the area.</p><p></p><p>Under the Minor Heavenly Eye, even the strongest concealment techniques could be seen through.</p><p></p><p>Besides, who could compare to the two of them in terms of concealing auras and hiding?</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, a mighty Immortal Lord, actually hiding in the mud. How rare indeed," Xu Yan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the earth beneath the seven Blood Disciples.</p><p></p><p>It had to be said, Heaven's Bane Earth's Shadow knew well that ordinary concealment methods couldn't fool the two of them. They actually hid directly underground.</p><p></p><p>They even used the Blood Disciples' auras as cover. With such a concealment technique, even if another Immortal Lord came, they probably wouldn't be able to discover it for quite some time.</p><p></p><p>They might even be ambushed successfully.</p><p></p><p>However, how could they hide from Xu Yan and Meng Chong? Under the Minor Heavenly Eye, everything was exposed.</p><p></p><p>Even without the Minor Heavenly Eye, with their concealment skills, they would still be able to detect it. The other party was simply too confident and underestimated Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Let's pretend we didn't notice these Blood Disciples and lead Blood Son Mo on a wild goose chase," Xu Yan said after pondering.</p><p></p><p>Let's see how long this Immortal Lord has the patience to keep hiding.</p><p></p><p>The two silently left and revealed themselves in another location, attracting Blood Son Mo to chase them. Then they fled again, leading Blood Son Mo away, far from where that Immortal Lord was hiding.</p><p></p><p>At Spirit Veneration Mountain, Red Cat was training the spirit beast army.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha had returned, along with Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Where are Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother?" Jiang Buping was amazed at the chaos in the Nine Mountains Realm. Such intense internal strife among the 36 Divine Realms...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>This was the first time I had heard of it.</p><p></p><p>From this, it was clear how deep the Tianshadiying's plan was. Once they took action, it immediately triggered such an intense battle.</p><p></p><p>"At Mount Dagai, that Blood Child Mo is chasing after them."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat raised its paw and pointed towards Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>"Farewell, I'm heading to Mount Dagai," said Jiang Buping as he turned to leave without lingering.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful. The Wan family of Mount Dagai is in a standoff with Qiandie Mountain and Hengfeng Mountain. Don't get caught up in it," Red Cat warned.</p><p></p><p>"It's no big deal," Jiang Buping said with a smile. He was no novice in martial arts anymore. Having become a discarded pawn, wandering from the Taikun realm to the Qinghua realm, he was already very experienced. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had not only recovered now, but his strength far surpassed his peak. The profundity of his martial arts was incomparable to before, so traversing the chaotic Nine Mountains realm was naturally effortless for him.</p><p></p><p>At Mount Dagai, after Xu Yan and Meng Chong had lured Blood Child Mo far away, they quietly returned.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, if I can distract him for a few breaths, do you think you can wound him?" Xu Yan asked, looking towards where the Immortal Lord was hiding.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pondered for a moment. "There's a 60% chance, but I'm not sure how badly I can wound him."</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Lord is indeed powerful, especially in wielding the power of heaven and earth. But it may not be impossible to defeat and kill him. With a 60% chance, we can give it a try," Xu Yan said, his eyes flashing with a fierce light.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's try it then!" Meng Chong rubbed his bald head, looking excited.</p><p></p><p>"Let's defeat an Immortal Lord and let these Divine Realm martial artists know that even Immortal Lords can be defeated!" Xu Yan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, what about those seven blood disciples?" Meng Chong asked. They were an obstacle to defeating the Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>"The Wan family also wants to hunt down the hidden blood disciples. Let them send some strong fighters. Since that Immortal Lord is trying to ambush us, we'll turn the tables and ambush him instead," Xu Yan said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>When it came to ambush techniques, he considered himself quite skilled - even more so than an Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and took out a communication talisman.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, fifth junior brother has come to the Nine Mountains realm," Xu Yan said with surprise.</p><p></p><p>He had thought it would be Wan Tianlin or Red Cat sending a message, but unexpectedly it was Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, has fifth junior brother successfully entered the sect?" Meng Chong asked, his eyes brightening.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother is already at Mount Dagai, within range of the communication talisman. We'll put off defeating the Immortal Lord for now and go meet fifth junior brother," Xu Yan said as he communicated with Jiang Buping to arrange a meeting place, while turning to leave.</p><p></p><p>At a certain location on Mount Dagai, the three brothers reunited.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Extreme Soul martial arts. Its power to kill souls is even more domineering and targeted than my Xun Wind Sword Intent," Xu Yan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I've only just entered the door and haven't practiced many Extreme Soul techniques yet," Jiang Buping said, shaking his head.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he was still slightly weaker than his first and second senior brothers. He had mastered too few Extreme Soul martial arts techniques, and had only just entered the door. Even though he had learned from the master's teachings and insights and comprehended an extremely lethal technique, he had still only just begun.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother's Extreme Soul martial arts are even harder for ordinary martial artists to defend against. With your current strength, if you catch an Immortal Lord by surprise, you could wound their soul," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul martial arts focused on extremes, which made them harder to defend against. Divine Realm martial artists had never faced such martial arts before, so even an Immortal Lord would suffer greatly if caught off guard.</p><p></p><p>"I didn't expect fourth junior brother to have already refined new communication talismans. Now we don't have to worry about distance preventing communication," Meng Chong said, holding a communication talisman in his hand as he communicated with Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>After the brothers caught up, Jiang Buping spoke up: "First and second senior brothers, I heard Blood Child Mo is hunting you. Why don't we..."</p><p></p><p>He was eager to try, his eyes flashing with a fierce light.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother has the right idea. It's good, very good. The three of us brothers working together to kill an Immortal Lord would shock Tianshadiying," Xu Yan said with a laugh.</p><p></p><p>"We'll leave Blood Child Mo for later. We're going to kill another Immortal Lord. Fifth junior brother, your technique for concealing your aura should be able to fool even an Immortal Lord..."</p><p></p><p>With Jiang Buping's arrival and his not insignificant strength, especially his Extreme Soul martial arts that could kill souls, the three of them working together should be able to kill an ordinary Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>The three began to discuss how to ambush and kill that Tianshadiying Immortal Lord.</p><p></p><p>But before taking action, they would naturally need to lure Blood Child Mo away again, far from where that Immortal Lord was, to avoid him coming to aid during their ambush.</p><p></p><p>The seven blood disciples were getting a bit restless where they were waiting. They had deliberately leaked traces of their whereabouts, so why hadn't Xu Yan and Meng Chong come to attack yet?</p><p></p><p>But they didn't dare to move rashly. This was Blood Child Mo's order, and besides, there was an Immortal Lord hidden underground where they were.</p><p></p><p>"Die, you Netherworld scum!" Suddenly, two figures appeared, attacking. It was actually two elders from the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" The seven blood disciples' expressions changed. Xu Yan and Meng Chong hadn't come, but the Wan family elders had! </p><p></p><p>Boom! The battle erupted. Even though it was seven against two, the seven blood disciples were no match for the Wan family elders. They were beaten back repeatedly, moving farther and farther from where the Immortal Lord was hidden.</p><p></p><p>Several zhang underground, an Immortal Lord wearing a dark cloud mask watched the distant battle with his eyes, hesitating on whether to scare off the Wan family elders.</p><p></p><p>If he revealed his aura, the Wan family Immortal Realm experts would surely know an Immortal Lord was hidden on Mount Dagai. Xu Yan and Meng Chong would also get the news and wouldn't fall for the trap.</p><p></p><p>If he acted to kill the Wan family elders, his whereabouts would be exposed as soon as he made a move.</p><p></p><p>As he was hesitating, suddenly the earth churned. Sword intent surged, and a scene of mountains and rivers appeared. A fierce killing sword strike came slashing down!</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, his aura erupted. The power of an Immortal Lord spread in all directions, collapsing the scene of mountains and rivers. A young man wielding a sword came slashing down, sword wheels revolving endlessly around his body.</p><p></p><p>"You've come at just the right time. Today I'll kill you!" the Immortal Lord said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The might of an Immortal Lord erupted, but then his expression changed slightly. As he tried to wield the power of heaven and earth in this area, he encountered resistance, as if another force was blocking him.</p><p></p><p>It was a scene of mountains and rivers, formed by the descent of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?" </p><p></p><p>His heart was shocked, and his killing intent grew even stronger. Such a prodigy must die. The more of a prodigy Xu Yan was, the greater the turmoil his death would cause!</p><p></p><p>Boom! He struck out with a slash. The might of an Immortal Lord was incredibly powerful, tearing apart the scene of mountains and rivers as it slashed towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Xu Yan's expression didn't change. As he retreated, his Yin-Yang Undying Sword continuously deflected the force of this slash, while his Unending Sword Intent surged like raging waves.</p><p></p><p>"Is this all an Immortal Lord can do?" Xu Yan said with a contemptuous smile, appearing as if he was about to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"You won't be able to escape!" the Immortal Lord said with a cold smile, taking a step forward to attack.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

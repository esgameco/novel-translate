        <h1>Chapter 262</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spiritual ore in this section of the cave tunnel has not been mined, and the number of spiritual crystal stones is also limited. </p><p></p><p>At regular intervals, a moonstone is embedded in the cave wall, emitting a faint silver glow that illuminates the tunnel.</p><p></p><p>After passing through the tunnel, one arrives at a massive underground mining cavern. On the left side of the entrance, a large pavilion stands in the middle of the cavern, allowing one to overlook the entire mining area.</p><p></p><p>The entire pavilion is carved out of spiritual crystal stones, and all the spiritual crystal stones in the mining cavern have been extracted, leaving only this spiritual crystal pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Inside the pavilion, a middle-aged man is cultivating with his eyes slightly closed, and the dense spiritual energy is converging towards him.</p><p></p><p>In front of the mining cavern, there are more than 20 mining tunnels, and one can see several disciples of the Jade Deity Sect using mining tools to enter one of the tunnels.</p><p></p><p>This is just the edge of the entire large mine.</p><p></p><p>The person in the spiritual crystal pavilion is the Refining Deity Elder who oversees this place.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the pavilion, several small houses have been built with spiritual crystal stones, which are the residences of the Jade Deity Sect's stewards, each of whom is a Great Celestial Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan directly took to the air and headed towards the pavilion. Although the other party's cultivation is only at the initial Refining Deity Realm, even without a sneak attack, he could still easily kill the other party. </p><p></p><p>However, in the mining cavern, if a battle were to break out, and the other party realized they were no match, they might recklessly destroy the spiritual ore, and possibly even the Earth Spirit Flower that might be present, which would be difficult to prevent.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there are other Jade Deity Sect disciples in the spiritual ore, and if they heard the commotion, the destruction of the Earth Spirit Flower would result in a huge loss.</p><p></p><p>This large spiritual ore, the most precious thing is undoubtedly the Earth Spirit Flower! "What is the matter?" The Jade Deity Sect Elder opened his eyes and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The visitor was one of the patrolling stewards, and if there was no major event, he would not have come to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder..." Xu Yan had already arrived at the pavilion and spoke softly.</p><p></p><p>The moment he opened his mouth, a sword light flashed, and the Mountain River Sword Formation instantly enveloped the other party.</p><p></p><p>The Sword of Extinction descended! The Jade Deity Sect Elder was completely unprepared, after all, who would have thought that someone would impersonate a patrolling steward, and their appearance and aura would be exactly the same.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, as the number one sect in Yuzhou, who would dare to attack him? "You!" The Jade Deity Sect Elder's expression changed drastically, and his spiritual soul surged out, a white light erupting from his body, about to take action to defend himself.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mountain River Sword Formation had already descended! Pu! "Who are you?" The Jade Deity Sect Elder was shocked and horrified, his body had been annihilated by the sword formation in this moment.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual soul was collapsing. Stunned, he asked his last question in life.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Immortal Xu Yan!" Xu Yan replied coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Deity Sect Elder perished!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and retrieved the other party's storage pouch.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, at the base of the pavilion, Fang Hao and Meng Chong had quickly dealt with the stewards. With their strength, those Great Celestial Realm stewards were no match and were slaughtered without even being able to raise an alarm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand, and a formation artifact flew out, instantly deploying a large formation in the vast mining cavern. Any Jade Deity Sect disciples who entered the mining cavern would be lost within the formation, unable to even detect the abnormality.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's see if we can find the Earth Spirit Flower," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>The Earth Spirit Flower was the most important treasure.</p><p></p><p>The three of them headed towards the mining tunnels, and each tunnel had a signpost. Two of the tunnels were forbidden for stewards and disciples to enter!</p><p></p><p>"The Earth Spirit Flower is most likely in these two tunnels. I'll go check this one, and you two brothers go explore the other one," Xu Yan entered one of the tunnels.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Fang Hao entered the other tunnel.</p><p></p><p>As expected, deep in the tunnel, at the site of the spiritual crystal ore mining, a pure white flower was growing on the sparkling spiritual crystal ore - the Earth Spirit Flower! A divine-grade spiritual herb, extremely rare even in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart raced as he carefully excavated the Earth Spirit Flower, using the sealing techniques taught by Su Ling Xiu to seal the spiritual herb and store it in his storage ring.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the spiritual crystal ore, the reserves here were incalculable. Just this one spiritual crystal mine alone would provide the Jade Deity Sect with ample resources to cultivate their disciples.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the most precious was undoubtedly the Earth Spirit Flower.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not bother mining the spiritual crystals, as this spiritual crystal mine would take an unknown amount of time to fully excavate. Occupying it would suffice.</p><p></p><p>Soon, Meng Chong and Fang Hao returned, both excited.</p><p></p><p>"We found two Earth Spirit Flowers here!" Fang Hao exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"I have one as well!" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual mine had a total of three Earth Spirit Flowers. If the other mines also had Earth Spirit Flowers, the Jade Deity Sect's accumulation must be substantial, no wonder they were willing to offer one as a reward.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the other mining tunnels, several Jade Deity Sect disciples were coming out of the tunnels, handing over the spiritual crystals they had mined to the stewards, then excitedly re-entering the tunnels to continue mining.</p><p></p><p>But the Jade Deity Sect disciples did not know that after returning to the mining cavern, they had fallen into the formation, trapped in an illusion, seemingly continuing to mine in the tunnels when in reality they were still within the cavern.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the next major mine!" Xu Yan turned and left.</p><p></p><p>This mine had already been enveloped by the formation, and these Jade Deity Sect disciples would be unable to break through the formation's constraints, so the news would not leak out.</p><p></p><p>They would just wait for the plan to be completed, then open an escape route and let these Jade Deity Sect disciples leave, and this mine would be occupied.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent excavation and handling would be left to Fang Hao's Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>At the second Jade Deity Sect major mine, Xu Yan's group followed the same approach, slaying the Refining Deity cultivator in charge, deploying a formation, and harvesting the Earth Spirit Flowers.</p><p></p><p>"There are only two Earth Spirit Flowers here."</p><p></p><p>"It's time to take action against the Jade Deity Sect!" Xu Yan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, I'm ready. This raid will definitely allow us to seize the Jade Deity Sect's treasury!" Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched the entire process, silently nodding his head. Xu Yan's group had deployed their plans meticulously and silently occupied the mines, slaying Refining Deity cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Each time Xu Yan slew a Refining Deity cultivator, the Dao Scriptures would feedback a Divine Extinguish Technique, and he had now obtained five Divine Extinguish Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Jade Deity Sect, Xu Yan's group quietly arrived and concealed their auras in a mountain cave.</p><p></p><p>"Send a message to Yu Gao, it's time to act," Xu Yan looked at Fang Hao and nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out a communication talisman and conveyed the order to act to Yu Gao.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Patriarch has sent a message, it's time to act. Everyone knows the plan, if we succeed this time, the Wanshi Alliance in Yuzhou will rise!" With the spiritual crystal mines secured, the cultivation resources for the younger generation in the alliance would no longer be lacking, and they could tilt more resources towards the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, do not be careless. Whoever disrupts the mission will face my ruthlessness!" Yu Gao looked at the group of Refining Deity cultivators and spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Protector-in-Chief, don't worry, we will definitely not disrupt the Patriarch's plan!" The Right Protector-in-Chief said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Although they had not yet met the new Patriarch, the appearance of the Mist Talismans and Teleportation Talismans had let them know that...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The new alliance leader will surely lead the Alliance to soar to new heights!" "That's right, we've been suppressed by the Spiritual Sect and the Aristocratic Families for a long time. Now that we have the chance, how can we not give it our all?"</p><p></p><p>The rest of the Refining Spirit Cultivators all nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Follow the plan and do not act on your own initiative!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!" Zuo Hufa and the others nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go see Zhu Liang, let him know that I, Yu Gao, am alive and well, and that my strength has returned to its peak!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao let out a cold laugh, his figure moving as he headed towards the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Jade Spirit Sect's main hall, Zhu Liang and a group of Refining Spirit Elders were gathered, discussing how to proceed next.</p><p></p><p>That rogue cultivator force had not been completely eradicated, leaving some hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>And Xu Yan and Meng Chong were like two sharp swords hanging over their heads, ready to strike at any moment. Yet, despite the huge bounty, there had been no news of the two.</p><p></p><p>Not even a trace of them outside of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong must be related to that rogue cultivator force!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"They are likely remnants of the Wanxing Sect. We must notify the Spiritual Sects in other states to be on high alert. I have already contacted Elder Xing of the Crimson Abyss Sect, and we can seek their aid at any time."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, what is the price for their aid?" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Two Earthsoul Flowers!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's gaze narrowed slightly, but he soon continued, "The other Earthsoul Flower will be paid by the Xia Family. This is not just the Jade Spirit Sect's affair."</p><p></p><p>"Elder, is it really necessary to seek aid?" </p><p></p><p>One of the Elders said, not quite convinced.</p><p></p><p>"They've all gone into hiding, what use is seeking aid? Although the Crimson Abyss Sect is powerful, their influence does not extend to Yuzhou. How can they find those people?"</p><p></p><p>"At this stage, we don't necessarily need it, but we need to keep a retreat option open. The true inheritors of the Crimson Abyss Sect are extremely powerful. Xu Yan is a prodigy, and a confrontation between prodigies is only natural.</p><p></p><p>"Just like in the past, when prodigies clashed. If he is a remnant nurtured by the Wanxing Sect, then we shall follow the old rules - a clash between prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"He will surely show himself. Once he does, he will be doomed. The true inheritors of the Crimson Abyss Sect are far beyond the capabilities of a mere rogue cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Elders were stunned. They actually wanted to summon the true inheritor of the Crimson Abyss Sect, who was one of the true prodigy geniuses, although he had not yet broken through to the Refining Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>He was only at the peak of the Great Celestial Realm, but he was known as the number one prodigy of Luozhou, having once slain a Refining Spirit Rogue Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"If it's the true inheritor of the Crimson Abyss Sect, two Earthsoul Flowers are worth it!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master smiled and nodded.</p><p></p><p>With this matter, the Jade Spirit Sect and the true inheritor of the Crimson Abyss Sect would form a bond. Henceforth, the true inheritor of the Crimson Abyss Sect would become a powerful backer for the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>"I hope to witness the grandeur of the Divine Radiance Physique, just how powerful it is, that its divine radiance can resist the might of the divine soul."</p><p></p><p>One of the Elders sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity that the Jade Spirit Sect does not have such a prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Yuzhou, there was no one who could match the talent of the true inheritor of the Crimson Abyss Sect. Yuzhou had truly fallen too far.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a loud and arrogant voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"Little Zhu Liang, come out and fight me!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's expression changed, and he said in a deep voice, "It's that Refining Spirit Cultivator in the late stage, he's only half-crippled at most!"</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, and in an instant, he had rushed out of the Jade Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master and the other Elders also changed their expressions, quickly following after him.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Jade Spirit Sect, Yu Gao's aura was powerful, his divine soul might rippling in all directions, suppressing the Jade Spirit Sect's servants and disciples below.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A white light surged, the divine soul might from within the Jade Spirit Sect forcefully blocking Yu Gao's divine soul might.</p><p></p><p>"It's the Elder!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect's servants and disciples rejoiced.</p><p></p><p>"You're not dead!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang was shocked, the other party not only had not been crippled, but his strength had also returned to its peak. The Refining Spirit late stage might was rippling unrestrained in all directions.</p><p></p><p>This person must die! "Heh, little Zhu Liang, do you really think you can kill me? Come, come, you and I are the only two Refining Spirit late stage cultivators in Yuzhou. Today, we shall determine who is the true strongest in Yuzhou!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao let out a cold laugh and raised his hand to attack.</p><p></p><p>"You will die today!" </p><p></p><p>Zhu Liang's heart was filled with murderous intent, his white light surging as he directly attacked Yu Gao.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master and the others rushed over, intending to surround and kill Yu Gao.</p><p></p><p>"The despicable and shameless ones from the Spiritual Sect, only know to bully with numbers!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao turned and fled, with Zhu Liang in pursuit.</p><p></p><p>Behind Zhu Liang, there was also a Refining Spirit mid-stage Elder, closely following to hunt down Yu Gao, making it clear they wanted to gang up on him.</p><p></p><p>"This person is doomed to die!" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to return to the sect, their expressions suddenly changed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Kill, since Zhu Liang is not here, today we shall break through the Jade Spirit Sect!"</p><p></p><p>A group of Refining Spirit Rogue Cultivators roared as they charged in.</p><p></p><p>"Where did so many Refining Spirit Rogue Cultivators come from?" </p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master's face changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Spirit Elders rushed to meet them, and a fierce battle erupted. The Refining Spirit Rogue Cultivators were quickly pushed back and turned to flee.</p><p></p><p>"Damn the Spiritual Sect, their strength is too powerful? Quickly, flee, don't engage them head-on, ambush is the way to go!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, they are mighty and influential, while we are just barefoot. Ambush is the best strategy!"</p><p></p><p>The group of rogue cultivators cursed as they fled.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Elders' faces turned green, their hearts filled with murderous intent. They had to kill these rogue cultivators, or else the other side would resort to ambushes, and the Jade Spirit Sect would suffer heavy losses.</p><p></p><p>"Kill them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Send word to the Xia Family, and the other Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families, we must surround and eliminate these rogue cultivators!"</p><p></p><p>The Elders pursued them in their chase.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master's expression was grim. The sect could not be left without a Refining Spirit expert to guard it, and as the Sect Master, he could not leave.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he turned and returned to the main hall, ordering, "All servants and disciples, listen closely, be on high alert to defend against any attacks!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect was on high alert, with all the servants and disciples heightening their vigilance.</p><p></p><p>Inside the main hall, the Jade Spirit Sect Master's expression was grave. Where in Yuzhou did so many Refining Spirit Rogue Cultivators come from? It must be the powerful experts of that mysterious rogue cultivator force, their ambitions posing a great threat to the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to convene a meeting of the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families to address this matter!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Surging power, he was about to rush out of the main hall, but layer after layer of mist enveloped the area, and illusions of phoenixes, swords, and thunder appeared, as if a grand formation had trapped the entire main hall.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect Master's expression changed greatly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He struck out forcefully, the main hall collapsing, but outside was only thick mist, and he could not sense the movements within the mist, nor the situation outside.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 10 - The Disciple's Engagement Broken Off (Please collect and continue reading)</p><p></p><p>The first day after Xu Yan's departure, Li Xuan got up early and went out, but he didn't see that diligent training figure, nor did anyone cook for him. He had to do the feeding of the chickens and the planting of the vegetables by himself.</p><p></p><p>He felt uneasy all over.</p><p></p><p>On the second day after Xu Yan's departure, Li Xuan started to feel anxious again.</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple, he couldn't have died in the evil demon forest, right?"</p><p></p><p>"He came back safely twice before, so he should be fine this time too, right?"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the fifth day after Xu Yan's departure, Li Xuan came to the hillside outside the village, looking in the direction Xu Yan had left, but he didn't see anyone coming.</p><p></p><p>He heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I've been exposed, those who want to arrest me as a fraud wouldn't come so quickly."</p><p></p><p>"Will I really be exposed?"</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, that foolish Xu Yan isn't very smart, but since he comes from a good background, there should be smarter people, right?"</p><p></p><p>"If I get exposed, won't I be in trouble?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mind was in a mess, and he was quite worried.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the tenth day after Xu Yan's departure, Li Xuan stood on the hillside, keeping an eye out, ready to hide and run if he sensed anything amiss.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple, he couldn't have died in the evil demon forest, and not returned home, right?"</p><p></p><p>"Or maybe he's been confined?"</p><p></p><p>The more he thought about it, the more muddled his mind became. Li Xuan cursed under his breath, "Fuck! It's not like I forced him to be deceived, it was his own lack of intelligence, how can you blame me for it?"</p><p></p><p>"I'm doing so poorly, it's so embarrassing!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, feeling that as a transmigrator, he was doing too poorly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the eleventh day, Xu Yan finally returned.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple has returned!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the respectful Xu Yan, and that only he had come back, without a group of people to arrest the fraud that Li Xuan was, Li Xuan felt a great sense of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, good that you're back!"</p><p></p><p>His expression remained calm and indifferent, as if he had already known Xu Yan would return.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this is a small token from your disciple."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan placed two long boxes on the table.</p><p></p><p>"That's thoughtful of you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained tranquil as he reached out to open one of the boxes.</p><p></p><p>Inside was a sword, the scabbard entirely golden, engraved with auspicious clouds and auspicious beast patterns, inlaid with red, white, and blue gemstones, nine in total.</p><p></p><p>What a treasure!</p><p></p><p>Just a glance showed it was priceless, and Li Xuan was inwardly excited. This foolish disciple's background was even richer than he had imagined.</p><p></p><p>His face remained calm and indifferent, as if he wasn't moved at all.</p><p></p><p>He reached out and picked up the precious sword from the box. It was a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>The scabbard was inlaid with nine gemstones on each side, a total of eighteen gemstones, each of which was of great value.</p><p></p><p>The hilt was inlaid with two larger red gemstones.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gently drew the sword out of the scabbard, and a golden light flashed before his eyes - this was a sword entirely forged of gold!</p><p></p><p>He sheathed the sword and placed it back in the box.</p><p></p><p>While Li Xuan's face remained calm and tranquil, his heart was already trembling with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"I've hit the jackpot. This sword can be passed down as a family heirloom. In the future, when I flee to the Wu state, I won't have to worry about anything."</p><p></p><p>His face revealed a slight look of approval as he said, "You have such a heart, your master is very pleased. Although this sword is mundane, it can still be enjoyed."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan was immediately overjoyed and hurriedly said, "I'm so glad Master likes it!"</p><p></p><p>"Master truly is a hidden immortal. Such a priceless treasure of a sword, yet he remains completely unmoved, only thinking of it as something to play with."</p><p></p><p>His admiration for his master rose even higher.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan opened the second box, and inside was a flawless jade ruyi scepter. His eyes lit up slightly - this jade ruyi scepter was clearly a treasure as well.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Thing!</p><p></p><p>"Correct!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I also brought some precious medicinal materials."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took off the package and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his eyebrows and thought to himself, "Has he also discovered that after taking these rare tonics, his body has improved? Feeling that it is beneficial for cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"As for these tonics, just use them as usual, and measure them carefully."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at them, there were no nine-leaf yuan zhi or thousand-year mountain ginseng, but there were two five-leaf yuan zhi and three hundred-year mountain ginseng, which were also rare herbs.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan placed the herbs properly and began to tidy up the room, preparing to cook.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was satisfied, this disciple was sensible, and as soon as he came back, he knew to get the work done.</p><p></p><p>"Huh? What's wrong? He looks so dejected, did something happen?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan noticed that although Xu Yan was working, his expression was quite dejected, and his heart skipped a beat. Could it be that someone had reminded him this time he came home, causing him to have some doubts?</p><p></p><p>Or perhaps, after a long time without feeling the flow of qi and blood, without entering the refinement phase, he had suffered a setback upon returning home and felt discouraged?</p><p></p><p>"I can't let him get depressed, it has come to this, if I don't continue to deceive him, he might fall into a trap."</p><p></p><p>"I must boost his confidence!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought this way, and then spoke, "Disciple, why are you so dejected? Is it something related to your cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's hand paused while wiping the table, and he said in a somewhat dispirited manner, "Master, it's not about my cultivation, it's that... this time I came home, I was called off the engagement!"</p><p></p><p>Huh?</p><p></p><p>Called off the engagement?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback, muttering to himself, "Called off the engagement? Your name is Xu Yan, not Xiao Yan, so it's not a problem, it must be a sad story!"</p><p></p><p>"What happened? Why was the engagement called off?"</p><p></p><p>He showed an expression of a master concerned for his disciple.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked dejected, hanging his head as he said, "She said I'm not smart enough, and being with me would be embarrassing."</p><p></p><p>She's right, your brain is indeed not very smart!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He stood up and patted Xu Yan's shoulder, no matter what, he still needed to comfort his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"You are my disciple, being called off the engagement means she is short-sighted."</p><p></p><p>"Master is right, that's what I think too."</p><p></p><p>"Did you yell at her, 'For thirty years the river flows east, for thirty years the river flows west, don't bully the poor young man'?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan coughed and asked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked puzzled at his master and said, "Master, I'm not poor!"</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow twitched, feeling a sting in his heart!</p><p></p><p>He immediately said in a serious tone, "Disciple, where are you not poor? When I say you are poor, is it about your wealth? No! It's about your cultivation, your strength, your martial arts knowledge!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly felt ashamed and said, "Master, you are right, I am poor, I am very poor!"</p><p></p><p>Then he added, "But Master, don't worry, I haven't lost my ambition. Although I didn't yell 'don't bully the poor young man', I also told her, 'Today you mock me, insult me, and abandon me, one day you will regret it, you are not worthy of me!'"</p><p></p><p>Saying this, Xu Yan slightly raised his head, his eyes resolute.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, muttering to himself, "This kid, why do I have a feeling he's a chosen one? It must be an illusion!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, disciple, your spirit is very good."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw that Xu Yan still had some dejection in his eyes, so he continued, "Being called off the engagement may not be a bad thing for you, you must know that it is through setbacks that one can rise up bravely."</p><p></p><p>"The ancient geniuses, none of them did not rise up from adversity."</p><p></p><p>"In the path of cultivation, it requires enlightenment, a clear mind, and self-realization!"</p><p></p><p>Patting Xu Yan's shoulder, Li Xuan said seriously, "Disciple, there is a saying, 'With no woman in the heart, cultivation is as if with a divine being.' Since you have been called off the engagement, your heart is free of a woman, free of desires, and you will surely make great progress!"</p><p></p><p>Seeking votes, seeking everything.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

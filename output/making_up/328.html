        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two elders of the Qianwu Hall, looking at the place where the Spirit Realm Gate originally stood, found it empty - where had the Spirit Realm Gate gone? Their hearts were trembling, and their scalps were numb.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang was also stunned. He felt a chill throughout his body, his vision darkened, and he almost collapsed to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm Gate had disappeared, and Zheng's country's mission no longer existed. How could they maintain their unique status? How could they continue to enjoy the protection of the Superb Spirit Sect? Thinking about this, Zheng Huang was almost on the verge of a breakdown.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, let me go see if those two scoundrels have completed the opening!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang said as he rushed frantically into the hall.</p><p></p><p>"Open the Spirit Realm Gate, open it all!"</p><p></p><p>He said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The two guarding warriors, seeing Zheng Huang's troubled expression, hurriedly opened the Spirit Realm Gate completely.</p><p></p><p>After confirming that the Spirit Realm Gate was fully opened, Zheng Huang hurriedly passed through the hall, but the place where the Spirit Realm Gate had been was still empty.</p><p></p><p>His vision suddenly darkened, and his legs weakened.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm Gate has been fully opened?" </p><p></p><p>One of the Qianwu Hall elders asked in a deep voice. Even he couldn't help but notice his voice slightly trembling.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, it has all been opened, completely opened, without any problems at all!" </p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang knelt on the ground and reported.</p><p></p><p>"This..." </p><p></p><p>The two Qianwu Hall elders had an expression of disbelief, and their hearts were trembling.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm Gate, which had existed for countless years and connected the inner realm, had disappeared?</p><p></p><p>This was a shocking event that shook the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>"What should we do?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter cannot be leaked out. Go back and report to the Hall Master to make further plans."</p><p></p><p>"There's no other choice."</p><p></p><p>The two elders communicated through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>"The matter of the disappearance of the Spirit Realm Gate, you two and I are the only ones who know. Understand?"</p><p></p><p>One of the elders said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang's face was deathly pale as he nodded and said, "Yes, my lord, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>The two elders nodded.</p><p></p><p>If Zheng Huang wasn't a special case, they would have killed him to silence him, but that would have drawn the attention of the other Superb Spirit Sects.</p><p></p><p>Back in the hall.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm Gate is closed. From today on, without the order of the Qianwu Hall, no one is allowed to open the Spirit Realm Gate!"</p><p></p><p>The Qianwu Hall elder said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>The two guarding warriors hurriedly closed the Spirit Realm Gate.</p><p></p><p>Although they felt it was strange that the two great lords first opened the Spirit Realm Gate and now closed it, they didn't dare to ask further. The less they knew about the secrets of such powerful figures, the safer they would be.</p><p></p><p>The two Qianwu Hall elders, along with Zheng Huang, left the hall after giving him further instructions.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Zheng Huang went to the hall under the pretext of inspection, openly executed the guarding warriors for dereliction of duty, and replaced them.</p><p></p><p>This was a trivial matter. Zheng Huang was unhappy and simply killed two guarding warriors, and no one cared.</p><p></p><p>No one knew about the disappearance of the Spirit Realm Gate.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang didn't dare to reveal even a hint of it, not even to the other Superb Spirit Sects, or he would be dead for sure.</p><p></p><p>As for the two Qianwu Hall elders, they were hurriedly rushing back to the Qianwu Hall.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A Stranger Appears in the Imperial Palace</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan had honed his mind in the palace of the Qi Emperor, but the imperial palace of the Great Zhou is far beyond the comparison of the palace of a frontier kingdom. The Great Zhou Emperor seems to have quite good taste."</p><p></p><p>"The dances of the martial artists are so beautiful - their postures, their supple waists, their difficult movements... The cultivation method of the Great Zhou Emperor is from the Fire Dao, so it seems his fire qi has always been quite vigorous."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat atop a false mountain, watching the palace ladies of the Great Zhou Emperor dance, and couldn't help but sigh in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor possessed a fierce and violent power within him, cultivating a method from the Fire Dao, whose power was not weak. Perhaps it was because of this that his fire qi was so vigorous.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wandered through the palace of the Great Zhou, eventually arriving at the Imperial Archives. With a leisurely pace, he stepped inside.</p><p></p><p>Although powerful guardians protected the Imperial Archives, Li Xuan paid them no mind. In an instant, the extraordinary doors of the universe silently opened before him, and in the eyes of the guarding martial artists, everything remained as it was - no one had approached, and no one had entered the Imperial Archives.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan strolled through the Imperial Archives, ascending to the topmost level where the most precious treasures were stored, where he could find the items that piqued his interest.</p><p></p><p>Sitting down in a chair at the top, he waved his hand, and a tome flew over to him. Li Xuan then leisurely perused the Great Zhou's collection, including cultivation methods and secret histories.</p><p></p><p>While Su Ling and the others were enjoying the bustling capital of the Great Zhou, Li Xuan was leisurely browsing through the treasures of the Great Zhou imperial family in the Imperial Archives.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, Xu Yan had arrived in Chenzhou, seeking out Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao hurried over after receiving the message, with Yue Changming by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Junior Brother, you've been doing well as the Vice Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, not bad!" Fang Hao chuckled. Although he was only the Vice Sect Master, he was now the true leader of the Wanshi Sect.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the communication talisman, a new communication system was established. And with the deployment of the teleportation arrays, connecting numerous major cities, travel became much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>Chenzhou was undergoing earth-shaking changes. Scattered cultivators flocked there, and even some Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families wanted to establish branches in Chenzhou. </p><p></p><p>The miraculous teleportation arrays had shocked the Spiritual Realm, also impacting the dominance of the Spiritual Sects. Travel between cities became swift and convenient, with a surge of people, making Chenzhou increasingly prosperous.</p><p></p><p>However, everyone knew that the Transcendent Spiritual Sect would not sit idly by and watch the Wanshi Sect continue to grow stronger. They were just waiting for the right moment, planning to crush the Wanshi Sect in the coming battle of geniuses.</p><p></p><p>They were even brewing some kind of action.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, cultivators from all over continued to flock to Chenzhou, even if just to experience the wonders of the teleportation arrays. Imperceptibly, Chenzhou was becoming the center of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The two brothers chatted for a long time, and Xu Yan mentioned his upcoming trip to the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, do you have a flying ship?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>He had come for the flying ship, as the vast Azure Sea would be much more convenient with one, making his journey easier.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, since you are going to the Azure Sea to search for treasures, you will need to enter the sea. I will refine a flying ship for you that can submerge into the sea."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"That's perfect. There are a few places in the Azure Sea that I need to explore thoroughly, and with a flying ship to assist, it will be much more convenient."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Brother, please wait a few days, and I will refine the flying ship for you."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao began refining the flying ship for Xu Yan, and one of the most important functions was the ability to submerge into the sea and travel underwater, which required careful consideration.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Fang Hao held a pale blue flying ship and said, "Elder Brother, the flying ship is ready. This ship can submerge into the sea, with the ability to avoid and part the water, and it can also determine direction."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao introduced the ship, explaining that the most significant function was the navigation pearl, which could be placed in a location. If Xu Yan ever became lost, he could activate the navigation array on the ship to return to the location of the pearl.</p><p></p><p>"However, the array may also be interfered with, and the farther the distance, the greater the possibility of losing the navigation. Within a thousand miles, the navigation power will be strongest, so Elder Brother must still be cautious."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao reminded him.</p><p></p><p>"Understood."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. The arrays could indeed be affected by interference, and the extent of the interference in the Black Abyss was unknown, so he would need to be very careful.</p><p></p><p>"Since this flying ship can submerge into the sea, let's call it the Submerging Sea Ship."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, holding the azure blue flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"Before the battle of geniuses, I will return."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"I await the day when Elder Brother crushes the geniuses of the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, the top four on the Genius Ranking, we'll take them all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed, then rose into the air, a flying ship about ten feet long appearing and turning into a blue light as it flew away.</p><p></p><p>"The Azure Sea..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sighed wistfully.</p><p></p><p>Ever since joining the Wanshi Sect and becoming the Vice Sect Master, he knew he could no longer wander freely like his Elder Brother and Elder Sister.</p><p></p><p>"Envious of your Elder Brother's carefree and unrestrained life?"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming smiled and asked.</p><p></p><p>"A bit, but I'll be able to do that soon enough."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Sect was just a stage in his martial dao journey, and he would not be trapped within it. As the landscape of the Spiritual Realm changed, he would put down the affairs of the Wanshi Sect and walk his own extraordinary martial path, becoming as carefree and unrestrained as his Elder Brother and Elder Sister.</p><p></p><p>Traveling the world, defeating all geniuses!</p><p></p><p>"I feel that Chenzhou will become a storm center."</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming sighed.</p><p></p><p>The more miraculous the teleportation arrays, the greater the storm they would bring. The current calm was merely the calm before the storm, and once it erupted, it would be beyond imagination in its ferocity.</p><p></p><p>"Even if the storm is mighty, it's just the failure of the Wanshi Sect. Can it blow me down?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao smiled.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming nodded. No matter how powerful the storm, it was just the failure of the Wanshi Sect. Who could truly harm Fang Hao?</p><p></p><p>After all, he had a peerless expert as his teacher.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the small pavilion of the flying ship, Xu Yan added enough spirit stones to power the ship, then began cultivating and comprehending his own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a pale blue light and sped towards the direction of the Azure Sea, faster than even peak Refined Spirit Celestials.</p><p></p><p>One day, the flying ship entered the misty and cloudy sky.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened his eyes and looked around.</p><p></p><p>"We've arrived at Wuzhou."</p><p></p><p>Wuzhou, one of the eighteen states of the Spiritual Realm, was named for its abundant clouds and mist, and was connected to the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan planned to enter the Azure Sea from Wuzhou, heading to the Azure Sky Azure Sea City.</p><p></p><p>After finding Xie Lingfeng and passing on the cultivation method, he would then explore the Black Abyss and the Azure Sea Abyss.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 415</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This drop of blood contained terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Even though he was an Immortal Lord, and his strength had increased, and he had cultivated divine abilities, facing this drop of blood, he still felt unable to resist it. </p><p></p><p>Even if it wouldn't kill him, it would still severely injure him!</p><p></p><p>The power permeating from this drop of blood had already been weakened by the barrier of heaven and earth. Otherwise, it would have been enough to destroy him.</p><p></p><p>An existence above the Immortal realm? </p><p></p><p>A Blood Spirit from the Netherworld Prison? Feng Yan's expression changed drastically - the crisis was upon them! The Great Yue Emperor's expression also changed as he exclaimed: "A drop of Netherworld Bone Blood, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow and pointed his spear. With a boom, the drop of Netherworld Bone Blood was instantly shattered by him, dissipating into a blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>An attack from beyond the Immortal realm?</p><p></p><p>A Blood Spirit from the Netherworld Prison? Li Xuan took a step forward and arrived at the core area of the Heavenly Cave, looking up towards the outside of the barrier of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Feng Yan felt as if he had been given a new lease on life. He grabbed the corpses of the three Blood Children and hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>A cold voice came from outside the barrier of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The karmic consequences of my name are not something an insect like you can bear."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said indifferently. </p><p></p><p>Although what came to the Heavenly Cave was an Extreme Soul Body, it was not a clone after all, so it was no different from his true self.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Eye of the Heavenly Dao appeared.</p><p></p><p>What the Extreme Soul Body saw was also what Li Xuan saw, and Li Xuan could also use the Eye of the Heavenly Dao through the Extreme Soul Body.</p><p></p><p>The Dao principles surrounded him, and the power of the Dao principles formed a barrier, blocking stronger forces from outside the world from entering, preventing stronger enemies from outside from invading.</p><p></p><p>Was this the world's self-protection? Yet the barrier of heaven and earth also prevented martial artists inside from leaving and going beyond the barrier.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was already very familiar with the Taicang world, especially regarding the Dao principles. Under the Eye of the Heavenly Dao, he saw even more.</p><p></p><p>Chaos, darkness, and a blood-colored haze appeared outside the world. A figure with a blood-colored long beard and cold eyes stood within the blood-colored haze.</p><p></p><p>It was the Blood Spirit from the Netherworld Prison who had attacked.</p><p></p><p>"So that's all there is to it."</p><p></p><p>After seeing the other's strength, Li Xuan's gaze was calm. Although this Blood Spirit's strength was above the Immortal realm, compared to himself, it was still quite lacking.</p><p></p><p>"So my current strength is actually much stronger than the realm above Immortal, at least comparable to about two realms above Immortal?"</p><p></p><p>Even if not quite that strong, it wouldn't be far off.</p><p></p><p>Although he was at the Void-breaking realm, his strength was amplified a hundredfold after all, and couldn't be judged by normal Void-breaking realm standards.</p><p></p><p>The overlapping of five martial paths and numerous divine abilities were all beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>That Blood Spirit coldly exclaimed, raising his hand as an even deeper red blood drop began to condense. He was preparing to attack again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled faintly and raised his spear, pointing towards the outside world.</p><p></p><p>Although there was the barrier of heaven and earth blocking the way, with his understanding of the Taicang Dao principles, it wasn't difficult for him to bypass the barrier's obstruction and send this attack through.</p><p></p><p>"I am here in this realm, insects are not allowed to disturb!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's indifferent voice also transmitted out.</p><p></p><p>Poof! This attack, although Li Xuan seemed calm and relaxed, was actually almost a full-power strike of the Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit who was about to attack suddenly felt his soul tremble in fear.</p><p></p><p>A suffocating feeling arose, his soul trembled, and his expression changed drastically. Even if he wanted to flee, it was already too late. His soul seemed to have been locked onto.</p><p></p><p>A point of cold light appeared within his soul.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Blood Spirit's aura erupted, blood light soared to the sky, and a barrier condensed on his rolling blood-filled soul. This was a soul defense technique!</p><p></p><p>However, this soul defense technique seemed so fragile, like it was made of paper, and was instantly pierced through by the cold light.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The Blood Spirit fell, his eyes completely empty. His soul had been annihilated, his aura completely gone, his life force completely extinguished.</p><p></p><p>"I'll leave your corpse intact, let's see who else dares to come and disturb."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>As for whether killing this Blood Spirit would offend stronger beings from the Netherworld Prison, Li Xuan didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>If stronger beings could enter the Taicang world, could enter the Divine Realm, they would have come long ago.</p><p></p><p>For example, Mei Wu definitely hated him to death. If she could come in, she would have come to seek revenge on him long ago.</p><p></p><p>"When I break through to the Heaven and Earth realm, I'll be even stronger, and won't fear at all!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was completely calm.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, several strands of undying qi entered the barrier of heaven and earth, forming a sealing restriction. With this seal in place, even Blood Spirits from the Netherworld Prison would not be able to permeate their power in.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Blood Children entering the Heavenly Cave would also be weakened.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu wanted to turn the Great Yue Heavenly Cave into a Heavenly Furnace. If the permeation from outside the world was sealed off, it would mean fewer materials for refining in the Heavenly Furnace.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned and left, having already put away his Extreme Dao Soul Weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, set it up yourself. There won't be any invasions from the Netherworld Prison for a while."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was overjoyed upon hearing this. "Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" </p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor and others hurriedly bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, took a step, and disappeared from the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Cave has been pacified. You should all go support the Myriad Thunder Sect and Heavenly Martial Gate."</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor said to the other Immortal Lords.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>The group of Immortal Lords all left to support the Heavenly Martial Gate and Myriad Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>The battle of the Qinghua Realm Heavenly Cave came to an end in this way.</p><p></p><p>Post-war matters also needed some time to deal with.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and the others returned. Fang Hao continued to conceive his grand formation, Su Lingxiu was also preparing for the Heavenly Furnace, and Jiang Buping was absorbing and comprehending the gains from this battle.</p><p></p><p>As the Qinghua Realm Heavenly Cave battle gradually subsided, the chaos in the Nine Mountains Realm showed no signs of abating. Instead, it became increasingly chaotic, with unending battles.</p><p></p><p>All nine major forces were involved, in complete disarray. There were also Blood Children from the Netherworld Prison causing slaughter. The entire Nine Mountains Realm had become a chaotic battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As the core disciples of the major forces fell one after another, even though there were factors of Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow behind it, all the major forces had also become red-eyed with anger, engaging in chaotic killing without end.</p><p></p><p>"Another realm has fallen into chaos."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up towards a certain place where the fluctuations of the world's laws were violent. Clearly another great battle had erupted, and another realm had fallen into chaos.</p><p></p><p>"What will ultimately happen to the 36 realms of the Divine Realm? Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow have infiltrated too deeply."</p><p></p><p>The chaos in the Divine Realm could no longer be stopped.</p><p></p><p>The unification of heaven and earth was perhaps tacitly permitted by some powerful beings, who did not strongly intervene, clearly also observing to see how far Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow could go.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Fang Hao also summoned the Great Yue Emperor, the Sect Master of the Myriad Thunder Sect, the Master of the Heavenly Martial Gate, and several other strongest and most influential Immortal Lords of the Qinghua Realm to begin his grand plan.</p><p></p><p>"Set up a grand formation for the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. Once the formation is set up, the entire Qinghua Realm will be without worry. Let alone Blood Children from the Netherworld Prison, even Blood Spirits from the Netherworld Prison can be destroyed by harnessing the power of the Qinghua Realm's heaven and earth through the formation.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the formation is set up, the Qinghua Realm will be able to stay out of the great chaos, accumulating powerful strength. The Heavenly Cave will no longer be a threat.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, once my junior sister succeeds in using the Heavenly Cave as a Heavenly Furnace, not only can higher-grade pills be refined, but treasures from outside the world can also be captured to refine into pills.</p><p></p><p>"More importantly, the spiritual energy of the Qinghua Realm will be enhanced, and it will be able to draw upon the rhythm of the Dao principles."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"...descend, and in this way we can break through in the Qinghua Realm," As Fang Hao explained and persuaded, Great Yue Emperor and the others were shocked, their minds already envisioning the Qinghua Realm covered by the great formation, the heavenly cave transformed into a divine furnace, with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth surging.</p><p></p><p>And they would use this to break through the limits of the Immortal Realm. </p><p></p><p>Being able to break through to the Immortal Realm in the Qinghua Realm was an incredibly tempting prospect. No Immortal Lord could resist such temptation.</p><p></p><p>If successful, the Qinghua Realm would truly become as solid as iron, and the chaos of the Divine Realm would not be able to affect it. Even if the Blood Spirits of the Netherworld descended, they could mobilize the might of heaven and earth in the Qinghua Realm to destroy them.</p><p></p><p>No matter how strong the Blood Spirits of the Netherworld were, how could they resist the vast might of heaven and earth in the Qinghua Realm?</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Lords were no match for the Blood Spirits of the Netherworld simply because the area of heaven and earth they controlled was too small.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good, we'll follow all of Brother Fang's arrangements!" Great Yue Emperor said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, we'll follow all of Brother Fang's arrangements!"</p><p></p><p>"Whatever is needed, Brother Fang, just say the word. This formation must succeed."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of Ten Thousand Thunders and the Master of Heavenly Martial Gate also spoke excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then it's settled. Once the great formation is complete, no matter how chaotic the Divine Realm becomes, the Qinghua Realm will be safe," Fang Hao said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Using the entire Qinghua Realm as a great formation was no easy task, nor could it be completed overnight. Fang Hao would be busy from now on. Even with the assistance of the Immortal Lords, the actual arrangement of the formation would still require his personal touch.</p><p></p><p>Some less important, non-core formation arrangements, as well as the refining of formation treasures, could be entrusted to the other members of the Qimen Academy.</p><p></p><p>The entire Qinghua Realm began to buzz with activity. To prevent information leaks, the gates of the Qinghua Realm were closed, not allowing anyone to enter.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu, along with Yue'er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu, were also busy. In the end, even Cai Ling'er was pulled in to help, preparing for the arrangement of the divine furnace of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I want to go to the Nine Mountains Realm."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping emerged from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to venture out, and the chaos in the Nine Mountains Realm was the perfect place for him to make a name for himself. Moreover, his first and second senior brothers were also in the Nine Mountains Realm, confronting the Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow.</p><p></p><p>The three brothers would join forces and establish their reputation!</p><p></p><p>"Go then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and waved his hand, sending a jade talisman into Jiang Buping's body.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>Little Ha hopped over, also wanting to return to the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, his big brother and second brother were busy working for the cause of the demon race, how could he remain idle?</p><p></p><p>It was perfect to go to the Nine Mountains Realm with Jiang Buping. With Jiang Buping there, crossing the realm gates wouldn't be so dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu made time to see them off.</p><p></p><p>"These are communication talismans that can transmit messages unhindered throughout the entire Divine Realm. Take them and give them to your first and second senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>"These are my latest formation discs, also take them to your first and second senior brothers."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out a stack of communication talismans and a pile of formation discs and handed them to Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"Take these pills with you, and also bring some for your first and second senior brothers. Your Extreme Soul Martial Arts makes your soul unchanging, so it shouldn't be easily damaged, but we can't rule out unexpected situations.</p><p></p><p>"So, this bottle contains pills I've refined that can heal and restore the soul. Moreover, they're specially made for you, junior brother. I've infused a trace of unchanging qi into them to enhance their effects.</p><p></p><p>"The unchanging qi is no longer harmful to you, junior brother. Combined with the effects of the pills, it's enough to restore any damage to your unchanging soul."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu handed some pills to Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Among them were pills specially prepared for Jiang Buping. Although she couldn't refine the unchanging qi herself, she could infuse it into the pills.</p><p></p><p>And these pills containing unchanging qi were perfect for Jiang Buping's Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, third senior sister and fourth senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping carefully put away all the items.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, take these to Red Cat."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also gave some pills to Little Ha, these were for Red Cat and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>Little Ha nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother will be waiting in the Qinghua Realm to hear of junior brother's fame!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I definitely won't disappoint senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping nodded solemnly with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple is leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping bowed respectfully to his master.</p><p></p><p>"Go then, and study the Extreme Soul Martial Arts manual well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded calmly.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Jiang Buping, accompanied by Little Ha, arrived at the gates of the Qinghua Realm, stepped into the realm gate, and entered the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>The abandoned son of Taikun had finally, at this moment, set foot on the path of counterattack and rise to power.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was in chaos, with battles raging unceasingly.</p><p></p><p>At Mount Dagai, the Immortal Lords of the Wan family were facing off against the Immortal Lords of Mount Qiandie and Mount Hengfeng. They had already engaged in one great battle.</p><p></p><p>The entire Mount Dagai was now in chaos. The Blood Disciples of the Netherworld had infiltrated and were killing indiscriminately. Moreover, a Blood Son had entered Mount Dagai, seemingly waiting for an opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At a certain place on Mount Dagai, a golden giant, holding a huge blade, surrounded by wind and thunder, with a great sun suspended above its head, was domineering and awe-inspiring, like a god of heaven.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>A blade strike rolled with wind and thunder, falling like the end of the world.</p><p></p><p>Puff! A fierce-looking masked person was completely slain under this blade strike, disintegrating into ashes! On the other side, layers upon layers of sword light, sword intent reflecting in the sky, an image of rivers and mountains inverted, enveloped three fierce-looking masked people.</p><p></p><p>Puff! As the common people wielded swords and slashed within the image of inverted rivers and mountains, black sword light seemed to extinguish everything. The fierce-looking masked people fell one after another under this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>This was the headquarters of Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow on Mount Dagai, and today was the day to uproot them.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong broke through to the Divine Image Realm, he and Xu Yan began to retaliate against Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow. Using the members of Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow controlled by the Heaven's Will Fixing Palm, they obtained the locations of various strongholds one by one, killing some and releasing others. By now, all strongholds had been uprooted.</p><p></p><p>And today was the day to destroy the headquarters of Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow on Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>With the Nine Mountains Realm in chaos, Mount Hengfeng and Mount Qiandie each had powerful figures accusing Xu Yan and Meng Chong of killing their talented descendants. The Wan family of Mount Dagai was under great pressure.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, some talented individuals from Mount Dagai had also been killed. Although they knew it was a plot by Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow, they couldn't change the chaotic situation. In the entire Nine Mountains Realm, the Wan family was the only family force.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, they became the main target of Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow, especially since Xu Yan and Meng Chong were on Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Wan family didn't have a single Immortal Lord who was a member of Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow, so Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow couldn't truly infiltrate the core of the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, there will be no more Heaven's Bane and Earth's Shadow forces on Mount Dagai. This also repays the Wan family for blocking the Immortal Lords."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood holding his sword, the sword intent from the great battle still lingering slightly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if it would never dissipate.</p><p></p><p>This place would become a treasure trove for sword cultivators to practice.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a blood light appeared, and a powerful aura enveloped the area.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

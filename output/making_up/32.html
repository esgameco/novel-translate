        <h1>Chapter 32</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 32: Mastering the Art of Violent Enemy Slaying</p><p></p><p>"Who's there!" </p><p></p><p>Elder Bear roared, grabbing the large machete by his feet and glaring at the sudden figure that had appeared.</p><p></p><p>One look, and his scalp went numb!</p><p></p><p>The scorching, fiery aura was truly intimidating.</p><p></p><p>"It's the fool son of Lord Xu!" </p><p></p><p>One of the mountain bandits exclaimed in shock.</p><p></p><p>The rest were also horrified, having heard rumors that Lord Xu's fool son was seeking out hidden masters to learn true martial arts. </p><p></p><p>Could it be that he had succeeded?</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" </p><p></p><p>Elder Bear howled, leaping forward to charge at Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Kill him! He's just one person!"</p><p></p><p>Over a hundred mountain bandits, with the weakest being second-rate fighters, and Elder Bear being an almost peerless expert. </p><p></p><p>Even top-tier masters usually had over twenty men.</p><p></p><p>Knives, guns, hidden weapons - they all converged on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Come at me!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was exhilarated. With a thunderous boom, he unleashed his ten-zhang aura, charging straight at them.</p><p></p><p>The ten-zhang aura swept across, and with each punch and kick from Xu Yan, the power was immense. The group of mountain bandits were instantly crushed, with heavy casualties.</p><p></p><p>Elder Bear was directly punched to death.</p><p></p><p>Blood and flesh flew everywhere, horrifying the remaining bandits.</p><p></p><p>"Run away!"</p><p></p><p>What kind of peerless expert was this? Too terrifying! They couldn't even get close before being instantly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>The rest of the bandits fled in terror.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can get away?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, charging after them.</p><p></p><p>"My master said to be low-key, but if I kill them all, no one will know it was me. This is being low-key!"</p><p></p><p>The battle was a foregone conclusion, a complete steamroll. All the bandits were slaughtered without a single one escaping.</p><p></p><p>After searching the Black Wind Mountain, he couldn't find the goods his family had lost, nor any hidden bandits.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the mountain, looking at the scattered limbs and severed body parts, Xu Yan's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>"My strength is indeed powerful, but I only know how to use brute force. If I encounter an opponent of equal strength, I would definitely lose.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know any martial arts techniques, only crude strength.</p><p></p><p>"This time when I return, I must ask my master for guidance!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, taking advantage of the dark and windy night to hurry down the mountain and return to the East River Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan left, Li Xuan carefully reviewed the self-created cultivation theory and framework for the Innate Realm, confirming there were no omissions and that it could be seamlessly connected to the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Only then did he truly feel at ease.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to find an opportunity to pass the Innate Realm cultivation method to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Cultivation was such a arduous task, of course it should be left to the disciple to handle. He only needed to casually fabricate the realm, cultivation framework, basic theory, and a rough cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>Whether it succeeded or not would depend entirely on his disciple, Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"It's about time I leave this place. Hiding in this small village since transmigrating has been too miserable."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed wistfully.</p><p></p><p>He packed up his belongings, waiting for Xu Yan's return to move out.</p><p></p><p>With nothing to do, Li Xuan strolled around the small village. He had to admit, the scenery was quite nice, and it was extremely suitable for a reclusive life.</p><p></p><p>After a round, he returned to his residence.</p><p></p><p>"Without a disciple to serve me, I have to cook for myself. It feels a bit unfamiliar."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had gotten used to being attended to. Now that there was no one to serve him, he felt a bit uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple violently crushed a group of mountain bandits. Your mastery of violent enemy slaying is complete."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A voice suddenly rang out in his mind, instantly imparting to him the methods of violent and brutal enemy slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned.</p><p></p><p>He felt as if he had experienced countless instances of violent and brutal enemy slaughter, and had completely mastered the techniques of violent enemy slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"What did my foolish disciple do? Did he just push over a whole gang of mountain bandits?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was astonished.</p><p></p><p>This foolish disciple of his, was he really that courageous?</p><p></p><p>And the external martial prowess was actually so low?</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan, who had just entered the Qi and Blood Realm, actually single-handedly pushed over an entire gang of mountain bandits?</p><p></p><p>The strength of these mountain bandits was really too weak, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>"Too violent, too brutal, this is simply relying entirely on brute force to slay enemies!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan received feedback, and his violent enemy slaughter had reached perfection.</p><p></p><p>It was truly relying entirely on brute force, charging and crashing through, without the slightest bit of martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan realized that he had only been blindly concocting cultivation techniques, but he had not created any martial techniques!</p><p></p><p>With only brute force, how could he be considered a qualified martial artist?</p><p></p><p>"No, I must create some techniques to be used in battle, techniques that can fully unleash my strength."</p><p></p><p>"My foolish disciple, this time he relied on brute force to push over the mountain bandits, he should have also realized this point. When he returns this time, he will definitely come to me to ask about martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I must make preparations in advance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became troubled.</p><p></p><p>How should he create martial techniques?</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how to do it at all!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he didn't have any real-world martial technique references.</p><p></p><p>Concocting cultivation techniques was relatively easier, after all, it was just for cultivation, not for fighting against others.</p><p></p><p>"Headache!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a pained expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Let me think... Should I pass down the Eighteen Palms of the Descending Dragon to my disciple? The Six Meridian Divine Swords? The Divine Palms of Tathagata? The Arhat Fist?... How the hell do I create these?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't even know any hand-to-hand combat skills!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan was somewhat troubled.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'm thinking the wrong way. These are all for the disciple to comprehend on his own. Why am I so obsessed with techniques? The martial dao I've created, the Qi and Blood Aura, the Primordial True Qi, and so on, are essentially about the application of Qi and True Qi in combat.</p><p></p><p>"I just need to pass down the martial technique incantations and rough theories to my disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Let him comprehend it himself!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight struck Li Xuan's mind, and he immediately figured out how he should pass down martial techniques and cultivation methods to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The starting point cannot be too high. Since it's the martial dao, I'll just pass down some palm techniques or the like to him. But I can make them a bit more advanced, and as his strength increases, I can keep upgrading them.</p><p></p><p>"He'll need body techniques as well, right?</p><p></p><p>"Sword techniques should also be included, right? No, what sword techniques should I pass down to him? I'll teach him the Dao of the Sword!</p><p></p><p>"Whether he can succeed or not, it will depend on how diligent my disciple is."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a general idea in his mind about how to create and pass down martial techniques and cultivation methods to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"My Qi and Blood has reached perfection, my strength is a hundred times that of those at the same realm. When the time comes, I'll just casually demonstrate a bit, the terrifying power displayed will surely shock my disciple.</p><p></p><p>"I'll also find some excuse to deceive him, no problem."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan went out to the village outskirts.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A hundred-zhang Qi and Blood surged towards the heavens, its might terrifying.</p><p></p><p>Waving his hands, he struck out palm after palm, the hundred-zhang Qi and Blood surging like a mighty flood, flowing and swirling with his palm movements, though it lacked any semblance of order, appearing to rely solely on brute force.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the movements of his palms even seemed a bit chaotic.</p><p></p><p>However, the flood-like Qi and Blood, with its shocking momentum, possessed terrifying power as well.</p><p></p><p>Relying solely on this terrifying Qi and Blood, he would be invincible against any army!</p><p></p><p>"The palm techniques are a bit chaotic, appearing to have no order, no technique at all, just wildly striking out. </p><p></p><p>"This won't do, even if I'm just trying to deceive my disciple, there should at least be some order to it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned in contemplation, then struck out palm after palm, trying his best to make the movements more orderly, at least making it appear less chaotic and disorganized.</p>

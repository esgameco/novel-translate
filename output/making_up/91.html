            <p>Chapter 91: The Ancient Leather-Bound Book and the Mysterious Voice</p><p></p><p>Along with the sound came a towering figure, the most eye-catching of which was his shiny bald head.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was startled!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong?!</p><p></p><p>The ministers were also shocked. Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>They were all too familiar with Meng Chong, as they often gritted their teeth in hatred towards him!</p><p></p><p>How did he come here?</p><p></p><p>And how did he manage to intrude into the court meeting?</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu abruptly stood up, with a look of shock on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Seize him!" </p><p></p><p>This was the imperial palace, the sacred ground of the court, yet Meng Chong had barged in?</p><p></p><p>Were the imperial guards and the palace guards all useless?</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, surrender!"</p><p></p><p>The military commanders in the hall were suddenly energized, as the opportunity to make a meritorious achievement had arrived.</p><p></p><p>With a roar, they rushed towards him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong extended his hand and, like picking up a chicken, threw all the military officers out.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong toss the military officers out of the hall as if they were just chicks, the ministers were almost scared out of their wits.</p><p></p><p>Among the military officers were peerless experts!</p><p></p><p>Yet they didn't even have a shred of resistance?</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was so frightened that his face turned pale, wanting to flee but unable to do so.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong grabbed him and said with a grin, "Emperor Wu, you owe me 100,000 taels of gold, a 3,000-year-old ginseng, and 10 precious herbs. You haven't forgotten, have you?"</p><p></p><p>"No... no, I haven't forgotten!" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu almost fainted from fear, trembling as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sat down on the dragon throne, took out the alliance leader's token, and with a crisp sound, he inserted it into the table, saying, "This is the alliance leader's token. Normally, you should enfeoff me as a marquis, but I don't like it, so let's skip the marquis title. Just go to your imperial treasury and bring some things to compensate me. Reasonable, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu nodded his head, "Reasonable! Reasonable!"</p><p></p><p>He just wanted to get away from the scoundrel Meng Chong, and then order the elite imperial guards to surround and kill him!</p><p></p><p>The ministers in the hall, seeing that Meng Chong wasn't paying attention to them, looked at each other and then very discreetly began to retreat, preparing to escape.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Emperor Wu lived or died, they were powerless.</p><p></p><p>After this incident, they could just replace the emperor. It was such a simple matter, no need to risk their lives.</p><p></p><p>And they couldn't even defeat him anyway.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the timid and stealthy retreating ministers and chuckled, "Emperor Wu, your ministers don't seem very loyal, do they?"</p><p></p><p>The ministers were startled and hastily stopped in their tracks.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu gritted his teeth in anger!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, we are loyal and devoted. We are going to fetch reinforcements to rescue you!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, Your Majesty, we are going to fetch reinforcements."</p><p></p><p>The ministers said awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, holding Emperor Wu, said in a deep voice, "Emperor Wu, you helped me with my revenge back then, and I won't give you a hard time. I know you're not satisfied. I've heard that the Tianyuan Guard of the Wu Kingdom is the army that guards the nation.</p><p></p><p>"I'll give you a chance. Let you mobilize the Tianyuan Guard. If they can kill me, it will be a testament to your abilities."</p><p></p><p>Thinking that his senior brother could single-handedly overwhelm the Qi Kingdom's Divine Might Army, he would then single-handedly overwhelm the Wu Kingdom's Tianyuan Guard as well.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Really?" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Could Meng Chong really be defeated by the Tianyuan Guard?</p><p></p><p>"Of course!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, then let's go to the training ground for a battle!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the ministers were all shocked and looked at Meng Chong in disbelief. Has this guy gone mad?</p><p></p><p>One person against the Tianyuan Guard?</p><p></p><p>Then they were delighted, this guy is doomed!</p><p></p><p>At the Tianyuan Guard training ground, an aura of solemnity permeated the air.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood alone in the center, surrounded by the heavily armored Tianyuan Guard.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu gritted his teeth, filled with hatred, and ordered the Tianyuan Guard commander, "Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, sir!"</p><p></p><p>The Tianyuan Guard commander solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Tianyuan Guard launched their attack, charging from all directions, completely blocking Meng Chong's retreat and evasion space.</p><p></p><p>The long spears stabbed towards Meng Chong, utilizing the impact force of the charging war horses.</p><p></p><p>However, a surprising scene unfolded.</p><p></p><p>The spears all shattered, while Meng Chong remained unharmed.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong laughed, his body emanating a jade-like golden glow, like an invincible Buddhist warrior, sweeping away the Tianyuan Guard single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>The ministers were already dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu had a blank expression on his face, muttering, "How is this possible! That voice deceived me, saying this place cannot produce martial artists. How dare it lie to me!"</p><p></p><p>As if realizing something, Emperor Wu's face turned gloomy, gritting his teeth in anger as he muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong came before Emperor Wu, patting his bald head and grinning, "So, Emperor Wu, how was it?"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu took a deep breath and said, "Meng Chong, whatever you want, I will give it to you. I can even enfeoff you as a marquis or a king!"</p><p></p><p>"Enfeoffment as a marquis or king is not necessary. Just prepare the rewards I requested. As for the marquis title, let's just exchange it for your imperial treasury."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had already made his decision.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu gritted his teeth and nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, a pile of gold ingots was placed before Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the gold, Meng Chong was silent for a moment, then said, "Let the gold stay here for now. It's inconvenient for me to carry."</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu was also straightforward.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong collected the 3,000-year-old ginseng and the ten precious herbs, signaling Emperor Wu to lead the way to the treasury.</p><p></p><p>When they arrived at the treasury, Emperor Wu did not enter.</p><p></p><p>"You can take everything, I'll give it all to you!"</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu took a deep breath and said in a solemn tone.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong entered the treasury and began selecting treasures.</p><p></p><p>"The books and such that my master needs are easy to find, but the jewelry is useless to me.</p><p></p><p>"This Wu Kingdom treasury is not good enough. Most of it is jewelry, with only a small portion of medicinal herbs. I'll take everything."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked around the treasury, somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>After becoming a martial artist, jewelry no longer held any attraction for him.</p><p></p><p>Aside from some books to bring back for his master, there wasn't much suitable.</p><p></p><p>"Let me look around some more."</p><p></p><p>This time, Meng Chong examined more carefully. Suddenly, he spotted an ancient leather-bound book on a shelf.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>It was an ancient leather-bound book, made of an unidentifiable material, looking very old.</p><p></p><p>On the cover of the ancient leather book, there were two bold characters: "Tai Cang".</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong opened the cover, but there were no words, only some lines drawn on the ancient leather, curving and twisting, as if following a certain pattern.</p><p></p><p>"I can't understand it. I'll bring it back for my master to take a look."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the ancient leather book with him.</p><p></p><p>As he left the treasury, Meng Chong said casually, "Emperor Wu, I've selected the treasures I want. Considering that you helped me with my revenge, I won't completely empty your treasury."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Wu had a gloomy expression and didn't say anything.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong came and left in a hurry. His purpose had been achieved, and the grudge against the Wu Kingdom was now completely settled. It was time to return and diligently cultivate the martial way.</p><p></p><p>After the news of Meng Chong single-handedly sweeping through the martial artists on Tianya Mountain and single-handedly overwhelming the Tianyuan Guard at the Wu Kingdom's capital spread, he shocked the Wu Kingdom once again.</p><p></p><p>Many people in the Wu Kingdom recalled the rumors about Qi Kingdom searching for a powerful expert, and were amazed. Could it be that there truly were such powerful martial artists in the world?</p><p></p><p>In a certain place in the Wu Kingdom, the renowned elder Wu Qianren, after learning about Meng Chong's feat of single-handedly overwhelming the Tianyuan Guard, ...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened, his heart deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>It seemed he had recalled something.</p><p></p><p>"Disciples, come quickly!"</p><p></p><p>Two disciples hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are your orders?"</p><p></p><p>"Hurry, pack your bags, prepare to enter the boundless mountains! Go to the boundless mountains!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Wu instructed his disciples.</p><p></p><p>In his mind, he recalled the time in his youth when he had hidden in the boundless mountains to escape his enemies. There was a special place there that he had never fully explored, fearing he wouldn't be able to find his way out.</p><p></p><p>Now he wondered, could there be an opportunity there?</p><p></p><p>"If I were 20 or 30 years younger, I would go there alone!" </p><p></p><p>Elder Wu regretted.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rode a horse, carrying the spoils of his journey, returning to Yunshan County. </p><p></p><p>He was unaware that although Wu the Emperor was shocked by the display of Meng Chong's immense power, it was merely unexpected surprise, not a complete collapse of his worldview like the court officials.</p><p></p><p>In the deep recesses of the Wu palace, there was a solitary courtyard, without eunuchs or palace maids, with only some newly sprouted weeds.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Wu walked in with an unsettled expression.</p><p></p><p>The head eunuch stopped at the courtyard entrance, only the Emperor entering.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor walked into the courtyard towards a grand hall. </p><p></p><p>Opening the hall door, to his surprise, it was a stone house!</p><p></p><p>The stone house was not large, about ten meters square, as if carved from a single massive stone.</p><p></p><p>The weathered stone house showed its great age and hardships.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor stood at the stone house entrance, his gaze clouded, expression grave.</p><p></p><p>He stepped inside, the light dimming, the gloomy stone house feeling desolate.</p><p></p><p>"Today, a man came to my palace, with his own power, crushed my Tianxuan Guards. You said there could be no true martial artists, that it was impossible. How do you explain this to me!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor suppressed his dissatisfaction and anger, speaking in a low voice that echoed in the stone house.</p><p></p><p>After a long moment, the stone house suddenly spoke.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice, as if the stone house itself was speaking, had a tone of doubt:</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists? Impossible. In the remote borderlands, the spiritual energies have long been extinguished, making it impossible to cultivate true martial artists."</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense! Meng Chong is a martial artist, what else could he be? I told you to teach me cultivation methods, but you always make excuses about the spiritual energies being extinguished to evade me!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor angrily retorted.</p><p></p><p>"Is he truly a martial artist?" </p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice remained doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Would I lie to you?"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice fell silent for a while before speaking: "Then he must be a martial artist from the Central Plains. But why would a Central Plains martial artist come here?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor coldly snorted: "In all the history of my Wu Kingdom, I have never seen a martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>"Your Wu Kingdom is too young, how could you have seen one? And even if a martial artist came, you wouldn't know."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice seemed to be reminiscing: "The last time a Central Plains martial artist came to the borderlands was... about three thousand years ago."</p><p></p><p>"I knew you would use this 'Central Plains martial artist' excuse to deceive me again. But this time, I'm telling you, he is not from the Central Plains, his name is Meng Chong, and he is from my Wu Kingdom. </p><p></p><p>He once tried to assassinate me, his strength barely matching the peak of the jianghu. But in less than a year, he has become so powerful. You still want to lie to me, saying martial arts cultivation is impossible here?"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor suppressed his fury.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible! Absolutely impossible! In the remote borderlands, there can be no martial artists!"</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice became somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>"I saw it with my own eyes, and yet you still want to deceive me? Moreover, Qi Kingdom has rumored the appearance of an unparalleled expert, an incredibly powerful martial artist who has subdued Qi Kingdom single-handedly!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor roared, his face flushed with anger.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, absolutely impossible."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice refused to believe it.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't teach me the cultivation methods, I will destroy this stone house!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor threatened.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, go ahead and destroy it, you think you can break it? You think by destroying the stone house, I'll be gone..."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice laughed in a crazed manner.</p><p></p><p>"All liars, you won't trick me again, I won't fall for it again, impossible, you can't deceive me anymore, I won't be fooled..."</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice laughed maniacally, repeatedly muttering "liars, all liars, I won't be fooled again."</p><p></p><p>The voice in the stone house gradually fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor's expression was unsettled, with anger, helplessness, and unwillingness.</p><p></p><p>He swept his gaze around the stone house, then left with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>After exiting the grand hall, closing the door, and leaving the courtyard, he glanced at the newly grown weeds.</p><p></p><p>He ordered: "As usual, pick someone from the death row and have them clear these weeds. Once done, dispose of them properly."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Majesty!"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch chief bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong returned to Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>"Master, look at this book. What is it?"</p><p></p><p>He had arranged all the books and now brought an ancient leather-bound book to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took the ancient book, immediately struck by its unusual nature. </p><p></p><p>The material was special, not ordinary animal hide. </p><p></p><p>It had an ancient feel to it. On the cover were two large characters: "Taisuang".</p><p></p><p>"Taisuang? What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled. He opened the book, seeing not words but lines, finely drawn, appearing somewhat scattered, but upon closer inspection, they formed a coherent pattern.</p><p></p><p>"Formations?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the lines and patterns, Li Xuan's first thought was that they were formations. </p><p></p><p>But on closer inspection, they did not quite resemble formations.</p><p></p><p>"Not quite formations, nor a map..."</p><p></p><p>He could not make sense of what the drawn patterns represented. His intuition told him this was no ordinary illustration.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what does this mean?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at it curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's normal that you can't understand it. One's vision and comprehension are determined by one's cultivation level and realm. Since your cultivation is still weak, you naturally can't grasp its meaning."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression remained calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>"When your cultivation improves and your realm advances, you'll understand it naturally. Don't be too eager to understand the unknown. Focus on steady cultivation, and don't let curiosity get the better of you."</p><p></p><p>I can't understand it either, but as a peerless expert, I can't let my disciple see that...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself, while outwardly instructing his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since his master did not explain, it must mean this ancient book is not something he currently needs to know about. It was likely just an ordinary relic from the Wu Emperor's treasury.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not dwell on it further and hurriedly went outside to continue his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he turned the page of the ancient book.</p><p></p><p>The second page had even more lines, seemingly depicting continuous mountain ranges, or perhaps chains, or perhaps just random scribbles.</p><p></p><p>He continued studying the mysterious illustrations.</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had Meng Shushu on his back, frantically fleeing. "My cousin, how are you doing?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's face was deathly pale, panting heavily. "I can still hold on!"</p><p></p><p>He was on the verge of tears, worried that another powerful master would show up, and sure enough, another powerful master appeared, blocking their path.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Meng Chong was fast enough, suddenly changing direction to flee, shaking off the appearing powerful master.</p><p></p><p>However, the opponent seized the opportunity, suddenly striking with a powerful attack.</p><p></p><p>Even with the distance between them, Meng Shushu could not withstand such a powerful blow, thinking he was going to die.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Meng Chong struck back with a knife, neutralizing part of the attack, and with the force of that blow, his speed increased dramatically, putting more distance between them.</p><p></p><p>Leaving that powerful master behind.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Meng Shushu was seriously injured, and Meng Chong, worried that Meng Shushu would die, painfully tossed two elixirs into his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Cousin, if you really can't escape, just leave me behind, and try to escape on your own. They may not necessarily kill me, but if you keep carrying me, you'll only be a burden!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu gritted his teeth and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, if you die, I'll suffer a big loss. Who else will I get the storage bag from?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cursed.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu's face darkened, so he was just concerned about the storage bag, huh? He felt that even if he escaped this crisis, in the future he would have to work hard for Meng Chong, coming up with ways to buy a storage bag for him.</p><p></p><p>From now on, he was afraid he could only wander in the wilderness, looking for all kinds of rare spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>This was not the life he wanted! That powerful master stubbornly chased after them, and behind him, there was another powerful master pursuing them, the one from the very beginning.</p><p></p><p>Even though they had put some distance between them and were no longer visible, he had not given up, continuing to chase them along the trail.</p><p></p><p>"Cousin, if a third powerful master comes, what are we going to do?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Are powerful masters like cabbages, coming one after another?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said gloomily.</p><p></p><p>He was also secretly shocked, his shijie's enemies had such a powerful force, with three powerful masters already appearing. One of them had been killed in the remote border region.</p><p></p><p>Now there were two chasing after them, and it was obvious that this was not the full force of their enemies' powerful masters!</p><p></p><p>"Cousin, can you tell which faction they belong to?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Daring to chase after him, this enmity would be settled when his strength improved, and he would definitely seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not sure either, hidden factions are already low-key, and these people seem even more low-key, having so many powerful master experts, yet their reputation is not prominent.</p><p></p><p>"And they also never mention the name of their own faction."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned, he had tried multiple times to get the name of their faction from them, but these people stubbornly refused to reveal it.</p><p></p><p>"They are all shady characters, powerful masters wearing hoods and only revealing their eyes, it's obvious they are not good people."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cursed as he fled frantically.</p><p></p><p>He was also worried that another powerful master might appear, and if they were surrounded, it would be truly dangerous.</p><p></p><p>"I have to find a way to shake them off."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned in thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure swiftly appeared, its speed beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly startled, about to change direction to flee, but was delighted to find that the newcomer was his shixiong, Xu Yan! "Shixiong!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came over, seeing that Meng Chong's clothes were a bit disheveled, but without any obvious injuries, he was carrying someone on his back who was seriously injured, with an extremely pale face.</p><p></p><p>"Shimei, are you not injured?"</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stopped, looking back and said, "Shixiong, that is a powerful master, look at his attire."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked up, that familiar black robe, his anger rising, "Shimei, you wait here, I'll go kill him!</p><p></p><p>"The one hiding and showing his head, daring to chase my shimei, he's tired of living."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan directly charged towards the powerful master.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was completely stunned, this young man was Meng Chong's shixiong? And he was so formidable, directly charging towards the powerful master, that was a powerful master after all!</p><p></p><p>"Shixiong, be careful, there's another powerful master behind!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hurriedly warned.</p><p></p><p>"That's even better, I'll kill them both!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't care.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's gaze narrowed, sternly shouting, "Who are you to interfere in this matter?"</p><p></p><p>"You shady character, daring to chase my shimei, today I'll cut you down!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out with his sword.</p><p></p><p>Mountain and river dragon roar!</p><p></p><p>Howl! Mountains and rivers appeared, the dragon's roar resounding.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's gaze narrowed, letting out an angry roar, his saber slashing out, the terrifying saber light pouring forth like crashing waves!</p><p></p><p>This young man gave him a very dangerous feeling!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The mountains and rivers collapsed, the dragon's roar rising, as if it would bury all living beings! This powerful master's strength was much stronger than the just-broken Yin Hong, a single palm strike could not shatter it, but for Xu Yan, it was not a difficult opponent to kill.</p><p></p><p>Since there was another powerful master behind, he had to act quickly and decisively, lest the other one escape!</p><p></p><p>With the first strike, it was the mountain and river dragon roar! Howl! After all, he was a powerful master, the dragon's roar and the mountains and rivers appearing only caused his mind to waver slightly, not falling into it.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying saber light kept pouring out, as if it would tear the mountains and rivers apart!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out with his sword again.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, within the mountains and rivers, there were small bridges and flowing water, countless figures, lakes rippling, tall buildings standing.</p><p></p><p>Illusory mountains and rivers, as if there were living beings within.</p><p></p><p>Mountain and river myriad beings sword! Countless figures within the mountains and rivers, as if wielding long swords, accompanied by the dragon's roar, slashing down! "Not good!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's expression was horrified, at this moment, he found himself seemingly trapped within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying killing intent enveloped him, figures all around, slashing towards him with swords.</p><p></p><p>No matter how he poured out saber light, no matter how he unleashed his strength, all he saw was that sword light, and the mountains and rivers turning, the terrifying power that would bury all living beings!</p><p></p><p>Pu! The black-robed man's consciousness dimmed, losing all awareness.</p><p></p><p>This was Xu Yan's first time using the Mountain and River Myriad Beings Sword, with a single sword strike, the black-robed man's body constantly showed cracks, then shattered and disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>A small bag fell from the broken black-robed man's body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed it, relieved, "Almost, almost lost a stack of spirit tickets. These guys are all very rich, this one is a powerful master, he must be even richer, right."</p><p></p><p>Without even checking how many spirit tickets were inside, he quickly stuffed it into his embrace, then looked ahead, a figure already appearing in the distance, chasing after them.</p><p></p><p>He directly went to meet it.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to chase my shimei, you've got some guts."</p><p></p><p>He slashed out with his sword! "Die!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's expression changed drastically, swinging his saber to strike back, only now did he realize in horror that the companion who had been chasing Meng Chong had disappeared! A bad premonition rose in his heart!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you!" </p><p></p><p>He roared angrily, swinging his saber while his figure moved, about to flee.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Danger!</p><p></p><p>A strong crisis suddenly enveloped his mind.</p><p></p><p>"The one who will kill you is the Sword Deity Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword light surged, the sword intent transformed into mountains and rivers, instantly enveloping all directions.</p><p></p><p>It completely blocked the retreat path of the black-robed person.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with the sword again.</p><p></p><p>The Sword of the Myriad Existences! The black-robed person's body immediately shattered into pieces, and a bag fell from his body. Xu Yan retrieved it.</p><p></p><p>The shattered remains of the black-robed person continuously disintegrated, eventually turning into fine sand-like particles that scattered from the air, becoming ashes before even reaching the ground.</p><p></p><p>With a single sword strike, the sword intent was extinguished, directly slashing him to ashes.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Meng Shushu had already gotten off Meng Chong's back, standing beside Meng Chong, panting. At this moment, he widened his eyes and opened his mouth.</p><p></p><p>He was so shocked that he didn't even feel the pain of his injuries.</p><p></p><p>This was Meng Chong's senior martial brother?</p><p></p><p>Too powerful, absurdly powerful!</p><p></p><p>That was a Grand Master, and he killed one with a single sword strike?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he is the Sword Venerable Xie Lingfeng? Meng Chong patted his head and exclaimed joyfully, "Senior brother has broken through, he can now kill Grand Masters across realms. Now we don't have to fear those sneaky things anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Excitedly, he raised his hand and patted Meng Chong's shoulder, saying, "You see, my family's one, following me is absolutely safe!"</p><p></p><p>Poof! In his excitement, he used a bit too much force, forgetting that Meng Shushu was seriously injured, causing Meng Shushu to cough up a mouthful of blood.</p><p></p><p>"Tsk! My family's one, you're too fragile!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong awkwardly withdrew his hand.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was on the verge of tears, now his injuries were compounded.</p><p></p><p>"Meng brother, quickly give me some healing medicine!"</p><p></p><p>Since he already owed a lot, he didn't care anymore, he could owe another eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>"Here!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong reluctantly took out a medicinal pill and put it in his mouth.</p><p></p><p>"There are only three left!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the bottle, there were only three pills left, Meng Chong felt a pain in his heart.</p><p></p><p>A figure flashed, Xu Yan returned, his face filled with excitement and excitement, saying, "Junior brother, how did you get involved with them? Do you know where their lair is? I'll go and capture them right away!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed person was indeed wealthy! Xu Yan had killed two Grand Masters and taken their money bags. When he opened them, in addition to two bottles of medicinal pills and a dozen or so spirit crystals, there were nearly 200,000 spirit tickets.</p><p></p><p>No wonder they were Grand Masters! In comparison, Yin Hong was truly a poor wretch. Those medicinal pills were actually not cheap, they were made from spirit herbs, but in Xu Yan's eyes, they were just worthless trash.</p><p></p><p>The spirit tickets were what he loved the most, he could buy a lot of spirit herbs with them.</p><p></p><p>He was now filled with excitement, wishing he could immediately go and capture their lair, surely he could reap a huge harvest, and become a wealthy person in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, he would no longer be a poor man!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu swallowed a mouthful of saliva, this senior martial brother of Meng Chong's, why did it seem that he was going to raid the lair of the black-robed people not for revenge, but to loot? That excited look made Meng Shushu feel afraid! Meng Chong shook his head and said, "I don't know, I just saved him and went to a spirit herb treasure trove, and then was chased."</p><p></p><p>Next, Meng Chong introduced Meng Shushu, explaining the beginning and end of the matter, how he was chased by the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>He particularly emphasized that Meng Shushu was a spirit herb scout, including the fact that he owed Meng Chong a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan heard this, and his gaze towards Meng Shushu changed.</p><p></p><p>A spirit herb scout?</p><p></p><p>And he can rank among the top five in the Inner Realm?</p><p></p><p>Of course he understood Meng Shushu's value, so he revealed a kind smile and gently patted Meng Shushu's shoulder, saying, "So you are Meng brother's junior. I am Xu Yan, Meng Chong's senior martial brother. Since you are my junior brother's family member, you can call me senior brother as well."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was a bit dazed, but he quickly realized, this was a great support!</p><p></p><p>Killing Grand Masters as easily as slaughtering chickens, a terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>Calling him senior brother, he had gained a lot!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, greets Senior Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly and excitedly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, smiling and saying, "Since you've called me senior brother, then let me tell you directly, I'm missing a storage bag, how about it?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>They really are brothers, their minds are all about storage bags, right? Meng Shushu felt numb.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he could only grit his teeth and say, "Senior Brother Xu, I'll do my best, my best to earn enough money to buy you a storage bag!"</p><p></p><p>He was on the verge of tears, from now on, he could only run all over the mountains and forests, searching for all kinds of spirit herbs, in order to buy two storage bags!</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Take this as your goal, I'm very pleased, I believe you can definitely afford to buy the storage bag!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily patted his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Time is of the essence, let's go to the spirit herb treasure trove now and harvest the spirit herbs there, to avoid any unexpected developments."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother is right, if the other party finds out that the Grand Masters have been killed, and forcibly enters, it may cause the spirit herbs to be damaged, that would be a huge loss."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"That place may already have a Grand Master guarding it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up and he said, "That would be even better, Grand Masters are quite wealthy, killing one can earn a lot of spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>Grand Masters have become money bags, killing one can earn a big profit.</p><p></p><p>This is too absurd!</p><p></p><p>In Meng Shushu's mind, those lofty, extremely powerful Grand Masters have now collapsed.</p><p></p><p>To him, they were the pinnacle of experts, the objects of worship for countless martial artists.</p><p></p><p>But in someone's eyes, they were just walking money bags? The three did not linger, and immediately returned, heading to the Yan Country's Tianhammer Mountain.</p><p></p><p>However, this place was far from Tianhammer Mountain, and it would take a long time to get there.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was injured and could not travel long distances, so Meng Chong simply picked him up and rushed there.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu felt completely uncomfortable, he felt like a little chick being carried.</p><p></p><p>"Could there be fifth-grade spirit herbs in the spirit herb treasure trove?"</p><p></p><p>Along the way, Meng Chong detailed the matter of the spirit herb treasure trove.</p><p></p><p>Hearing that there might be fifth-grade spirit herbs in the treasure trove, Xu Yan was surprised, this was a truly rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>Once a fifth-grade spirit herb appeared, it would likely provoke a battle between Grand Masters, or even cause the downfall of some minor powers.</p><p></p><p>This shows the preciousness of fifth-grade spirit herbs in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, they could only purchase sixth-grade spirit herbs, but fifth-grade spirit herbs had never been sold.</p><p></p><p>This is also why sixth-grade spirit herbs are already recognized as the highest grade in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a possibility that there might be fifth-grade spirit herbs, generally speaking, the Inner Realm cannot produce fifth-grade spirit herbs. My family's ancestral teachings believe that the spiritual energy in the Inner Realm is insufficient to support the growth of spirit herbs to the fifth-grade."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu explained, "The reason we speculate that there might be fifth-grade spirit herbs there is because I suspect that place was once the remnant of a sect that cultivated spirit herbs, and under artificial arrangements and long-term cultivation, fifth-grade spirit herbs may have grown."</p><p></p><p>Thinking for a moment, he added, "Whether there are fifth-grade spirit herbs or not, I can't say for sure, but spirit herbs that are between fifth-grade and sixth-grade must exist."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly said, "Half fifth-grade spirit herbs? That's not bad either!"</p><p></p><p>The three rushed for a long distance, finally arriving in the Yan Country, and from afar they could see a mountain peak that looked like an iron hammer.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was no longer the Inner Realm of the past. The gate to the Spirit Realm had disappeared, and the Spirit Realm and Inner Realm had merged into one, both belonging to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi, as the Heavenly Dao, had been operating the world of the Great Wilderness, enhancing its laws, lowering the difficulty of cultivation, and bestowing opportunities upon exceptionally talented and perceptive geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Thus, under the operation of the Heavenly Dao, as martial artists in the Great Wilderness gained insight into the Dao, cultivation bottlenecks weakened. In a short time, the overall strength of the Great Wilderness had improved tremendously.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Refinement realm was no longer rare, and Condensed Law realm martial artists had also appeared.</p><p></p><p>On Canglang Island, besides Xu Junhe who was at the Divine Power realm, Kou Ruozhi had also broken through to the Divine Power realm, as well as Bai Yunkong, Pang Yu, the Master of Tianbao Pavilion and others.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong and the others had transitioned from their original martial arts, which were between Cang and the Great Wilderness. After the appearance of the Heavenly Dao, they gradually fully converted to the martial arts of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Although there were still some slight differences compared to pure Great Wilderness martial arts, they had ultimately completely separated from Cang martial arts and become Great Wilderness martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Besides those at the Divine Power realm, there were even more at the Divine Origin and Divine Will realms.</p><p></p><p>The earliest batch of geniuses in the Great Wilderness had gradually grown up.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Great Wilderness now, there were no longer any pure Cang martial artists. Even Condensed Law realm martial artists had significant differences from Cang martial artists of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Although they did not belong to Great Wilderness martial arts, they had partially separated from Cang martial arts and leaned towards Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>If one had sufficient talent and comprehension, there was a chance to cultivate divine powers as their strength increased.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was operating the world, steadily advancing the perfection of the Heavenly Dao according to plan. For example, Heavenly Dao divine powers were gradually being arranged.</p><p></p><p>This allowed martial artists with excellent comprehension and insight into the Heavenly Dao to cultivate divine powers from it, which were Heavenly Dao divine powers.</p><p></p><p>For people like Xu Junhe who were already at the Divine Power realm and had their own divine powers, they were now comprehending and cultivating Heavenly Dao divine powers, naturally increasing their strength.</p><p></p><p>The power of divine abilities made many martial artists yearn for them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe used the might of his divine power to directly suppress a Condensed Law realm martial artist, demonstrating the great power of divine abilities. This made the strong and talented of the Great Wilderness all aspire to comprehend the Heavenly Dao and cultivate Heavenly Dao divine powers.</p><p></p><p>This region of the Great Wilderness was no longer in the form of the Cang world.</p><p></p><p>Under the Heavenly Dao, nothing could be hidden. The return of Blood Demon naturally did not escape Tianzi's notice.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi revealed a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>An external blood soul had suddenly descended into that corpse, reviving it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this corpse actually had some connection with this blood soul. It was carefully nurtured by the owner of the blood soul, prepared for this moment.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Lingzi's original opportunity and rise were all thanks to this person. Blood Demon, is it?" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi pondered, "That fellow Mingyu is the ancestor of the blood path. Could Blood Demon be Mingyu? But it doesn't seem like it."</p><p></p><p>This blood soul did not have Mingyu's aura.</p><p></p><p>Mingyu, one of the seven world lords, was extremely powerful. Tianzi was not unfamiliar with him, after all, Cang had taught Mingyu a lesson for a period of time.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon, could he be one of Mingyu's minor world lords?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was puzzled, but judging from this blood soul, the other party did not seem to be as simple as a minor world lord.</p><p></p><p>"Is he one of those from the Immutable Temple, seemingly connected to Mingyu?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi suddenly had a realization. He remembered something - although Mingyu was called the ancestor of the blood path, his martial way was usually referred to as the Blood Demon Way.</p><p></p><p>And the owner of this blood soul called himself Blood Demon. Could it be that Mingyu's cultivation method came from him?</p><p></p><p>"Has Mingyu betrayed and joined the Immutable Temple?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi pondered deeply. At this moment, he felt a sense of urgency.</p><p></p><p>This blood soul entering the Cang world must have some scheme. This meant the Immutable Temple had begun to take action.</p><p></p><p>"Has that fellow's injuries healed, or has he escaped the influence Cang imposed on him, preparing to start devouring the Cang world?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Tianzi couldn't help but feel anxious.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet fully operated the entire world, the Heavenly Dao was not yet completely perfected to encompass the whole world. If the Immutable Temple started to act, how would he have enough power to resist? Rely on the Dao Ancestor? </p><p></p><p>Tianzi immediately shook his head. Relying on the Dao Ancestor for everything would make him seem too useless. What he wanted was to punish those bastards in the name of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Delay him!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi immediately had an idea.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Heavenly Dao. This blood soul that has descended only has the strength of the Spirit Refinement realm. It won't be difficult to confuse him."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's current strength was only at the Spirit Refinement realm, though of course he was stronger than ordinary Spirit Refinement realm martial artists. This strength was just at the upper limit of the Spirit Realm's martial way.</p><p></p><p>And in the Inner Realm, it was absolutely invincible, with overwhelming power.</p><p></p><p>This was probably Blood Demon's plan to use this as a starting point, to lay groundwork in the Inner Realm and Spirit Realm, gradually increase his strength, and finally enter the Divine Realm, fully integrating into this world without being rejected by it.</p><p></p><p>He might even use this to cultivate and rise bit by bit, eventually comprehending the world's origin, and act as an insider for devouring the world?</p><p></p><p>Regardless, Blood Demon's current strength was the same as when he perished.</p><p></p><p>"Where is Blood Demon's true self?"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi looked towards the chaotic and immutable land, but did not find Blood Demon's figure.</p><p></p><p>"Sooner or later, I'll let you taste what the power of the Heavenly Dao is."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi inwardly sneered.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Blood Demon walking out of the great tomb, the corner of his mouth curled up, revealing a mischievous smile, "You want to come to the Cang world, but this is the Great Wilderness. Let's see if you're confused!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon walked out of the great tomb, the corner of his mouth revealing a sinister smile, "I, Blood Demon, have returned. I, Blood Lingzi, have returned. Tremble, all of you!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he looked confused, raising his head to look at the sky, then looking around.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on? Why is the spiritual energy here so dense?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon looked puzzled. His gaze swept around, and he soon saw a first-grade spirit herb growing not far away.</p><p></p><p>"This... this is the Inner Realm. The spiritual energy shouldn't be so dense, and it's absolutely impossible for a first-grade spirit herb to grow here. What exactly is going on?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon frowned, his expression uncertain and alarmed. "Could it be that the Cang world has undergone some changes? Impossible, how could there be such huge changes in such a short time?"</p><p></p><p>The Cang world was divided into four major regions. This was a change in the world's rules. No matter how the Inner Realm changed, it was absolutely impossible for it to change so drastically all of a sudden.</p><p></p><p>After all, this involved too many things, such as adjusting the world's rules and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Cang has a world lord now? No, Cang is still the same old way, it hasn't entered the state of having a world lord."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's mind was full of confusion.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, taking a step and instantly disappearing from the area of the great tomb. He wanted to find someone to understand what changes had occurred in the Inner Realm, why the world's spiritual energy had become so dense.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Blood Demon had an unpleasant thought. With such dense spiritual energy, hadn't the upper limit of the Inner Realm's martial way been broken? Wouldn't there be Spirit Refinement Heavenly Human realm martial artists now? If so, with his current strength, in the Inner Realm...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He would not necessarily be invincible, and some plans would need to be changed.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Blood Demon saw a martial artist picking spiritual herbs, with strength only at the Grand Master realm. In an instant, he appeared before the person.</p><p></p><p>The aura of a Spirit Refinement Celestial was unmistakable, with the bearing of a great expert, fully displaying the dignity of a powerful figure. </p><p></p><p>He thought the other person would be greatly shocked, bowing down and calling him "senior". But the martial artist picking herbs just raised his head and glanced at him.</p><p></p><p>"Do you need something?" </p><p></p><p>The tone was calm, without any reverence for a powerful figure.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was a bit confused, as this reaction was completely different from what he had expected. His expression darkened, his aura surging, and he asked, "Young man, which part of the Inner Realm is this?"</p><p></p><p>His aura was like a great mountain, vaguely pressing down. He thought the other person would kneel down under the pressure of his aura, respectfully and tremblingly answering.</p><p></p><p>But the other person only looked slightly displeased, neither kneeling nor answering with a trembling voice. Instead, he frowned and said, "Inner Realm? What Inner Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Now it was Blood Demon's turn to be confused. "If this isn't the Inner Realm, could it be the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>The herb picker looked at him puzzledly, then raised his hand and slapped him on the head with a "pa" sound. Blood Demon staggered, almost falling to the ground.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his heart was churning with shock. This person didn't look strong, so why was his strength far beyond his own? He couldn't even react to that strike.</p><p></p><p>Although this blood soul had descended into a body whose own strength wasn't great, which was why he only had Spirit Refinement realm cultivation, this cultivation level was already at the limit of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, he should have been like a god.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as he came out of the great tomb, he met an herb picker whose strength surpassed his own? With his special blood soul, his perception and adaptability far exceeded others at the same level, and he could be considered invincible among peers. Yet the herb picker easily knocked him down, so his strength must exceed his by at least one major realm.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was shocked. Even if the spiritual energy in the Inner Realm had become denser, it was impossible for experts surpassing Spirit Refinement Celestials to appear in such a short time! Could it be that he had miscalculated the time, and actually a very long time had passed in the Inner Realm, allowing warriors surpassing the Spirit Refinement realm to appear?</p><p></p><p>He heard the herb picker's voice in his ears, "Did you become stupid from closed-door cultivation? Gone mad? There's no Inner Realm or Spirit Realm, this is the Great Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>Great Wilderness?</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon raised his head in shock, "Great Wilderness? This is clearly the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>He had never heard of a place called the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Pa! His head was hit again. The herb picker shook his head and sighed, "You really have problems from cultivation, your mind is confused. What Inner Realm? Since ancient times, this place has always been the Great Wilderness, it has never changed!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's mind was in chaos. Just out of the great tomb, he randomly met an herb picker stronger than him, and now this place wasn't even the Inner Realm? Great Wilderness, what place was that? He had never heard of a region called Great Wilderness in the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"No, this should be the Inner Realm. I... when I was in closed-door cultivation, this was the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>He had wanted to say that this body was buried in the Inner Realm. </p><p></p><p>But on second thought, if people knew he was the former Blood Demon, it would be very dangerous with his current strength. So he changed it to closed-door cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"There can't be a mistake, this is the Cang Heaven and Earth, where the Inner Realm is located. Do you know of the Cang Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's eyes lit up. Since the other person's strength surpassed the Spirit Refinement realm, he should know the name Cang Heaven and Earth, right?</p><p></p><p>The herb picker looked him up and down, sighed and said, "You really have problems from cultivation, talking about Inner Realm, Spirit Realm, and Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully, this is the Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth, not called Cang Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon couldn't help but look shocked. Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth?</p><p></p><p>Among the Seven Great Heavens and Earths, there was no Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth. Could it be that the Cang Heaven and Earth had been renamed?</p><p></p><p>Yes, it must be so!</p><p></p><p>And for a Heaven and Earth to be renamed, could a new Lord of Heaven and Earth have appeared?</p><p></p><p>How was that possible? How could a new Lord of Heaven and Earth appear in the Cang Heaven and Earth without any disturbance?</p><p></p><p>"Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth? No, this is the Cang Heaven and Earth, Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth must be a later renaming."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon said seriously.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, you fool!"</p><p></p><p>The herb picker sighed, "You've even forgotten the origin of the Great Wilderness. As a martial artist of the Great Wilderness, how can you not know where the Great Wilderness came from? You've actually forgotten it all."</p><p></p><p>"What origin?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon forced himself to calm down.</p><p></p><p>The herb picker looked up at the sky. To Blood Demon's shock, a mysterious radiance appeared on the herb picker's body, his expression solemn and devout.</p><p></p><p>"At the beginning of time, when chaos had not yet separated, the Ancestor of the Dao felt pity for living beings dwelling in chaos. So with one thought he opened up the Great Wilderness, allowing living beings to dwell, farm, and develop here. Initially the heaven and earth were heavy and wild, and living beings dwelling here were tempered and strengthened themselves, thus the heaven and earth was named Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth was opened up by one thought of the Ancestor of the Dao at the beginning of time. He enlightened the Heavenly Dao to operate the heaven and earth. The Heavenly Dao is supremely impartial, revered by all living beings. This is the origin of the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon was completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>This didn't match any of the heavens and earths he knew.</p><p></p><p>At the beginning of time, the Ancestor of the Dao opened up the Great Wilderness with one thought, allowing living beings to dwell here?</p><p></p><p>Who was the Ancestor of the Dao?</p><p></p><p>What kind of existence would be called the Ancestor of the Dao!</p><p></p><p>He had never heard the name Ancestor of the Dao before, and didn't even have the concept of such a title before this.</p><p></p><p>And what was the Heavenly Dao? All of these things were vastly different from the heaven and earth he knew.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't Cang?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon looked incredulous.</p><p></p><p>He looked down at his own body. This was clearly Blood Spirit Child's body, and that great tomb was also Blood Spirit Child's tomb.</p><p></p><p>"I've told you this is the Great Wilderness!"</p><p></p><p>The herb picker slapped his head again, then sighed and said, "Alright, since we've met it must be fate. I'll treat you. Come with me, I'll treat your cultivation madness. Looking at your symptoms, although your consciousness is confused and disordered, you can still be saved!"</p><p></p><p>"No, this must be the Cang Heaven and Earth, where the Inner Realm is located."</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon took a deep breath and said with a determined gaze, "I came out of the great tomb, how could I be wrong?"</p><p></p><p>"There has never been any great tomb here. The so-called great tomb is just your confused consciousness."</p><p></p><p>The herb picker sighed helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon moved in an instant, leaving immediately. He wanted to go back to the great tomb to check and confirm again!</p><p></p><p>"Great Wilderness? How is that possible? Among the Seven Great Heavens and Earths, there is no Great Wilderness Heaven and Earth, and in the Unseparated Land there is no eighth heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his heart skipped a beat.</p><p></p><p>No one knew how vast the Unseparated Land was, and he didn't know either. No one had ever traversed the entire Unseparated Land. Could there be a heaven and earth called Great Wilderness in the Unseparated Land?</p><p></p><p>"It's impossible, absolutely impossible. I came to Cang, how could I have gone to an unfamiliar heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon shook his head, denying his own thoughts.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

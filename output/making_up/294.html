        <h1>Chapter 294</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In the small notebook of the elder of the Wood Clan, there was an introduction to the Wei Kingdom. The contemporary Wei royal family had produced two geniuses, and the one who cultivated the spear art was Wei Yuan.</p><p></p><p>At the peak of the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm, he was only half a step away from the middle stage of the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm, and his realm was very stable. Moreover, he cultivated the techniques from the Thousand Martial Hall, so his strength was not weak.</p><p></p><p>However, a mere Refine Spirit Celestial Realm initial stage, even if he was a genius, was not worth Xu Yan's attention at all.</p><p></p><p>Even if it was the legendary Spirit Celestial genius, Xu Yan would only pay a little attention, but that was it.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are too arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>With Wei Yuan's appearance, two more figures came with imposing auras.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Blade Gate from the Seven Sects, theWei Clan from the Eight Families, three geniuses, that's about it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Pointing his long sword, he said, "Come at me together, so I don't waste time!"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that you, Xu Yan, are arrogant, and today I've finally witnessed it!" </p><p></p><p>Wei Yuan said with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogance is the impression of the ignorant towards me. I, Xu Yan, have never been arrogant, I only speak with my strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists watching the battle kept increasing, not only from the Thousand Martial State, but also those who had traveled from other states, as well as the scattered cultivators and the martial artists from the various spiritual sects. </p><p></p><p>After all, setting up a stage in front of the Thousand Martial Hall to challenge the geniuses of the Thousand Martial State was unprecedented.</p><p></p><p>Whether they were scattered cultivators or martial artists from spiritual sects, they were all extremely excited, rushing to witness history, so that they could later boast about being witnesses and participants of this historical event! The generous rewards from the Thousand Martial Hall had also spread among the spiritual sects, and the geniuses from all over the Thousand Martial State seemed to see the opportunity to enter the Thousand Martial Hall, so they set out one after another.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how much strength you have!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Yuan charged over, his huge spear thrusting out, the cold glint flashing like a giant python rushing towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a battle to decide the winner, or a battle to the death?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked in a deep voice as he broke through Wei Yuan's attack with a sword.</p><p></p><p>"It's a battle to the death!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Yuan said coldly, "If you're afraid, kneel down and beg for the forgiveness of the Thousand Martial Hall's supreme sect, and maybe you can live."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered contemptuously and said coldly, "If you want to seek your own death, I, Xu Yan, will certainly oblige you."</p><p></p><p>Looking at the other two, he said, "And you two?"</p><p></p><p>"To the death!" </p><p></p><p>The other two said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and said, "The geniuses of the spiritual sects really know the way to seek death, don't they!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists watching couldn't help but twitch at the corners of their mouths, this Xu Yan was truly arrogant!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan's gaze turned cold, and with just three sword strikes, he had forced Wei Yuan to retreat in a sorry state.</p><p></p><p>"With just you alone, you are not qualified to fight me, Xu Yan. I'll give you a chance, come at me together."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Wei Yuan's expression was extremely gloomy, Xu Yan's strength exceeded his imagination, he alone was no match for him.</p><p></p><p>The other two also changed their expressions, exchanged a glance, and nodded, descending from the high platform to stand with Wei Yuan.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, since you are so arrogant, then I will indulge you!"</p><p></p><p>Although the geniuses should have pride, this was an opportunity to gain the favor of the Thousand Martial Hall. Moreover, in the face of life and death, how many could maintain their pride? Boom! The three auras, three spiritual energies connected, and a powerful force surged on the high platform.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has made a mistake, the techniques of the Three Kingdoms, the Seven Sects, and the Eight Families all come from the Thousand Martial Hall. Once they join forces, their spiritual energies will fuse, and their strength will undoubtedly double."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this is much stronger than the ordinary alliance of three martial artists. Seemingly three people, but in reality, they have combined the strength of three, fusing into one, like a single person wielding three different martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is still young and arrogant, too self-confident. One-on-one, he can win, but how can he defeat the combined strength of the three?"</p><p></p><p>Among the watching martial artists, there were those who had some understanding of the martial arts of the Thousand Martial Hall. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, they shook their heads and sighed, believing that Xu Yan had been careless.</p><p></p><p>This was not a simple case of three martial artists joining forces, but more like a fusion of the three into a single entity, forming a unified power, rather than being scattered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wanted to divide and conquer, to defeat them one by one, but that was absolutely impossible.</p><p></p><p>"In this battle, Xu Yan's defeat is inevitable!"</p><p></p><p>An elder martial artist said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>On the high platform, Xu Yan's sword intent swirled, facing the three geniuses of Wei, and he was a bit surprised that Wei Yuan's three had fused their spiritual energies, like a single entity.</p><p></p><p>"So be it, after this battle, I should be able to break through!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, today is your day of reckoning!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Wei Yuan took the lead, his huge spear thrusting out, the spear light bursting with cold radiance, tearing through the sky.</p><p></p><p>In the moment Wei Yuan struck, the other two also attacked Xu Yan from the left and right.</p><p></p><p>The three of them striking at the same time, it was as if a single martial artist was attacking from three directions, the deadly killing intent already enveloping Xu Yan, leaving him no room to dodge or escape.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, sword lights flashed! Xu Yan's expression remained calm, sword lights surging up, in an instant, a distant tree suddenly rose up, transforming into a sword and thrusting towards Wei Yuan's three.</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the grass and trees had transformed into fierce and sharp swords, radiating cold light, the sword intent surging, and they were arranged in an orderly manner, the sword qi fusing, like forming a mountain and river.</p><p></p><p>And around Xu Yan, sword lights gushed forth, the mountain and river surrounding him, the killing intent surging in all directions! The Mountain and River Sword Array!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword art is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Grass and trees transformed into swords, a myriad of swords unleashed?"</p><p></p><p>"No, not just a simple myriad swords unleashed, you've noticed, haven't you? It seems to have formed a special pattern, forming an even more powerful offensive art."</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Mountain and River Sword Array shocked the world.</p><p></p><p>Even the martial artists in the clouds above, Wu Tiannan, were startled.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword art is this? In the Spiritual Realm, when has there ever been such a sword art?"</p><p></p><p>On the sect gate of the Thousand Martial Hall, the Thousand Martial Hall Master and the others had extremely solemn and grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword art was too profound, too incredible! "To transform mountains into swords, it seems to be true!"</p><p></p><p>An elder said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan, how did you create such a sword art?"</p><p></p><p>The Sword Cultivating Elder gritted his teeth in shock.</p><p></p><p>Wei Yuan's three were now feeling a chill down their spines, their expressions changing drastically, they roared in unison, gathering their martial arts power and fusing them together.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The sword lights were already pouring down, the sword array swirling, the mountain and river transforming, the killing intent fierce.</p><p></p><p>"In the world of the sword arts, I am the supreme. Today, I will let the cowards of the Thousand Martial Hall see what true sword art is!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Wei Yuan's three, although not weak in strength, with their fusion, they unleashed a powerful momentum. The swords formed from the grass and trees were being knocked away and blocked.</p><p></p><p>The mountain and river transformed, the sword lights layer upon layer, the offensive never-ending.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held his sword, slashing down, the sword lights alternating, like the cycle of life and death.</p><p></p><p>Although the high platform had already been empowered by his formation, it was...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The battle continued to intensify, causing Xu Yan's brow to furrow as he forced Wei Yuansan and the others to take to the air and leave the high platform.</p><p></p><p>Step by step, he ascended into the air, and the battle continued in midair.</p><p></p><p>On the ground, a large tree suddenly shattered, transforming into dozens of gleaming swords with surging sword intent, flying up into the air and engulfing the figures of Wei Yuansan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Two more figures arrived, also geniuses from the Three Kingdoms' seven major families and eight great clans.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" The newly arrived two were shocked, for this was an unimaginable level of sword dao. The gathered martial artists were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>The senior martial artist who had previously determined that Xu Yan would be defeated now felt his face burning, as if all eyes were mocking him. Silently, he slipped away into the crowd, where no one recognized him. "Xu Yan is truly an unparalleled genius, the number one contemporary unaffiliated cultivator. Wei Yuansan and the others will undoubtedly be defeated!"</p><p></p><p>As if he had not been the one who had previously declared Xu Yan's defeat.</p><p></p><p>"You two, have you also come to challenge him? Come at me together then!" Xu Yan calmly looked at the two young men.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" One of them coldly said, but gritting his teeth, he charged forward with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The other had an exceptionally grim expression. He held a sword in his hand, but a ridiculous thought crossed his mind - the sword might disobey him and even turn against him!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's sword dao is strong, but if I retreat, I will never improve!" He took a deep breath, let out a low roar, and the sword qi surged as he also attacked Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, five geniuses were fighting against Xu Yan alone. The spectators were all shocked and secretly excited, for it seemed that they were about to witness a historic event - a lone unaffiliated cultivator genius defeating the geniuses of the Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists kept arriving to watch the battle, both unaffiliated cultivators, who were thrilled and hoped that Xu Yan could defeat the Lingzong Sect geniuses, and the Lingzong Sect's members, who had gloomy expressions. If Xu Yan won, the established notion of the Lingzong Sect geniuses crushing the unaffiliated cultivator geniuses would be shattered, which was not a good thing for the Lingzong Sect.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan narrowed his eyes slightly, his sword intent surging as he deployed his sword formations - the Mountain and River Sword Dao and the Life and Death Sword Wheel. Fighting against five opponents, he could feel the pressure.</p><p></p><p>Although the sword formations were powerful, Wei Yuansan and the others were also geniuses, and their spiritual energies were fused, unleashing an extremely fierce power, as if a single person was wielding five completely different attack methods and perfectly combining them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Wei Yuansan and the others were two realms higher than Xu Yan in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Heart Sword Realm, my heart is the sword, and all things can become the sword; the sword is my heart, and a single thought of mine is where the sword resides..."</p><p></p><p>In the midst of the fierce battle, Xu Yan finally closed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he had a profound realization. Each sword seemed to be his eyes, and with a single thought, they could reveal different ways of attack.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent had undergone some changes. The Mountain and River Sword Intent and the Gentle Wind Sword Intent could now interchangeably transform in an instant, as if the sword intent he desired could freely manifest.</p><p></p><p>"Still lacking a bit." Xu Yan thought to himself. He had gained new insights, elevating his sword dao to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the Qianwu Palace, he felt a tinge of regret - his strength was still not enough. Otherwise, he could have directly transformed the Qianwu Palace sect into a giant sword for his own use, shattering it with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>"The strength is still lacking a bit." Xu Yan sighed, wondering what realm he would need to reach to be able to transform the Qianwu Palace sect into a sword in his hand with a single thought.</p><p></p><p>The battle grew increasingly intense, with Wei Yuansan and the others fully unleashing their martial arts power, merging into a martial arts giant that struck against the surging swords.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, with his eyes closed, continued to cultivate his sword dao, even feeling the essence of each sword.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the sword formations and sword dao underwent changes. One sword unleashed the Mountain and River Dragon Roar, while another executed the Thunderclap Sword... Each sword displayed different sword dao, and these sword dao complemented each other, forming a sword formation that became the attack.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost complete, the foundation has been accumulated enough, the Spirit Element Realm is about to be broken through!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sensed that the "martial dao momentum" within him had almost reached the point of perfection and could no longer be accumulated further. The attacks from Wei Yuansan and the others, along with their martial dao energy, were all absorbed into his Mountain and River Sword Intent, strengthening his martial dao momentum and allowing him to gain insights into the different aspects of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Several more geniuses arrived, their eyes filled with shock. A single person fighting against five geniuses? How could this rain of swords appear? It seemed that once one entered it, death was inevitable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not speak, and even if they wanted to intervene, they could only hold back, as the rules of the competition among geniuses still needed to be observed.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures from the Three Kingdoms' seven major families and eight great clans had all arrived, their expressions gloomy.</p><p></p><p>Five of them working together could not defeat Xu Yan? Although they had never witnessed the current genius of the Qianwu Palace, they likely could not even match Xu Yan, who was fighting alone against the five of them.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, were the geniuses of the Qianwu Palace no match for Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>How could a lone unaffiliated cultivator be so powerful? Defeating the Lingzong Sect geniuses single-handedly?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes snapped open, and two sword lights shot out from them.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to end this."</p><p></p><p>He had accumulated enough martial dao foundation, and now it was time to break through to the Spirit Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a sword fell into his grasp.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, he unleashed a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain and River Sword Formation, each sword seemingly transforming into a person wielding a sword, all struck down together.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Wei Yuansan and the others felt a strong sense of life-and-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" In this moment, a light surged from the five of them, and their lifeblood also ignited as they unleashed their ultimate martial dao secret technique.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In the stunned eyes of the gathered martial artists, Wei Yuansan and the others seemed to have merged into one, and a powerful attack with a faint blood-colored aura suddenly appeared.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The swords were shattering, and that attack seemed unstoppable as it charged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>However, as Xu Yan's sword strike fell, the sword within that attack suddenly reversed direction and struck back!</p><p></p><p>One sword strike, and the genius was extinguished.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

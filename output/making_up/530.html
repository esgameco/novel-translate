        <h1>Chapter 530</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A powerful being at the level of a Lord of Heaven and Earth, driving a group of true spirits to attack - everyone's expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>Among that group of true spirits, there were those with strength at the Realm Lord level. Once they broke into the world, they would surely cause massive disaster. </p><p></p><p>Not to mention, there was also a Lord of Heaven and Earth powerhouse present.</p><p></p><p>"Get ready," Taihe said, looking at Cangli and Jiang Feng.</p><p></p><p>"No need to panic. The current world is operating under the Heavenly Dao, they won't be able to break in," Old Xiao said after thinking for a moment. </p><p></p><p>"Besides, the Ancestral Dao is within the world. How could he sit by and watch calamity befall it?"</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too happy..." Taikun began to say solemnly, but his expression suddenly changed. "Quick, retreat!"</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! From the unchanging realm, a whip lashed out across a vast distance, seemingly wanting to tear open a gap in the world's barrier to allow the unchanging true spirits to enter.</p><p></p><p>This whip strike was incredibly powerful. The group of Realm Lords felt their scalps go numb as they frantically retreated back into the world. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, they could only hope the rules of the Heavenly Dao could block this attack!</p><p></p><p>"A Lord of Heaven and Earth is actually this powerful!" some Realm Lords muttered, expressions shocked.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rules of the Heavenly Dao emerged, forming a barrier that collided with this strike. A violent storm erupted in the unchanging realm, but ultimately blocked the attack.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang, how many more tricks do you have up your sleeve?" a voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>"You really think you can bully me, Tianzi?" A youth in purple robes appeared, looking angrily at the charging unchanging true spirits.</p><p></p><p>He turned to look at Taihe and the others. </p><p></p><p>"You bunch of old fossils, go kill those true spirits for me. It'll be perfect to scatter them within the world as precious materials for martial artists to cultivate with."</p><p></p><p>Taihe and the others sighed, saying: "Tianzi, if you have the chance, you should still try to leave this world and escape to the unchanging realm. Otherwise, staying within this world, you'll surely die.</p><p></p><p>Whether it's the Heavenly Dao or Taicang's Dao principles, they ultimately can't withstand the Unchanging Divine Palace."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Tianzi became furious. "Bullshit! If it weren't for the fact that you're about to die of old age and we go way back, I'd let you taste the might of the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Taihe shook his head. As one of the earliest followers of Taicang, he naturally knew Tianzi's identity.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many true spirits, the impact is too great. All of you hold them off. I'll deal with that guy myself. I'll let him taste the might of the Heavenly Dao," Tianzi said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Xiao Yao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Tianshe, Meiwu and the others also agreed. The other Realm Lords naturally had to follow orders as well. Now they could only share the world's fate.</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>The giant whip lashed out again.</p><p></p><p>Purple light surged from Tianzi's body. With a thunderous boom, lightning erupted from the world. Suddenly, a massive bolt of lightning struck out, colliding with that whip.</p><p></p><p>"For Taicang to still have such a trump card after falling for so long, it's truly impressive!" There was a hint of admiration in Mu Yao's words.</p><p></p><p>"Come on then, let me show you my power," Tianzi sneered. As purple light surged, the power of the Heavenly Dao emerged. A strand of the Heavenly Dao's rules appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The unchanging true spirits had already charged over, crashing into the world's barrier.</p><p></p><p>"Attack!" Old Xiao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The group of Realm Lord level powerhouses all attacked, slaying the weaker unchanging true spirits with a wave of their hands. But soon, under Mu Yao's control, true spirits comparable to Realm Lords quickly targeted them, and a great battle broke out.</p><p></p><p>As for the remaining unchanging true spirits, although their individual strength was weaker, their numbers were too vast. The force of their charge was also extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"All Supreme Realm martial artists, come hunt the unchanging true spirits!"</p><p></p><p>One Supreme after another rose into the air, both excited and nervous as they approached the edge of the world.</p><p></p><p>This was their first time stepping out of the world and entering the unchanging realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, before this, due to the existence of Taicang's world barrier, they were unable to leave the world.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Outside the world, a great battle erupted. Mu Yao's figure also appeared, wielding a long whip as he lashed out, wanting to kill Ao Lie who had unleashed his dragon might to intimidate the true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Tianzi, gripping lightning, struck out, completely blocking the other's attack.</p><p></p><p>"I'm your opponent!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao looked at Tianzi, then glanced at the world, somewhat puzzled. He felt that Taicang's world seemed a bit unusual.</p><p></p><p>Especially Tianzi - his strength was actually not weaker than a Lord of Heaven and Earth. He could completely block him. Moreover, Mu Yao had a feeling that if he stepped into the world, he would very likely be suppressed!</p><p></p><p>"How lively," Li Xuan raised his head to look outside the world. The battle continued, true spirit after true spirit falling, but some Supreme Realm martial artists were also severely injured, retreating back into the world.</p><p></p><p>There were too many unchanging true spirits. This was clearly Mu Yao's careful preparation, obviously taking no small amount of time to gather and drive such a vast group of true spirits here.</p><p></p><p>"It's time for me, Fang Hao, to show my skills," Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Such a vast group of true spirits was the perfect opportunity to deploy the Qimen martial arts, set up a killing formation, and slay a huge number of true spirits single-handedly.</p><p></p><p>It was also time to let the name of Qinghua Sect Master, Qimen Fang Hao, shake the world.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao ascended step by step, heading straight for the outside of the world.</p><p></p><p>Nine Mountains, Demon Race Territory.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains of the Wilderness belonged to demon race territory. This was common knowledge among martial artists above the Immortal Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity for our demon race has come. Devour the true spirits, strengthen ourselves. Those are all food for our demon race, the best nourishment for us!" Red Cat said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Demon Generals, follow me outside the world to battle!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat sat on his throne, carried by several great demons as they headed straight for the outside of the world.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong and Little Ha both had helpless expressions. Even at a time like this, Red Cat couldn't help but flaunt his status as the Great Demon King.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Great Wilderness world, the battle had already become extremely intense. But there were too many unchanging true spirits. Old Xiao, Tai Miao, Tianshe, Taihe, Taikun and other powerful experts each faced two unchanging true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Some weaker Realm Lords could only battle one unchanging true spirit each. The Realm Lord level unchanging true spirits were barely held back.</p><p></p><p>But there were too many unchanging true spirits below the Realm Lord level. The Supreme Realm martial artists were having difficulty resisting them. Some true spirits charged towards the world's barrier, triggering the Heavenly Dao rules to intercept them.</p><p></p><p>This in turn affected the Heavenly Dao power that Tianzi was using.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the Heavenly Dao's rules extending outside the world, they naturally couldn't exert the true power of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Wielding lightning, Tianzi was only able to resist Mu Yao and entangle him, preventing him from targeting Old Xiao and the others.</p><p></p><p>Mu Yao was unhurried, constantly attacking but not approaching the world any further. He was similarly entangling Tianzi, preventing him from diverting more power to deal with the true spirits charging towards the world.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>More and more true spirits charged towards the world. Eventually even Divine Venerable realm martial artists within the Great Wilderness world had no choice but to take action, intercepting the more powerful true spirits in front of the world's barrier.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They didn't dare to stray too far from the barrier of heaven and earth. Otherwise, if they encountered supreme-level true spirits, they wouldn't be able to retreat back to the protection of heaven and earth to save their lives.</p><p></p><p>On the side of the Great Wilderness heaven and earth, under such a massive onslaught of true spirits, they were extremely passive and showed signs of defeat. Once forced to retreat within heaven and earth, the situation would become very passive.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, if you keep playing dead, you'll really die!" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi said, looking towards a certain part of the blue sea.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle had a helpless expression, but had no choice but to take action.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle rose into the air, coming outside of heaven and earth. Its enormous turtle body was like a huge mountain, and also like a giant shield.</p><p></p><p>"My strength hasn't recovered, I can only assist in defense," the Ancient Sea Turtle said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"Ancient Sea Turtle? You're actually not dead?" Taihe had a look of surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Just lucky, just lucky. I was only a bit faster at running away," the Ancient Sea Turtle said with an embarrassed smile.</p><p></p><p>Taihe raised an eyebrow. He could somewhat believe that the Ancient Sea Turtle's extremely strong defense allowed it to escape disaster, but he absolutely didn't believe it could outrun disaster. For this turtle to have survived, there must be another reason.</p><p></p><p>Taihe didn't continue questioning. Being able to survive that great calamity, regardless of the reason, was indeed lucky.</p><p></p><p>The Ancient Sea Turtle's enormous body blocked the impact of the untransformed true spirits. The group of supreme martial artists used the Ancient Sea Turtle as a shield, continuously attacking the incoming true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Even so, there were still too many true spirits. The Great Wilderness heaven and earth still showed signs of defeat. The supreme realm martial artists barely stabilized the situation, but the divine venerable realm martial artists began to be unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>Although the strength of divine venerable level true spirits wasn't considered strong, there were too many of them. The momentum of their charge was also extremely terrifying, and would divert some of the power of the heavenly laws.</p><p></p><p>"We can't hold on much longer!" some martial artists wailed.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, within heaven and earth, light flared up. Beams of light flew out like flowing light, descending in all directions. In an instant, slaughter manifested, and hundreds of true spirits were instantly annihilated.</p><p></p><p>A young man walked forward step by step. With a pat of his hand on his weapon box, a torrent of ten thousand techniques flew out. At the same time, the formation tool in his hand danced, scattering in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, one great formation after another was activated.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghua Sect, Fang Hao of the Qimen School," Fang Hao said calmly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his head to look at Mu Zhao, then slowly stepped into the group of true spirits, while the formation disk in his hand flew out.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, follow me in controlling the formations to destroy the true spirits!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of martial artists were overjoyed and amazed at the profundity and incredibility of the formations.</p><p></p><p>With Fang Hao's arrival and the deployment of the formations, the pressure on the martial artists instantly decreased greatly, while the impact force of the true spirits was weakened by the formations at the first barrier.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of Fang Hao's hand, the Qimen formations and the torrent of ten thousand weapons shooting out from the weapon box killed without equal. Wherever they passed, true spirits were slaughtered one after another.</p><p></p><p>It somewhat had the appearance of one person surrounding and killing a group of true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Mu Zhao's gaze was cold as he looked at Fang Hao, then turned to look at heaven and earth, his heart shaken.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang, you truly have good methods, to actually have such an arrangement."</p><p></p><p>This way of formations was truly inconceivable. In an instant, spiritual energy was controlled, and even the untransformed energy of the untransformed land was turned into killing power.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Mu Zhao coldly snorted, his form moving as he was about to kill Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Your opponent is me!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi had an unhappy expression. Did he look so weak? While fighting him, the other dared to be distracted and want to deal with others?</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Tianzi also became angry.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth shook, and profound heavenly laws manifested. Purple lightning instantly surged forth, striking towards Mu Zhao under Tianzi's control.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Mu Zhao didn't dare to be careless. His aura erupted as he resisted the attack of the purple lightning. Gloomy energy surged on his body. For a time, under Tianzi's attack, he was unable to break free and leave.</p><p></p><p>"This isn't the power of Tai Cang's laws. Could Tai Cang have altered the laws of heaven and earth? Or even upgraded them?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Zhao's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Tai Cang had already been dead for such a long time, yet could still leave behind such an arrangement?</p><p></p><p>Mu Zhao waved his whip, making thunderous cracking sounds. As the whip cracked, another group of untransformed true spirits came charging from the untransformed land.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>This time the impact on heaven and earth showed that Mu Zhao had clearly prepared for a long time. Otherwise, he wouldn't have been able to drive such a vast number of true spirits to come, wouldn't have been able to gather such a huge group of true spirits.</p><p></p><p>The pressure on the martial artists surged again. Even though Fang Hao had taken action, even though great formations had been deployed that greatly weakened the first wave of the true spirits' impact.</p><p></p><p>However, it still couldn't reverse the declining situation.</p><p></p><p>"Who can replace me in blocking these two true spirits? I'll go intimidate the other true spirits," said Ao Lie while battling two powerful true spirits.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to use true dragon prestige to intimidate the weaker true spirits and break Mu Zhao's driving force over the true spirits.</p><p></p><p>However, what other realm lords had the spare capacity to help him block two true spirits?</p><p></p><p>Roar! Just then, a tiger's roar rang out.</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the sound. Within heaven and earth, a group of spirit beasts came carrying a golden glowing chair. Seated on the chair was a huge striped tiger.</p><p></p><p>The striped tiger held a large blade, its eyes gleaming with majesty as it silently gazed at those true spirits!</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Beast King of the beast race?"</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists were stunned. Wasn't this striped tiger the Great Beast King of the Nine Mountains of the Great Wilderness? Rumor had it that the Great Beast King's background wasn't simple, so no realm lord level expert dared to make a move against the Great Beast King. They could only allow it to gather spirit beasts and establish the beast race.</p><p></p><p>"A bunch of brainless beasts, watch how I, Red Cat the Great Beast King, subdue them!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat stood up from the chair, holding the large blade, its beastly might surging.</p><p></p><p>Roar! After a roar, it transformed into a tiger as huge as a mountain. Beastly energy rolled, and the might of a great beast shook in all directions. In just an instant, some of the originally charging true spirits actually trembled and prostrated themselves.</p><p></p><p>This scene shocked everyone.</p><p></p><p>Although the true spirits that prostrated themselves weren't considered strong, only barely at the divine venerable level, this was the first time they had been intimidated and subdued under the might of the Great Beast King, breaking free from Mu Zhao's control!</p><p></p><p>This meant that the might of the beast race had the power to subdue true spirits.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat stood proudly, waving its large blade. The might of a great beast surged as it simultaneously used great beast divine abilities. In an instant, beastly energy rolled and beastly winds raged.</p><p></p><p>The originally charging true spirits actually halted their advance and slowly began to retreat.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, mindless beasts, how can you defy the might of my Great Beast King!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Finally able to display its great power and let these strong experts know the strength and awe-inspiring might of the Great Beast King.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Jade Little Dragon also charged over. Although it had the body of a true dragon, it was different from true dragons like Ao Lie. Its dragon might was more of a surging beastly might.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, beastly energy rolled all over its body.</p><p></p><p>Croak! Little Ha transformed to the size of a huge mountain, also with rolling beastly energy. It opened its giant mouth and spat out a vortex that ground up true spirits that entered, shredding them into pieces with the spatial power contained within!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the crowd of martial artists were shocked to discover that the three great beast kings of the Nine Mountains were all extremely extraordinary. Those beast race divine abilities were actually even more powerful and inconceivable than those of the true spirits led by the true dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

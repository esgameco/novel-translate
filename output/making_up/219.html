        <h1>Chapter 219</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan drew the terrain, topography, and the special features of the natural formation of the Hunting Demon Battlefield into a pattern, and incorporated it into the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>He also extracted some of the laws of heaven and earth from the first page of the Tai Cang Book, and integrated them into this pattern, forming a true grand formation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Or one could say, the grand scheme of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As the laws of heaven and earth were integrated, this grand formation became more complete, and the pattern looked profoundly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>"I drew the unique terrain of the Inner Realm into a pattern, and then integrated the laws of heaven and earth, forming a formation diagram. With this formation diagram, it will be easier for me to comprehend the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>A flash of inspiration came to Li Xuan's mind.</p><p></p><p>The unique terrain of the Inner Realm is mostly found in the Cyan North region.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Hunting Demon Battlefield, Li Xuan looked at the towering peaks of the Cyan North, as if they were the boundaries of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the gate to the Spiritual Realm was located here, indicating that these peaks had some special properties.</p><p></p><p>Were they the boundary mountains?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked among the peaks of the Cyan North, sketching the terrain and topography into patterns.</p><p></p><p>After returning, he would fill them with the laws of heaven and earth, step by step, to perfect them and draw out the formation diagrams.</p><p></p><p>Once the formation diagrams were completed, the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao would be almost fully created.</p><p></p><p>As long as he mastered the entry, the subsequent Mysterious Gate Martial Dao would be relatively easy to develop, as he would have a clear cultivation direction.</p><p></p><p>After wandering around the Cyan North, Li Xuan looked at the towering peaks, curious about what lay beyond them. So he climbed up one of the peaks.</p><p></p><p>Standing at the summit, the biting cold wind howled, and even a peak master would be unable to withstand the frigid conditions for long.</p><p></p><p>Looking out from the peak, he saw a vast expanse of mist and fog beyond the mountain range.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, he had already crossed over the peak and entered the misty realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's spiritual awareness enveloped the surroundings, and he couldn't help but frown. All he could see was the mist, until suddenly, it cleared, and he found himself on a small hillside.</p><p></p><p>There was no icy wind or snow, only lush greenery and the sounds of insects and birds.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!" Li Xuan took a deep breath. He had just flown from the peak, and it couldn't have been more than ten li away, but when he looked back, he could vaguely see the towering peaks of the Cyan North in the distance, far beyond the ten li range.</p><p></p><p>"It's as if I've been teleported away."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed, but he became intrigued.</p><p></p><p>The peaks of the Cyan North were the boundaries of the Inner Realm, the edge of the realm, and crossing over them seemed to have teleported him to a distant location.</p><p></p><p>Was this a teleportation formation set up by someone? Or was it the work of the laws of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan leaned towards the latter.</p><p></p><p>He moved his body and headed back towards the peaks. Soon, he returned to the Cyan North region.</p><p></p><p>He crossed the peak again, but the result was the same - he ended up in a distant location.</p><p></p><p>Even with his full focus and spiritual awareness covering the area, he couldn't detect any changes.</p><p></p><p>Standing at the summit again, this time Li Xuan slowly walked down the mountain, using his physical steps to cross over.</p><p></p><p>Halfway down the slope, Li Xuan's gaze shifted, and within the coverage of his spiritual awareness, he seemed to detect a subtle change in the terrain below the peak.</p><p></p><p>This change was imperceptible to the naked eye.</p><p></p><p>"The laws of heaven and earth are circulating here!" Li Xuan took a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly had a suspicion that there might be some issues with the laws of heaven and earth of the Tai Cang, and this place was the source of the problem, causing the leakage of the power of the laws of heaven and earth, forming a teleportation force.</p><p></p><p>This force could instantly transport people to distant locations.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm only at the Spiritual Awareness Realm, my spiritual awareness has refined the will of heaven and earth, so I can detect these leaking powers of the laws of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan realized.</p><p></p><p>Even cultivators at the Refined Spirit Celestial level might not be able to observe these leaking powers of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>But his ability to sense them was due to the fact that his spiritual awareness had refined the will of heaven and earth, and he had also thoroughly memorized the laws of heaven and earth from the first page of the Tai Cang Book, which were the key factors.</p><p></p><p>The two were inseparable.</p><p></p><p>To verify his guess, Li Xuan continued walking down the mountain, silently observing the fluctuations of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The subtle changes were manifested in his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>"A few more steps, and I'll reach the teleportation point!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes lit up, and he stepped forward into the area he had observed.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, as if it was the most natural thing, he found himself outside the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>"If I can draw the terrain below the mountain peak and the subtle changes into a formation diagram, can I comprehend the teleportation formation?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Thinking and acting immediately, he returned to the mountain peak and continued walking down, his spiritual awareness covering the area and memorizing the subtle changes.</p><p></p><p>However, these subtle changes involving the powers of the laws of heaven and earth were extremely difficult to record.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, Li Xuan had already memorized the pattern from the first page of the Tai Cang Book, so recording these subtle changes was just a matter of spending more time.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in no hurry to return to Canglan Island, and he kept going back and forth on the mountain, recording the subtle changes and continuously drawing them into patterns.</p><p></p><p>"I must draw out this formation diagram. The Mysterious Gate Martial Dao is almost complete. I just need to find a suitable disciple to comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly excited.</p><p></p><p>While drawing the formation diagram was difficult, it was not the most challenging part. The most difficult thing was finding a suitable disciple.</p><p></p><p>Geniuses were rare.</p><p></p><p>And the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao, whether it was formations, strategies, or weapon forging, all required exceptional talent.</p><p></p><p>People's talents had their own specialties, like Meng Chong's talent being more inclined towards physical martial arts, and Su Ling Xiu's talent being more focused on medicine...</p><p></p><p>"If I can't find one in the Inner Realm, I'll go to the Spiritual Realm. I'll definitely be able to find a suitable disciple."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Once again, he returned to the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>The formation diagram had already been drawn to 70% completion. With just a few more back-and-forth trips, he would be able to finish it.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, on his spiritual consciousness, the Golden Book of the Dao opened, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple, Meng Chong, has comprehended the first layer of your Unbreakable Golden Body. You have broken through the Unbreakable Golden Body!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had finally comprehended the first layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, as his strength had increased further.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with the breakthrough of the Unbreakable Golden Body, Li Xuan realized the true power of the Unbreakable Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Unbreakable Divine Armor appeared, and he seemed like a divine being descended to the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>"Even small Celestial Beings can't harm a single hair on me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at himself, with the divine armor covering his body, and his majestic aura, and he was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, his body suddenly expanded, transforming into a towering six-zhang giant.</p><p></p><p>The Unbreakable Divine Armor covered him, and the six-zhang Unbreakable Golden Body was truly like a divine being descended, invincible and unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>"This Cloud Cocoon Silkworm Silk robe is truly remarkable, as it can withstand my transformation into a six-zhang giant."</p><p></p><p>The robe Li Xuan was wearing was made of Cloud Cocoon Silkworm Silk.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he transformed into the six-zhang golden body, the silkworm silk robe did not tear or break, but remained perfectly fitted to his body.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but sigh, this cloud-realm silkworm silk made clothing was truly excellent.</p><p></p><p>Putting away the Inextinguishable Golden Body technique, Li Xuan descended the mountain again, quickly completing the array diagram, and then he should return to Canglan Island. After being away for so long, and Xu Yan had already broken through to the Tong Xuan Perfection, but he still hadn't broken through to the Divine Intent Realm, obviously he still hadn't completed the accumulation of his foundation.</p><p></p><p>Unable to guarantee that he would undergo sublimation and transformation during the breakthrough, that's why he was suppressing his realm and not breaking through.</p><p></p><p>After going back and forth dozens of times, Li Xuan excitedly looked at a mysterious pattern.</p><p></p><p>"This, is the teleportation array diagram, although it's only a basic one and a bit crude, as long as I can comprehend and set it up, teleportation should be no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>Once the teleportation array appears, it will greatly change the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>Even if separated by a great distance, by activating the teleportation array, one can arrive in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"The Mysterious Door Martial Dao has also been compiled, it's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took one last look at the Gate of the Spirit Realm, then turned and left, returning to Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Where did the master go?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked at the chair, where the figure was no longer there.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat came running over, squatting on the ground, meowing in a cute manner.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, no medicinal pills today!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu glared at the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Somewhat helpless, after all, it was a mighty demon, yet it was like a cat. But it had to be said, the chubby Red Cat looked really adorable.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat swung its tail and left, running to where Madam Xu was, since there were no medicinal pills here, Madam Xu's place must have some.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He looked at his wife with a helpless expression, "My lady, you used to cultivate for an hour and a half a day, how come it's been shortened now, you only cultivate for an hour?"</p><p></p><p>Madam Xu held a few medicinal pills in her hand, waiting for the Red Cat to come, lazily saying, "My lord, an hour is not short. As long as I persist in cultivating like this every day, my realm will also rise, right?</p><p></p><p>"It may be slow, but it's stable. I'm not suited for fighting and killing anyway, and no matter how hard I cultivate, I still can't catch up to you and Yan'er.</p><p></p><p>"With you and Yan'er here, I won't be in danger, and there's also the Red Cat, it's very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Just then, she saw the Red Cat quickly running over.</p><p></p><p>She immediately showed a smile, "The Red Cat is here, hurry and eat, don't starve, it won't be good if you get thin!"</p><p></p><p>Madam Xu rubbed the Red Cat's head and stuffed the medicinal pills into its mouth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He was speechless, looking at the Red Cat that came to mooch medicinal pills every day, wishing he could kick it away, but alas, he was no match for it. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, Madam Xu was protecting it, truly treating this mighty demon as a cat.</p><p></p><p>"A mighty demon, yet so shameless, mooching and freeloading!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He said with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat couldn't be bothered to pay attention to him, mooching and freeloading was the right way, it had recently eaten so many medicinal pills, its strength had also increased.</p><p></p><p>Was it supposed to hunt for food itself? That would be too tiring, it was the Red Cat, not a foolish demon, how could it not know how to live comfortably?</p><p></p><p>It directly lay down on the ground, rolling over to show its belly, acting like a cat begging for attention.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He couldn't bear to watch anymore and left with a gloomy face.</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak, Meng Chong and Xu Yan were exchanging insights on the martial dao, verifying with each other.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the Tong Xuan Realm is accumulating too slowly, lacking spiritual treasures to nourish my body."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the Tong Xuan Perfection, but the accumulation of his foundation was still slow to reach the pinnacle.</p><p></p><p>He had also consumed medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the grade of the spiritual herbs was a bit lacking, and the properties of these spiritual herbs were not very suitable for nourishing and accumulating the foundation, and after refining them into medicinal pills, the effect was also not enough.</p><p></p><p>At this rate of accumulation, it might take a considerable amount of time before he could accumulate enough.</p><p></p><p>"For my physical martial dao, even if I reach the Tong Xuan Perfection, the accumulation of the foundation will also be very slow."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, is it time to go to the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm, a new martial dao world, there are powerful martial dao celestials there, and the spiritual treasures are of higher grade, easier to accumulate the foundation. After going to the Spirit Realm, he might be able to quickly accumulate enough.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, but the inner domain here, my parents and family members are still weak, I can't always rely on the master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could now break through to the Divine Intent Realm, but he was not satisfied with that.</p><p></p><p>Every realm is an opportunity for self-sublimation and transformation, so he needs to accumulate the foundation to prepare for the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can he continue to advance on the martial dao path, surpassing those ancient geniuses!</p><p></p><p>Only in this way will he have a chance to raise his strength to about half of his master's.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, I still have some time before going to the Spirit Realm, there's me on Canglan Island, there won't be any problems, even if celestial beings come to attack, I can slay them!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"When I go to the Spirit Realm, I should be able to break through quickly, then I'll go to the Spirit Realm later."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, hearing this, was somewhat tempted.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, thank you, I'll go to the Spirit Realm after the master returns."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath and nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Only by going to the Spirit Realm can he accumulate the foundation more quickly and break through to the Divine Intent Realm sooner. And after breaking through the Divine Intent Realm, the Divine Origin Realm will not be far away.</p><p></p><p>Once he breaks through the Divine Origin Realm, he can leave a Divine Origin Avatar for his parents.</p><p></p><p>In this way, their safety will be guaranteed, even if there is turmoil in the inner domain, his Divine Origin Avatar can easily suppress it!</p><p></p><p>"There are many strong experts in the Spirit Realm, and they are not very friendly to us inner domain cultivators, but with a Jade Token, it seems we can avoid some trouble."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought for a moment and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Token is just a means for the forces to recruit us, there's no need to be bound by that when going to the Spirit Realm, and as for the people at the Spirit Realm's gate, they are not a concern."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, you're right, the journey to the Spirit Realm must be careful, as long as it's not a Refining Divine Celestial, there's no need to worry."</p><p></p><p>The Refining Divine Celestials in the Spirit Realm are the true supreme existences.</p><p></p><p>Small Celestials and Great Celestials, even if not their match, escaping is not a problem.</p><p></p><p>But Refining Divine Celestials, in the Spirit Realm, they are the top-tier existences, they won't be guarding the Spirit Realm's gate.</p><p></p><p>The chance of encountering them is extremely low.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned, sitting down in the familiar chair, feeling very relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you're back!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu excitedly came over and brewed a pot of spiritual tea for her master.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat also came running over.</p><p></p><p>The master is back, if it doesn't come and act cute, it might irritate the master, that wouldn't be good! "Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat rubbed against Li Xuan's leg, acting very affectionate and obedient.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, this fat tiger, it was really getting more and more clever, and losing its mighty demon aura, actually liking to act cute! "Red Cat, you're a tiger, you're a mighty demon... Forget it, as long as you work hard to improve your strength."</p><p></p><p>He still wanted to scold the Red Cat, to make it regain its mighty demon aura.</p><p></p><p>But seeing that its strength was also improving quite quickly, he couldn't be bothered to say anything.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 542</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle gazed at that finger bone, lost in thought for a while, and finally sighed. No wonder it felt familiar - his guess had actually come true.</p><p></p><p>"This is Fenyun's remains!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle said solemnly: "Fenyun was said to be a fire spirit. In terms of understanding and mastery of fire, no one was stronger than him. Although he didn't have any real enmity with Hongze, every time they met, they would argue and conflict would erupt.</p><p></p><p>"But that was the extent of it. When the arguments got intense, they would at most have a duel, but it never reached the level of deep hatred. In fact, their relationship was still quite good. According to Taicang, water and fire don't mix - with one being a fire spirit and the other a water spirit, this was inevitable."</p><p></p><p>Fenyun was one of the Lords of the Seven Realms, and the first to fall.</p><p></p><p>As for how he fell, probably no one knew except the other six Realm Lords. </p><p></p><p>Of course, even among the six Realm Lords, not all of them necessarily knew the truth about Fenyun's demise.</p><p></p><p>"It seems now that Fenyun was ambushed. This true spirit was one of those who ambushed him, and very likely, it was a true spirit from the Immortal Palace."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Among the Seven Realm Lords, Fenyun's fire-based offensive power was extremely strong, his firepower extremely violent. Perhaps this is why the Immortal Palace targeted Fenyun first?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle speculated.</p><p></p><p>"This is not where Fenyun fell. If a great battle had erupted here, Taicang and the others would certainly have sensed it and come to his aid immediately."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle lamented with some emotion, "Where exactly Fenyun was killed, and how he was killed, probably only Wumo and Taicang know."</p><p></p><p>Fenyun's remains were first discovered by Wumo. This matter would certainly have been told to Taicang, but whether it was told to Mingyü, Ao Hong, Hongze, and Qingling was uncertain.</p><p></p><p>"Just one finger bone is no ordinary treasure. I'll take this finger bone. It will be quite useful. Our conflict with the Immortal Palace is irreconcilable, and we will eventually fight against them. Using his finger bone to kill some of the Immortal Palace's people can be considered avenging him somewhat. Fenyun wouldn't object to this."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said with a sigh as he stepped forward, preparing to collect the finger bone.</p><p></p><p>Fenyun's finger bone contained the laws of fire and was a supreme fire treasure.</p><p></p><p>"Using his finger bone to kill enemies from the Immortal Palace - Fenyun would certainly not object, and would rather be pleased to see it."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand, laying down a restriction, about to seal and take the finger bone.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, with a boom, the finger bone erupted with a burst of flame.</p><p></p><p>The flames were violent, and one could vaguely sense the anger within the flames, as if that anger from just before Fenyun's fall had remained.</p><p></p><p>"Seal!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao raised an eyebrow, pointing with his finger. A restriction fell, sealing the flames.</p><p></p><p>Bang! But the restriction was broken by the wild flames erupting from the finger bone. That sense of anger grew stronger and stronger, seeming to have a kind of desperate resolve to perish together!</p><p></p><p>"Although it's not a remnant soul, it is a kind of obsession. How angry and unwilling Fenyun must have been when he died! For him to be so angry to the bone, it was probably because he encountered betrayal."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>He pointed with his hand, and as the power of the Extreme Soul swept by, the anger in the finger bone gradually subsided.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth Senior Brother, I've calmed the anger in the finger bone. The method of calming it is very simple - avenge him."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I understand. Having this anger is actually a good thing. Once we fight against the people of the Immortal Palace, this anger can evoke even stronger power."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded and waved his hand to take the finger bone.</p><p></p><p>The anger within the finger bone could make the flames more violent, increasing their power by 30%.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go."</p><p></p><p>This giant mountain formed from the fallen true spirit only had Fenyun's finger bone. Now that the finger bone had been taken, it was time to continue searching for Hongze's realm.</p><p></p><p>The four people and one turtle continued on their journey. Fang Hao began refining the materials he had collected, pondering how to forge a flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Over the next two days, they encountered several groups of true spirits. After hunting and killing them, they continued to advance, but still did not discover the location of Hongze's realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that Hongze's realm has really been taken away?"</p><p></p><p>Even the Sea Turtle began to waver.</p><p></p><p>"The probability of it being taken away is not small, but we came to the Immortal Land to explore and to gain experience. Let's just continue exploring."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not disappointed by this.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle looked around and said thoughtfully: "Perhaps our direction of exploration has deviated. The direction Hongze's realm shifted to may have exceeded my expectations. Let's explore for one more day. If we find nothing, we'll change direction."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a blood-red light appeared abruptly, arriving in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle's expression changed. With a rumble, a layer of blue-green light surged forth, like rolling waves, forming a defensive barrier.</p><p></p><p>The four brothers of Xu Yan's group looked towards that blood-red light. The newcomer was a minor Realm Lord, with blood light surging around him, his strength formidable.</p><p></p><p>One of the Blood Lords from the Mingyü Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Madness?!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle's gaze focused as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness looked at the Sea Turtle, then at Xu Yan and his three brothers, seemingly lost in thought. Then he slowly raised his hand, a blood blade appearing in his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Sea Turtle, you're actually still alive."</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness was somewhat surprised. He looked at Xu Yan and the other three again, saying coldly: "Which of you four is Xu Yan? Which is Meng Chong? I, Blood Madness, have also heard of the prodigies from the Taicang Realm."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his head, his face full of delight, "I never thought that my name, Meng Chong, would spread even to the Mingyü Realm."</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness clearly came with ill intent. With Meng Chong's current strength, he was naturally no match for a minor Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sea Turtle was also at the level of a minor Realm Lord. The four people and one turtle together were not afraid of Blood Madness.</p><p></p><p>"You are Meng Chong, so you must be Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness looked at Xu Yan and said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Since we've encountered each other, it can only be considered your bad luck. This must be your fatal calamity!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness's killing intent was palpable.</p><p></p><p>"Don't count on the Sea Turtle to protect you. His defense is fine, but his offense and speed are lacking. You four will perish here in this Immortal Land today."</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness raised his hand, blood light reflecting in the Immortal Land. A huge blood blade appeared in front of him, emanating a cold killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle's expression was solemn as he transmitted: "Blood Madness's strength is not weak. Although I have recovered from my injuries, I haven't fully returned to my peak state from before. Moreover, he's not wrong - I excel at defense, but my offense and speed are not good.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Madness appearing here, I guess he's also after Hongze's realm. This indicates that Hongze's realm hasn't been taken away by the Immortal Palace. He must have guessed that we're here for Hongze's realm too.</p><p></p><p>"I'll do my best to resist his attacks. Look for a chance to escape."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, however, calmly said: "Old Turtle, it's enough that your defense is strong. From now on, you focus on defense, we'll handle the offense. Since Blood Madness has encountered us, it's his bad luck."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle was stunned, looking at Xu Yan in surprise, "You want to kill him? Are you already capable of slaying a minor Realm Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How much time had passed? Xu Yan's strength had already reached this level?</p><p></p><p>"Still a bit short, but it would be very difficult for a minor realm lord to harm me. You can focus on defense without worry. Your speed is slow, but we're not slow. We can always hide within your defenses. Leave the attacks to us brothers - it's a good chance to test our combined strength against a minor realm lord, which will be good training."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had now reached the peak of the Heaven and Earth realm. Although he couldn't kill a minor realm lord, it would also be difficult for a minor realm lord to break through his Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword defense.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping had all reached the great completion stage of the Heaven and Earth realm. With the Sea Turtle responsible for defense, they naturally weren't afraid of Blood Madness's threats. </p><p></p><p>The four brothers joining forces represented the fusion of four martial arts schools. It wasn't impossible for them to kill Blood Madness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan would attack with his powerful sword techniques. Meng Chong would target Blood Madness's physical body. Jiang Buping would target his soul. Fang Hao would use formations to restrict, seal, interfere with and confuse the opponent, finding his weaknesses.</p><p></p><p>"Then be careful!" The Sea Turtle nodded.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan and his brothers had chosen to fight, they clearly had some confidence.</p><p></p><p>Boom! As Blood Madness waved his hand, an enormous blood blade slashed over. His figure moved in an instant, appearing at the Sea Turtle's side. He struck out again, wanting to bypass the Sea Turtle and attack Xu Yan's group directly.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Madness, you can talk after breaking through my defense!" </p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle roared. Brilliant blue light bloomed on its shell. In an instant, its body grew to the size of a small mountain, the entire turtle like a giant shield.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's group hid behind the Sea Turtle, watching Blood Madness intently, ready to strike.</p><p></p><p>"I may not be able to break your defense, but you clumsy old turtle, wanting to protect people is just a foolish dream!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness sneered.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, blood shadows multiplied. His figure darted about, constantly attacking while looking for gaps to get close, trying to bypass the Sea Turtle's defense to attack Xu Yan's group.</p><p></p><p>But what he didn't expect was that while the Sea Turtle's speed couldn't match his, Xu Yan's group was not slow at all. Every time he got close, they would move behind the Sea Turtle's defense before he could attack, avoiding his strikes.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting, but how long can you dodge?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness was unconcerned. The geniuses of the Cang Heaven Realm - even he had heard of them. It was understandable they would have such abilities.</p><p></p><p>"Dodge?" Xu Yan smiled disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In an instant, the light of the Indestructible Realm sword flashed. Violent spiritual energy and indestructible energy condensed into sword after sword, each containing extreme killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword circled Xu Yan, endless and inexhaustible. He stood directly outside the Sea Turtle's defense, facing Blood Madness.</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also instantly transformed into a golden giant, golden armor and divine waves rolling, truly like a god.</p><p></p><p>Violent physical power surged constantly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao patted his weapon box. Divine artifacts shot out one after another, scattering to the four corners of the battlefield. He stomped his foot, and the grand formation of the Qimen school appeared, using the battlefield as the array.</p><p></p><p>In this area of the Indestructible Realm, a great momentum gathered in an instant, like a deep pool or quagmire.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A faint glow appeared on Jiang Buping's body, like a layer of soul armor. He gripped an ultimate soul weapon in his hand, constantly condensing extreme killing power.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness's expression tightened slightly, shocked in his heart. Only now that he saw Xu Yan's group display their martial arts did he truly understand why those Blood Kings and Blood Princes were so shocked by Xu Yan and Meng Chong's powerful martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"What martial arts are these?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness felt grave. Whether it was Xu Yan's sword techniques, or the godlike aura Meng Chong displayed, or Fang Hao's Qimen grand formation, or Jiang Buping's ultimate soul techniques - they had all exceeded Blood Madness's understanding. These were martial arts he had never heard of before.</p><p></p><p>"Left behind by Cang Heaven?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Madness's desire to kill Xu Yan's group grew even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, Meng Chong and the other two must be Cang Heaven's backup plan, seeds left to seek revenge in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Just from the martial arts Xu Yan's group displayed, Blood Madness believed that if any one of them broke through to the Realm Lord level, he would be no match.</p><p></p><p>This showed how powerful the martial arts Xu Yan's group practiced were.</p><p></p><p>It meant that if any one of them became a Realm Lord, their strength could very possibly match or even exceed the former Cang Heaven?</p><p></p><p>Four Cang Heavens joining forces - how could the Indestructible Divine Palace resist?</p><p></p><p>"With just you, you dare to resist?"</p><p></p><p>Though shocked in his heart, Blood Madness's tone was dismissive and contemptuous.</p><p></p><p>"Strike!"</p><p></p><p>As Blood Madness spoke, an enormous blood blade instantly struck out towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, blood shadows multiplied, turning into rolling waves of blood. Powerful aura surged, and blade after blade of blood appeared in the rolling blood waves, emanating piercing killing intent, attacking from all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" </p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle warned. Blue light surged on its shell, turning into rolling ocean waves, forming a shield to block the incoming blood blades.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Xu Yan raised his hand and pointed. Sword energy flowed and sword intent surged, gathering into a huge, cold sword light. This sword seemed to have a sacred aura.</p><p></p><p>The sharp killing intent faded. One couldn't even sense killing intent from this sword - only a sacred aura, as if it were a holy sword rather than a killing blade.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, get closer to him!" Xu Yan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Getting too close makes it easy for him to find weaknesses."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be afraid. Give him this chance. Let's see if he can block our brothers' attacks. Find the right moment to turn your defense into offense and restrain him a bit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle thought about it. Xu Yan's group were true disciples of that person - how could they not have life-saving trump cards? So the Sea Turtle began to endure Blood Madness's attacks and move closer.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness's lips curled in a cold smile. He slowed his attacks, letting the Sea Turtle approach. He looked at Xu Yan's group, a glimmer of mockery flashing in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Young and impetuous, wanting to seize an opportunity, thinking they could harm or even kill him by joining forces? Too naive! He was a minor realm lord - how could he be killed so easily? Since they were taking the risk to assassinate him, it gave him a chance too. They were seeking death, so he would oblige them!</p><p></p><p>How could Blood Madness not know their intentions? But he didn't care at all, and instead went along with their plan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was calm, not hiding his intentions at all, also letting Blood Madness see the opportunity. We'll see who has the last laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogance and underestimating the enemy comes with a price."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed coldly in his heart. Blood Madness relied on his strength as a minor realm lord, and the Sea Turtle was good at defense but not offense. He thought he could ignore the combined attack of Xu Yan's group, thinking he could easily block it and seize the chance to strike. But he didn't know that even though he was a minor realm lord, he couldn't block the combined attack of all four.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

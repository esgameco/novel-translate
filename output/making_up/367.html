        <h1>Chapter 367</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spiritual domain is vast and expansive. Even if the supreme Spiritual Sect Alliance and the communication system established by the Millennium Alliance were to work together, it would still take a considerable amount of time to thoroughly search the entire spiritual domain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not in a hurry about this. The Qingcheng Pavilion's flying ship remained stationed in Rainbow State, waiting for news from Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual domain should not have so many hidden dangers, there shouldn't be another Celestial Abyss." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made this judgment in his heart. </p><p></p><p>However, a thorough search would ultimately bring more peace of mind.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingcheng Pavilion, Su Ling Xiu was researching the Underworld Blood Pearl.</p><p></p><p>The rest were all diligently cultivating on their own. Du Yu Ying, Yun Miao Miao, and Zi Yun in particular felt a sense of inadequacy after the previous great battle. </p><p></p><p>They must strive to complete their cultivation as soon as possible, so that when they enter the Divine Realm, they can immediately set about preparing to break through to the Condensed Fa Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was designing divine abilities, including eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand-Mile Eyes? The name isn't strong enough. Heaven's Eyes? Eyes of Illusion Dispelling? Eyes of Void Perception?" Li Xuan murmured to himself, beginning to ponder eye technique divine abilities. "Let's keep it simple - call it the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. It can penetrate illusions and phantoms, captivate the mind, perceive the flow of time and space, and possess the might of the Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's inspiration surged, and a powerful eye technique divine ability emerged - the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>"It's powerful, but difficult to compose and comprehend... The Eyes of the Heavenly Dao shall be an extremely formidable great divine ability. But before perfecting it, I can compose a simplified version of the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. It can serve as the foundation for cultivating the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. Once I've grasped and comprehended the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, it will be easier to compose the true Eyes of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had made his decision. While the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao in his conception was supremely powerful, it was not easy to compose, and even after composing it, it would not be easy to comprehend. This required an extremely high realm, and theoretically, the lower realms would be unable to wield the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he would compose the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao as a foundational cultivation for the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, while not as powerful as the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, is still extremely formidable at this stage. The higher the realm, the greater its power. </p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it is more suitable for Xu Yan's current realm to comprehend."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began composing the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. Although he had already composed many martial arts and divine abilities, and had gained much experience, composing the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao was still not easy. </p><p></p><p>Blind composition would not work - there had to be a theoretical framework, otherwise how could it be comprehended?</p><p></p><p>"In addition to the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, I should also compose other eye technique divine abilities. In the future, there will be more and more people cultivating divine abilities, and the cultivation difficulty of the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao will undoubtedly be extremely high, only monstrous geniuses would be able to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"So I should also compose some weaker eye technique divine abilities, or those focused on specific abilities, such as killing enemies, perceiving illusions, or bewildering the mind..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began adding a new divine ability category, eye technique divine abilities, to the martial arts canon.</p><p></p><p>"Divine abilities are countless, and it all depends on my own composition. No matter how hard I try, there will always be limitations. The most fundamental thing is to compose a set of methods for cultivating and comprehending divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>"In this way, talented cultivators will be able to comprehend divine abilities on their own. As time accumulates, these martial arts and divine abilities will become more and more numerous and diverse."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly realized that relying solely on himself to compose divine abilities, no matter how hard he tried or how much he racked his brain, would ultimately be limited.</p><p></p><p>The key was to compose a path for cultivating and comprehending divine abilities, allowing future geniuses to comprehend them on their own!</p><p></p><p>"I only need to compose powerful divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan had found his positioning for composing divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>While composing the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, Li Xuan also began pondering the fifth martial art. He already had some preliminary ideas for the fifth martial art, he just needed to refine and see if it was feasible.</p><p></p><p>Time passed as Li Xuan composed the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao and pondered the fifth martial art. It had been a month since the collapse of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>On the Divine Realm side, there had been no movement, and no powerful experts had come to repair the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>It was unclear whether there were no experts with such power, or if the Divine Realm's Qinghua Realm was truly in great turmoil, leaving them no time to attend to the affairs of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others finally returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, as he had expected, the Spiritual Realm did not harbor any other hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spiritual Realm, such as Wu Tian Nan, had gradually returned to Rainbow State, all waiting for a powerful figure to repair the Divine Bridge and open the way to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qinghua Realm of the Divine Realm might be in great turmoil, it could not stop their determination to enter the Divine Realm. </p><p></p><p>Only by entering the Divine Realm could they reach higher martial dao realms and witness the flourishing martial arts of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Since that is the case, then let's go."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and made a grasping motion. With a thunderous sound, a rift appeared in the sky, and a rainbow bridge emerged before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>The broken bridge seemed to be slowly repairing itself. A giant hand gripped the Rainbow State end of the bridge, like a chain, and flung it forward.</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>The rainbow light spanned the azure sea, reaching the other shore.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, the Divine Bridge opened again.</p><p></p><p>The rainbow light gathered and solidified, appearing in the sky, spanning the azure sea and reaching the other shore.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge was a law, and not a powerful one, it merely possessed the ability to connect the Spiritual Realm and the Divine Realm. With Li Xuan's current strength and understanding of the laws of heaven and earth, reconnecting the Divine Bridge was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>As the Divine Bridge appeared, everyone was excited and elated. They were also relieved, grateful that there was a powerful figure in the Spiritual Realm, otherwise it would have been a great calamity, and the Spiritual Realm might have been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge had been restored, but no powerful experts had appeared from the Divine Realm side.</p><p></p><p>Logically speaking, with the Divine Bridge having collapsed and now restored, the Divine Realm should have sent experts to investigate.</p><p></p><p>But there was nothing.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spiritual Realm's hearts sank. This situation meant that the situation in the Divine Realm's Qinghua Realm was not good.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship transformed into a beam of light and landed on the Divine Bridge, heading towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan took a deep breath and stepped onto the Divine Bridge, following closely. He was both excited and apprehensive in his heart. </p><p></p><p>Would the person he was looking for really be in the Divine Realm? Would they still be alive?</p><p></p><p>All of this was unknown.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, he would keep searching.</p><p></p><p>"Follow me," the Great Zhou Emperor and other powerful experts of the Spiritual Realm said solemnly to the young geniuses.</p><p></p><p>The group stepped onto the Divine Bridge, and after walking for only a moment, the Divine Bridge on the Rainbow State side began to dim and fade away.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The bridges have time limits. Once someone steps onto the divine bridge, the divine bridge will disappear between heaven and earth when the time is up.</p><p></p><p>All those who wish to enter the divine realm must board the divine bridge within a certain time frame, or they will miss their chance! The divine bridge spans the azure sea, reaching the other shore, which also means the divine bridge is very, very long.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat slowly advances on the divine bridge, and Xu Yan and the others curiously observe the divine bridge, even trying to comprehend the principles of the divine bridge, wanting to glimpse how the divine bridge truly exists.</p><p></p><p>This segment of the journey is somewhat lengthy due to the slow pace of travel.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they see the other end of the divine bridge on the distant shore, landing in front of a long, narrow gorge, like a chasm that has opened up between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, it seems they can see a vast, boundless expanse beyond the gorge.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm, the Qinghua Boundary.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Boundary connects to the Spiritual Realm, the gateway opened by the divine bridge, one of the thirty-six boundaries of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>It is time for the divine bridge to open again.</p><p></p><p>However, this time period, the Qinghua Boundary is not peaceful, as it is in the midst of great turmoil in the Underworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Boundary is ruled by three major powers: the Tianwu Gate, the Wanlei Sect, and the Great Yue Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Aside from these three major powers, the rest of the forces are dependent on and must obey the commands of the three major powers.</p><p></p><p>Apart from the three major powers, there is another force in the Qinghua Boundary called the Blood Shadow Tower, which has allied itself with the Underworld Abyss and has always been a major thorn in the side of the Qinghua Boundary.</p><p></p><p>Despite countless attempts to eradicate them, they have never been completely eliminated, and they resurface to cause trouble every so often, even colluding with the Underworld Abyss to invade the Qinghua Boundary.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Qinghua Boundary began several years ago, initially just due to the regular disturbances caused by the Underworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the divine bridge about to open again, and the Spiritual Realm about to send its talented cultivators to the Divine Realm, the situation has escalated.</p><p></p><p>As expected, the Thousand Martial Hall, a subordinate of the Tianwu Gate, has opened a virtual bridge, and a Condensed Dao Saint from the Tianwu Gate has descended to the Spiritual Realm, prepared to bring the talented cultivators back.</p><p></p><p>Due to the threat of the Underworld Abyss, the three major powers are to some extent allied and have formed a coalition.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the entire Divine Realm, the situation is more or less the same, as the greatest threat to the Divine Realm is the Underworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Each force bears the responsibility of suppressing the local Underworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The enemies of the Underworld Abyss in the Qinghua Boundary are all from the Underworld, with hundreds of large and small Underworld Abysses, but the truly powerful Underworld Abysses are only three in number.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, the three major powers each take responsibility for guarding one of the Underworld Abysses.</p><p></p><p>The struggle with the Underworld Abyss has been ongoing for countless years, with many Underworld Abyss blood servants slain, and many cultivators from the Qinghua Boundary also perishing.</p><p></p><p>But many powerful figures have also risen from the battles with the Underworld Abyss. The Underworld Abyss is both a threat and a treasure trove, albeit extremely perilous.</p><p></p><p>Slaying the Underworld Abyss blood servants and blood slaves who invade can yield treasures from outside the Divine Realm, even from realms beyond this world.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of this that there is no shortage of cultivators from the Qinghua Boundary who venture into the Underworld Abyss, despite knowing the dangers, in the hopes of obtaining some treasures.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the rewards offered by the three major powers, they can also obtain some treasures from the Underworld Abyss itself.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall has opened a virtual bridge, and the Condensed Dao Saint from the Tianwu Gate, representing the three major powers, has descended to the Spiritual Realm to bring back the cultivated spiritual prodigies.</p><p></p><p>According to past practice, these spiritual prodigies, once they enter the Divine Realm, will break through to the Condensed Dao Realm within three years.</p><p></p><p>Once they break through to the Condensed Dao Realm, they can go to the Underworld Abyss to guard a location, becoming a minor powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>However, this time, it seems there has been an unexpected incident.</p><p></p><p>After the Tianwu Gate's Condensed Dao Saint descended to the Spiritual Realm, he did not return even after the virtual bridge disappeared, indicating that something unexpected has occurred in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Tianwu Gate had planned to send more powerful cultivators to the Spiritual Realm, but the Underworld Abyss that the Tianwu Gate was guarding has launched a massive invasion, forcing them to abandon the plan.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Underworld Abyss is escalating, and what is even more shocking to the three major powers is that the Blood Shadow Tower has actually produced an Immortal Realm cultivator! An Immortal Dao Saint, when the Qinghua Boundary has only a few such figures!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Dao Saint of the Blood Shadow Tower has suddenly launched a sneak attack on the Immortal Dao Saint of the Great Yue Dynasty who was guarding the Underworld Abyss, colluding with an Underworld Abyss blood servant in that Abyss to injure the Great Yue Dynasty's Immortal Dao Saint.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Underworld Abyss has launched a massive invasion, with countless blood servants rampaging across the Great Yue Dynasty, setting off a great calamity.</p><p></p><p>The Tianwu Gate, the Wanlei Sect, and others have to dispatch reinforcements to support the Great Yue Dynasty, while also facing threats to the Underworld Abysses they are guarding, leaving them stretched thin.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, at this critical juncture, the divine bridge has opened.</p><p></p><p>Reluctantly, a True King from the Wanlei Sect who had returned from the Underworld Abyss battle has set out for the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, at the moment the divine bridge opened, all the Underworld Abysses in the Qinghua Boundary erupted, with the Blood Shadow Tower causing chaos everywhere, one Underworld Abyss after another falling.</p><p></p><p>Blood slaves have invaded the Qinghua Boundary, and even blood servants have entered the Qinghua Boundary, plunging the region into an extremely dire crisis.</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators of the Qinghua Boundary have emerged to suppress the Underworld Abysses, exterminating the rebels and intercepting the blood servants and blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking events then occurred - the divine bridge collapsed! The Spiritual Realm has been invaded by the Underworld Abyss! And that True King has been slain!</p><p></p><p>The True King Dao Saints of the Wanlei Sect were preparing to go to the Spiritual Realm for rescue, but were ambushed on the way and are engaged in an endless battle, unable to reach the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the entire Qinghua Boundary is in chaos, with Underworld Abyss blood servants rampaging, one city after another being sacrificed in blood rituals.</p><p></p><p>Some cultivators of the Qinghua Boundary, in their despair, have even defected to join the Underworld Abyss blood servants, participating in the blood sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the three major powers are all in a desperate situation, unable to spare the manpower to rescue the Spiritual Realm, and with the divine bridge severed, only Immortal Dao Saints can reach the Spiritual Realm without it.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, no Immortal Dao Saint can leave, as they are needed to suppress the Underworld Abyss blood servants and prevent them from invading the Qinghua Boundary.</p><p></p><p>"We must seek outside aid!"</p><p></p><p>The three major powers are embroiled in bitter battles, and the entire Qinghua Boundary has become a living hell, with some remote and weaker cities already turned into ghost towns, shrouded in faint blood mist.</p><p></p><p>"Open the Boundary Gate, seek outside aid!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor, holding a long spear, stands at the edge of the Underworld Abyss, facing off against a blood-colored figure within.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Dynasty has fallen!</p><p></p><p>Neither the Tianwu Gate nor the Wanlei Sect can provide aid at the moment. Without outside assistance, the casualties in the Great Yue Dynasty will be unimaginably heavy.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>A burly man in silver armor, wielding a long saber, solemnly responds.</p><p></p><p>Open the Boundary Gate!</p><p></p><p>Among the thirty-six boundaries of the Divine Realm, they can quickly travel between them by relying on the Boundary Gates, directly crossing over to reach another boundary, without the need for a long journey.</p><p></p><p>The Boundary Gates are not man-made, but rather formed by the condensation of the laws of heaven and earth, appearing after the great division of the Divine Realm into thirty-six boundaries.</p><p></p><p>The thirty-six boundaries are connected, but the Boundary Gates are located in the central regions, which are also under the control of the strongest forces in each boundary.</p><p></p><p>Once opened, one can directly reach the central region of another boundary, saving the time of a long journey.</p><p></p><p>This is an important channel for the thirty-six boundaries to seek aid from one another.</p><p></p><p>At this critical moment, with the Qinghua Boundary in turmoil and the Great Yue Dynasty facing a crisis, they have no choice but to seek outside aid. Even though the neighboring boundaries may also be in upheaval, as long as they have the strength, they will surely come to their aid.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

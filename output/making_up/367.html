        <h1>Chapter 367</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The spirit realm was vast. Even with the combined efforts of transcendent spirit sects and the communication system built by the Eternal Alliance, it would still take considerable time to search the entire spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not in a hurry about this. The Changqing Pavilion flying ship remained in Hong Province, waiting for news from Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit realm shouldn't have so many hidden dangers. There shouldn't be any more celestial caves," Li Xuan concluded in his mind. </p><p></p><p>However, conducting a search would ultimately be more reassuring.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Changqing Pavilion, Su Lingxiu was studying the Netherworld Blood Pearl.</p><p></p><p>The others were all diligently cultivating. Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao and Zi Yun especially felt this way - the recent great battle had given them a sense that they were too useless. They had to strive to complete their cultivation as soon as possible, so that upon entering the divine realm, they could quickly prepare to break through to the Condensed Law Celestial Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was creating divine abilities, specifically eye techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Thousand Mile Eyes? The name's not strong enough. Heavenly Eyes? Illusion-Breaking Eyes? Void-Penetrating Divine Pupils?" Li Xuan muttered to himself as he pondered eye technique divine abilities. "Let's keep it simple - call it the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. It can penetrate illusions and phantasms, captivate people's souls, observe the flow of time and space, and possess the might of the Heavenly Dao..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's inspiration surged, and a powerful eye technique divine ability emerged.</p><p></p><p>Eyes of the Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>"It's powerful, but not easy to create. And it would be difficult to comprehend... Let's consider the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao as an extremely powerful greater divine ability. But before perfecting it, I can create a reduced version of the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"I'll call it the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. It can serve as the entry requirement and foundation for cultivating the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"That's the plan. First create the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. Once it's comprehended and understood, it will be easier to create the true Eyes of the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made his decision.</p><p></p><p>In his conception, while the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao was incredibly powerful, it would not be easy to create. Even if created, it would not be easy to comprehend. </p><p></p><p>This required an extremely high level of cultivation. Moreover, theoretically, the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao could not be used at low cultivation levels.</p><p></p><p>So, creating a foundational stage for cultivating the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao - the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao - would serve as a basis.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao is not as powerful as the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, it is still incredibly powerful at the current stage. The higher the cultivation level, the more powerful it becomes.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, it's more suitable for Xu Yan to comprehend at his current level."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began creating the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao. Although he had created many martial arts techniques and divine abilities, gaining considerable experience, creating the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao was still not easy.</p><p></p><p>Simply making things up wouldn't work. There needed to be a theoretical framework, otherwise how could it be comprehended?</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, I should also create some other eye technique divine abilities. After all, there will be more and more people cultivating divine abilities in the future. The difficulty of cultivating the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao will certainly be extremely high, and only prodigious geniuses will be able to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"So, I should also create some weaker ones, or ones focused on specific abilities, such as killing enemies, seeing through illusions, confusing people's minds, and so on..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began adding a new divine ability classification to the martial arts canon - Eye Technique Divine Abilities!</p><p></p><p>"There are myriad divine abilities, all created by me alone. No matter how much I create, it will be limited. So the most fundamental thing is to create a method for how to cultivate and comprehend divine abilities on one's own.</p><p></p><p>"This way, geniuses will be able to comprehend divine abilities on their own. As time accumulates, these martial arts divine abilities will inevitably become more numerous and varied."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly realized that relying solely on himself to create divine abilities, no matter how hard he tried or racked his brains, would ultimately be limited.</p><p></p><p>Only by creating a path or method for cultivating and self-comprehending divine abilities could he allow future geniuses to comprehend on their own!</p><p></p><p>"I only need to create powerful divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan found his position in creating divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>While creating the Lesser Eyes of the Heavenly Dao, Li Xuan also began to ponder the fifth martial way. He already had some initial ideas for the fifth martial way.</p><p></p><p>However, it was not yet finalized, but he could think about and refine it to see if it was feasible.</p><p></p><p>Time passed as Li Xuan created the Eyes of the Heavenly Dao and pondered the fifth martial way. A month had already passed since the collapse of the divine bridge.</p><p></p><p>There was no movement from the divine realm, nor did any supreme beings come to repair the divine bridge.</p><p></p><p>It was unknown whether there were no supreme beings with such power, or if the Qinghua Realm in the divine realm was truly in chaos and had no time to attend to matters in the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others finally returned.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. As he had expected, there were no other hidden dangers lurking in the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and other spirit realm powerhouses gradually returned to Hong Province, all waiting for the expert to take action, repair the divine bridge, and open the path to enter the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Qinghua Realm in the divine realm might be in chaos, it could not stop their determination to go to the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Only by going to the divine realm could they reach higher levels of martial arts and witness the prosperity of martial arts in the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, let's go."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and grabbed forward. With a rumbling sound, it was as if a hole had been torn open in midair! Rainbow light appeared again, and a bridge appeared before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>The broken bridge seemed to be slowly recovering on its own.</p><p></p><p>A giant hand grasped the section of the bridge in Hong Province, like a chain, and flung it forward.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The rainbow light spanned the azure sea, crossing it, as if reaching the other shore.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, the divine bridge opened again.</p><p></p><p>Rainbow light swirled, and the divine bridge continuously solidified, appearing in midair, spanning the azure sea and reaching directly to the other shore.</p><p></p><p>The divine bridge was a rule of law, and not a strong one. It only had the ability to connect the spirit realm and the divine realm. With Li Xuan's current strength and understanding of the laws of heaven and earth, reconnecting the divine bridge was an easy task.</p><p></p><p>As the divine bridge appeared, everyone was excited and thrilled.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they were grateful in their hearts that the spirit realm had an expert. Otherwise, it would surely have been a great disaster.</p><p></p><p>The spirit realm would likely have been destroyed!</p><p></p><p>The divine bridge was restored, but no powerful beings appeared on the divine realm side.</p><p></p><p>Logically, since the divine bridge had collapsed and was now restored, there should have been powerful beings from the divine realm coming to investigate.</p><p></p><p>But there weren't!</p><p></p><p>The hearts of the spirit realm powerhouses sank! Such a situation meant that the situation in the Qinghua Realm of the divine realm was not good.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship turned into a streak of light, landing on the divine bridge and heading towards the divine realm along the bridge.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath and followed closely, stepping onto the divine bridge. His heart was both excited and a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>Was the person he was looking for really in the divine realm? Were they still alive?</p><p></p><p>All of this was unknown.</p><p></p><p>But no matter what, he would keep searching.</p><p></p><p>"Follow!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou and other supreme beings of the spirit realm looked at those geniuses and said sternly.</p><p></p><p>The group stepped onto the divine bridge. After stepping onto the bridge and walking for just a moment, the Hong Province end of the divine bridge began to dim and fade away.</p><p></p><p>Each time, after stepping onto the divine bridge...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All bridges have time limits. Once someone steps onto the divine bridge, it will disappear between heaven and earth when time is up.</p><p></p><p>Anyone wishing to enter the divine realm must ascend the divine bridge within a certain time frame - no waiting for latecomers! The divine bridge spans the azure sea, reaching directly to the other shore, which means it is very, very long.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat slowly advanced on the divine bridge. Xu Yan and the others curiously observed the bridge, even trying to comprehend its principles, wanting to glimpse how the divine bridge existed.</p><p></p><p>This part of the journey was somewhat lengthy due to the slow progress.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they saw the other end of the divine bridge on the far shore of the azure sea, landing in front of a long, narrow canyon, like a rift torn open between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, they seemed to see beyond the canyon - a vast and boundless land.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Divine Realm, Qinghua Border.</p><p></p><p>Qinghua Border connects to the Spirit Realm, one of the 36 borders of the Divine Realm where the divine bridge opens a gateway.</p><p></p><p>It was time again for the divine bridge to open.</p><p></p><p>However, during this time, Qinghua Border was not peaceful, being in the midst of chaos from the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qinghua Border was ruled by three major powers: Tianwu Gate, Wanlei Sect, and Great Yue Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>Apart from these three powers, all other forces existed by attaching themselves to the big three, having to obey their orders.</p><p></p><p>Besides the three major powers, there was another force in Qinghua Border called the Blood Shadow Tower, formed by martial artists who had defected to the Netherworld Abyss. They had long been a major internal threat to Qinghua Border.</p><p></p><p>Despite countless attempts to eliminate them, they always managed to survive and would cause trouble every so often, even cooperating with the Netherworld Abyss to invade Qinghua Border.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in Qinghua Border had started several years ago, initially just the three major powers dealing with routine disturbances from the Netherworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>With the divine bridge about to open again, and by their calculations, it was time for the Spirit Realm to send more prodigies to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Thousand Martial Hall, subordinate to Tianwu Gate, opened a virtual bridge. A Condensed Law Celestial from Tianwu Gate descended to the Spirit Realm, preparing to bring back prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Due to the threat from the Netherworld Abyss, the three major powers were allied to some extent.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the entire Divine Realm, this was generally the case, as the greatest threat to the Divine Realm was the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Every power bore the responsibility of suppressing their local Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Qinghua Border's Abyss enemies all came from the Netherworld, with hundreds of large and small Abysses, but only three truly powerful Netherworld Abysses.</p><p></p><p>Conveniently, the three major powers each took charge of guarding one Netherworld Abyss.</p><p></p><p>The struggle against the Netherworld Abyss had continued for countless ages. Many Netherworld blood disciples were killed, and many martial artists from Qinghua Border also perished.</p><p></p><p>But there were also many strong individuals who rose up from the battles in the Netherworld Abyss. The Abyss was both a threat and a treasure trove, albeit an extremely dangerous one.</p><p></p><p>Slaying invaders like Netherworld blood disciples and blood slaves could yield treasures from beyond the Divine Realm, even from beyond this world.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, even knowing the dangers of the Netherworld Abyss, there was no shortage of martial artists from Qinghua Border willing to go fight in the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Besides the rewards offered by the three major powers, they could also obtain some treasures from the Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Thousand Martial Hall opened the virtual bridge, and a Condensed Law Celestial from Tianwu Gate descended to the Spirit Realm on behalf of the three major powers to bring back the cultivated spirit body prodigies.</p><p></p><p>According to past practice, these spirit body prodigies would break through to the Condensed Law realm within three years of entering the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once they broke through to the Condensed Law realm, they could be stationed in the Abyss to guard an area, considered minor powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>However, this time there seemed to be an unexpected situation.</p><p></p><p>After the Tianwu Gate Condensed Law Celestial descended to the Spirit Realm, he did not return even until the virtual bridge disappeared. Something seemed to have gone wrong in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Tianwu Gate was preparing to send another powerful expert to descend to the Spirit Realm again, but the Netherworld Abyss they were guarding launched a major invasion, forcing them to abandon the plan.</p><p></p><p>The chaos from the Abyss grew increasingly rampant. What shocked the three major powers even more was that Blood Shadow Tower actually produced an Immortal realm martial artist! An Immortal Celestial - how many were there in all of Qinghua Border?</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Celestial from Blood Shadow Tower suddenly ambushed the Immortal guarding the Abyss for the Great Yue Dynasty, joining forces with a Netherworld blood prince from that Abyss to wound the Immortal Celestial of the Great Yue Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>It was at this moment that the Abyss launched a full-scale invasion, with endless blood shadows rampaging through the Great Yue Dynasty, thus beginning the great chaos.</p><p></p><p>Tianwu Gate, Wanlei Sect and others had to both send people to support the Great Yue Dynasty and face the threat from the Abysses they were guarding, stretched thin on all sides.</p><p></p><p>Coincidentally, at this time, the divine bridge opened.</p><p></p><p>With no other choice, a True King from Wanlei Sect who had just returned from fighting in the Abyss set out for the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, when the divine bridge opened, all the Abysses in Qinghua Border erupted. Blood Shadow Tower caused trouble everywhere, and one Abyss after another fell out of control.</p><p></p><p>Blood slaves invaded Qinghua Border, and even blood disciples entered. For a time, Qinghua Border faced an extremely severe crisis.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of Qinghua Border all appeared, suppressing the Netherworld Abysses, hunting down traitors everywhere, and killing blood disciples and blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Even more shocking events followed - the divine bridge collapsed! The Spirit Realm was invaded by the Abyss! That True King was even slain!</p><p></p><p>Several True King Celestials from Wanlei Sect prepared to go to the Spirit Realm for rescue but were intercepted halfway. They fought continuously but could never reach the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all of Qinghua Border was in chaos, with Netherworld blood disciples rampaging and one city after another being blood sacrificed.</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists from Qinghua Border, in despair, even defected to the Netherworld blood disciples and participated in the blood sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>For a time, all three major powers were in dire straits, unable to spare any forces to rescue the Spirit Realm. Moreover, with the divine bridge broken, only Immortal Celestials could descend to the Spirit Realm without relying on the bridge.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, not a single Immortal could leave their post, needing to intimidate the Netherworld blood princes to prevent them from invading Qinghua Border.</p><p></p><p>"We must call for aid!"</p><p></p><p>The three major powers were caught in bitter battles, and the whole of Qinghua Border seemed to have turned into a hell on earth. Some more remote cities, some weaker cities, had already become dead cities.</p><p></p><p>Only faint blood mists lingered in those cities.</p><p></p><p>"Open the border gate, call for outside help!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor, holding a long spear, stood at the edge of the Abyss, facing off against a blood-red figure inside.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Nation had fallen!</p><p></p><p>Neither Tianwu Gate nor Wanlei Sect had the strength to come to their aid at this moment. Without outside help, the casualties in the Great Yue Nation would be unimaginably severe.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" responded a burly man in silver armor, holding a long saber.</p><p></p><p>Open the border gate!</p><p></p><p>For the 36 borders of the Divine Realm to travel quickly between each other, they could only rely on border gates. Crossing directly through a border gate would allow one to reach another border.</p><p></p><p>The existence of border gates was not artificially created, but formed by the laws of heaven and earth, appearing when the world greatly changed and the Divine Realm was divided into 36 borders.</p><p></p><p>The 36 borders were connected, but the border gates were in the central regions of the 36 borders, also within the control of the strongest powers in each border.</p><p></p><p>Once opened, one could directly reach the central region of another border from the central region of this border, saving the time of a long journey.</p><p></p><p>It was also an important channel for the 36 borders to seek help from each other.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with Qinghua Border in chaos and the Great Yue Nation facing crisis, they had no choice but to seek outside help. Although neighboring borders might also be in turmoil, they would surely come to aid if they had any strength to spare.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

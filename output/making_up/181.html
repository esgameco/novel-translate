        <h1>Chapter 181</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of Iron Mountain County were anxious and restless, and many of them had fled far away from the vicinity of the Qingqing Pavilion, with some even hiding in the mountains, waiting for the situation to pass before returning.</p><p></p><p>Undoubtedly, the most dangerous place in Iron Mountain County now was where the grand masters were, let alone the middle and lower-level martial artists who were not even at the third rank.</p><p></p><p>Even the slightest aftershock of a battle could reduce them to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Although Iron Mountain County was some distance away from the Qingqing Pavilion, the powerful figures who came would inevitably stay in the county. </p><p></p><p>As a result, the martial artists in the county had all temporarily left the county to find a place to avoid the turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Even the ordinary people had sensed that something was amiss and fled the county.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, the county had become desolate.</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion also had no guests coming and going, becoming cold and quiet.</p><p></p><p>On the top floor of the Tianbao Pavilion, a few people were sitting, sipping tea, completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Two of them, with graying hair, as if they had weathered the vicissitudes of life, were sipping tea while looking at the outline of the Qingqing Pavilion outside.</p><p></p><p>"What a grand spectacle! There hasn't been such a scene since the collapse of the dynasty," one of them said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed!" the other nodded.</p><p></p><p>"The elixirs are truly profound, revolutionizing the cultivation of the martial dao, a groundbreaking innovation in the martial world that has attracted much attention. It's only natural."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the Tianbao Pavilion will enjoy it exclusively, or just watch the unfolding events?"</p><p></p><p>The two chatted casually, unaffected by the pressure exerted by the various powerful factions.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi-Nurturing Elixir alone is not enough to make the Tianbao Pavilion abandon its principles. Let's see, the key is not the Qi-Nurturing Elixir formula or the Qi-Nurturing Elixir production method, but the person who created it.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianbao Pavilion has always valued talented individuals."</p><p></p><p>One of them spoke with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Exactly, such a talented individual, if not recruited by the Tianbao Pavilion, would be a pity. So the Qingqing Pavilion can be divided up, but that person belongs to the Tianbao Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The other nodded and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Acquiring one person was not difficult for them, no matter how many powerful figures gathered, as long as the Tianbao Pavilion wanted to protect someone, no one could touch them.</p><p></p><p>Since the various factions wanted the Qi-Nurturing Elixir, then so be it.</p><p></p><p>The Tianbao Pavilion's vision was not limited to the Qi-Nurturing Elixir.</p><p></p><p>In the Qingqing Pavilion, Su Lingxiu's expression was grave. She didn't expect that it would cause such a huge commotion, with many powerful figures from the inner domain gathering.</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbao Pavilion had a smiling expression as he chatted with Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, the situation facing the Qingqing Pavilion is not good. As far as I know, the Grand Marshals of the Heavenly Robe Guard and the Heavenly Guardians of the Great Yue Kingdom have come, and they are all peak grand masters. Each of them has brought three grand master experts."</p><p></p><p>"Furthermore, the powerful figures revered by the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family have also come. Roughly estimating, there are more than fifty peak grand masters gathered here."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what this means? Since the collapse of the dynasty, there has never been such a gathering of peak grand masters."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that fifty is a lot. You have to know that after the collapse of the dynasty, countless powerful figures have perished, and the martial world has been resting and recuperating for a long time. The accumulated peak grand masters are not few."</p><p></p><p>"The collapse of the dynasty was over ten thousand years ago. Even if a peak grand master emerges every twenty years, you can imagine how many there would be. Let alone the inner domain, where it's impossible for a peak grand master to appear only once every twenty years."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's heart trembled as he listened. He was not unaware of the significance of peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Even if his son could kill one with a single sword strike, he would need fifty strikes. Let alone the peak grand masters joining forces, how could they be so easily killed? One would be no match, let alone ten - it was too dangerous!</p><p></p><p>The only thing that gave him confidence was the powerful seniors.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty peak grand masters? They are overestimating the Qingqing Pavilion too much," Xu Junhe chuckled dryly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, the Qingqing Pavilion is doomed. Considering our friendship, you can come to the Tianbao Pavilion to seek refuge. As long as you come to the Tianbao Pavilion, your safety will be guaranteed."</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbao Pavilion said with a smile, implying that the Qingqing Pavilion should give up the Qi-Nurturing Elixir and hand it over to the various factions.</p><p></p><p>The core members of the Qingqing Pavilion, mainly the ones who had developed the Qi-Nurturing Elixir, could join the Tianbao Pavilion, and their safety would be assured.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was secretly shocked. The manager of the Tianbao Pavilion's implication was rather terrifying. </p><p></p><p>More than fifty peak grand masters had gathered, yet joining the Tianbao Pavilion could guarantee their safety. This showed how terrifying the Tianbao Pavilion's strength was.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, the Tianbao Pavilion has always respected talented individuals and provided them with generous treatment, without restricting their freedom..."</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbao Pavilion continued to smile.</p><p></p><p>"I appreciate your kindness, but the Qingqing Pavilion still has some foundation. We haven't reached that point yet. If we really have no other choice, I'll consider it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe replied with a smile, not closing the door completely to avoid provoking the Tianbao Pavilion to join the faction targeting the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"If you decide, just activate this signal flare, and the Tianbao Pavilion's experts will come to rescue you."</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbao Pavilion left behind a signal flare.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Junhe thanked him, the manager left. Xu Junhe's expression became grave as he hurriedly went to the inner court of the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty peak grand masters?" Meng Shushu's face turned pale. This was too terrifying.</p><p></p><p>How could Permit Yan alone withstand so many peak grand masters?</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was covered in cold sweat and said, "The inner domain is this powerful? The Great Yue Kingdom is too strong, and our Great Wilderness is too weak!"</p><p></p><p>However, he gritted his teeth and said, "If we get through this, I will definitely overthrow the Great Yue Kingdom!"</p><p></p><p>This was a life-and-death battle for the Qingqing Pavilion. If they won, they would officially rise to the ranks of the supreme powers in the inner domain. If they lost, they would lose everything.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu hurriedly ran to Li Yuan's side and asked anxiously, "Master, you can deal with them, right?"</p><p></p><p>Fifty peak grand masters! She had thought they only needed to face the Great Yue Kingdom or the Black-Robed faction. </p><p></p><p>But now, many top factions had gathered, and even with the help of the Sword Immortal Cliff, the pressure was immense.</p><p></p><p>Li Yuan had a helpless expression. The number of peak grand masters in the inner domain was a bit too much, wasn't it?</p><p></p><p>However, upon further reflection, he didn't find it unexpected.</p><p></p><p>As the manager of the Tianbao Pavilion had said, after the collapse of the dynasty, the martial world of the inner domain had not experienced major conflicts and was in a period of recuperation. The number of peak grand masters, the pinnacle of the inner domain's martial arts, had naturally accumulated over the years.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not all peak grand masters, they were close. In the vast inner domain, there were no shortage of talented individuals who had reached the peak of martial arts over the years.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Because they have already reached the peak of the martial dao, they are all striving for perfection and constantly exploring how to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there are not many peak grand masters who walk among the common people.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if peak grand masters do not reveal their strength, ordinary martial artists cannot even detect them, which is why there are many peak grand masters who exist only in rumors in the inner domain martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>Now, with huge benefits in sight, peak grand masters are revealing their whereabouts one after another, gathering together, naturally shocking the four corners! "I'm here to enjoy life, my disciple. In the future, you must work hard in cultivation. As for these peak grand masters, it's a bit embarrassing for me to deal with such weak ones."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted Suli's hand and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Suli felt ashamed: "Master, it's my fault for causing you trouble."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had just returned and, hearing the master's words, immediately felt ashamed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there are only fifty peak grand masters. I can handle them!" Xu Yan gritted his teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>He was deeply ashamed, "Master is a reclusive immortal, but because of me, he has to come out. He should be enjoying a comfortable and carefree life, but now he has to deal with such weak ones. For the master, this must be very unpleasant."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked himself, if his own strength reached a certain level, but he had to deal with dozens of ordinary people, he would also feel very helpless and embarrassed.</p><p></p><p>They are such disappointing disciples!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt the same way. Although he was at the peak of the innate realm, if he had to deal with dozens of ordinary people, he would also feel that it was beneath his status.</p><p></p><p>Although it was necessary to take action, one could imagine how reluctant they must be.</p><p></p><p>Master, this must be the feeling you have now.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his three disciples, their faces full of shame, and inwardly nodded, knowing his disciples' reluctance.</p><p></p><p>They should strive to make their master proud, and diligently cultivate, the faster their strength increases, the better.</p><p></p><p>There is no better way to motivate the disciples to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Xu Yan, although Xu Yan's strength was very strong, he was still at the peak of the innate realm. Dealing with seven or eight, or even ten peak grand masters, would still be within his capabilities.</p><p></p><p>Fifty peak grand masters gathered together, their might was absolutely beyond Xu Yan's current strength.</p><p></p><p>Unless he broke through to the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>"Disciples, do not be blindly stubborn. A wise person does not seek momentary courage. When the enemy is numerous, it is only natural to be unable to defeat them. I have said before, a true martial artist is not a reckless fool!"</p><p></p><p>He must instill in his disciples the idea of retreating when they cannot win, so that in the future when they encounter powerful enemies, they will not stubbornly resist to their detriment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt ashamed and said, "I will remember the master's teachings."</p><p></p><p>Fifty peak grand masters, Xu Yan knew that with his current strength, he could not defeat them, and could only choose to flee.</p><p></p><p>If it were ten or eight, he would still have a chance to win.</p><p></p><p>"Master, won't I have to trouble you to take action?" Xu Yan said shamefully.</p><p></p><p>It's all his fault for being so disappointing, that he can't even deal with fifty peak grand masters, and needs the master to step in.</p><p></p><p>He made a silent vow to delve deeper into the martial dao, break through to the Tong Xuan realm as soon as possible, and improve his own strength. Being unable to even handle these weak ones and needing the master's help, he feels unworthy of the martial teachings imparted by the master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, stretched his waist and limbs, and said, "I do not use realm to oppress others, I shall subdue them with the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>"Well, it's time for me to move a bit. Disciples, watch carefully and see the might of the Tong Xuan realm."</p><p></p><p>It's finally time for him to take action.</p><p></p><p>Another opportunity to show his disciples his great strength!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others perked up upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>"The master is truly a reclusive immortal, he does not use realm to bully others, even when facing numerous enemies. This is the true mark of a great master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought admiringly.</p><p></p><p>"In terms of realm, the innate realm is on par with inner domain masters, while the Tong Xuan realm is on par with grand masters. The master is using only the Tong Xuan realm to subdue numerous peak grand masters, it's simply unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"This is true same-realm invincibility, no matter how many same-realm enemies there are, one person can subdue them. When will I be able to achieve this?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was inwardly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Suli was greatly excited, finally about to witness the master's display of power again.</p><p></p><p>The shocking scene of the master shattering a grand master with a single palm strike was still vividly etched in her memory. And now he was going to subdue dozens of peak grand masters with his own strength.</p><p></p><p>What an extraordinary sight this would be!</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu and the others also heaved a sigh of relief. Since the senior has taken action, there will naturally be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had an admiring look on his face, this is my Great Wasteland Martial Ancestor! He finally has the honor of witnessing the Ancestor's display of power, and using same-realm strength to subdue the enemies.</p><p></p><p>"The glory of the Great Wasteland will definitely shine in the inner domain!" Kou Ruozhi thought excitedly, his mind already planning how to overthrow the Great Yue Kingdom after this incident.</p><p></p><p>Rebellion! He must rebel!</p><p></p><p>As long as the Ancestor subdues all the incoming enemies and possesses the Blossoming Pill resources, he will have the backing to rally the strong ones of the Great Yue Kingdom. He failed in the borderlands, but this time in the inner domain, he must succeed in overthrowing the Great Yue Kingdom's royal family.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the excited crowd and muttered to himself, "Could there be an existence above grand masters? As long as it's not tens or twenties, it should be fine. Otherwise, my image as an immortal might be hard to maintain.</p><p></p><p>"Fifty peak grand masters, no big deal. With my current strength, even if a hundred came, I could still push them all aside with ease."</p><p></p><p>After assessing his own strength, Li Xuan felt assured. Fifty peak grand masters were just a small matter.</p><p></p><p>He also sighed inwardly, the allure of these pills is truly beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>However, after this incident of him subduing numerous peak grand masters, the Long Qing Pavilion will surely shake the inner domain and become a formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Those who want to refine pills will have to consider their strength carefully.</p><p></p><p>Afterwards, many factions and martial artists will have to come to the Long Qing Pavilion to purchase pills.</p><p></p><p>"Will the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion make a move? What kind of experts do they have?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan would not overlook the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Since he's going to take action, he must be prepared to face the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's retaliation.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's confidence in protecting Xu Junhe and the others, even with many factions joining forces, means their strength must be extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Let's say it's a hundred peak grand masters, no problem, I can still push them all aside with ease."</p><p></p><p>After evaluating, Li Xuan felt that he had already reached the peak of the inner domain, an invincible existence.</p><p></p><p>These are just small matters, no need to worry!</p><p></p><p>He leisurely sat back down in the chair, playing with a jade scepter, about to continue encouraging his disciples, letting them know the shame and then the diligence in cultivating the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The more diligent the disciples, the stronger the master can become, and the greater the martial dao cause can grow.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he furrowed his brows and looked up towards the outside of the Long Qing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Eight figures were floating over.</p><p></p><p>The leading one, leaning on a cane, had the appearance of an aged elder, extremely old and decrepit. Behind him were seven others, all peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>Dressed in black robes, except for the old man in the lead, they all kept their faces hidden.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

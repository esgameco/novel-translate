        <h1>Chapter 498</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue felt surprised, yet not entirely unexpected, as he had already guessed something like this.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, only he could have cultivated such an extraordinary prodigy. What is he plotting? Should I retreat now and report to Lord Tiansha, or take a risk?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue found himself in a dilemma. </p><p></p><p>He looked back at Xu Yan standing on the true dragon's head. The Heaven Fusion realm martial artist who had just attacked had already turned to ashes and scattered.</p><p></p><p>"Or, should I kill his disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue pondered.</p><p></p><p>He was 100% confident he could kill Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the Qinghua Realm, Yin Jue made a decision.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go to the Qinghua Realm and see what exactly he's plotting there. Once I find out clearly, it will be more certain if the Realm Lord takes action."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Yin Jue concealed his traces and slowly widened the distance to avoid being detected.</p><p></p><p>Since the person was here, he would enter the Qinghua Realm from another location.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he could be killed later. It wasn't urgent to kill him until after understanding the Qinghua Realm situation.</p><p></p><p>With the assistance of the Mist Beast's true spirit, Yin Jue silently and slowly left, looking for a suitable place to enter the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly looked at the Revenge Alliance, "Attack together, otherwise you have no chance!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Revenge Alliance were all shocked. How could Xu Yan be so strong? That was a Heaven Fusion realm martial artist who had used a secret technique, even fighting with his life on the line and unleashing extremely powerful strength, yet was still killed by Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"Kill him, attack together!"</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was no turning back.</p><p></p><p>The Revenge Alliance leader said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Boom! One Heaven Fusion realm martial artist after another stepped forward, their auras surging and connecting, forming a joint attack formation. It was as if they had become one with this part of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that only by shattering this piece of heaven and earth could they be defeated!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, although you are strong, we are not afraid of you when we join forces!"</p><p></p><p>The Revenge Alliance leader's expression was resolute, looking ready to go all out.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Today I'll let you see what the power of heaven and earth truly means."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled faintly.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and grabbed. With a thunderous sound, heaven and earth shook. A majestic power suddenly descended, as if bringing down an entire realm of heaven and earth with it.</p><p></p><p>Heavenly might swept through, thunder roared, all things transformed into sharp sword light. In an instant, sword light from heaven and earth surrounded them, with an aura of annihilation enveloping all directions.</p><p></p><p>"Our Treasure Alliance did not come for Young Master Xu, please don't misunderstand!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, several Heaven Fusion realm martial artists wiped cold sweat from their foreheads and retreated.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You didn't come for me? Then did you come just to watch?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was indifferent.</p><p></p><p>"We came to deliver treasures to Young Master Meng of the Heavenly Gods!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi wiped cold sweat from his forehead and said with a flash of inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we came to deliver treasures to Young Master Meng!"</p><p></p><p>The other Treasure Alliance experts nodded hurriedly in agreement.</p><p></p><p>They hastily distanced themselves from the other martial artists, quickly retreating. At this moment, how could they still have thoughts of revenge? Even Heaven Fusion realm experts were like little grasshoppers, simply courting death.</p><p></p><p>"You Treasure Alliance cowards!"</p><p></p><p>The Revenge Alliance leader and others glared angrily.</p><p></p><p>"What cowards? Our Treasure Alliance has always admired Young Master Xu for subduing dragons and saving the God Realm from danger! Your actions are despicable! We came with you originally to assist Young Master Xu at the critical moment. Did you really think our Treasure Alliance would sink to your level? Young Master Xu's divine might covers the world, naturally he doesn't need our help. Now is the time to draw a clear line with you and tell you the truth!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi said righteously.</p><p></p><p>The Revenge Alliance leader and others almost coughed up blood. The bastards of the Treasure Alliance were such fence-sitters!</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and the others were dumbfounded. </p><p></p><p>Were the Treasure Alliance martial artists really so good at reading the situation?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head, stepped forward, and sneered: "I heard that your Treasure Alliance wanted to suppress the Heavenly God and avenge past grudges!"</p><p></p><p>"Absolutely not! This was definitely not spread by our Treasure Alliance. It was the shameless people of the Revenge Alliance who falsely used our Treasure Alliance's name, intending to drag us down with them. Young Master Meng, please see clearly!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi and the other Treasure Alliance martial artists saw that with each step Meng Chong took, his body grew ten feet taller. In just an instant, he had transformed into a giant, like a god, with a terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>The current Meng Chong was incomparably stronger than when he was in the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi and the others' hearts trembled. On one hand they accused the Revenge Alliance of being despicable and shameless, falsely using the Treasure Alliance's name to frame them and trying to use Meng Chong to destroy the Treasure Alliance, which was truly hateful.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, they frantically flattered Meng Chong, cold sweat dripping from their foreheads like raindrops, while hurriedly taking out treasures.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Meng, Great Hero Meng, every word we say is from the bottom of our hearts! We really did come to deliver treasures!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi hurriedly took out an ancient artifact.</p><p></p><p>"This is an ancient artifact that our Treasure Alliance happened to obtain in the God Realm. This item seems to have other mysteries, but our cultivation is low and our vision is shallow, so we ultimately couldn't perceive its profundities. Therefore we specially came to offer it to Young Master Meng!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we all came to deliver treasures."</p><p></p><p>The other Treasure Alliance martial artists nodded repeatedly, hurriedly taking out their own prized treasures.</p><p></p><p>As expected of top experts from the Treasure Alliance, their prized treasures were all extraordinary, including many ancient artifacts. As for how many mysteries these ancient artifacts held, it was unknown, but they certainly had some special qualities.</p><p></p><p>"Since you came to deliver treasures, I'll accept them!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded. These Treasure Alliance guys really knew how to read the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Young Master Meng!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi and the others were grateful, so moved that tears almost flowed from their eyes.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the Revenge Alliance leader and others had resolute expressions, showing their determination to fight to the death. At this point, they could not retreat like the Treasure Alliance.</p><p></p><p>The slogan of slaying the Sword God and capturing the true dragon had already spread to all martial artists in the God Realm, while the Treasure Alliance's slogan had only been shouted a couple times as an afterthought.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Treasure Alliance could pin everything on them, but they could not do the same.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a terrifying person. Since he had given them two paths and they didn't cherish the opportunity, now they could only fight to the death, perhaps with a slim chance of victory.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>The Revenge Alliance martial artists roared and attacked together. Their powerful attacks shook heaven and earth, ripples spreading in all directions, accompanied by a low rumbling sound.</p><p></p><p>A huge, ferocious giant mouth appeared between heaven and earth, swallowing towards them, as if it would devour both heaven and earth along with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Should we retreat?" </p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue felt her heart pounding.</p><p></p><p>This attack was too strong. She couldn't withstand it at all and could only avoid its sharp edge.</p><p></p><p>After all, she was not yet an adult, just a young dragon, with strength only at the Heaven Fusion realm.</p><p></p><p>"Mere child's play."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression didn't change as he raised his hand and pointed forward. With a thunderous sound, heavenly might transformed into a sword. Silent and invisible, yet it seemed like a sword born from the creation of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It lightly slashed through the ferocious giant mouth.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gently, as if a soft breeze, it swept over the group of Snow Shame Alliance warriors.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Heavenly Earth realm. This sword strike can slay a Divine Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao was shocked in his heart and couldn't help but sigh inwardly.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike from Xu Yan seemed ordinary, like a gentle breeze, but its profundity was such that even Divine Venerable realm warriors would find it difficult to withstand!</p><p></p><p>The battle result was, of course, without any surprise, just as Xu Yan had said - these Heavenly Union realm warriors were nothing but jumping clowns.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao turned and left.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was silently watching. Even Ao Yuxue couldn't help but widen her eyes, staring at that group of Heavenly Union realm warriors.</p><p></p><p>The world had returned to calm, the heavenly might was gone, and the magnificent aura had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone was watching in silence.</p><p></p><p>Even those Immortal Venerable who had followed to watch the excitement, or who harbored thoughts of taking advantage if an opportunity arose, were silent, with a hint of confusion in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>Why had those powerful Heavenly Union realm experts suddenly become quiet?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, oh, okay!" Ao Yuxue was stunned for a moment, then turned her dragon body, preparing to return to the Qinghua Realm, wanting Xu Yan to get off her head sooner.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, as she turned, it was as if something was triggered, or as if a gentle breeze had been stirred up. The silent Snow Shame Alliance warriors suddenly turned to ash and scattered!</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi and the other Wanbao Alliance powerhouses were drenched in cold sweat, their hearts trembling, while also feeling fortunate for their own cleverness.</p><p></p><p>The many Immortal Venerables who had followed were soaked at this moment, their clothes drenched in cold sweat, their lips trembling, their hearts quivering.</p><p></p><p>"Better to provoke a true dragon than to provoke the Sword God!" Someone muttered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, riding the true dragon, returned to the Qinghua Realm. Su Lingxiu and the others were also preparing to return. As for those Immortal Venerables, they were all scared out of their wits and wouldn't dare enter the Qinghua Realm without permission.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, a figure walked out from the crowd.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, come out and face death!"</p><p></p><p>The voice was cold and filled with hatred that reached the skies.</p><p></p><p>The group that was about to return to the Qinghua Realm suddenly stopped and looked back.</p><p></p><p>A young man walked out from the crowd, his eyes fierce, killing intent palpable. As he walked, he unstrapped a long saber from his back.</p><p></p><p>The long saber, tightly wrapped in leather, now began to emit a sinister aura. Evil, violent, and bloody intentions surged out from the saber.</p><p></p><p>"Are you crazy? Didn't you see Xu Yan's strength? Your current power is no match for him. Quickly retreat and come back for revenge when your strength has increased!" Blood Extreme was extremely anxious.</p><p></p><p>This body double seed had not yet been fully cultivated and couldn't become his substitute physical body. He had originally thought that with his methods and the Blood Prison Saber, it would have enough strength to kill Jiang Buping for revenge.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan's displayed strength completely exceeded expectations.</p><p></p><p>And Jiang Buping and Xu Yan seemed to be from the same sect. If Jiang Buping was in danger, wouldn't Xu Yan intervene? If Xu Yan made a move, the body double seed would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>And this remnant soul of his would also be in danger of perishing.</p><p></p><p>Although he was extremely cautious and had left a wisp of remnant soul behind, that wisp was really not much, quite weak, and it would be almost impossible to recover.</p><p></p><p>It could only truly cling to life, which was why Blood Extreme was so agitated.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can kill Jiang Buping, it's fine. With my current strength, I can definitely kill Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's voice was almost manic, unable to suppress the hatred in his heart, as if he was beginning to lose his rationality.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you really kill Jiang Buping, you won't survive. Xu Yan will kill you!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme cursed inwardly, wondering why everyone he found was an idiot.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can avenge Yan'er, what does it matter if I die? I'm not afraid of death!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's eyes were full of madness, full of uncontrollable hatred.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Blood Extreme cursed silently. Cloud Yan'er was already dead, and even when she was alive, she had never really looked at him, only treating him as a servant to order around. Yet he was willing to risk death for such a person? What kind of brain was this?</p><p></p><p>The hatred in the young man's eyes grew stronger and stronger, his eyes blood-red. "It's all Jiang Buping's fault. Before, Yan'er would call on me to do things every day. After becoming Jiang Buping's fiancée, she started giving me attitude.</p><p></p><p>"It's all Jiang Buping's fault. If it weren't for him, Yan'er would have been with me long ago!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme felt this guy was beyond saving, he had started self-hypnotizing. He silently cursed himself for being blind, how did he choose such a person.</p><p></p><p>He had originally thought this was someone whose heart was filled with hatred, and he could use that hatred to stimulate his madness and ruthlessness, cultivating him into a more suitable body double seed.</p><p></p><p>But instead, he was completely filled with irrational hatred, occupying his entire mind, willing to give up his life for so-called revenge!</p><p></p><p>"No good, I need to find a way to avoid this disaster!" Blood Extreme's gaze became solemn. In his current state, it would be difficult to forcefully control this physical body. He would encounter strong resistance, and since the body double seed was not yet fully cultivated, if he completely took over this physical body, it would be extremely difficult for this remnant soul to recover its strength.</p><p></p><p>"If only I had more time to complete the cultivation of the seed, why did it have to come to this?" Blood Extreme lamented inwardly.</p><p></p><p>If the body double seed had been fully cultivated, why would he need to let him risk his life? He could directly occupy the physical body and melt its soul. But alas, the time was not ripe.</p><p></p><p>"Since you insist on taking revenge now, this seat will lend you a hand. At the critical moment, remember to act according to my words. Only then can you get your great revenge and still survive!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme spoke solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I can get revenge, what does it matter if I die? This life is not worth cherishing, I will certainly give my all!"</p><p></p><p>The young man's face was full of determination.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme almost cursed out loud, but finally held back and said in a deep voice, "Don't you want to live and pursue even the slightest chance of resurrecting Cloud Yan'er?"</p><p></p><p>The young man's expression paused, and amidst his madness, a look of longing appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I want to resurrect Yan'er. Senior, I will definitely listen to you. As long as Jiang Buping dies, I'll do whatever you say. No matter how slim the hope, I will exhaust everything to resurrect Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme felt relieved inwardly and said with satisfaction, "Good, good, it's not in vain that I've guided you. As long as you hold firm to this belief, not only will you get your great revenge, but you will certainly be able to resurrect Cloud Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>"Activate the Blood Prison Saber now, activate it completely. Stir up heaven and earth, use the Blood Prison Demon Abyss, challenge Jiang Buping, issue a challenge for a one-on-one battle. Stay away from Xu Yan, otherwise you won't be able to kill Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>"A battle of geniuses, a one-on-one duel, use this reason. Jiang Buping will accept the challenge. Don't reveal your full strength, otherwise if Jiang Buping sees that your strength is too great, he might not accept the challenge, and you'll lose your chance!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme began to give instructions.</p><p></p><p>He was also planning how to escape. Whether or not Jiang Buping could be killed, this body double seed was destined to die, without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>He would either die at Jiang Buping's hands or at Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>So, Blood Extreme began to plan his escape strategy, as well as how to select the next body double seed, to prepare for recovering his strength and rising again.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 308</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wu Yuan's strength was not weak, and he even used a secret technique similar to burning one's life force to activate the divine artifact of the Thousand Martial Hall. This strike was not inferior to the one Huang Liang unleashed earlier.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Wu Yuan's current cultivation level, he was actually able to unleash the divine artifact's power to such a degree, which must have been empowered by an extremely powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's divine element was in motion, and the refined Clarity Sword within his body was trembling slightly, but he did not draw it out.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand was forged by Fang Hao, a top-grade spiritual weapon. </p><p></p><p>Of course, the spiritual weapons forged by Fang Hao's spiritual refinement techniques were not comparable to the spiritual weapons of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, the power of the divine artifact of the Thousand Martial Hall was unleashed by Wu Yuan, who had exhausted his entire cultivation, and was further empowered by an extremely powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>The sword in his hand could withstand the divine artifact without being destroyed, but he would still be unable to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave, but he did not retreat at all.</p><p></p><p>Just because one sword could not block it, it did not mean he had no way to defend against it!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the large swords inserted around the arena platform rose into the air and lined up in front of Xu Yan, while countless sword lights also appeared behind him.</p><p></p><p>Clang! At this moment, the spectating martial artists suddenly found that their swords were no longer under their control.</p><p></p><p>"My sword!"</p><p></p><p>Cries of alarm rang out.</p><p></p><p>Countless cold sword lights shot out, arranging themselves around Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this time, Wu Yuan's aura also reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>His entire body began to wither, as his divine spirit, essence blood, and the entirety of his cultivation were poured into the Frigid Severance Blade.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, die!"</p><p></p><p>His withered body seemed to rise up and wield the blade, or perhaps the blade was controlling him.</p><p></p><p>A bone-chilling blade light came slashing from the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate, traversing the vast sky. The cold killing intent was so palpable that even the distant martial artists felt as if they were plunging into an icy abyss.</p><p></p><p>Between the Thousand Martial Hall's mountain gate and the spot where Xu Yan stood, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to be frozen by the bone-chilling blade light, forming a trail of icy radiance in the air.</p><p></p><p>Boom! By the end, the strike of the Frigid Severance Blade divine artifact even had the power of the great forces of heaven and earth infused into it, turning the blade light into a deep azure color.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the martial artists, it was as if they saw an azure giant blade hundreds of meters long, instantly slashing towards the figure in the air!</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! Sword lights surged through the air, like a torrential flood of countless swords, rushing to meet the azure blade.</p><p></p><p>Puk puk puk! However, one sword after another was shattered and destroyed, yet the azure blade light continued to approach, seemingly unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji's heart clenched, silently cursing the Thousand Martial Hall's despicable tactics. But it also served as a reminder that the battle between geniuses would require more preparation from the Myriad World Alliance. If the Thousand Martial Hall had such methods, the other supreme sects would not be lacking either.</p><p></p><p>The sects definitely did not want to lose this battle, so they would undoubtedly use all their trump cards.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong stared intently at Xu Yan, wondering if he could block this strike, or if he had hidden any trump cards. Otherwise, where did he get the courage to challenge the Thousand Martial Hall at their doorstep?</p><p></p><p>"You must block it!" Cui Huayu silently prayed.</p><p></p><p>The torrential sword flood continued to unleash strike after strike, constantly assaulting the azure blade light. Even large trees were uprooted and transformed into swords.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had also transformed into sword lights, constantly washing against the azure blade.</p><p></p><p>However, although the azure blade light had slowed down and even dimmed slightly, it was still slashing towards Xu Yan, and he could not retreat or evade it. This strike had already locked onto his aura - there was no retreat or evasion possible.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was what others thought, but for Xu Yan, evading this strike was not an impossible task. However, Xu Yan, while not being a reckless person, was also not the type to cower and retreat at the first sign of danger.</p><p></p><p>Although the divine artifact's power was formidable, it was not something he could not withstand!</p><p></p><p>The torrential sword flood suddenly became weaker, like a surging stream, and as the azure blade light slashed into the sword stream, it seemed to get entangled within it, with its power constantly being diminished.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out sword after sword, and the gentle breeze seemed to turn into a viscous liquid, containing the might of the Sword Dao, continuously weakening the azure blade light.</p><p></p><p>"Blocking it without a single scratch?" Cui Huayu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This Sword Dao is rather unusual, able to so greatly diminish the power of the Frigid Severance Blade," Cui Huayu pondered in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, the Frigid Severance Blade still has another attack hidden!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Cui Huayu's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>On the battlefield, an unexpected turn of events occurred.</p><p></p><p>The azure light and the cold aura, which had been diminishing, suddenly erupted with a dazzling brilliance.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the true, ruthless killing intent was only now being revealed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The torrential sword flood and the viscous breeze were all cleaved apart.</p><p></p><p>The blade light was already slashing towards Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Even though the power of this strike had been diminished, Xu Yan's sword defenses had all been shattered.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists widened their eyes, a thought flashing through their minds: Xu Yan is in peril! The legendary Xu Yan was about to die under this blade!</p><p></p><p>Many sighed inwardly, thinking that challenging the supreme sects, no matter how monstrous one was, would ultimately lead to certain death.</p><p></p><p>This final killing intent was clearly the true trump card, the remnant divine spirit of Wu Yuan, seizing the opportunity to unleash the Frigid Severance Blade's true killing technique.</p><p></p><p>This strike bore the shadow of an extremely powerful expert. Evidently, it was a powerful expert from the Thousand Martial Hall who had empowered Wu Yuan's final strike, leaving behind this core attack.</p><p></p><p>Although the method was somewhat despicable, the effect was undoubtedly astonishing.</p><p></p><p>No one had expected that Wu Yuan's strike still had this hidden killing move.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that Xu Yan had not anticipated it either.</p><p></p><p>Now, with the torrential sword flood broken and his sword defenses shattered, he was in a vulnerable state. Hastily trying to defend against this blade, he would clearly not have enough time.</p><p></p><p>And even if he miraculously survived, he would undoubtedly sustain heavy injuries, perhaps even damaging his foundations.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had not expected Wu Yuan's strike to conceal such a deadly move. The crisis had suddenly descended upon him!</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan was unafraid. He was no longer a naive newcomer to the martial arts world. Even if he had not faced life-and-death crises before, he had ways to deal with the sudden danger.</p><p></p><p>The torrential sword flood and all his sword defenses had been shattered, and the strike was already upon him.</p><p></p><p>Activating his divine element, like a surging river, Xu Yan suddenly struck out with a palm.</p><p></p><p>Towards that blade!</p><p></p><p>He was not only unparalleled in the Sword Dao, but his Descending Dragon Palm was also unmatched in the world! Roar! Just as everyone thought that Xu Yan would either die or sustain grave injuries that would damage his foundations, and as the Thousand Martial Hall's master and others wore cold smiles, a dragon's roar resounded through the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Before the shocked gazes of the crowd, Xu Yan struck out with his palm, and a massive golden dragon erupted forth!</p><p></p><p>The dragon's might shook the heavens, the epitome of yang and vigor!</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon?!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Someone was shocked to the point of almost crying out, as a golden dragon roared and burst forth, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the legendary golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the overwhelming pressure it exuded seemed to make all living beings tremble, akin to the awe-inspiring might of the true dragon in legends. The true dragon form of the sixth layer of the Descending Dragon Palm was almost like a real dragon!</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon let out a thunderous dragon roar that shook heaven and earth, rushing towards the Cold Severance Saber. It opened its massive jaws and swallowed the powerful strike, then plunged upwards into the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Boom! </p><p></p><p>The clouds exploded, the golden giant dragon shattering, but it had completely blocked that attack.</p><p></p><p>The Cold Severance Saber remained in Wu Yuan's withered hand. His lifeless body had long lost all vitality, but as soon as the sword was drawn, it charged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it no longer posed any threat.</p><p></p><p>The frigid aura of the Cold Severance Saber had dimmed, with only a faint blue glow still emanating from the blade.</p><p></p><p>Without waiting for the Thousand Martial Hall to react, Xu Yan struck out with a palm, summoning another golden giant dragon that swiftly engulfed the Cold Severance Saber.</p><p></p><p>Wu Yuan's corpse instantly disintegrated into ashes.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Thousand Martial Hall no longer has any geniuses to challenge me, I shall take my leave. We shall meet again at the final battle of the Genius Showdown. I hope the despicable Thousand Martial Hall will not disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a carefree laugh.</p><p></p><p>The blockade of the Thousand Martial Hall had come to an end. From Wu Yuan's final words, Xu Yan knew the Thousand Martial Hall would not send any more geniuses to fight him.</p><p></p><p>Whether Wu Yuan's words were true or not, the Thousand Martial Hall clearly did not wish to continue engaging him.</p><p></p><p>Since that was the case, it was best to seize the opportunity and leave.</p><p></p><p>The Cold Severance Saber, a divine artifact, would now be his war trophy.</p><p></p><p>"This saber shall be my war trophy. I take my leave!"</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon swallowed the Cold Severance Saber, and with a wave of Xu Yan's hand, the dragon coiled around him. In an instant, they vanished from the scene.</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!" </p><p></p><p>A furious roar echoed from the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder was enraged. How dare Xu Yan brazenly seize the Thousand Martial Hall's divine artifact!</p><p></p><p>Where did he get the audacity? All the martial artists were stunned, only reacting after Xu Yan had taken the Cold Severance Saber and left. </p><p></p><p>That was the Thousand Martial Hall's divine artifact! To openly seize it right at the Thousand Martial Hall's gates, where did Xu Yan find the courage? Were today's young people this bold?</p><p></p><p>No, it was just Xu Yan who was this audacious! He was the first to steal a divine artifact from the Transcendent Spirit Sect, and he had done it right at the Thousand Martial Hall's gates. Didn't he fear the Thousand Martial Hall's strongest experts would hunt him down?</p><p></p><p>"This, this, this... is unbelievable!" </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu wiped the sweat from her brow, staring in shock.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>A voice filled with murderous intent came from the Thousand Martial Hall gates, and a figure instantly shot out, charging towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The powerful aura shook the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>It was the Saber Elder of the Thousand Martial Hall!</p><p></p><p>"Trying to bully the small, are you?" </p><p></p><p>Tian Ji roared, his massive halberd crashing down like a mountain avalanche, blocking the Saber Elder's pursuit of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder let out a furious roar, a sword flying from the Thousand Martial Hall gates into his hand. He slashed through the mountain-like halberd.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has stolen our Thousand Martial Hall's divine artifact. Tian Ji, do you wish to die alongside him?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji's heart was trembling, but he said, "The rules of the Genius Showdown dictate that the victor claims the spoils. Although the divine artifact belonged to the Thousand Martial Hall, it was in the possession of Wu Yuan. Now that Wu Yuan has been defeated, the spoils rightfully belong to Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense!" </p><p></p><p>Another furious roar came.</p><p></p><p>An even more powerful aura surged from the Thousand Martial Hall gates - the Thousand Martial Hall Master! Immediately, one powerful aura after another rose up.</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji's face turned green, and after unleashing his halberd strike, he turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you're too bold! I wanted to support you, but my backbone isn't strong enough. I can't hold out anymore. You're on your own now!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji frantically escaped, fearing not only for his own safety, but also that his divine artifact might be seized.</p><p></p><p>Originally, he had come to support Xu Yan, to prevent the Thousand Martial Hall from bullying the smaller factions. As a Protector of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, it was normal for him to stand up for the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan had directly stolen the Thousand Martial Hall's divine artifact right in front of everyone. Tian Ji's backbone wasn't strong enough to withstand this.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong stared blankly at the direction Xu Yan had disappeared, unable to recover for a long time.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a voice echoed in front of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"This saber is my war trophy. If the Thousand Martial Hall is not satisfied, feel free to send people to hunt me down. They will become the stepping stones for my ascent to the peak of the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the source of the voice. High in the sky, Xu Yan stood proudly, looking down on the Thousand Martial Hall with disdain.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" </p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder charged after him, but before he could reach Xu Yan, the young man had already transformed into a force and dissipated into the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this? The martial artists were all stunned into silence.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you can't escape!" </p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder roared, chasing after the direction Xu Yan had fled. He was confident that with his strength, he would catch up to Xu Yan in no time.</p><p></p><p>"You're walking straight to your doom!" </p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder sneered inwardly. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had given him a valid reason to act, and a very compelling one at that. The divine artifact could not be stored in a spatial ring, so Xu Yan's tracks could not be hidden. He would be unable to escape the Thousand Martial Hall's pursuit.</p><p></p><p>And those elderly grandmasters of the Thousand Martial Hall had already quietly disappeared, chasing after Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever provides information on Xu Yan's whereabouts will be greatly rewarded!" </p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>He did not specify the reward, but a single word from the Transcendent Spirit Sect would hold immense weight, and countless powers and martial artists would go mad trying to obtain it. And this was just for providing information on his whereabouts. </p><p></p><p>If they could actually capture him... the reward would be unimaginable! Of course, the martial artists present knew that unless they were at the pinnacle of strength, attempting to defeat Xu Yan would be akin to seeking their own death.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's power had already surpassed that of the peak Refining Spirit Celestial Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Even if ten or eight of them attacked together, they would only end up being killed.</p><p></p><p>"Is there still a genius in the Spiritual Realm who can match Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>This thought flashed through the minds of many martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, unrivaled by any except the strongest, where could they find a genius to contend with him?</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, unbelievable! We've witnessed history!" </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu excitedly rushed into the palace.</p><p></p><p>This trip was not in vain, it was too thrilling! Xu Yan was too bold! Throughout history, Xu Yan was undoubtedly the most courageous of all scattered cultivators!</p><p></p><p>She soared into the sky, chasing after the direction Xu Yan had fled.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong's brow furrowed. She also followed, knowing Xu Yan couldn't have gone far. Once the Saber Elder caught up to him, he would surely die, unless Xu Yan had some hidden trump card, which was highly unlikely.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

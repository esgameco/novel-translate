        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited. Xu Yan's ability to accumulate sufficient foundation and break through the Divine Element Realm was related to his undefeatable path.</p><p></p><p>"This time Xu Yan breaks through, barring any accidents, he should transform into a Divine Body, right?"</p><p></p><p>When he broke through the Divine Will Realm, Xu Yan had a Divine Bone Spiritual Body. Now that he has broken through the Divine Element Realm, he should transform into a Divine Body without any accidents. In this way, the Divine Bone and Divine Body will be perfectly integrated, further enhancing his natural talent and strength, far surpassing those at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has transformed into a Divine Mountain and River Body, and you have obtained the Primordial Divine Mountain and River Body."</p><p></p><p>The moment he obtained the Primordial Divine Mountain and River Body, Li Xuan's strength increased again. His body seemed to contain the essence of mountains and rivers, and his Martial Dao principles were akin to the laws of mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>"The feeling of increased strength is really great."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has mastered the Sixth Layer of the Descending Dragon Palm (True Dragon Form Intent), and your Descending Dragon Palm has reached the Sixth Layer Perfection!"</p><p></p><p>The Descending Dragon Palm has also broken through.</p><p></p><p>The Sixth Layer of the Descending Dragon Palm is the True Dragon Form Intent. When striking with a palm, it is as if commanding a true dragon, the dragon-shaped palm force is almost indistinguishable from a real dragon.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he is my Martial Dao pioneer."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan exclaimed with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has broken through the Divine Element Realm, and the Martial Dao techniques of the Divine Appearance Realm, I estimate it won't be long before he can comprehend them, right?"</p><p></p><p>He was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Comprehending the Martial Dao techniques of the Divine Appearance Realm is relatively easier. Li Xuan had confidence in Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Martial Dao techniques of the Void Realm would be much more difficult.</p><p></p><p>Probably, Xu Yan would need to further enhance his Martial Dao comprehension after reaching the Divine Spiritual Realm before he could comprehend the Martial Dao techniques of the Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>This breakthrough of Xu Yan has greatly boosted his strength. Peak Refine Spirit Realm cultivators can no longer pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>Even experts like Huang Liang, who have refined the Spiritual Mechanisms of Heaven and Earth, may not be able to defeat Xu Yan, let alone pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>This is the confidence of breaking through the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's current strength, unless they are Spiritual Body Refine Spirit Celestials, they are not his match."</p><p></p><p>Of course, even Spiritual Body Celestials would need to be at the peak of the Refine Spirit Realm to contend with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan is far superior to the Spiritual Body geniuses of the Spirit Realm in both Martial Dao and foundation.</p><p></p><p>"He has broken through the Divine Element Realm, the undefeatable path should be nearing its end. I wonder how Xu Yan will proceed next?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became curious.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the vast Spirit Realm of Eighteen States provides ample space for Xu Yan to roam. Traveling the four corners of the world and mastering the Martial Dao will also aid his Martial Dao comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"The competition among the Spirit Realm geniuses has already lost any suspense, Xu Yan will be the supreme one."</p><p></p><p>The Genius Competition lasts for ten years, and when the final battle of the geniuses arrives, barring any accidents, Xu Yan should have already reached the Divine Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he has not reached the Divine Spiritual Realm, he will certainly be at the peak of the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the Spirit Realm geniuses, even the strongest of the Transcendent Spirit Sect cannot be Xu Yan's opponents.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has broken through to the peak of the Divine Will Realm, and your Pill Dao Martial Dao has reached the Divine Element Realm Perfection."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu has broken through to the peak of the Divine Will Realm. Next, she also needs to accumulate a foundation to prepare for the breakthrough to the Divine Element Realm, but it will be much more convenient for her.</p><p></p><p>By healing the injured, especially the strong ones, she can gain Pill Dao experience, obtain divine-grade spirit herbs, refine them into pills, and with enough high-grade pills, she can quickly accumulate a sufficient foundation.</p><p></p><p>As a Pill Dao cultivator, the Pill Dao is the fastest way for her to accumulate a foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother is too fierce!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was full of awe.</p><p></p><p>News about Xu Yan has already spread.</p><p></p><p>He directly went to the Thousand Martial State, besieged the gate of the Thousand Martial Palace, killed Thousand Martial Palace cultivators, and even defeated five geniuses single-handedly, shaking the entire Thousand Martial State.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, the Thousand Martial Palace actually abided by the rules so strictly?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>In the Transcendent Spirit Sect, the Thousand Martial Palace was the most shameless, this was a common consensus.</p><p></p><p>Yet, when someone besieged their gate and challenged them, they actually just accepted it without violating the rules of the Genius Competition, and the strong ones did not come out to intervene? This was not in line with the Thousand Martial Palace's style at all.</p><p></p><p>"There must be some reason related to the start of the Genius Competition."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace must have some reservations, which is why they did not send their strong ones to intervene.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother is also fierce, single-handedly sweeping through the geniuses of Great Proclamation City, making the Spirit Sect pale-faced."</p><p></p><p>News of Meng Chong's exploits also arrived.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was burning with passion, wishing he could immediately go to the Grand Alliance and lead the alliance's geniuses to challenge the Spirit Sect's geniuses, shaking the entire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Among the four siblings, he was the only one whose fame was not prominent enough. Although he had made a name for himself in the Jade State, the Jade State was ultimately too weak, no matter how famous he became or how skilled he was, the true geniuses would not take him seriously.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Jade State Spirit Sect was too weak.</p><p></p><p>To truly shake the Spirit Realm, he still needed to rely on his powerful strength to defeat one Spirit Sect genius after another.</p><p></p><p>The Esoteric Martial Dao should also be the time to display its might.</p><p></p><p>Sister Su Ling Xiu may seem low-key and not famous, but it is clear that the title of Pill Dao Immortal Lady will soon spread throughout the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I must quickly refine a flying ship!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He began to refine the flying ship again. The design of the flying ship has been finalized, and he can start the refining process now.</p><p></p><p>After all, this is the first time he is refining such a complex and miraculous flying ship. The process is extremely complicated, and each component must be handled with the utmost care, as the precious materials are limited and cannot be wasted.</p><p></p><p>In addition to refining a flying ship for his master, he also needs to refine one for his own use.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>At the gate of the Thousand Martial Palace in the Thousand Martial State, there were many cultivators lingering, waiting for Xu Yan's return.</p><p></p><p>They also wanted to see whether the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Palace would be forced out.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan was pondering whether to leave the Thousand Martial State or continue waiting for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After all, without his deterrence, the shameless ones of the Thousand Martial Palace might personally come out and bully with their superior strength.</p><p></p><p>But he was also burning with curiosity to meet Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>An existence transcending heaven and earth? This was something he did not even dare to imagine.</p><p></p><p>"If what Xu Yan said is true, as such a terrifying existence's disciple, how could he be threatened by the Thousand Martial Palace? I need not worry about him."</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a while, Wu Tian Nan could not resist the curiosity in his heart, so he turned and left for the Grand Alliance's headquarters, to find the Jade State Alliance Master and personally inquire about the possibility of visiting Xu Yan's master.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Thousand Martial Palace, more than a dozen geniuses were sitting cross-legged. They were from the major sects of the Thousand Martial State, and the weakest of them had already reached the mid-stage of the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>The strongest one had even reached the peak of the Refine Spirit Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, their realms were somewhat unstable, but their strength had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>This was all the preparation the Thousand Martial Palace had made for Xu Yan's challenge.</p><p></p><p>"This Burning Soul Killing Intent, which gathers your spiritual souls, life force, and everything, is the true killing technique, and also the essential killing technique for the Thousand Martial Palace's geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"This is the technique of mutual destruction. Once activated, you won't live long either.</p><p></p><p>"But in a situation where you are outmatched, having the strength to achieve mutual destruction is also a source of confidence. At least you know the enemy will also die."</p><p></p><p>Four elders were seated in the four directions, and streams of spiritual energy converged and flowed into the more than a dozen geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt you provided:</p><p></p><p>In the body of the Heavenly Prodigy, they helped them condense the Burning Life-Threatening Technique.</p><p></p><p>Without the assistance of the Supremely Strong, these Heavenly Prodigies would not be able to condense the Burning Life-Threatening Technique.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity to make contributions for my Thousand Martial Hall is about to arrive. You all are now disciples of the Thousand Martial Hall, and also the Heavenly Prodigies of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Once you encounter danger, do not hesitate, immediately unleash the Burning Life-Threatening Technique!" The Thousand Martial Hall warriors must have this courage and decisiveness, do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>The group of Heavenly Prodigies had solemn expressions, but their eyes were resolute. This was an opportunity to become a disciple of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect. Even if they died, the families and forces behind them would still gain tremendous benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Prodigies responded firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!"</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Thousand Martial Hall revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>In a secret chamber of the Thousand Martial Hall, five youths were sitting cross-legged, each possessing the peak Refining Spirit Celestial realm. </p><p></p><p>These five were the publicly acknowledged Heavenly Prodigies of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, with the assistance of the elders, they were also condensing the Burning Life-Threatening Technique.</p><p></p><p>Compared to the Heavenly Prodigies of the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families, the Heavenly Prodigies personally cultivated by the Thousand Martial Hall were naturally stronger. Even if they relied on special methods to temporarily reach the peak Refining Spirit Celestial realm, their cultivation appeared a bit unstable, but their strength was still far beyond ordinary peak Refining Spirit Celestial realm warriors.</p><p></p><p>"Your Burning Life-Threatening Technique is extraordinary. When the critical moment comes, you must decisively unleash it. As Heavenly Prodigies of the Thousand Martial Hall, you absolutely cannot retreat or be cowardly!"</p><p></p><p>An elder said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, rest assured. Even if we cannot defeat Xu Yan, even if we die, we will absolutely not let Xu Yan off easy!" </p><p></p><p>Several Thousand Martial Hall disciples said in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!"</p><p></p><p>The elder revealed a satisfied smile.</p><p></p><p>In another secret place of the Thousand Martial Hall, the Thousand Martial Hall Master strode in.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the youth sitting cross-legged with a long saber across his lap, the Thousand Martial Hall Master asked the saber-wielding elder.</p><p></p><p>"It has been successful. We can now wield the power of the Frigid Absolute Saber."</p><p></p><p>The saber-wielding elder said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The Frigid Absolute Saber was one of the divine artifacts of the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is it really necessary to use the divine artifact? And to activate it with the Burning Life-Threatening Technique?"</p><p></p><p>The saber-wielding elder was somewhat disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>Even if Xu Yan was strong, could he really force the Thousand Martial Hall to use such methods? To even mobilize a divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>And to avoid the influence of Xu Yan's sword dao, they deliberately chose the Frigid Absolute Saber divine artifact, but to activate the divine artifact, merely being at the peak Refining Spirit Celestial realm was not enough to fully unleash the divine artifact's power.</p><p></p><p>For this reason, he infused a wisp of refined Heavenly Earth Spiritual Mechanism into the Frigid Absolute Saber, then had the disciples merge their spiritual souls, and used the Burning Life-Threatening Technique as the catalyst to explosively unleash the power of the Frigid Absolute Saber.</p><p></p><p>Such methods would be enough to slay even a Supremely Strong who had refined a wisp of Heavenly Earth Spiritual Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Yet they were using it against Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Even Xu Yan, no matter how strong, was far from enough to contend against a Supremely Strong who had refined a wisp of Heavenly Earth Spiritual Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>When it came to using all these methods, it meant that these publicly acknowledged Heavenly Prodigies were doomed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the deaths of these public Heavenly Prodigies would not deal a heavy blow to the Thousand Martial Hall, after all, the existence of the Thousand Martial Hall was to cultivate core Heavenly Prodigies.</p><p></p><p>It was just that the tenure of this group of elders in charge of the Thousand Martial Hall would be extended a bit longer, waiting for suitable successors to be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"Better to be prepared!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan, has it really come to this step? If he ascends the Divine Bridge, wouldn't that mean..."</p><p></p><p>The saber-wielding elder said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall had the greatest enmity with Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>"He will not have the chance!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master said expressionlessly.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go see those senior predecessors."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is it really necessary to have those senior predecessors do this?"</p><p></p><p>The saber-wielding elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't necessarily have to be aimed at Xu Yan, it can also be aimed at the Myriad World Alliance. They are old, their lifespans are not much left, they don't have the chance to ascend the Divine Bridge. For the sake of their descendants, they will fight one last time.</p><p></p><p>"This has become a common practice in the Thousand Martial Hall."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master said as he left.</p><p></p><p>The saber-wielding elder fell silent. Among those senior predecessors, one of them was the one who brought him into the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is the best ending for them."</p><p></p><p>The saber-wielding elder sighed.</p><p></p><p>Without the qualifications to ascend the Divine Bridge, in the end their lifespans would be exhausted, and they could only choose to gamble one last time before death, to strive for better treatment for their descendants.</p><p></p><p>"Senior predecessors, are you all prepared?"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master looked at the white-haired, aged elders and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Master, rest assured, we are ready."</p><p></p><p>An elder with a face full of wrinkles smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>"Then good, just await the order."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master nodded.</p><p></p><p>These senior predecessors were old members of the Thousand Martial Hall, and they were once considered Heavenly Prodigies. After all, to become a disciple of the Thousand Martial Hall, one must have the reputation of a Heavenly Prodigy.</p><p></p><p>They either encountered some accidents and could no longer continue advancing in their cultivation, or their innate talents were limited and they could no longer progress in the Dao of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>However, after cultivating for so many years, and refining the Burning Life-Threatening Technique over a long period of time, their strength was far beyond what it seemed on the surface.</p><p></p><p>When they reached the end of their martial path and could no longer continue forward, they began to cultivate the secret techniques of the Thousand Martial Hall, preparing for the current task.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall has always had such a group of people.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the past, when they contended with the Myriad Star Martial Institute, or when they crushed the Blood Demon Sect's Blood God Sect, it was done in this manner.</p><p></p><p>The profound foundations and hidden methods of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect were far more complex than they appeared on the surface.</p><p></p><p>Not only the Thousand Martial Hall, but the other Transcendent Spiritual Sects were the same.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan, Myriad World Alliance, how will you two contend?"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master coldly chuckled in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Little Xu Yan, you have a bit of talent, and have become arrogant. Do you really think the Heavenly Prodigies of the Spiritual Realm are supreme? The Spiritual Realm has seen monstrous prodigies throughout history, which of them could shake the Spiritual Sects? How many monsters who opposed the Spiritual Sects have turned to dust, like the Blood Demon Sect. You, Xu Yan, will be no exception!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master's eyes flashed with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>The half-month period was about to arrive, he wanted to see how Xu Yan could still be arrogant!</p><p></p><p>Outside the gates of the Thousand Martial Hall, more and more warriors gathered, including some who had come from distant states specifically.</p><p></p><p>They all wanted to witness the rise of a monstrous prodigy, and also witness the downfall of a monstrous prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Blocking the Thousand Martial Hall gates, setting up an arena, the first in the history of the Spiritual Realm!</p><p></p><p>In the crowd, a huge eagle landed on a large tree, and on its back was a small palace. Cui Huayu, dressed in colorful feathered robes, poked his head out from the palace.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, what a bold person!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu exclaimed in amazement. As one of the true inheritors of the御灵府, he was also a renowned Heavenly Prodigy. Ever since he witnessed the battle between Xu Yan and Lu Xinting, he had been greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>It had only been a short while, yet Xu Yan had become the first to block the gates of a Transcendent Spiritual Sect, setting up an arena.</p><p></p><p>One had no choice but to admire him!

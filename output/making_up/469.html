        <h1>Chapter 469</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>If the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder had concealed this information and tried to deflect blame, Xu Yan's favorable impression of the Sea Spirit Clan would have completely vanished. However, since the Grand Elder had frankly explained the risks involved, Xu Yan didn't mind this hot potato.</p><p></p><p>For the Sea Spirit Clan, these two garments would bring danger, but for Xu Yan, it was no big deal. </p><p></p><p>He didn't care who coveted them or how powerful they were.</p><p></p><p>Since he liked them and could give them as gifts, why not accept?</p><p></p><p>"For me, it's not troublesome. I'll take them," Xu Yan said, putting away the jade box.</p><p></p><p>"I should warn you, young friend, that those who covet these items may now be at the Divine Venerable realm," the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Venerable realm? No problem!" Xu Yan smiled, unconcerned.</p><p></p><p>"If you have such confidence, this old man can rest easy," the Grand Elder said with relief.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued browsing the treasury, looking for treasures that caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>After picking and choosing, accepting some treasures, Xu Yan calculated that he had selected gifts for everyone he wanted to give to. There weren't any other items that particularly moved him, so he was preparing to leave.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder spoke up: "Young friend, why not take a look at those ancient artifacts? They're said to be from extremely ancient times."</p><p></p><p>"What's special about these ancient artifacts?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I can't really say!" The Grand Elder shook his head and led Xu Yan to a corner of the treasury. He tapped rhythmically on the wall, and an entrance suddenly appeared on the floor of the corner.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, follow me!" The Grand Elder entered the underground passage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. This underground treasure room was quite hidden - ordinary powerful cultivators probably couldn't discover it.</p><p></p><p>Following the Grand Elder, he entered the underground passage and arrived in a treasure room only a few zhang in size.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered, he sensed an aura of antiquity.</p><p></p><p>He even perceived a feeling of time's accumulation.</p><p></p><p>There weren't many ancient artifacts in the treasure room.</p><p></p><p>There were only about a dozen or so, with the most eye-catching being a shimmering, azure blue pearl.</p><p></p><p>Apart from that, the other objects all looked very old, but had a sense of time's accumulation.</p><p></p><p>In the entire secret treasure room, the most attention-grabbing item was undoubtedly this azure blue pearl. However, Xu Yan's gaze wasn't on the pearl, but on another object.</p><p></p><p>It was a stone jar, but not an ordinary one. The mottled, aged body of the jar seemed unremarkable except for the sense of time's accumulation.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan saw that the stone jar was circulating a faint rhythm, sealing the contents inside so they wouldn't decay with the passage of time.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was stunned. He had thought Xu Yan would first examine the azure blue pearl, as it looked the most extraordinary among these ancient artifacts.</p><p></p><p>He never expected that the first thing to catch Xu Yan's attention would be a stone jar.</p><p></p><p>"This stone jar is somewhat special. I've tried to open it to investigate what's inside, but I've never been able to. Even with my strength, I can't damage this stone jar..." the Grand Elder explained.</p><p></p><p>"What's the background of this stone jar?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"It's said to have been treasured by our clan's ancient emperor, but the specifics are unknown. However, in some of our clan's ancient texts, there are a few sentences saying this stone jar was bestowed upon our ancient emperor by some great figure..." the Grand Elder recalled.</p><p></p><p>He then added: "Given that our clan was once a true spirit of the True Dragon lineage, we speculate it might be related to True Dragons."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up the stone jar and said, "I'll take this."</p><p></p><p>"That's great if young master Xu likes it!" the Grand Elder said happily.</p><p></p><p>He had been worried Xu Yan wouldn't like anything. As long as Xu Yan liked and accepted treasures from the Sea Spirit Clan, it would create some connection and goodwill between them.</p><p></p><p>If the Sea Spirit Clan truly faced a great calamity in the future, remembering this connection, Xu Yan might lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put away the stone jar. Although he couldn't fully see what was inside, he had some guesses. It would be perfect to give to his master.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan looked at the azure blue pearl.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder introduced it: "This item is called the Vast Sea Pearl. It's said to have been left behind by our clan's ancient emperor. I don't know exactly what it does, but it must surely hide some profound mysteries."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan's heart stirred. Vast Sea Pearl? That giant turtle was called the Vast Sea Turtle. Could this pearl and the Vast Sea Turtle come from the same place? Vast Sea?</p><p></p><p>Was there a place in this world called the Vast Sea? But the Vast Sea Turtle was an otherworldly being, not a powerful figure from this world.</p><p></p><p>"Could the Vast Sea be outside this world?" Xu Yan wondered curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Elder, do you know if there's a place in this world called the Vast Sea?" </p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder shook his head: "I've never heard of it. The sea in this world has always been called the Azure Sea. The current Divine Realm's Azure Sea Territory and the Spirit Realm's Azure Sea are all parts of the world's vast Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>"The world changed, separating into its current state. It's said that in ancient times, the Azure Sea was boundless, far beyond comparison with the current Azure Sea Territory."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and reached out his hand. The Vast Sea Pearl fell into his palm. Since it was related to the Sea Spirit Clan's ancient emperor, he might as well take it and give it to his master.</p><p></p><p>After putting away the Vast Sea Pearl, Xu Yan continued examining the other ancient artifacts.</p><p></p><p>The rest were relatively ordinary. Although they had some marvelous aspects, Xu Yan wasn't particularly moved by them.</p><p></p><p>Ever since obtaining the Primordial Turtle Shell, his standards had been raised. Ordinary treasures no longer impressed him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, having reached his current level of strength, ordinary treasures had little effect on him.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan discovered that among these ancient artifacts was a bamboo scroll. But the bamboo used for this scroll was extraordinary, and seemed somewhat similar to the jade bamboo in his possession.</p><p></p><p>It seemed to be of the same type, with the only difference being that the jade bamboo used for this scroll was of a much higher grade than the one he had.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder thought for a moment and said, "According to fragments left by our clan's former powerful members, this bamboo scroll records some strange tales and events, or perhaps some secrets. However, it doesn't mention any cultivation methods or secret techniques."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan picked up the bamboo scroll. Under his Minor Heavenly Dao Eye, he saw a layer of hazy light obscuring the scroll's contents. However, he could vaguely make out some text.</p><p></p><p>"The person who wrote this scroll must have been extremely powerful. Even with my current strength and the Minor Heavenly Dao Eye, I can't fully penetrate the scroll's contents," Xu Yan marveled.</p><p></p><p>"This bamboo scroll seems to have a blocking force. After our clan's strongest cultivators perished, no one has been able to see its contents.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, this bamboo scroll itself is a supreme treasure. It's said to be made from slips of an extraordinary jade bamboo. Legend has it that the hollow parts of this jade bamboo are like miniature worlds."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder continued explaining.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. He could almost confirm that the bamboo used for the scroll was of the same type as the jade bamboo in his possession.</p><p></p><p>"This would be perfect to give to Master. He can read the strange tales inside to pass the time," Xu Yan thought to himself as he put away the jade scroll.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll take these three items then," Xu Yan said with a smile after accepting the bamboo scrolls.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, don't you want to look at the rest?" The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was taken aback. He had been prepared for Xu Yan to sweep away all the ancient artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"No need!" Xu Yan turned and walked towards the exit. "Today I've taken three ancient artifacts from your Sea Spirit Clan. In the future, within my capabilities, I can assist your clan three times!"</p><p></p><p>"Many thanks, Young Master Xu!" The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder bowed gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, your Sea Spirit Clan still has a backer," Xu Yan said with a smile. </p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er was from the Sea Spirit Clan and possessed the bloodline of the Sea Spirit Emperor. Now that she was by his master's side, how could she not help if the Sea Spirit Clan was in trouble? As his master's maid, anyone who wanted to target her would have to consider whether they could withstand a slap from his master.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" The Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder was overjoyed, thinking Xu Yan meant himself as the backer.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Sea Spirit Palace, the Grand Elder personally escorted Xu Yan back to Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Cloud Sky Island was already in an uproar. News of the True Dragon calamity had reached the island.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at his father in shock, "Father, a True Dragon! There's actually a True Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"The legendary True Dragon has appeared in the Divine Realm. This isn't good news for the Azure Sea Realm!" Xie Tianxing sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm's vast sea, only the Azure Sea Realm existed. The True Dragon would eventually descend upon the Azure Sea Realm to rule over the seas.</p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that the True Dragon causing havoc seemed to have lost its reason, becoming extremely agitated and slaughtering cultivators above the Immortal Venerable realm indiscriminately. </p><p></p><p>Many cultivators below the Refining Truth realm had also died or been injured as collateral damage!</p><p></p><p>The True Dragon's strength would surely sweep across the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu is about to leave the Azure Sea Realm," Xie Lingfeng sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Xie Tianxing was stunned, then realized, "That's right, with Xu Yan's prodigious talent, how could he not go observe the True Dragon? After all, it's a legendary being."</p><p></p><p>He continued with a look of regret, "If only I wasn't so weak, I would also be unable to resist going to observe. After all, it's a True Dragon!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng smiled bitterly, "Brother Xu isn't going just to observe."</p><p></p><p>He knew that Xu Yan had a Dragon Subduing Palm technique. With a name like Dragon Subduing, it must have been created to subdue dragons. Now that a True Dragon had appeared and was wreaking havoc, how could Xu Yan resist taking action?</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xie Tianxing nodded, "That's right, with Xu Yan's strength, he would certainly want to spar with the True Dragon. Even if he can't defeat it, with the elder's jade talisman, he won't be in danger."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng chuckled. Xu Yan wasn't going to spar, but to subdue the dragon!</p><p></p><p>News of the True Dragon's appearance caused an uproar on Cloud Sky Island. Many people looked worried, knowing the True Dragon would eventually descend upon the Azure Sea Realm.</p><p></p><p>The powerful members of the Sea Spirit Clan also had solemn expressions.</p><p></p><p>In the past, they were true spirits of the dragon lineage, tasked with patrolling the great seas. However, times had changed, and the Sea Spirit Clan had weakened considerably, no longer as glorious as before.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they were now the overlords of the Azure Sea and didn't want to suddenly have a new master, becoming mere attendants.</p><p></p><p>Besides, this True Dragon had lost its reason and become agitated.</p><p></p><p>"This matter is beyond our ability to resolve. We can only hope the Supreme Harmony Realm has countermeasures," the Cloud Sky Island Lord said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"The only countermeasure is likely opening the Heavenly Stairway," the Sea Spirit Clan's Second Elder said worriedly. </p><p></p><p>If the Heavenly Stairway opened, would those who had coveted the Sea Spirit Clan's treasures take this opportunity to descend upon the Divine Realm?</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sky Island Lord fell silent. The opening of the Dao Realm Heavenly Stairway was naturally a good thing for major forces with backgrounds, but not necessarily for those without much backing.</p><p></p><p>They might not even have the chance to ascend the Heavenly Stairway and break through their cultivation bottlenecks.</p><p></p><p>There were many restrictions and secrets involved.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to Cloud Sky Island with the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder. Upon hearing about the True Dragon, the Grand Elder's face became extremely solemn, and he hurried to Cloud Sky Island's main hall.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, I've come to say goodbye," Xu Yan said with a smile as he returned to Xie Lingfeng's residence.</p><p></p><p>"I expected as much," Xie Lingfeng smiled.</p><p></p><p>"When we meet again, I will surely be at the Void Breaking realm!" Xie Lingfeng said confidently.</p><p></p><p>"With Brother Xie's talent, breaking through to Void Breaking won't take long," Xu Yan nodded. Xie Lingfeng's talent was not bad, and under his guidance, he had already grasped the key to breaking through to the Void Breaking realm. </p><p></p><p>With the pills Xu Yan had left behind, Xie Lingfeng's cultivation speed would certainly not be slow. Moreover, because of his connection to Xu Yan, he would be able to obtain more cultivation resources on Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>"Does Brother Xu have confidence?" Xie Lingfeng asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Subduing a dragon! Throughout history, it had never been heard of. Xu Yan was likely the first.</p><p></p><p>Of course, what happened in more ancient times couldn't be verified, but at least in recorded history, there had never been mention of subduing a dragon.</p><p></p><p>"From the information available, this is a young dragon. Its strength isn't too formidable. Although it can easily crush Immortal Venerables, my Dragon Subduing Palm was created to subdue dragons after all, so I should have some confidence," Xu Yan said after pondering.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianxing and Fu Yun beside them were already dumbstruck.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was going to subdue a dragon?</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll wait on Cloud Sky Island for news of Brother Xu subduing the dragon!" Xie Lingfeng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Xu Yan nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Then, Xu Yan went to bid farewell to the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder and the Cloud Sky Island Lord.</p><p></p><p>"Young Friend Xu, you're leaving the Azure Sea Realm already?" The Cloud Sky Island Lord and others looked reluctant to part.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan here, the entire Azure Sea Realm felt like it had a pillar of support. Now that Xu Yan was leaving, they suddenly felt uneasy.</p><p></p><p>"I have urgent matters to attend to, so I must take my leave for now," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"What urgent matters does Young Friend Xu have? My Cloud Sky Island is willing to offer what little help we can to repay Young Friend for saving us," the Cloud Sky Island Lord said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>"You can't help with this matter," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>"Although we know our strength is weak, we are still considered powerful in the Divine Realm. We can surely do something within our capabilities for Young Friend. Please don't hesitate to tell us!"</p><p></p><p>"I appreciate everyone's kindness, but you really can't help with this matter."</p><p></p><p>"Although Immortal Venerables may seem weak to Young Friend, they are not to be underestimated in the Divine Realm. With so many Immortal Venerables, even major realms wouldn't dare look down on us. There are only two or three cultivators as strong as Young Friend in the entire Divine Realm. How could we not be able to help? Young Friend needn't be polite. We will do our utmost to assist. Even if we can only cheer you on, we can boost your morale!"</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sky Island Lord said solemnly. The other Azure Sea Realm powerhouses nodded, saying that even if they could only cheer, so many Immortal Venerables could still boost Xu Yan's momentum!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan cupped his hands and said, "I appreciate everyone's kindness, but my purpose in leaving is to subdue a dragon!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

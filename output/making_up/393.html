        <h1>Chapter 393</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Besides setting up the formation, with a thought, Xu Yan spread the sword intent of mountains and rivers around, as if transforming into an invisible landscape that enveloped the cave.</p><p></p><p>After everything was ready, Xu Yan began preparing to comprehend the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way.</p><p></p><p>"The Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way is the foundation of the Eye of the Heavenly Way, and is extraordinarily marvelous. Once comprehended and successfully cultivated, it will surely lead to an increase in strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>He could imagine that after comprehending the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way, when he broke through to the Divine Phase realm and underwent another transformation, it would definitely strengthen his foundation.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only a little bit away from fully comprehending the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way. I hope the Blood Heart Fruit truly has such miraculous effects and can help me comprehend that final bit, shortening the time needed for comprehension."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a Blood Heart Fruit, feeling hopeful.</p><p></p><p>It had been such a long time since Li Xuan passed on the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way to him. Even back in the Green Transformation realm, Xu Yan had been working on comprehending it. He was just one step away from fully grasping it.</p><p></p><p>For this final step, Xu Yan was hoping the Blood Heart Fruit could provide assistance to quickly comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>He consumed one Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt a gentle energy flowing through his body, then appearing in his primordial spirit, nourishing it. Even his spirit platform emitted a misty radiance because of this.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind became tranquil, as if entering a state similar to sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also began comprehending the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The final bit that he previously didn't understand suddenly became clear. In an instant, he thoroughly grasped how to cultivate the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way, what mysteries it held, and what kind of power it possessed. All of this surfaced in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited. He had finally fully comprehended the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way. The effect of the Blood Heart Fruit in assisting with comprehending techniques was truly marvelous beyond compare. No wonder Wan Tianlin was so obsessed with obtaining Blood Heart Fruits.</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the Eye of the Minor Heavenly Way, Xu Yan began to comprehend the Heaven and Earth realm technique.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, even with the assistance of the Blood Heart Fruit, with his mind focused and spirit platform radiating a misty light, it was still difficult to comprehend the Heaven and Earth realm technique. He still felt the profound mysteriousness of this realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immersed himself in comprehension until the misty radiance no longer emanated from his spirit platform and the effects of the Blood Heart Fruit disappeared. Only then did Xu Yan come back to his senses from his state of comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"There was some gain, but I'm still far from fully comprehending the Heaven and Earth realm. It's because I lack experience, and my understanding of martial arts and the heaven and earth is too limited."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt regretful.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth realm technique was too profound and mysterious. Even with the assistance of the Blood Heart Fruit, entering a state of deep comprehension similar to sudden enlightenment, he still couldn't understand much of it.</p><p></p><p>But it wasn't without progress. At least Xu Yan had gained some direction and clues for comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if eating another Blood Heart Fruit would still be effective."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out another Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>In the Snake Peak Heavenly Cave, he had collected quite a few Blood Heart Fruits, enough for him to splurge a bit.</p><p></p><p>After consuming the second Blood Heart Fruit, Xu Yan found that it was still effective, but its potency had decreased by one-third.</p><p></p><p>"I'll comprehend divine abilities then!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath. This level of effectiveness was clearly not enough for comprehending the Heaven and Earth realm technique. It was most suitable for comprehending the divine abilities in the Divine Ability Classic.</p><p></p><p>"Which divine ability should I comprehend?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered. The Divine Ability Classic contained many divine abilities, including greater and lesser ones. He wasn't very interested in the lesser divine abilities anymore.</p><p></p><p>Since he was going to comprehend one, it would naturally be a greater divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Then, he decided on which greater divine ability to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>This was a rather special divine ability called "Heavenly Will Fixes the Spirit".</p><p></p><p>This divine ability was neither an offensive nor defensive one, but rather a type that controlled others' souls and wills.</p><p></p><p>My will becomes heavenly will, fixing their souls, fixing their minds, fixing their consciousness, making those affected by this divine ability act according to one's own will.</p><p></p><p>Once someone falls victim to this divine ability, even if told to kill their beloved, they would do so without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>No matter how loyal a person is, as long as they are affected by this divine ability, they would be controlled to act according to the seemingly heavenly will. Even if they are conscious, they cannot control themselves from doing things against their own will.</p><p></p><p>"This divine ability it is."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly delighted. He thought of the clever uses of this divine ability. Since he was now in conflict with Wan Tianlin and the Wan family, these unorthodox methods could sometimes have unexpected effects.</p><p></p><p>For example, he could use this divine ability on Wan family martial artists and order them to assassinate Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>In this way, those affected by this divine ability would be conscious and inwardly resistant, but unable to disobey the seemingly heavenly will. Their souls and minds would be fixed.</p><p></p><p>"Wan Tianlin probably can't imagine that the Wan family martial artists around him, even the most loyal ones, would attack him. The entire Wan family would be thrown into chaos because of this."</p><p></p><p>He could imagine that once loyal and devoted martial artists suddenly betrayed and attacked, the Wan family would surely become very nervous and immediately start internal investigations to root out traitors.</p><p></p><p>"What if even the clan elders betrayed..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's lips curled into a smile. So it was very necessary to comprehend this Heavenly Will Fixes the Spirit divine ability.</p><p></p><p>The more special a divine ability is, the more unexpected effects it can have in certain situations.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began comprehending Heavenly Will Fixes the Spirit. As the Blood Heart Fruit's effects were consumed, his understanding of this divine ability grew more and more, and he was about to fully comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>When the Blood Heart Fruit's effects disappeared, Xu Yan felt somewhat regretful. This Blood Heart Fruit hadn't allowed him to fully comprehend Heavenly Will Fixes the Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"The higher one's comprehension ability, the stronger the enlightenment effect when consuming a Blood Heart Fruit for the first time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The effectiveness of Blood Heart Fruits in enhancing a martial artist's comprehension of techniques for a short time was related to the martial artist's innate comprehension ability.</p><p></p><p>According to Xu Yan's calculations, Blood Heart Fruits could increase a martial artist's comprehension by about 30% for a short time. This seemed to be roughly fixed.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists with higher comprehension abilities, after a 30% increase, comprehending techniques would naturally become much easier.</p><p></p><p>For martial artists with poor comprehension abilities, even with a 30% increase, they still couldn't compare to those with good comprehension abilities.</p><p></p><p>"I'll eat one last one."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and took out another Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The third Blood Heart Fruit only had 10% effectiveness, but it was better than nothing. For Xu Yan, it was enough to fully comprehend the greater divine ability Heavenly Will Fixes the Spirit.</p><p></p><p>As he consumed the third Blood Heart Fruit, Xu Yan clearly felt that its effectiveness had decreased significantly. Even the misty radiance from his spirit platform had dimmed a lot.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally understood it!"</p><p></p><p>When the Blood Heart Fruit's effects disappeared, Xu Yan opened his eyes with a bright smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Heart Fruits are truly treasures. I wonder what the effects would be if they were refined into pills. Since I've eaten Blood Heart Fruits, would pills made from them still be effective for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Besides Blood Heart Fruits, are there other heavenly and earthly treasures with similar effects? Would they still be effective for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan secretly contemplated. If there were heavenly and earthly treasures even more powerful than Blood Heart Fruits that could assist in comprehending Heaven and Earth realm martial arts techniques, wouldn't he be able to understand them quickly?</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Such treasures must be quite rare," Xu Yan sighed inwardly. He could only keep an eye out for them while traversing the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>If he came across any more such heavenly materials and earthly treasures, he would certainly find a way to obtain them.</p><p></p><p>"Now, it's time to cultivate," Xu Yan took a deep breath, his eyes excited. He had already comprehended the Minor Heavenly Eye and Divine Will Mind Control techniques, so now it was time to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>"First, cultivate the Minor Heavenly Eye."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began by cultivating the Minor Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating divine abilities cannot be accomplished overnight. Xu Yan hid in this mountain cave, with concealment arrays outside, while the cave interior was like an invisible landscape.</p><p></p><p>Even an Immortal Venerable passing by would be unable to discover his whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan cultivated his divine abilities, Mount Dagai grew increasingly lively, as if winds and clouds were stirring. The Wan family's activities increased, seemingly enraged by their inability to find any trace of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Wan family, members of the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow were also secretly investigating, even mobilizing their undercover agents in other factions.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan seemed to have vanished into thin air. Not only was the Wan family secretly perplexed, but even the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow was bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Where did he go?</p><p></p><p>From the Wan family's actions, it was clear they hadn't found Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow's next moves were temporarily halted due to Xu Yan's disappearance. Just when their plan was about to succeed and progress smoothly, an unexpected variable emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Did Xu Yan return to the Qinghua Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"Even if he returned to Qinghua, he would need to leave Mount Dagai, but we found no trace of him."</p><p></p><p>"He just came from Qinghua, why would he go back so soon? Perhaps he's already left the Mount Dagai region."</p><p></p><p>"The question is, how did he leave Mount Dagai without a trace under the Wan family's search?"</p><p></p><p>Not just the Wan family, but also their Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow members fell silent for a moment.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family also suspected Xu Yan had quietly fled Mount Dagai, so they requested assistance from neighboring major powers to search, but naturally found no information.</p><p></p><p>"He provoked our Wan family, killed our people, yet can still roam free, evading our pursuit. This is a disgrace to the Wan family."</p><p></p><p>"If we can't find him, where is our family's face?"</p><p></p><p>The Wan family elders were furious.</p><p></p><p>Wan Tianlin's face turned black with anger. He even offered another reward of blood heart fruit, risking himself to try and lure Xu Yan out.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this yielded no results.</p><p></p><p>Besides the Wan family and Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, there was a third party of martial artists also searching for traces of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>They came from Thousand Fold Mountain and the Demon Witch Skypit.</p><p></p><p>Each was a True King Venerable. Though not numerous, one True King Venerable could gather some Law Condensation Venerables as eyes and errand runners.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, this force secretly searching for Xu Yan was not small in number.</p><p></p><p>Those True King Venerables had all been bewitched, prostrating themselves under someone's skirt, becoming loyal lapdogs, their minds filled only with pleasing the beauty and fulfilling her plans.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I've succeeded in cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Oblivious to the outside world and focused solely on cultivating divine abilities, Xu Yan opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his eyes were suffused with an unfathomable meaning, as if the sun and moon rotated within them, or stars revolved around them, or some divine aura lingered.</p><p></p><p>The Minor Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>After a considerable period of cultivation, Xu Yan had finally mastered the basics of the Minor Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>"The Minor Heavenly Eye, one glance like heaven's will, able to see through everything, everything within grasp..."</p><p></p><p>Only after cultivating the Minor Heavenly Eye did Xu Yan deeply feel the power and profundity of this divine ability.</p><p></p><p>Now, in his eyes, arrays were clearly visible. He could even see through their flaws and the trajectories of their operations at a glance.</p><p></p><p>"Fourth junior brother's arrays need upgrading, they're a bit weak now," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he knew this was an array disc refined by Fang Hao, different from Fang Hao personally deploying the Heaven and Earth Wondrous Gate with layered arrays.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Wondrous Gate martial way had its own extraordinary mysteries.</p><p></p><p>"Besides these eyes, there's also..."</p><p></p><p>After cultivating the Minor Heavenly Eye, in addition to his eyes, it seemed an eye also appeared in the center of his brow.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the eye in his brow seemed to have other mysteries, possessing great power when opened.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the foundation of the Heavenly Eye?" Xu Yan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a faint light emanating vast power, like an eye, appeared between his brows.</p><p></p><p>This light, located between his brows, eye-shaped and nurturing a vast power, allowed Xu Yan to sense that the eye in his brow could unleash an incredibly powerful strike.</p><p></p><p>"My techniques have increased, my strength has grown, my foundation is more solid," Xu Yan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Next, I should cultivate Divine Will Mind Control."</p><p></p><p>With the Minor Heavenly Eye successfully cultivated, only Divine Will Mind Control remained.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan decided that after cultivating Divine Will Mind Control, he would leave this place to settle accounts with Wan Tianlin. If Wan truly wanted to resolve their grudge, he must provide sufficient compensation.</p><p></p><p>Such as gathering the heavenly materials and earthly treasures Xu Yan needed.</p><p></p><p>"Using the Minor Heavenly Eye to assist, then deploying Divine Will Mind Control, with my current strength, I should be able to make a True King Venerable act according to my will."</p><p></p><p>However, not a True King Venerable who was too powerful.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, there was a chance they could break free from the control of the Divine Will Mind Control technique.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was only at the peak of the Divine Ability realm, and controlling will was inherently the most difficult. Those who could cultivate to True King Venerable all had tenacious wills.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan estimated that with his current strength, he could only control early-stage True King Venerables.</p><p></p><p>"For now, that's enough to annoy Wan Tianlin and the Wan family, create chaos within the Wan family. That's sufficient!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath and began cultivating the Divine Will Mind Control technique.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile on Mount Dagai, the Wan family finally couldn't sit still and offered a high reward.</p><p></p><p>Anyone providing clues about Xu Yan would receive a generous reward. If Xu Yan was captured based on these clues, the informant would be allowed to join the Wan family and receive 10% more cultivation resources.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family's generous bounty immediately caused a stir on Mount Dagai. As for what crimes the wanted person had committed, the Wan family didn't mention.</p><p></p><p>This led to much discussion among Mount Dagai's martial artists, who felt it might be a family scandal, thus inappropriate to publicize widely.</p><p></p><p>Even more extreme rumors spread that the wanted person had seduced and abandoned a Wan family maiden, playing with her before running away, which was why the Wan family was taking such drastic action. These vivid rumors spread like wildfire across Mount Dagai.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

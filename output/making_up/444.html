        <h1>Chapter 444</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan proceeded cautiously, and when he appeared at the entrance of the Heavenly Cave, he did not immediately step in. Instead, he raised his hand and shot a sword into the cave, as if testing it.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Heavenly Cave, there was no movement, as if there truly was no danger.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu had already hidden herself, silently watching Xu Yan's actions. Her heart was in suspense, fearing that Xu Yan would not enter the cave.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, come in quickly. Once you enter, don't even think about escaping!" </p><p></p><p>Mei Wu laughed coldly in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Xu Yan stepped into the Heavenly Cave one step at a time, carefully exploring the surroundings, gradually approaching the pool.</p><p></p><p>"When he discovers Dian Wu and moves to defend himself, and when Dian Wu uses his evil eyes, that will be the moment to capture this kid."</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu thought she was being very cautious. Even though Xu Yan had already entered the cave, she did not reveal herself.</p><p></p><p>According to the established plan, to ensure foolproof success, they could capture Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>To capture Xu Yan, she had paid a price, temporarily avoiding the restrictions of the Tai Cang realm to bring in a treasure.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was to prevent Xu Yan's master from giving him some powerful treasure that could hold out until his master came to rescue him.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, they had to ensure that Xu Yan's life and death were firmly under control before the other party came to rescue his disciple.</p><p></p><p>If it weren't for the fact that her true self could not descend, Mei Wu would not have gone to such lengths to have her avatar bring a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pretended to be extremely cautious all the way, as if he had not discovered Mei Wu's presence, nor had he noticed the Flame Demon's figure.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, Dian Wu, and who is that powerful expert? His fire power is very strong, and this fire dao power is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan secretly marveled.</p><p></p><p>The scorching aura of the Heavenly Cave came from that fire dao expert, whose strength was very powerful and special.</p><p></p><p>"Responsible for sealing off the Heavenly Cave? Too bad your strength is not enough to trap me."</p><p></p><p>Under the Little Heavenly Eye, neither Mei Wu nor the Flame Demon could hide.</p><p></p><p>"What treasure is this? Mei Wu is really a good person!"</p><p></p><p>Finally, seeing the treasure Mei Wu had prepared, Xu Yan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The jade bamboo in the pool looked extraordinary at first glance.</p><p></p><p>He showed a look of delight, but still did not let his guard down, carefully moving forward while the Mountains and Rivers in his sword quietly appeared, enveloping the area.</p><p></p><p>The originally not-so-deeply hidden Dian Wu should have been discovered by now. Dian Wu was prepared to strike as soon as Xu Yan discovered him.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan seemed to have his attention completely drawn by the jade bamboo, not noticing his hiding place. This caused him to hesitate, unsure whether to make a move.</p><p></p><p>"The opportunity is now!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath. This moment of hesitation from the opponent was exactly what he wanted.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In an instant, Xu Yan's figure disappeared from its original spot. A shadow seemed to rush towards the jade bamboo, but that was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's true body, with a shift in position, appeared in an instant at Mei Wu's hiding place.</p><p></p><p>While the three of them were distracted for a moment by the illusion rushing towards the jade bamboo, Xu Yan had already made his move in that split second!</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was greatly alarmed and furious. What a cunning kid!</p><p></p><p>A streak of pink light had not yet blossomed, and the treasure she was about to use had just begun to activate when she saw a wooden sword thrust out from Xu Yan's hand.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! She had no time to react before the wooden sword pierced into her body.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu screamed in pain. The treasure she was about to use instantly fell, and Xu Yan took the opportunity to snatch it, the treasure falling into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the formation disk activated, and a great formation descended upon Dian Wu's location.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, thousands of swords flew out from Xu Yan's sleeve, forming a sword formation that enveloped the Flame Demon.</p><p></p><p>The Mountains and Rivers in the sword retracted, and in an instant, the pool including the jade bamboo, as well as the treasures around the pool, all fell into Xu Yan's hands.</p><p></p><p>From the moment he made his move to when he had looted all the treasures, it was but an instant. By this time, Dian Wu had just barely broken out of the formation.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon transformed into a terrifying fire giant, burning the thousands of swords and breaking free.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu let out screams of agony, as a sword was roaming inside her body, seemingly about to destroy her.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, thank you for your generous gift!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled brightly, swinging the sword in his hand. A sword intent that could annihilate everything seemed about to completely destroy Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>"This avatar of yours is going to die at my hands again!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu suddenly turned into a streak of pink light, frantically retreating. "Xu Yan, you little brat, you deserve to die. I must kill you!"</p><p></p><p>When had she ever suffered such great losses one after another?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, to suffer such great losses at the hands of a young, weak kid - she couldn't swallow this!</p><p></p><p>"We'll see if you can escape back first!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan made as if to completely destroy Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu snorted coldly. She knew that this avatar of hers was absolutely no match for Xu Yan and must return to descend a new avatar.</p><p></p><p>"Dian Wu, Flame Demon, trap him for me. I'll go back for a moment and return immediately!"</p><p></p><p>After Mei Wu finished speaking, she turned into a streak of pink light and instantly disappeared from the Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a smile. Mei Wu had taken his master's sword back with her. The mission was complete!</p><p></p><p>"Dian Wu, Flame Demon? Heh, you two think you can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>With a thought from Xu Yan, all the grass, wood, sand, and stones in the Heavenly Cave turned into killing swords, densely packed, their number uncountable.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood proudly as countless killing swords, each with different sword intents and sharpness, shot towards the Flame Demon and Dian Wu like a rain of blades.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Yan waved his hand, and the Mountains and Rivers Manifestation was deployed. With a rumble, a blurry, majestic figure suddenly appeared within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>Then, two powerful figures were seen battling, the sky shattering and the earth cracking, a heart-shaking sight.</p><p></p><p>Dian Wu and the Flame Demon were alarmed. They were merely power avatars, their strength ultimately limited.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Shan Gu's disciple?" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Flame Demon asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Within the Mountains and Rivers Manifestation, two powerful experts were battling. Although one of the figures was blurry, he was an old acquaintance and old rival after all, so naturally recognizable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. Shan Gu?</p><p></p><p>The powerful expert who perished together with Ming Wu?</p><p></p><p>"No, that's not right. Shan Gu is dead. You can't be Shan Gu's disciple, and your martial arts are different from Shan Gu's!"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon immediately shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>"But regardless of whether you are Shan Gu's successor or not, a prodigy like you must die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As the Flame Demon spoke, his entire body turned into flames.</p><p></p><p>Like a human-shaped flame, burning fiercely, terrifying fire power raged in all directions, turning into powerful attacks that came to seal off Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Today, you won't escape!"</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon's cold voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The flames were like giant pythons, or like a huge net, completely sealing off Xu Yan's surroundings, constantly enveloping towards him.</p><p></p><p>Dian Wu opened his hundred eyes, evil eye light shining forth. At the same time, he waved a black rod in his hand, an evil power spreading, attacking Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can stop me?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave a cold laugh. Neither the Flame Demon nor the Tomb Witch had strength surpassing the Immortal realm. Although he hadn't broken through to the Void-Breaking realm, he was still capable of handling attacks from both of them.</p><p></p><p>As for the Charm Witch, she had taken back his master's sword, so there was no chance for her to descend again.</p><p></p><p>"You wanted to trap me here, waiting for the Charm Witch to descend. Unfortunately, your plan is doomed to fail. The Charm Witch can't come - my master is teaching her a lesson right now," Xu Yan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Sword light rippled, and mountains and rivers appeared. A golden dragon soared among them, its majestic aura spreading as it let out a roar.</p><p></p><p>"Flame Demon, this power of yours is not bad. If I erase your consciousness, this flame power could be considered a treasure," Xu Yan said with a light laugh, looking at the approaching net of flames.</p><p></p><p>"Hah, you're not capable of erasing this consciousness of mine!" the Flame Demon sneered.</p><p></p><p>Although this avatar wasn't very powerful, he was still a supreme being. Even a trace of his consciousness wasn't something Xu Yan could erase. Even if Xu Yan had practiced soul secret techniques, he couldn't do it. This trace of consciousness was far beyond what an Immortal realm martial artist's soul could compare to.</p><p></p><p>"Is that so? Let's see about that!" Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>A fierce wind arose, blowing towards the flame net. This gust of wind directly struck the Flame Demon's trace of consciousness. What shocked him even more was that this wind contained the intent of the Undissolvable.</p><p></p><p>"This is..." He could hardly believe it. Could it be that the other party's killing move was cultivated from the Undissolvable Qi?</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this is sword intent cultivated from the Undissolvable Qi, and this sword intent is for killing souls," Xu Yan said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>This avatar of the Flame Demon was different from the avatars of the Tomb Witch and Charm Witch. Although their avatars were also power avatars, their powers were different. Once the consciousness was destroyed, the power would dissipate along with it.</p><p></p><p>But this avatar of the Flame Demon seemed to contain a trace of his origin power. Even if the consciousness was destroyed, it would still exist, even becoming a kind of treasure. This was related to the Flame Demon's own powerful strength, and even to his true body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also suspected that in order to seal off the Heavenly Cave and trap him here, an ordinary power avatar couldn't achieve this, so the Flame Demon had separated a trace of his origin power to reinforce it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the Undissolvable sword intent fused into the flames, even contaminating this trace of the Flame Demon's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"Charm Witch, I can't hold on much longer!" The Flame Demon's expression changed drastically, his gaze towards Xu Yan filled with intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>This boy must die, otherwise he would become a great threat in the future! To think the Pale Azure world had produced such a monster, he absolutely could not be allowed to live!</p><p></p><p>"Tomb Witch, you useless thing!" He then glared angrily at the Tomb Witch, who had been unable to pose any threat to Xu Yan at all.</p><p></p><p>The Tomb Witch felt extremely aggrieved. Xu Yan was not afraid of his evil eye light, which greatly reduced his killing power. His other techniques were even less able to threaten Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Stop shouting, the Charm Witch can't come!" Xu Yan said with a bright smile.</p><p></p><p>Right now, the Charm Witch was probably suffering in pain.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon was secretly shocked. Could it be that the Charm Witch had really been taught a lesson?</p><p></p><p>Who was Xu Yan's master?</p><p></p><p>Several figures flashed through his mind, but none of them fit.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, given the Charm Witch's strength, she shouldn't have been able to be taught a lesson by any of those people.</p><p></p><p>"Who is your master?" asked the Flame Demon, feeling that this trace of his consciousness couldn't hold on much longer.</p><p></p><p>He had underestimated his opponent, not expecting that his attack would contain the Undissolvable Qi.</p><p></p><p>"My master's name carries too much karmic weight. You couldn't bear it," Xu Yan said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"Nonsense, is there any karma in this world that I, the Flame Demon, cannot bear? Even as strong as..."</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon suddenly stopped speaking.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong? Suddenly realized there are indeed strong beings whose karma you can't bear?" Xu Yan mocked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, it's not that I can't bear it, just that some people are better left unmentioned!" The Flame Demon sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure suddenly flickered and disappeared from his original spot. The next moment, he appeared in front of the Tomb Witch, a black sword light slashing down.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Tomb Witch's gaze turned cold as he swung the black rod in his hand, stirring up waves of dark qi, as if wanting to corrode Xu Yan's attack.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment Xu Yan's sword slashed down, his palm struck out with a roar, and a golden dragon thundered forth.</p><p></p><p>True Dragon's Fury!</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Tomb Witch was sent flying backwards, the light in his hundred eyes dimming. He exclaimed in shock, "How did you become so much stronger?"</p><p></p><p>What kind of monster was this? When in the Long Cloud realm, Xu Yan's strength was nowhere near this powerful.</p><p></p><p>How much time had passed?</p><p></p><p>His strength had nearly doubled!</p><p></p><p>At this rate, in less than a hundred years, his strength wouldn't be weaker than his true body! This boy must die!</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon was also shocked. Had this kid been hiding his true strength all along?</p><p></p><p>"It's been a few years, isn't it natural to become stronger?" Xu Yan swung his sword repeatedly, his figure moving nimbly, completely ignoring the Flame Demon's fire attacks.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, this trace of my consciousness is destined to disappear. Since that's the case, I won't let you benefit from it. Let's see if you..."</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon's gaze turned cold as he prepared to self-destruct this avatar, turning it into a powerful attack. Even if it couldn't kill Xu Yan, it would surely severely injure him.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a voice full of anger, almost frenzied, roared, "Xu Yan, you master and disciple should both die! Just you wait!</p><p></p><p>"Ahhh, damn it, how dare you ambush me! Just you wait, I'll definitely cut you both into a thousand pieces.</p><p></p><p>"No, I'll turn you master and disciple into my charm slaves, torturing you day and night to vent my hatred!"</p><p></p><p>The roaring voice no longer had any trace of charm or gentleness, only anger, frenzy, and hatred.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave shook, and even the power of the world's laws was stirred up at this moment, turning into lightning flashing on the world's barrier, as if ready to destroy the roaring person with the power of heaven and earth should they dare to enter!</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon and Tomb Witch were stunned.</p><p></p><p>That was the Charm Witch's voice. What had happened to her? The two were naturally very familiar with the Charm Witch and had never seen her so angry, so out of control before. Even when someone had once angrily cursed her for being shameless, she had never been this enraged.</p><p></p><p>As a result, she was now roaring in anger as if she had lost her mind, seemingly wanting to kill her way into this world.</p><p></p><p>The Flame Demon, who was about to self-destruct his avatar, was stunned for a moment. He looked up towards the outside of this world, vaguely seeing pink light lingering.</p><p></p><p>"Good opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wasn't distracted by the Charm Witch's loss of composure. Taking advantage of the Flame Demon's momentary distraction, he instantly appeared in front of him, thrusting his sword into the ball of flames, at the core of the Flame Demon's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! In that killing move, he instantly shattered this trace of the Flame Demon's consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"How did you..." The Flame Demon was stunned. How had Xu Yan discovered the location of his consciousness core?</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, his consciousness had already dissipated.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

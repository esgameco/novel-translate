        <h1>Chapter 223</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"The gate of the Spiritual Realm has closed, greatly shortening the distance between the avatar of the Spiritual Progenitor."</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm and the Inner Realm were like two different worlds. With the gate of the Spiritual Realm closed, it was only natural that the control range of the Spiritual Progenitor's avatar would be reduced.</p><p></p><p>To enter the palace, Li Xuan himself would need to approach the gate of the Spiritual Realm and shorten the distance to the Spiritual Progenitor's avatar.</p><p></p><p>In front of the gate of the Spiritual Realm, the Spiritual Progenitor's avatar merged into a nearby stone and became dormant.</p><p></p><p>Leaving a Spiritual Progenitor's avatar in the Spiritual Realm, ready for any emergencies, such as opening the gate of the Spiritual Realm, was a wise move.</p><p></p><p>After all, the gate of the Spiritual Realm could only be opened from within the Spiritual Realm. If it were to be completely closed, how could one enter the Spiritual Realm?</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan turned and left, returning to Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked out of the gate of the Spiritual Realm, his spirit immediately invigorated, and a look of surprise appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy in the Spiritual Realm is actually more than three times as abundant as in the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>As a Spiritual Body, he was particularly sensitive to spiritual energy. As soon as he entered the Spiritual Realm, he felt the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy constantly surging into his body.</p><p></p><p>"The heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms are also more active."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gained some understanding. The reason why the cultivators in the Inner Realm could not break through to the Martial Dao Celestial level was not due to a lack of spiritual energy, as there was spiritual energy and spiritual crystals. </p><p></p><p>Even peak Grand Masters, who among them lacked spiritual crystals? Piling up spiritual crystals would not result in a lack of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>So, the fundamental reason why the cultivators in the Inner Realm could not break through to the Martial Dao Celestial level, apart from the cultivation techniques, was that the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms were not active enough!</p><p></p><p>The Borderlands were unable to cultivate martial arts because the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms had dissipated, and the spiritual energy was turbulent, so the living beings could not guide the heavenly and earthly spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"While in the Inner Realm, due to the lack of activity in the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, they could not break through the Martial Dao Celestial level."</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of martial arts in both the Inner Realm and the Spiritual Realm was closely related to the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms. The strength of the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms determined the advancement of martial cultivation!</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts taught by my master are truly powerful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Without the heavenly and earthly spiritual mechanisms, one could still cultivate without being restricted.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, he left the gate of the Spiritual Realm and had to pass through the main hall.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, the two guards who were guarding the gate of the Spiritual Realm were about to check if it was Jiao Ming or Ping'er who had returned, or if the two had returned together.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a graceful figure rushed in.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, open the gate of the Spiritual Realm, I need to go to the lower realms and capture some exploratory pigs and dogs."</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying hurriedly ran into the main hall and shouted.</p><p></p><p>Behind her, an old woman was closely following her.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, it's Miss Dai."</p><p></p><p>One of the guarding warriors said, slightly stunned.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying, the prodigy of the Dai family, was born with a precious body and was the apple of the Dai family's eye, showered with countless blessings. Recently, she had captured some lower-level warriors, preparing to explore the Qingtianjiao Tomb, but ended up angering many.</p><p></p><p>A Celestial Wandering Cultivator had threatened to kill her.</p><p></p><p>Frightened, the Dai family's strong members had not only paid spiritual crystals as compensation to the captured lower-level warriors under the pretext of voluntary employment, but also sent people to hunt down that Celestial Wandering Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>And Dai Yingying had also calmed down a bit.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, she was now preparing to capture people from the Inner Realm to use as cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's me!" </p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying tilted her head and said.</p><p></p><p>"The lowly people in the Inner Realm, being noticed by me, Miss, and going to explore for me, is an honor for them."</p><p></p><p>The two guarding warriors did not see any problem with her words.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Dai, the gate of the Spiritual Realm just opened, it should be the people from the Water Star Palace returning. Wait a moment, I'll open the gate of the Spiritual Realm for you to enter."</p><p></p><p>The guarding warrior smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were from the Zheng Kingdom, and Dai Yingying was the fiancée of the Second Prince of the Zheng Kingdom, the future princess. Her identity was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a young figure walked in from the door facing the gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying's eyes lit up slightly, this young man was quite handsome.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The guarding warrior was a bit puzzled, as he did not see the figures of Jiao Ming and Ping'er, only this young man.</p><p></p><p>An Inner Realm cultivator? He couldn't help but be surprised. The previous disturbance at the gate of the Spiritual Realm indicated that the person knocking was not weak, far beyond the abilities of an Inner Realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that Ping'er had let this handsome young man in? That member of the Water Star Palace was usually quite frivolous. If she saw such a handsome young man, would she not be moved?</p><p></p><p>"What Ping'er? I don't know her!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the people in the main hall, the two guarding warriors were at the Small Celestial level, not much stronger than Jiao Ming. </p><p></p><p>The young lady was at the peak Grandmaster level, a true prodigy at this age.</p><p></p><p>The old woman was the strongest, at the late Small Celestial level.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had no intention of lingering in the main hall, and strode towards the exit. He had no interest in these unrelated people.</p><p></p><p>"Are you an Inner Realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>The guarding warrior's face darkened as he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have a problem with that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gave him a sideways glance and continued to walk out.</p><p></p><p>The two guarding warriors frowned, exchanging a glance, and couldn't help but become suspicious.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such a powerful cultivator from the Inner Realm? Could it be...?</p><p></p><p>A terrifying thought emerged in their minds.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon! Suddenly, the two did not dare to act rashly, and could only watch helplessly as Xu Yan left, not daring to treat him the same way as the other Inner Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>If he really was the Blood Demon, any action they took would only lead to their own downfall!</p><p></p><p>"Is it the Blood Demon? Wasn't he killed by that person from the Taixuan Sect? And after so much time has passed, there has been no news of him. How could he suddenly appear?"</p><p></p><p>"Is it possible that the Blood Demon has changed his identity and is acting low-key, which is why there has been no news of him? The Blood Demon is rising again, and this is not the first time."</p><p></p><p>"That can't be, the Blood Demon is not the type of person to act low-key. He is arrogant and self-assured, and his cultivation technique is a killing art..."</p><p></p><p>"But you can't say for sure, after being hunted down so many times, maybe the Blood Demon has changed his usual style of action?"</p><p></p><p>The two guarding warriors were communicating through voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>The more they discussed, the more alarmed they felt.</p><p></p><p>Has the Blood Demon risen again? Will the Spiritual Realm once again be engulfed in a bloody storm?</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying looked at the departing Xu Yan and hurriedly asked, "Is he an Inner Realm cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, he is not someone who entered from the Spiritual Realm, he is undoubtedly an Inner Realm cultivator!"</p><p></p><p>One of the guarding warriors nodded.</p><p></p><p>He was just about to remind Dai Yingying not to provoke the other party.</p><p></p><p>But Dai Yingying turned and chased after him, with the old woman closely following behind.</p><p></p><p>The two guarding warriors looked at each other, and very tacitly sat down to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>If it was truly the Blood Demon, they could not provoke him, as getting involved would mean certain death.</p><p></p><p>If it was not the Blood Demon, then if Dai Yingying killed the person, so be it.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had just walked out of the main hall, unfamiliar with the Spiritual Realm, and was pondering his next move.</p><p></p><p>A voice came from behind him.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood with his sword crossed in front of his chest.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He turned around and said.</p><p></p><p>He thought back to when he first entered the inner domain and encountered Du Yuying.</p><p></p><p>"Are you an inner domain cultivator?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying tilted her head up and arrogantly asked.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, do you have any instructions?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed slightly, this young lady's attitude was somewhat repulsive.</p><p></p><p>"This young lady has taken a liking to you, come with me, and if you manage to survive, you, a lowly person, will have a great opportunity. This young lady will make an exception and let you become a servant in my Dai family!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying said loftily.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, he thought of Jiao Ming, who also had such an attitude, but he had already scattered his ashes.</p><p></p><p>Should he scatter this person's ashes as well? Xu Yan looked at Dai Yingying, then at the old woman beside her, a late-stage Xiao Tianren cultivator, indicating she had some background.</p><p></p><p>"I came to the Spirit Realm to accumulate a foundation and break through the Divine Consciousness Realm, there's no need to invite trouble."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan decided to ignore the other party.</p><p></p><p>He turned and left.</p><p></p><p>He would remember her, and if he encountered her again after breaking through the Divine Consciousness Realm, still acting so lofty and disdainful towards him, he would scatter her ashes.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan directly turn and leave, completely ignoring her, Dai Yingying, who was always lofty and spoiled, could not endure this.</p><p></p><p>Especially since the other party was from a lowly place in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent, how dare you ignore this young lady? I originally wanted to take you to the Qingtianjiao Tomb to explore the path, and if you were lucky enough not to die, I would grant you an opportunity. Since you are so insolent, don't blame this young lady for teaching you a lesson!"</p><p></p><p>The angry Dai Yingying directly took out a whip from her storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"You lowly thing from the inner domain, a pig-dog-like existence, this young lady sees that your appearance is still acceptable, so I'm making an exception to take you to the Qingtianjiao Tomb to explore the path and grant you an opportunity, yet you dare to ignore this young lady so, let me give you a beating!"</p><p></p><p>The arrogant and overbearing Dai Yingying swung the whip, making a cracking sound, and it coiled towards Xu Yan's neck.</p><p></p><p>This whip had disciplined many disobedient lower-level cultivators, killing more than a few.</p><p></p><p>Completely proficient, it directly coiled towards Xu Yan's neck, prepared to drag him over and beat him mercilessly!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already decided not to bother, but the other party not only directly insulted him as a pig-dog-like existence, but also attacked him.</p><p></p><p>He was immediately enraged.</p><p></p><p>This woman had walked the path to her own death, so he would oblige her! "Qingtianjiao Tomb? Could it be a treasure land?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying's mention of the Qingtianjiao Tomb caught his attention.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and grabbed the incoming whip, then yanked it forcefully, causing Dai Yingying to let out a cry as her figure was pulled towards him.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!"</p><p></p><p>The old woman angrily attacked Xu Yan, fully confident that with her late-stage Xiao Tianren cultivation, she could destroy him before he could harm the young lady.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't even spare her a glance, not even drawing his sword, and simply slapped his palm out.</p><p></p><p>A golden dragon roared out.</p><p></p><p>The dragon's might was accompanied by a faint wind, rushing towards the old woman.</p><p></p><p>Gentle Wind Sword Intent!</p><p></p><p>The old woman suddenly felt her consciousness violently pained, like a weak candle flame being extinguished by a gale, and she lost consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon roared, instantly annihilating the old woman's attack and then destroyed her dissipating spiritual consciousness, reducing her to ashes!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dai Yingying's neck was in Xu Yan's palm.</p><p></p><p>"Help..."</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying was about to cry for help, but then she saw that the old woman had already turned to ash! Her face turned deathly pale, she looked at Xu Yan in terror, this person from the inner domain was so strong? No! He definitely wasn't from the inner domain, those two scoundrels had deceived her!</p><p></p><p>"Don't kill me, if you kill me, you won't live either, I am Dai Yingying, the young miss of the Dai family, my fiancé is the Second Prince of the Zheng Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Dai Yingying could only bring up her background to scare him.</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she suddenly became arrogant again.</p><p></p><p>It seemed she suddenly realized that her background was terrifying, and if he killed her, he would also surely die, so he definitely wouldn't dare do anything to her.</p><p></p><p>"You quickly let me go, if you let me go, this matter will be forgotten, otherwise if you hurt me, you will face the pursuit of the Dai family and the Zheng Kingdom's royal family!"</p><p></p><p>She hadn't completely gone mad yet.</p><p></p><p>She made a compromise, letting him go and the enmity would be forgotten. </p><p></p><p>Of course, in her heart, she planned to kill him and torture him to death after escaping.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the grip on her neck tightened, turning her face red as she struggled, but her strength seemed to have disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she was terrified.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slightly loosened his grip and asked, "What is the Qingtianjiao Tomb, and where is it?"</p><p></p><p>"I'll tell you, I'll tell you, the Qingtianjiao Tomb is in the Zheng Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying hastily revealed all the details about the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>"Where in the Spirit Realm is this place? Give me an introduction."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying looked at him with suspicion, was he really a cultivator from the inner domain? But how could someone from a lowly place have such terrifying strength?</p><p></p><p>"This is Yuzhou, one of the eighteen states of the Spirit Realm, the location of the Zheng Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying answered tremblingly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't expect her to introduce much, he just wanted a general understanding of where he was in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You should quickly let me go, otherwise my Dai family and the Zheng Kingdom's royal family won't spare you."</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying exaggeratedly introduced the strength of the Dai family and the Zheng Kingdom, her eyes regaining some arrogance as she threatened him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan remained expressionless, taking her storage bag and then releasing her.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying hurriedly ran towards the main hall, angrily and venomously saying, "You lowly person, pig-dog-like thing, just wait for me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand and a palm strike shot out, then he strode away.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Dai Yingying turned to ash and dissipated.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure soared into the sky, heading towards the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>"Just after entering the Spirit Realm, I've encountered this treasure land about to open, the Qibi Tree and Dragon's Eye Fruit, they are all good things that can help me accumulate a foundation and undergo a metamorphosis during my breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"If there is Bluehorn Dragon blood and flesh inside, it would be perfect for my junior brother to nourish his physical body and accumulate a physical foundation, to aid in his breakthrough to the Unbreakable Golden Body."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was determined to obtain the Qingtianjiao Tomb.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators under thirty years old could enter, and he met the requirements.</p><p></p><p>As for the unwritten rule that wandering cultivators don't participate, Xu Yan directly ignored it.</p><p></p><p>Dai Yingying, that arrogant and overbearing woman, was seeking her own death, so he would oblige her.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dai family and the Zheng Kingdom's royal family behind her, Xu Yan didn't really care, with his Harmonious Concealment Technique, evading their pursuit would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>Only the guardians at the Spirit Realm's gates would have seen him, and if necessary, he could change his appearance.</p><p></p><p>As for not killing the guardians at the Spirit Realm's gates, it was mainly because they hadn't offended him and also didn't try to save Dai Yingying, since they didn't provoke him, Xu Yan wasn't one to indiscriminately kill.</p><p></p><p>In the main hall, two guardian cultivators were covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>This person was most likely the Blood Demon, if they had intervened, they would have been annihilated without even leaving ashes behind!

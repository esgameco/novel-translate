        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 1: I Don't Want to Take on a Disciple, But He Has Given Me Too Much</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is my gift to become your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>The young man respectfully placed three rosewood boxes in front of Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"You've misunderstood. I'm not some reclusive immortal, and I don't take on disciples. You should take these back!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke with a slightly pained expression.</p><p></p><p>The young man's name was Xu Yan, and he was the son of a wealthy family from the county capital. His family background made the transmigrated Li Xuan quite envious, but the problem was that the young man wasn't very bright and had mistaken Li Xuan for a reclusive immortal, insisting on becoming his disciple no matter what.</p><p></p><p>It had been over ten years since Li Xuan transmigrated to this world. Without any system or cheat abilities, he couldn't even leave the small mountain village, and the situation was even more tragic - he was now the only one left in this small village.</p><p></p><p>The small mountain village was surrounded by steep cliffs on all sides, with only a narrow passage about a zhang wide as the way in and out. It was an ideal place for reclusive living, and the village's ancestors had migrated here to escape the turmoil.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, with no more wars outside, the younger generation in the village was no longer content to live out their lives in this small mountain village, and they began to leave to seek their fortunes elsewhere. </p><p></p><p>The nearest town was a hundred li away, and the path was perilous, especially having to pass through a dense forest where fierce tigers and beasts often lurked.</p><p></p><p>Over the years, the population of the village had gradually dwindled. By the time Li Xuan transmigrated here, there were only about a dozen households left, mostly elderly people staying behind.</p><p></p><p>Including Li Xuan, there were only five young and able-bodied people left in the village, and they were all eager to leave the small village and go to the city to make a living, Li Xuan included.</p><p></p><p>However, the path was treacherous, especially the thirty-li Evil Demon Forest where ferocious tigers and beasts roamed. Several of the young villagers who tried to leave had died in the Evil Demon Forest.</p><p></p><p>Ten years ago, a villager who had previously left the village returned, wanting to take his mother to the city, claiming he had learned the skill to kill tigers and was not afraid of the beasts in the Evil Demon Forest.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan and a few other young men joined him on the journey out of the village.</p><p></p><p>Though the thirty-li Evil Demon Forest was home to fierce tigers and beasts, if they were lucky, they could pass through unharmed. But Li Xuan's group was not so fortunate.</p><p></p><p>A striped fierce tiger appeared.</p><p></p><p>The man who claimed to have learned the tiger-killing skill immediately charged forward with a dagger, roaring - and was immediately knocked down by a sweeping kick...</p><p></p><p>Only Li Xuan managed to escape with his life, returning to the small mountain village. He always believed that he was able to escape because he had decisively turned and fled the moment he saw the man's failed attempt.</p><p></p><p>This so-called tiger-killing skill was completely unreliable, sending the man straight into the tiger's jaws!</p><p></p><p>After that, Li Xuan was the only young able-bodied person left in the village. The elderly who had lost their loved ones gradually passed away over the decade, until just half a month ago when Li Xuan saw off the last old villager.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the empty small mountain village, with only himself remaining, Li Xuan felt grief and indignation. Other transmigrators either rose against the odds or had extraordinary backgrounds. </p><p></p><p>But what about him?</p><p></p><p>He couldn't even leave this small mountain village!</p><p></p><p>Without any system or cheat abilities, he might end up living out his days in lonely solitude in this small village.</p><p></p><p>"Sigh, I thought I could be like those in the online novels, wielding a sword and roaming the world, vanquishing demons and ascending to sainthood, looking down on the ages. Guess I was just dreaming."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, mocking himself, "Can't even leave this small mountain village, and I was dreaming of wielding a sword and roaming the world? Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>It was because of this self-mocking remark that the unknowing Xu Yan, who had somehow ended up in this small mountain village, heard the part about "wielding a sword and roaming the world" and mistook Li Xuan for a reclusive immortal, immediately kneeling down to beg to become his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I've finally found you! Please accept me as your disciple and impart your supreme martial arts to me!"</p><p></p><p>"What?!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled, his eyes widening as he looked at the sixteen or seventeen-year-old young man in luxurious attire, a long sword at his waist. He was quite bewildered.</p><p></p><p>"I am Xu Yan from Donghe County. From a young age, I have aspired to seek the true way of the martial arts. Today, I have the fortune to encounter you, Senior. I beg you to accept me as your disciple. I will diligently cultivate and never disappoint you with your teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Thud! Thud! Thud!</p><p></p><p>Seeing the young man's fervent gaze and respectful kowtowing, Li Xuan was completely dumbfounded, his first thought being: This kid doesn't have much upstairs!</p><p></p><p>No matter what Li Xuan...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>How could Xuan refuse, how could he deny that he was a reclusive master? Even Xu Yan did not believe him, and insisted on becoming his disciple. That fervent attitude made Li Xuan's head ache.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a reclusive master, nor do I know the methods of martial arts cultivation. You've found the wrong person, I'm still looking for someone to teach me the martial arts cultivation methods!"</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was firm as he said, "Senior, you don't have to lie to me, you must be a reclusive master!"</p><p></p><p>"Look here, the steep cliffs on all sides, the pleasant scenery, it's clearly a place of seclusion and retreat. Senior, if you are not a reclusive master, why would you live here alone?"</p><p></p><p>"Senior, please take me as your disciple, I will never betray your inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to kowtow, his gaze fanatical and resolute.</p><p></p><p>"I am not a reclusive master, I don't know any cultivation methods, and I don't take disciples. You've really found the wrong person..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was helpless, this kid was so single-minded, he didn't even know how he got through the evil forest and came to this small village.</p><p></p><p>Was he so obsessed with finding a reclusive master that he had lost his mind?</p><p></p><p>"I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly stood up, a look of enlightenment on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Taking a master is a great matter, how can it be done hastily? This junior will go back and prepare the disciple's gifts!"</p><p></p><p>In Li Xuan's bewildered state, Xu Yan rushed away, soon disappearing from sight.</p><p></p><p>Half a month had passed in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>For the past half month, Li Xuan had been frustrated, unable to seize the opportunity to learn about the outside world from Xu Yan, and even see if he could leave the small mountain village.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Xu Yan came again.</p><p></p><p>And he brought the disciple's gifts!</p><p></p><p>He was determined to take Li Xuan as his master!</p><p></p><p>No matter how Li Xuan denied it, Xu Yan firmly believed that he was a reclusive master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not want to deceive anyone, especially not someone with an extraordinary background. He had no external support and no systematic cultivation, if he was exposed, the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>So he repeatedly refused, repeatedly denied, but Xu Yan was so single-minded, believing him to be a reclusive master, that not even nine oxen could pull him back.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this is three hundred taels of gold, I know that yellow and white objects are not in your sight, but the disciple's gift cannot be lacking. This is a small token of my sincerity!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened one of the boxes, inside were thirty gold ingots neatly arranged.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the gold ingots, swallowing a mouthful of saliva, slightly tempted, but ultimately gritted his teeth and said firmly, "I don't take disciples! I'm not a reclusive master either, take it back, I'm not much older than you!"</p><p></p><p>"Although your appearance is youthful, you must have achieved cultivation attainment, and that is why you do not age." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still firmly believed that he was a reclusive master, and opened the second box.</p><p></p><p>"This is a thousand-year-old ginseng that my Xu family has treasured, it is the second disciple's gift. I hope the senior will accept it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan swallowed a mouthful of saliva, looking at the box, the root system was complete, already in a human form, and the faint ginseng fragrance entered his nostrils, making his whole person feel refreshed.</p><p></p><p>The thousand-year-old ginseng was undoubtedly a rare treasure. The elders in the village had said that a hundred-year-old ginseng could extend the life of a dying person by three days, with great invigorating and life-prolonging effects.</p><p></p><p>If a hundred-year-old ginseng had such miraculous effects, then a thousand-year-old ginseng must be even more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat tempted, but gritted his teeth and continued, "Take it back, I really am not a reclusive master and I don't have any cultivation methods!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened the third box: "Senior, this is a nine-leaf Yuanzhi, the third disciple's gift!"</p><p></p><p>Nine-leaf Yuanzhi!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found it hard to take his eyes off it. The elders in the village had said that according to ancestral tradition, the Yuanzhi with nine leaves was the most precious, and that taking the nine-leaf Yuanzhi could prevent a hundred diseases, maintain mental alertness, prevent graying and whitening, and extend one's life by twenty years!</p><p></p><p>Such a rare and precious medicinal herb in the world!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the box, the jade-white color, resembling lingzhi, with nine purple leaves on the stem - the nine-leaf Yuanzhi. He took a deep breath, and with great difficulty tore his gaze away, sighing deeply in a pretentious manner.</p><p></p><p>"Alright! Since you have come here, it must be fate. I will take you as my disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had given too much, Li Xuan couldn't bear to refuse.</p><p></p><p>A new book has arrived, please collect and read it^_^</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

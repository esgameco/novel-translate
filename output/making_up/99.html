            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 99: Elixir Martial Arts, Eternal Bone</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and several books flew out of the room and fell into his hands.</p><p></p><p>These were all medical books from the remote wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Let me test you, how about it?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan found it really hard to believe that this lively and unrestrained young girl actually had such superb medical skills.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, her talent was truly extraordinary, and he could consider taking her in as a disciple.</p><p></p><p>Flipping open the medical books, Li Xuan extracted some case records and began to examine Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>He discovered that Su Lingxiu answered fluently, able to provide treatment methods for all kinds of patients.</p><p></p><p>Her medical skills were indeed remarkable, not just empty talk.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became energized. As for Su Wenxiu's cultivation of inner domain martial arts, he didn't really care, as it was only at the seventh rank. Reforming her martial arts would be easy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with a martial arts foundation, her cultivation would not be slow.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, letting Shi Er leave, then stood up from the chair, playing with a jade scepter and circling around Su Lingxiu with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu felt a bit panicked: "It's over, it's over, I've stepped on a nail. This time I can't bury the body!"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yí's breathing was heavy, her fists clenched, as if she wanted to overcome the mountain in her heart and shield the young miss behind her. Her eyes had turned scarlet.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's aura was restrained as he chuckled, "Fourth rank in martial arts? From the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Yí took a deep breath and said in a muffled voice, "Yes, from the inner domain. I am Zhou Ying, responsible for protecting the young miss."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. This young girl's identity seemed to be not simple.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't care about his disciple's background, only whether they were suitable. The more background they had, the more willing he was to take them in.</p><p></p><p>"Inner domain martial artists don't usually come to this remote wilderness. Are you two fleeing here?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a guess in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying remained silent.</p><p></p><p>But she also felt relieved, as the other party was not those who were pursuing the young miss.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu snorted twice and said, "It's not fleeing, just changing a place to live!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was speechless.</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a while. Su Lingxiu had been in the remote wilderness for several years, after all, she had been the current Heavenly Mother of the Heavenly Mother Sect for years.</p><p></p><p>During all this time, no one had come to the remote wilderness to hunt them down.</p><p></p><p>Probably they didn't expect the two to flee to the remote wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan evaluated in his heart that if he took Su Lingxiu as a disciple, he would certainly provoke the forces pursuing the two. Whether it was worth it or not.</p><p></p><p>"With my strength, I can easily defeat great masters. And if Xu Yan can comprehend a cultivation method beyond the Innate Realm, I will break through the realm."</p><p></p><p>"So the troubles behind Su Lingxiu are just minor troubles."</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this was based on the premise that Su Lingxiu could comprehend the new martial arts system he had compiled. As long as she could comprehend it, the troubles behind her would be child's play.</p><p></p><p>"This young girl seems quite intelligent, and she started learning medicine at the age of four, her talent is monstrous. In the remote wilderness, I probably won't find a second person more suitable than her."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had made up his mind.</p><p></p><p>So he spoke, "Young miss, do you know about elixirs?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu shook her head.</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs, are they like those medicine pills?"</p><p></p><p>As she spoke, she reached into her bag and took out a bottle, pouring out a few round pills.</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs are not something as simple as these pills."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at the smooth, white little pills in her delicate hand.</p><p></p><p>This young girl had talent, perhaps she could comprehend the martial arts system he had compiled.</p><p></p><p>So he said, "I see you have talent and intelligence. I have a set of Elixir Martial Arts here. Would you like to become my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down in the chair.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Lingxiu pays respects to the master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu immediately knelt down and kowtowed, as if afraid Li Xuan would change his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Young miss, you!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was a bit dazed. How did the young miss suddenly decide to take him as a master?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched slightly. This girl Su Lingxiu was really sharp, unhesitatingly becoming his disciple.</p><p></p><p>By becoming his disciple, she now had a powerful backer.</p><p></p><p>"Let me make it clear, you only have one year. If you fail to enter the door in one year, I will dissolve the master-disciple relationship, I don't accept useless disciples."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said sternly.</p><p></p><p>If Su Wenxiu could not comprehend the Elixir Martial Arts, he naturally couldn't provide her with a backing.</p><p></p><p>No need to invite those troubles.</p><p></p><p>But if she could comprehend the Elixir Martial Arts, then she would be a precious disciple!</p><p></p><p>It was related to the grand cause of his martial arts, whoever dared to cause trouble, he would crush them all!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>One year was nothing, she believed that with her talent, entering the door in one year would be a breeze.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying, however, was anxious. "Young miss, in the remote wilderness, the spiritual energy has been extinguished, cultivation is impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was stunned, how could she have forgotten that?</p><p></p><p>"Master, you see?"</p><p></p><p>"My martial arts, how can they be compared to the inner domain? This talk of spiritual energy being extinguished and unable to cultivate, is all nonsense."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sneered contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"You just need to remember, focus on comprehending the techniques I teach you. If you fail to enter the door in one year, we'll dissolve the master-disciple relationship."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes lit up. "Master, will it really not affect my cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then master, rest assured, I will definitely enter the door within a year!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu promised.</p><p></p><p>"Don't say too much."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Martial Arts were something he had pondered over, another martial arts system beyond just physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I started learning medicine at the age of four, and by six I was already curing diseases and saving people..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>Looking at Su Lingxiu, he fell into deep thought. What was he doing at the age of six?</p><p></p><p>Playing in the mud!</p><p></p><p>Damn it!</p><p></p><p>The gap was quite large.</p><p></p><p>"Six years old, not bad. I vaguely remember that at the age of three, I had already fought and killed a fierce beast with my bare hands."</p><p></p><p>As a powerful and mysterious master, how could he lose to his disciple?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke without blushing or hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's mouth opened slightly as she looked at her master, falling into silence.</p><p></p><p>She doubted her master was boasting, but had no evidence.</p><p></p><p>"Master, truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>She then revealed an admiring smile and flattered him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, quite pleased.</p><p></p><p>"You can stay here, I'll teach you the martial arts techniques tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>She picked up an iron shovel and eagerly went to tidy up her own residence.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er came back.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother had actually become the disciple of the master?</p><p></p><p>But thinking about Su Lingxiu's monstrous talent, he felt it was only natural.</p><p></p><p>"Young miss, why did you take him as your master? The remote wilderness, how can cultivation be possible?"</p><p></p><p>In the room, Zhou Ying was cleaning and tidying up, worrying all the while.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, what if it's really possible? The remote wilderness, do we have to stay here forever? Master is a powerful person. If I succeed in cultivating, I won't fear those people anymore."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sister Shu Ling Xiu said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, you have reached the fourth rank. If it weren't for protecting me in the remote wilderness, you would have already broken through to the third rank."</p><p></p><p>Shu Ling Xiu's face was filled with excitement as she said, "If I can truly cultivate, then you also have a chance, Aunt Zhou. I will bury all those people someday!"</p><p></p><p>She waved the iron shovel in her hand as she spoke.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, Meng Chong was cultivating, tempering his saber, and comprehending the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>Two figures appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hurriedly stood up and bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong curiously looked at the beautiful young lady beside his master.</p><p></p><p>"This is your shijie, Shu Ling Xiu," Li Xuan introduced.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>"Temporarily," Li Xuan added after a moment's thought.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was puzzled, looking at his master, not understanding the meaning.</p><p></p><p>"I see her talent and potential, so I want to pass on the Pill Dao and Martial Dao to her. If she fails to make any progress in cultivation within a year, I will expel her from the sect, and she will no longer be your shijie.</p><p></p><p>"I do not accept useless disciples as my disciples," Li Xuan emphasized the last sentence.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suddenly understood. So that was the case.</p><p></p><p>He had heard his eldest shixiong mention that the master had given him a one-year deadline before.</p><p></p><p>Although the master had not explicitly stated it to him, it was obvious that he had also given Meng Chong a one-year deadline.</p><p></p><p>A master of such high attainment would certainly not be careless in accepting disciples. Only those on par with the ancient geniuses would be qualified to be his disciples.</p><p></p><p>"This is your second shixiong, Meng Chong," Li Xuan continued the introduction.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, second shixiong!" Shu Ling Xiu saluted.</p><p></p><p>"Shijie need not be so polite," Meng Chong returned the greeting.</p><p></p><p>Shu Ling Xiu examined Meng Chong. His figure was burly and robust, with a bald head, exuding an awe-inspiring aura and seemingly containing terrifying power.</p><p></p><p>Second shixiong is very strong! Much stronger than Aunt Zhou!</p><p></p><p>She was inwardly shocked. So the master was not lying, the remote wilderness can indeed be cultivated!</p><p></p><p>After introducing the two, Li Xuan led Shu Ling Xiu aside to pass on the Pill Dao and Martial Dao to her.</p><p></p><p>"Your talent lies in pills and medicine, so I will teach you the Pill Dao and Martial Dao... Whether it is orthodox martial arts or physical martial arts, the foundation is in refining the skin, bones, and organs, only the methods differ slightly."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slowly explained.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the skin, bones, and organs?" Shu Ling Xiu was very curious, as this was vastly different from the martial arts she had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"You have already reached the seventh rank, having a certain foundation in martial arts, so it will be relatively easy for you to cultivate. Next, I will pass on the cultivation method to you, but you must remember that the martial arts I impart are about comprehension and intent. Only by thoroughly comprehending the true meaning of the cultivation method can you make progress.</p><p></p><p>"Do not be too attached to the cultivation method itself, but focus on comprehending the essence..."</p><p></p><p>Teaching disciples was not something new to him.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was well-versed, repeating the words he had once said to Xu Yan and Meng Chong, emphasizing comprehension and intent, that only by grasping the true meaning of the cultivation method could one succeed in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Bone refining is divided into Iron Bone, Copper Bone, and Gold Bone... The basic pinnacle, orthodox martial arts refine Jade Bone, physical martial arts refine Diamond Lotus Bone, while the Pill Dao Martial Dao cultivates Evergreen Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Evergreen Bone!</p><p></p><p>This was the basic pinnacle he had created for the Pill Dao Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Evergreen Bone, with endless vitality, immortal and indestructible... Even if buried underground, it will absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, gradually transforming into a vibrant spiritual object, truly evergreen for all eternity.</p><p></p><p>"Those who refine Evergreen Bone will have a longer lifespan than other martial artists, living even longer, but their toughness may be slightly inferior to Jade Bone and Diamond Lotus Bone.</p><p></p><p>"Pill Dao Martial Dao practitioners can both save and kill, able to revive the dead and kill without a trace."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan introduced the basic system of the Pill Dao Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Shu Ling Xiu was already stunned.</p><p></p><p>Her small mouth slightly open, extremely shocked.</p><p></p><p>She could hardly believe that such a martial art existed in the world. Could it truly be cultivated?</p><p></p><p>Evergreen Bone, with endless vitality, if one died, the bones buried in the ground would absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, transforming into a vibrant spiritual object?</p><p></p><p>This was too profound!</p><p></p><p>Shu Ling Xiu's heart was pounding rapidly. It seemed she had encountered a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>If she could successfully cultivate this powerful and profound martial art, how formidable would she become?</p><p></p><p>"Master, please teach me quickly, teach me quickly. Once I succeed in cultivation, I will bury them all!" Shu Ling Xiu excitedly waved the iron shovel in her hand.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched slightly. This girl seemed to have an obsession with burying people.</p><p></p><p>He said in a serious tone, "What I'm passing on to you is the Dao, not just a cultivation method. You must go and comprehend the true meaning within. Only by comprehending it can you make progress and succeed in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"As for the precious medicines, I won't introduce them. Since you've studied medicine from a young age, you naturally know the effects and differences of various precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>"I will teach you the Dao of pill refining!"</p><p></p><p>As for the various precious medicines, their types and effects, Li Xuan naturally did not know, so he simply skipped over that, not passing on any pill formulas either. These were things Shu Ling Xiu had to comprehend on her own.</p><p></p><p>What he wanted to impart was the Dao of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Shu Ling Xiu respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Pills are the essence of refinement, removing impurities and fusing into a complete whole, their effects varying..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice was calm as he passed on the Dao of pill refining he had prepared to Shu Ling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>How to refine pills?</p><p></p><p>Essentially, it was about extracting the essence, refining the spiritual rhythm and fundamental power. Pill formulas were about combining different precious medicines and spiritual herbs, and through the refining process, the essences would fuse, resulting in a qualitative change and granting the pill extraordinary efficacy.</p><p></p><p>Shu Ling Xiu's bright eyes widened, her flawless white face flushed red with excitement and anticipation. The more she listened to her master's explanation, the more excited she became.</p><p></p><p>So precious medicines and spiritual herbs could be used in this way?</p><p>Refined into pills!</p><p></p><p>Even the most potent medicinal decoctions or pills, there would still be some toxins present.</p><p>If taken continuously without breaks to allow the body to expel the toxins, it would eventually harm the body.</p><p></p><p>But pills, on the other hand, had no such issues!</p><p>In pill refining, all the essence was extracted, and the impurities were removed and dissolved. Once taken, it would immediately assimilate, leaving no residual impurities.</p><p></p><p>What a wondrous technique!</p><p></p><p>"I must refine pills!" Shu Ling Xiu firmly declared in her heart.</p><p></p><p>"I will definitely succeed in cultivation and become a Pill Dao Martial Dao practitioner!"</p><p></p><p>She was well aware that once she comprehended the Dao of pill refining and could refine pills, she would gain a terrifying status in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, she needed a powerful backer.</p><p>Otherwise, she would be captured and forced to refine pills for powerful factions.</p><p></p><p>But with her master's strength, such a scenario would certainly not occur.</p><p></p><p>Shu Ling Xiu listened attentively, and as her master's explanation deepened, a pill formula began to take shape in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Ginseng, nine-leaf Yuanzhi combined with tiger's blood... Such a formula would have a great supplementary effect on cultivating. If refined into a pill, it would be of immense benefit."</p><p></p><p>She had studied medicine since she was young, so she was naturally familiar with various precious medicines and spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

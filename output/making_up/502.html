        <h1>Chapter 502</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was only a remnant soul, and trapped in the soul-storing jar. Whether he was lying or not could not escape Xu Yan's Small Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>Since Blood Extreme was telling the truth, Jiang Buping immediately lost interest in interrogating him further. He turned and left to go into closed-door cultivation, preparing for his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also continued cultivating, striving to break through as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan, he likewise continued cultivating, delving into the mysteries of the Heaven and Earth realm, as well as various divine abilities, to further perfect his strength at the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also went into seclusion. The affairs of the Qinghua Sect were left to Da Yue Huang and the others to handle.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Yue'er excitedly took the jar and entered the closed cultivation room, preparing to study Blood Extreme's remnant soul, to penetrate its mysteries and see what was special about the soul of a small world's master, and whether they could find a shortcut to advance the soul to the Realm Lord level ahead of time.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er was especially excited about this. If the research was successful, it meant that once she broke through to the Supreme realm, she could take a shortcut to elevate her soul to the Realm Lord level. In that case, breaking through to Realm Lord would naturally be a smooth process.</p><p></p><p>Just as now, the strength of her soul was much greater than Taicang warriors of the same level, which benefited from being Su Lingxiu's assistant, understanding souls better, and having soul-strengthening pills to aid cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was very nervous at this moment, feeling that the look in these two young girls' eyes was terrifying, as if they were going to do something horrible to him!</p><p></p><p>"Young ladies, let's talk this over, just tell me what you need me to do, I'll definitely cooperate!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme had become a coward!</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter whether you cooperate or not, you can't resist anyway!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, you'd better not try to resist at all, otherwise if something goes wrong, or even if some cruel accident happens, don't blame us."</p><p></p><p>"You just need to cooperate obediently, and I guarantee there won't be any pain. We're very skilled at this kind of research!"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er added.</p><p></p><p>The more Blood Extreme heard, the more anxious he felt, with an ominous feeling filling his mind.</p><p></p><p>Bang! The door of the closed cultivation room shut, and Blood Extreme's heart trembled along with it.</p><p></p><p>The formation lit up. Inside the closed cultivation room, there was a jade platform with various bottles and jars on it. Blood Extreme's gaze swept over them, and he immediately gulped.</p><p></p><p>The jars contained undying true spirits, and he even saw some souls. There were some corpses that had lost their souls and only the physical bodies remained.</p><p></p><p>On the jade platform were arranged some things he didn't understand, as well as some unusual lines and certain instruments. </p><p></p><p>He even saw a thin, sharp little knife. That small knife actually contained endless vitality, which was very extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The jar was placed on the jade platform. A depression appeared, swallowing half of the jar. Then some lines attached to the jar.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme sensed that something unusual was happening inside the jar. It was as if some special power, or even some indescribable force of law, was penetrating the jar and gradually entangling his remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>"Don't resist, don't move around. Otherwise if an accident occurs and you experience intense pain, that will be your own fault. Unless you, as a mighty Realm Lord, enjoy experiencing unknown pain in your remnant soul. If so, you can go ahead and resist."</p><p></p><p>"Actually, I hope you do resist. That way, I can study what unusual things happen to a soul under extreme pain, especially a Realm Lord level soul like yours."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps I can research medical techniques or pills that can ignore intense soul pain."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with narrowed eyes as she busied herself.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's remnant soul was trembling. Never before had he felt that such a peerlessly beautiful young girl could look so terrifying and make one's spirit quake!</p><p></p><p>Too scary!</p><p></p><p>"I won't resist, I absolutely won't resist!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme figured it out. Since he couldn't escape, and they were the disciples of such a terrifying being, he might as well be completely submissive. Maybe he would have a chance to recover that way?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Shadow Realm, deep in the abyss, mist suddenly surged and the entire Shadow Realm shook violently for a moment.</p><p></p><p>A pair of eyes faintly appeared in the thick fog, looking towards a certain place in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao, is it? So it really is you. In that case, let me test the strength of you, the leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord's gaze was deep and heavy.</p><p></p><p>The Mist Beast's true spirit and Yin Jue were both dead.</p><p></p><p>But according to their agreement, if the mastermind was confirmed to be one of the suspected few, they would shatter the sensing treasures accordingly.</p><p></p><p>These sensing treasures were all contained within their souls. They could be shattered with a single thought, so even if killed instantly, they could still shatter the sensing treasures in time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, besides Yin Jue, the Mist Beast's true spirit was the same.</p><p></p><p>Now, the identity of the mastermind was very clear - Xiao Yao, leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes!</p><p></p><p>"The time is about right. I, Shadow, should leave this place too."</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm Lord sank into silence. Before leaving, there were still some preparations to be made.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Shadow Realm finally began to connect with the Divine Realm. At this moment, Divine Venerable warriors from the Dao Realm also began to enter the Shadow Realm, heading towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>A surge of Dao essence, brought about by the initial fusion of the Dao Realm and Divine Realm forming changes in heaven and earth, gushed out from the Shadow Realm at this moment, pouring into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of martial arts in the Divine Realm was constantly rising, even gradually returning to the state before the great war of heaven and earth, without restrictions on the upper limit of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This was only the first step. In the time to come, this change would gradually spread to the Spirit Realm and Inner Realm, eventually reunifying heaven and earth, restoring the state of heaven and earth to what it was before the great war.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was a long process that could not be accomplished in a short time.</p><p></p><p>But the Divine Realm was the starting point for the reunification of heaven and earth, and it would inevitably bring about some huge changes. In the midst of these changes in heaven and earth, one might gain some insights or opportunities to break through bottlenecks in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why many Divine Venerable warriors from the Dao Realm entered the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Supreme realm was a major bottleneck. Countless Divine Venerable warriors were stuck below Supreme, unable to advance an inch. These Divine Venerable warriors naturally wanted to seize any possibility of breaking through.</p><p></p><p>Divine Venerables descending to the Divine Realm, besides seeking opportunities and insights to break through their own shackles, also included powerful figures from the upper sects of various forces in the Divine Realm, coming to stabilize their territories.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Miao Realm, inside the Tai Miao Divine Sect.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou's aura became increasingly dreamlike, yet with a sense of reality. It seemed to have deviated somewhat from the initial dream path, almost forging her own unique path.</p><p></p><p>In front of the statue, Xin Mengrou was silently cultivating. After returning, she had reported all of Ancestor Dao's guidance to the Tai Miao Ancestor one by one.</p><p></p><p>She had resolved the Tai Miao Ancestor's confusion. As for whether the Tai Miao Ancestor could gain insight from it, that was not for Xin Mengrou to consider - she was still far from that level.</p><p></p><p>Half a month after she reported Ancestor Dao's explanations to the Tai Miao Ancestor, the Tai Miao Ancestor unexpectedly took her as a disciple, which greatly surprised Xin Mengrou.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, Xin Mengrou's status in the Tai Miao Divine Sect suddenly increased dramatically.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As a true disciple of the Founding Master, this status was the most revered in the Taimiao Divine Sect. Even in the Dao Realm's Taimiao World, it was extremely respected.</p><p></p><p>Taimiao was an ancient minor world ruler. No one knew exactly how powerful she was, but it was almost certain that she was one of the strongest minor world rulers below the Seven Great World Rulers.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou becoming one of Taimiao's true disciples gave her an extraordinary status in the Dao Realm. Even though her current strength was still weak, even Supreme Realm experts would not dare to be arrogant or easily offend her based on their status.</p><p></p><p>Taimiao had not taken on disciples for a very long time. The fact that she suddenly accepted a disciple now showed that this disciple undoubtedly held an extraordinary position in her heart.</p><p></p><p>From being accepted as a true disciple, Xin Mengrou guessed that Master Taimiao must have had some enlightenment after receiving guidance from the Ancestor of the Dao, and should be about to break out of her predicament.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the statue suddenly opened its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Xin Mengrou hurriedly bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, you have developed your own understanding of the Dream Fantasy Dao," Taimiao's voice came.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple received guidance from the Dao Ancestor and gained some insights of my own," Xin Mengrou said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Lord of the Dao Realm has already descended to the Divine Realm. Ao Ming of the True Dragon Clan, leading the Four Supreme True Spirits, is also preparing to go to the Divine Realm. Tianshas is also making some moves..."</p><p></p><p>Taimiao informed Xin Mengrou about the news from the Dao Realm, as well as the movements in various realms and the Divine Lord's descent to the Divine Realm. The purpose was simple - to have Xin Mengrou pass this information to Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan was the disciple of the Dao Ancestor and naturally would not fear these things, being able to pass on information in advance was still a gesture of goodwill.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting the information, Taimiao gave some more guidance to Xin Mengrou, then the statue fell silent again.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou took out a communication talisman and transmitted the information she had learned to Wu Tiannan, asking him to relay it.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Dao rhyme surging from the Taihe Realm and the great changes in heaven and earth swept towards the Thirty-five Realms. The Qinghua Realm was also shaking slightly. Fang Hao was taking advantage of this cosmic trend to further enhance the Qinghua Great Array.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he was very busy.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Nine Mountains Realm, Red Cat had already returned. The three great Beast Kings gathered together with their twelve Beast Generals under them. Beastly energy rolled as they sent out the message that the Nine Mountains Realm was now beast territory.</p><p></p><p>They officially occupied the Nine Mountains Realm as beast territory.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, they personally led the beast army to sweep through the sky caves of the Nine Mountains Realm, transforming these sky caves into beast lairs and allocating them to different types of beasts to inhabit.</p><p></p><p>The twelve Beast Generals also began to break through in strength. Beastly energy rolled off their bodies. They were no longer in the form of spirit beasts as before, and their strength had already greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>They had cultivated great beast divine abilities, and their strength was no weaker than Tianhe Realm martial artists, even surpassing them somewhat.</p><p></p><p>What made these Beast Generals even more excited was that the increase in their strength would not be restricted by bloodline limitations. They would not be unable to continue improving once their bloodline reached its limit.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Red Cat led the twelve Beast Generals into the Long Cloud Realm. Beastly energy rolled as they directly carved out a territory in a large area bordering the Long Cloud Realm to serve as a buffer zone.</p><p></p><p>This naturally led to conflicts with the various forces in the Long Cloud Realm. It was through this conflict that the experts of the Divine Realm were shocked to discover how powerful the beast race had become.</p><p></p><p>Especially the Great Beast Kings, whose beastly might was overwhelming, easily suppressing three Tianhe Realm martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Finally, a large area of the Long Cloud Realm bordering the Nine Mountains Realm all became a buffer zone. The Wan family of Dacai Mountain in the Nine Mountains Realm also migrated to this area, leaving Dacai Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The Wan family had no objections to this, after all, this large area of the Long Cloud Realm was even more vast than Dacai Mountain. Moreover, becoming a buffer zone with the beast race allowed them to continue maintaining good relations with the beasts.</p><p></p><p>From this point on, the Nine Mountains Realm thoroughly became beast territory.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the Divine Realm was changing, with changes continuing to occur. Meanwhile, the Spirit Realm was also undergoing changes quietly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew of the Heavenly Dao, perceived the Heavenly Dao, and cultivated the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Holding the supreme concept of the Heavenly Dao in their hearts, perceiving the Heavenly Dao to break through their own limitations - martial arts would have no upper limit! Finally, some martial artists perceived the Heavenly Dao, had sudden enlightenment, broke through the limitations of martial arts, and stepped into the Condensing Law Realm. When this news spread, it shook the martial arts world of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>From then on, whether just starting on the path of martial arts or old-generation martial artists stuck at the Spirit Refinement Realm unable to break through, all were perceiving the Heavenly Dao and keeping the Heavenly Dao in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Even when sects accepted disciples, they would set up incense altars, burn incense to revere the Heavenly Dao, and respectfully invite the Heavenly Dao to witness the disciple acceptance ceremony.</p><p></p><p>There were even martial artists who, when making transactions, would swear oaths to the Heavenly Dao in order to gain each other's trust.</p><p></p><p>Until someone suffered punishment from the Heavenly Dao for violating a Heavenly Dao oath, everyone knew that violating a Heavenly Dao oath would incur divine punishment! As such, as long as one swore a Heavenly Dao oath, it was enough to be trusted.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short years, the entire atmosphere of the martial arts world in the Spirit Realm changed. It was no longer like it was initially, and was completely at odds with the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, concepts such as the origin of the Heavenly Dao and the Primordial Wilderness spread throughout the Spirit Realm and took root in people's hearts. Gradually, everyone considered themselves Primordial Wilderness martial artists.</p><p></p><p>One day, the gates of the Spirit Realm opened.</p><p></p><p>No! They didn't just open - the barrier between the Spirit Realm and the Inner Realm completely disappeared, thoroughly merging them together.</p><p></p><p>The Primordial Wilderness expanded! When the martial artists of the Spirit Realm stepped into what they had previously seen as the barren Inner Realm, they were immediately shocked. The Inner Realm was actually the Primordial Wilderness, the birthplace of the Heavenly Dao?</p><p></p><p>And the Holy Land of the Heavenly Dao, Canglan Island, was in the barren Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>Some Spirit Realm experts, excited beyond measure, went to Canglan Island wanting to enter the Holy Land to better perceive the Heavenly Dao. As a result, they were directly blasted back to the Spirit Realm by Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe and the others, who had already reached the Divine Ability Realm, took action one after another, shocking the experts of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts world of the Inner Realm, which considered itself the orthodox Primordial Wilderness, engaged in a duel with the martial arts world of the Spirit Realm. The result was a great victory for the Inner Realm martial arts world. From then on, the Spirit Realm also came under the jurisdiction of the Primordial Wilderness and was subject to the constraints of the Canglan Island Holy Land.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Spirit Realm also began to establish Primordial Wilderness Martial Arts Academies to teach orthodox Primordial Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Both the Inner Realm and the Spirit Realm became part of the Primordial Wilderness, and Tian Zi, as the Heavenly Dao, also gained no small harvest.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Heavenly Dao!" Tian Zi's Heavenly Dao avatar appeared on Canglan Island. He sighed endlessly in his heart, his gaze turning towards the Divine Realm. Before long, he would extend the tentacles of the Heavenly Dao towards the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, before that, he needed to operate the current Primordial Wilderness Heavenly Dao and let the operation of the Heavenly Dao rules become thoroughly perfected.</p><p></p><p>"The shackles on my body are not many left. When my Heavenly Dao operates throughout the entire world, what will it be like?" Tian Zi looked forward to it in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Ancestor said that fellow Xiao Yao is perceiving the Qi of the Heavenly Dao. If he can find a way forward because of this, it will have great significance for my Heavenly Dao and for this world."</p><p></p><p>"The other realm lords are all nourishment for the Heavenly Dao. They can quickly strengthen this world and make it vaster."</p><p></p><p>"What Tai Cang couldn't do, I, Tian Zi, can accomplish. One day, I will punish the Unmelting Divine Temple in the name of the Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>The more Tian Zi thought about it, the more excited he became, looking forward to the day when he would punish the Unmelting Divine Temple with the majestic power of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

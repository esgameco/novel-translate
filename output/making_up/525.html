        <h1>Chapter 525</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Purple Pearl was a supreme treasure, rumored to be formed from a strand of primordial purple light from the creation of the heavens.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Tianshai was so confident after obtaining this treasure, wanting to become the master of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Normally, with Tianshai's methods and the Celestial Purple Pearl as a supreme treasure, the probability of seizing control of heaven and earth and ascending to become its master was very high. </p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't fully control heaven and earth, he could at least obtain over 70% of its authority. In that case, Tianshai would become the strongest being in the Cang Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Unfortunately, Tianshai ultimately had limited knowledge of the Cang Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Cang Heavenly Realm was different from the other six major realms. Besides some arrangements Cang had made to the realm, the more important reason was the existence of Tianzi.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao, Taimiao and the others all knew about the special nature of the Cang Heavenly Realm, so they never had thoughts of obtaining authority over heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>As for Cang leaving some contingencies for later generations to become the new master of heaven and earth, those conditions were too harsh. It required obtaining Tianzi's approval, and one still couldn't become the true master of heaven and earth due to Tianzi's existence.</p><p></p><p>He was the spirit of heaven and earth, with immense authority over the realm.</p><p></p><p>Although Old Man Xiao and Yu Yao didn't know Tianzi was the spirit of heaven and earth, they knew his identity was special, as if he had a feeling of being Master Cang's son.</p><p></p><p>Cang was quite indulgent towards Tianzi.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Celestial Purple Pearl radiated purple light, and Tianshai's aura became powerful, with a special charm emerging.</p><p></p><p>At one point, the Shadow of Earth suddenly dispersed like clouds and mist, merging into heaven and earth, merging into the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai's expression was excited. The Celestial Purple Pearl was suffused with purple light, and he and the Shadow of Earth formed a kind of unified state.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth seemed to come under control, and the power of the laws surged towards the Demon Shaman Realm, pulling it to fall.</p><p></p><p>Tianshai wanted to use the power of the Demon Shaman Realm to control more of the laws of heaven and earth. With the aid of the Celestial Purple Pearl, as a crisis in heaven and earth emerged, the laws of heaven and earth would not reject his control.</p><p></p><p>Because this could resolve the crisis.</p><p></p><p>This was also Tianshai's opportunity, although it was rushed this time and would inevitably cause a great calamity in heaven and earth, with countless lives lost.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as he became the master of heaven and earth, it would all be worth it. He would have the confidence to confront that mysterious powerful being!</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth shook, and the laws appeared. Looking up, one could seemingly see rules surrounding heaven and earth, being controlled by a force.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Purple Pearl emitted purple light, suffused with the charm of the Dao, as the Shadow of Earth dispersed into the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Shaman Realm had already touched the barrier of the Cang Heavenly Realm. The entire realm began to shake. The laws of Cang radiated light, wanting to shatter the Demon Shaman Realm.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Demon Shaman Realm seemed to be stimulated. Its laws surged as if about to pour out, releasing a powerful striking force.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A faint purple halo emerged from the laws of the Cang Heavenly Realm. The power of the laws gathered, transforming into a giant blade.</p><p></p><p>The aura around Tianshai grew stronger and stronger, as if the authority of heaven and earth was merging into his soul.</p><p></p><p>"Slash!" </p><p></p><p>Tianshai roared, wanting to use the laws of the Cang Heavenly Realm to slash apart the Demon Shaman Realm. As long as the Demon Shaman Realm was shattered, even if it fell into the Cang Heavenly Realm, the damage would be greatly reduced.</p><p></p><p>However, just as the laws of Cang transformed into a giant blade slashing towards the Demon Shaman Realm, Tianshai was shocked to discover that the laws of heaven and earth seemed to undergo some kind of change in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they gradually slipped from his control.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>The Demon Shaman Realm crashed into the barrier of Cang, about to collide with the Cang Heavenly Realm. At this moment, a vast and mighty power emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Cang Heavenly Realm seemed somewhat different.</p><p></p><p>The laws seemed to have changed. In a daze, it was as if heaven and earth were no longer in the same state as before.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai turned pale with fright. He completely lost control of the laws of heaven and earth. What shocked him even more was that he lost his connection to the Shadow of Earth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if it had perished! The authority of heaven and earth that had originally merged into his soul had disappeared. The familiar laws of heaven and earth had become unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>That no longer seemed to be laws, but rather rules that were more powerful and harder to comprehend than the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It also contained supreme and majestic heavenly might.</p><p></p><p>Thud! The Demon Shaman Realm crashed in, but it was as if it had crashed into a huge vortex, or rather into a huge mouth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed not that the Demon Shaman Realm was crashing into the Cang Heavenly Realm, but more like the Cang Heavenly Realm was devouring the Demon Shaman Realm.</p><p></p><p>All the realm lords were stunned, and even felt a bit scared.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth had become unfamiliar, with a sense that they could not be offended, and a majestic heavenly might that would punish those who defied them!</p><p></p><p>"I still have a chance!"</p><p></p><p>Tianshai was unwilling to give up. He looked towards the Celestial Purple Pearl.</p><p></p><p>His aura surged as he infused power into the Celestial Purple Pearl. He wanted to activate this supreme treasure to reclaim the authority of heaven and earth that should have belonged to him.</p><p></p><p>The light of the Celestial Purple Pearl grew brighter and brighter. Tianshai had already infused 80% of his powerful strength, consuming a huge amount.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, the immense power contained in the Celestial Purple Pearl was enough to break through the current situation and create an opportunity for him.</p><p></p><p>Just as Tianshai was about to activate the Celestial Purple Pearl and strike with all his might, something shocking happened again.</p><p></p><p>The Celestial Purple Pearl lost control and slipped from his grasp, transforming into a beam of purple light that vanished into the sky.</p><p></p><p>In this situation, Tianshai had a sad feeling of being used by the Celestial Purple Pearl, which had taken his powerful energy and then left him.</p><p></p><p>The Demon Shaman Realm continued to fall, while the Cang Heavenly Realm was also undergoing changes. The Dao Realm was no longer above the Divine Realm, and the Three Hundred Realms were also changing, losing their status as small worlds and completely merging with the Cang Heavenly Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the Demon Shaman Realm was broken, it still contained powerful energy.</p><p></p><p>Its unstoppable momentum as it crashed in could not be blocked. Even though the Cang Heavenly Realm was devouring and eroding the Demon Shaman Realm, it could not resolve this crisis in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>"I can't control it anymore, it's going to crash in!"</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, all the realm lords seemed to hear a frustrated voice ring out.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, everyone watched this scene and sensed the changes in heaven and earth. Old Man Xiao had a look of shock and astonishment.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>He sensed the existence of the Heavenly Dao. The original laws of Cang had transformed into the Heavenly Dao. This realm had already undergone changes.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Dao has been born. From now on, heaven and earth have the Heavenly Dao!" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao was puzzled. What was the Heavenly Dao? What was going on with the Heavenly Dao? But this was not the time to ask about these doubts.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the Cang Heavenly Realm was devouring the Demon Shaman Realm, but the crashing force was too great. It would still crash into the Cang Heavenly Realm and still cause a significant calamity.</p><p></p><p>"The collision and fusion of realms, the mutual generation of yin and yang, is not a bad thing."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled slightly and waved his hand. The Cang Heavenly Realm suddenly changed. The wilderness of the 36 levels of the Divine Realm instantly merged together, appearing where the Demon Shaman Realm was falling.</p><p></p><p>The few living beings in the wilderness were all moved out.</p><p></p><p>When the Demon Shaman Realm crashed in, it would not cause much harm to life.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Something terrible happened to Ling Tutan.</p><p></p><p>No one understood the Taicang world and the Heavenly Dao better than Li Xuan. Although he was not the master of this world, his control over it would amaze even Taicang if he returned.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Wumo world crashed into the earth, continuously breaking apart and being consumed in the process. The principles of the Wumo world were constantly being devoured and absorbed.</p><p></p><p>The Taicang world shook, purple light surged forth, as if yin and yang were being born anew. It seemed new life was emerging, and one could see the differences between all things in these two worlds.</p><p></p><p>This was an unprecedented sight - worlds colliding and merging, yin and yang intermingling. The Wumo world kept falling as this world underwent transformation. </p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao was in motion, digesting all of this, seemingly using the Wumo world to create the underworld.</p><p></p><p>The myriad things of yin and yang were all different, cycling in an endless loop like reincarnation! Xu Yan watched as the worlds merged, yin and yang intermingled, all things differed, and new life was born. It was like witnessing the creation of the world.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, inspiration flashed in his mind. All sorts of insights about the Realm of Creation surfaced in his thoughts.</p><p></p><p>He sat down cross-legged and began to quietly contemplate.</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao watched this scene and sensed the Heavenly Dao. He vaguely gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>He immediately sat down cross-legged as well, seizing this opportunity to comprehend the profound mysteries.</p><p></p><p>As the worlds merged and yin and yang separated, this unprecedented event allowed any martial artist with talent and decent comprehension ability to gain insights.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xu Yan, feeling extremely excited. Was he finally going to fully comprehend the Realm of Creation? Li Xuan himself was not far from breaking through to that realm.</p><p></p><p>The collision of the Wumo world, the great changes to this world, and the separation of yin and yang - this process could not be completed or concluded in a short time.</p><p></p><p>As the world continued to be in turmoil, many martial artists, including those realm lords, were all in deep contemplation. </p><p></p><p>This was a great opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Even in the original domain realms, Taikun and Taihe couldn't help but sense this scene and became immersed in it.</p><p></p><p>In their trance-like state, they felt as if they were seeing that beam of world-creating purple light.</p><p></p><p>Although it was far inferior to the actual world-creating purple light, it was still the most profound sight they had ever seen in their lives, second only to that light.</p><p></p><p>The Taicang world was undergoing enormous changes. The power of the entire world was increasing.</p><p></p><p>The world was also expanding. As it merged with the remnants of the Wumo world, principles that did not belong to the Taicang world were being integrated.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao was in motion, separating yin and yang, transforming the world, and beginning to give birth to new life forms.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was also trembling slightly, but gradually calmed down. At this moment, all martial artists of the Great Wilderness had a feeling that their world had expanded.</p><p></p><p>They even felt as if they were the first generation of Great Wilderness martial artists, blessed with the world's favor. Their cultivation speed increased, it became easier to comprehend martial arts, and the price they had to pay for using powerful secret techniques decreased.</p><p></p><p>The world's spiritual energy was increasing, the grade of spiritual herbs was rising, and new, unfamiliar types of spiritual herbs were emerging.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently observed the changes in the world, watching his disciple and others in contemplation, and Tianzi busy at work. An expectant smile appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>The merging of worlds, separation of yin and yang, and birth of life - everything was so profound. This was the essence of the Dao, the true meaning of the Way.</p><p></p><p>"The Realm of Creation is not far off," Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan would understand the methods of the Realm of Creation through this contemplation.</p><p></p><p>"Yin and yang, reincarnation... this world is becoming more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched the world's transformation.</p><p></p><p>The Wumo world fell and became the underworld, merging with the Taicang world to form a new world.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness world now had yin and yang, and the order of reincarnation would gradually be established.</p><p></p><p>Although this was a long process, it would eventually be completed.</p><p></p><p>Looking up beyond the world, the violent spiritual energy and unchanging qi from the primordial chaos were being swept into the world, transforming into gentle spiritual energy and the yin energy of the underworld.</p><p></p><p>The 300 realms of the domain had already changed in appearance. They were no longer small worlds, but seemed to have become secret realms within the world.</p><p></p><p>"Let's call them Grotto-heavens. The 300 Grotto-heavens of the Great Wilderness, for the capable to reside in," Li Xuan said with a smile, clearly defining the 300 realms.</p><p></p><p>The 300 Grotto-heavens of the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the number of Grotto-heavens will increase in the future. 360 Grotto-heavens would be about right."</p><p></p><p>As the world continued to change, Tianzi was so busy he didn't have time to deceive Blood Demon. To prevent Blood Demon from noticing anything unusual, Tianzi tricked him into undergoing a transformation, sealing off his five senses and putting him in a state of "closed-door cultivation."</p><p></p><p>The Bihai Realm had now become a boundless ocean, connected to the original spirit realm's Bihai.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the vastness of Bihai was no longer what it once was.</p><p></p><p>It was even more vast and boundless than the ancient Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle cautiously poked its head out of the sea, looking towards the sky and beyond the world.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were filled with shock. The Taicang world was constantly changing, becoming unrecognizable.</p><p></p><p>Just as it came to its senses after the merging of worlds and separation of yin and yang, the amazement in the Sea Turtle's eyes couldn't be calmed for a long time.</p><p></p><p>This scene of worlds merging was like when Hongze created the world, only it seemed even more profound and mysterious than when Hongze did it.</p><p></p><p>"Why are there such changes? How did the Wumo world crash into Taicang and merge with it?"</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel that the world's principles seem a bit off? It gives me a sense of awe-inspiring heavenly authority that cannot be defied."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle's gaze was solemn and puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Is this Taicang's plan and backup?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, there's no use in thinking too much. I'll continue hiding for now and find Xu Yan when the time is right. These changes seem to be related to him."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Turtle hid once again at the bottom of the Bihai sea.</p><p></p><p>It had heard Meiwu's crazed, murderous roar, and shortly after, such great changes occurred in the world. The Sea Turtle absolutely didn't believe this had nothing to do with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and the world's tremors slowly weakened. The new world structure was about to stabilize.</p><p></p><p>This was the Great Wilderness world, and the Great Wilderness had its Heavenly Dao!</p><p></p><p>"I'm exhausted!" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi's face showed extreme fatigue, but his eyes were incredibly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao was now operating the entire world, and just as planned, the world had been divided into yin and yang.</p><p></p><p>This was a beginning, the beginning of a transformation, and the beginning of the Heavenly Dao's advance towards the unchanging realm.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang, your world will be mine from now on. This is the Great Wilderness world. Those bastards from the Unchanging Divine Palace who dare to covet my world must die!"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Heavenly Dao, supreme and unmatched. I will let those who defy the Heavenly Dao see what the power of the Heavenly Dao truly is."</p><p></p><p>"I will make the Unchanging Divine Palace feel the majesty of the Heavenly Dao and suffer its punishment. I will avenge you!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi silently said in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

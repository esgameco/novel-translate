        <h1>Chapter 275</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Hung Zhai-zhu's face was gloomy. The other party's strength was so powerful that it suppressed him. The remnant power of the Wanxing was truly not to be underestimated!</p><p></p><p>"Which one of the Wanxing remnants are you, sir?"</p><p></p><p>Hung Zhai-zhu struck out sword after sword, but they were all blocked by the old man.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance Master heaved a sigh of relief. It turned out to be a surviving powerful cultivator from the Wanxing Martial Dao Academy who came to assist. He cupped his hands and said, "Thank you, senior, for your assistance!"</p><p></p><p>He then turned around and charged towards an elder of the Sword Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The old man tapped his cane, and the crescent moon wheel behind him grew brighter, though it was still incomplete.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The moonlight-like radiance poured down, and Hung Zhai-zhu's sword light seemed to be weakened, losing its sharpness and becoming gentler.</p><p></p><p>Hung Zhai-zhu's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>However, a sickly redness appeared on the old man's face, indicating that the power he was exerting was an immense burden for him.</p><p></p><p>"If you possess such strength, could you be one of the Thirty-Six Elites of Wanxing?" </p><p></p><p>Hung Zhai-zhu said with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>The Wanxing Martial Dao Academy's most renowned were the Thirty-Six Elites, each of whom was a talented cultivator with a spiritual body, capable of contending with the geniuses of the Superb Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, he, the moon shining in the sky, the eternal bright moon, the Spiritual Body of the Clear Moon - truly extraordinary. Even though his Spiritual Body was once shattered, unexpectedly, not only has he not been ruined, but he has become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"I must say, Moon Zhao-ming, you are quite a character!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a cold and arrogant voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Along with the voice came a long spear, which slammed towards Moon Zhao-ming, almost shattering his cane, causing him to stagger back.</p><p></p><p>The incomplete crescent moon behind him trembled, as if it was about to collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Moon Zhao-ming's expression changed, and he retreated, looking at the newcomer with a gloomy face, and said in a low voice, "Huang Liang, is that you!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's me!" </p><p></p><p>The newcomer held a long spear, with a yellow beard on his face, his gaze indifferent but containing a murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Huang, why have you come?" </p><p></p><p>Hung Zhai-zhu hurriedly cupped his hands in greeting.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang said indifferently, "I heard that there is a talented cultivator named Xu Yan among the wandering cultivators, whose sword dao is extraordinary. After some investigation, I found that the sword dao he cultivates is the secret technique stolen from my Qianwu Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I have come to slay the thief and reclaim the secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>Hung Zhai-zhu nodded, "I see."</p><p></p><p>The sword techniques of the Sword Pavilion were stolen from the Qianwu Hall, so they were the stolen secret techniques of the Qianwu Hall as well.</p><p></p><p>"Shameless! Your Qianwu Hall is still so shameless!" </p><p></p><p>Moon Zhao-ming sneered angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Wretched dog, you have no right to speak! Today, I shall slay you, the wretched dog!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang said, raising his long spear. Suddenly, a mighty and grand power surged into the spear, causing the space around it to ripple, as if the grand power had stirred the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>A majestic aura like that of the heavens and earth emanated from Huang Liang, and a faint golden light appeared around him. Hung Zhai-zhu felt his body weighed down, as if pressed by a great mountain.</p><p></p><p>His expression changed in alarm, and he hastily retreated.</p><p></p><p>So this is the might of a supreme cultivator of the Superb Spiritual Sect?</p><p></p><p>"Do you see? This is the power of a supreme cultivator of the Superb Spiritual Sect. How can a wandering cultivator like you understand it? In the past, my senior uncle used this power to shatter your Spiritual Body, and today I shall completely annihilate you!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang coldly stared at Moon Zhao-ming.</p><p></p><p>Moon Zhao-ming's face changed drastically. His expression was gloomy, his eyes filled with anger, resentment, and a deep sense of powerlessness.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Superb Spiritual Sect was beyond his imagination.</p><p></p><p>"I never thought, Huang Liang, that you, a waste, could become such a powerful cultivator!" </p><p></p><p>Moon Zhao-ming said self-mockingly.</p><p></p><p>The person he once looked down upon had now become a supreme cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Zhao-ming, it is you who is the waste now," Huang Liang said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Moon Shining in the Sky? What a joke, you should disappear now!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang thrust out his spear, a strike infused with the grand power of the heavens and earth. Before the spear light reached him, Moon Zhao-ming was already coughing up blood, his body staggering back, his physical form seemingly cracking.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the power of a supreme cultivator. The one I couldn't resist back then, and now I can't resist this either!"</p><p></p><p>Moon Zhao-ming felt deeply powerless.</p><p></p><p>Back then, it was a supreme cultivator of the Qianwu Hall who struck, and his teacher couldn't withstand it, and his Spiritual Body was shattered. Now, he also couldn't withstand this strike.</p><p></p><p>Facing this attack, Moon Zhao-ming finally realized the terrifying nature of it, the grand power of the heavens and earth infused within.</p><p></p><p>"That person's techniques may be grand, but they can't withstand this strike!"</p><p></p><p>An image flashed in Moon Zhao-ming's mind - the powerful killing techniques displayed by the young man on the back of the big cat.</p><p></p><p>Powerful as they were, majestic as the descending dragon of the heavens and earth, they could not withstand this spear strike infused with the grand power of the heavens and earth. This was the might of a supreme cultivator of the Superb Spiritual Sect!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Moon Zhao-ming's expression turned grave, his gaze cold and fierce. "Huang Liang, you waste, I, Moon Zhao-ming, may die at the hands of a child, but I will not die by your hands. You are not worthy!"</p><p></p><p>He roared, and the incomplete crescent moon suddenly flew out from his body, as if it had transformed into a true crescent moon.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, his broken cane shattered, and a powerful force surged out from Moon Zhao-ming's body, infusing into the crescent moon.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The crescent moon suddenly erupted with tremendous power, instantly exploding in a blinding light that illuminated the surroundings, also blocking Huang Liang's spear strike for a moment.</p><p></p><p>When the light faded, Moon Zhao-ming was no longer in his original spot.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang snorted coldly, "Moon Zhao-ming, I never expected you to cultivate the power of your Spiritual Body to this extent. Now that you've used the essence of your Spiritual Body to block me for a moment, you are completely ruined. </p><p></p><p>"You won't live much longer. The Moon Shining in the Sky has truly disappeared!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang did not pursue Moon Zhao-ming. Even if he did, he might not be able to catch up for the time being, since Moon Zhao-ming was now ruined.</p><p></p><p>His indifferent gaze turned to the group of wandering cultivators from the Wanxing Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Lowly wandering cultivators, daring to defy me? You shall be executed!"</p><p></p><p>He swung his spear, and in an instant, two Cultivators at the Refinement Celestial realm were killed.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, run!" </p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance Master's eyes were bloodshot.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang was too powerful. Facing him, Cultivators at the Refinement Celestial realm were like children facing Cultivators at the Refinement Celestial realm - the difference in strength was heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>The supreme cultivator of the Superb Spiritual Sect! "Run? Let's see how many of you can escape!"</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang's expression remained indifferent as he took a step forward, his spear thrusting out with a force as heavy as a mountain, pinning the fleeing Refinement Celestial Cultivators in place. By the time they broke free of the oppressive force, the spear light had already annihilated them.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance Master roared, charging towards Huang Liang with two other peak Refinement Celestial Cultivators, directly burning their spiritual blood to unleash their most powerful secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>It was just to delay Huang Liang for a moment, to give the others a chance to escape!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Wanxing Alliance was nearly wiped out, the Luozhou Alliance Master...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The powerful cultivators were all killed in battle.</p><p></p><p>Only a few escaped cultivation practitioners managed to flee.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang held a gun in his hand, looking towards the Yuzhou region, and indifferently said, "I must go and retrieve the secret sword techniques that belong to my Thousand Martial Hall!"</p><p></p><p>He stepped towards Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, what's wrong, Grandpa, don't scare me!" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er saw her grandfather's pale and weak condition, and tears streamed down her face.</p><p></p><p>She hurriedly took out some spiritual herbs and fed them to her grandfather.</p><p></p><p>"Yue'er, quickly leave, don't come out before you reach the Refining Spirit realm, or retreat far into the Azure Sea, Grandpa won't last much longer!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming said weakly.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er hurriedly carried her grandfather on her back and fled into the mountains, wiping her tears as she asked, "Grandpa, who hurt you? I must avenge you!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming stroked her head, his eyes full of doting, and said, "Yue'er, don't be obsessed, just focus on your cultivation, as long as you are happy."</p><p></p><p>"No, without you, Grandpa, I won't be happy if I don't avenge you."</p><p></p><p>"Cough cough... Grandpa can still hold on for a few more years, I won't die yet!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming coughed a few times and then said, "Yue'er, take Grandpa to that cave, when Grandpa is healing, go find Xu Yan and tell him that the strongest of the Thousand Martial Hall are coming to seize his sword techniques, shamefully claiming that he stole the Thousand Martial Hall's secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Tell him to quickly flee far into the Azure Sea, that's his only chance of survival."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er bit her lip and said, "I understand, Grandpa, those bastards of the Thousand Martial Hall, I will definitely kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming let out a bitter laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Yue'er, promise Grandpa that before you become an ultimate expert, you won't expose your identity or take action!"</p><p></p><p>"Grandpa, I know!" </p><p></p><p>Yue'er nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the manor, it was as peaceful as usual.</p><p></p><p>Neither Li Xuan nor Xu Yan and the others had ever imagined that the Thousand Martial Hall would be so shameless as to come and seize the sword techniques, even falsely claiming that Xu Yan had stolen their secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>"This principle of heaven and earth is truly profound, I've only recorded it, but I haven't been able to apply it. With the strength of the Spirit Origin realm, it's impossible to use the principle of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"If it's the Spirit Dao realm, with my understanding of the principle of heaven and earth, I should be able to use it.</p><p></p><p>"The realm above Spirit Dao is to control the principle of heaven and earth for one's own use, it's about time I finished compiling it, it's just that Xu Yan hasn't yet realized the Spirit Dao martial art technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Who exactly wrote the Taisuang Book? To be able to depict the principle of heaven and earth of the Taisuang Realm, what kind of strength and realm is required to accomplish this.</p><p></p><p>"From my current understanding, the Spirit Realm does not possess such powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the Spirit Realm is just one of the domains of the Taisuang Realm. I can't help but feel that the Taisuang Realm seems to be divided into several regions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but become curious.</p><p></p><p>The Taisuang Book, which Meng Chong obtained in the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace, is such a precious treasure, why would it be in this remote frontier?</p><p></p><p>And who was the one who compiled this Taisuang Book?</p><p></p><p>"It's good this way, the Taisuang Book is in my hands, which is beneficial for me to compile martial arts, and with the Taisuang Book as a reference, the martial arts I compile will be even more likely to surpass the Taisuang martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was memorizing the eighth page of the Taisuang Book.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao's strength has also improved, his progress is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu were also about to break through, and Xu Yan was not far from reaching the Spirit Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was contemplating the Wisdom Sword realm, the more he contemplated, the more profound it seemed, and he couldn't help but sigh, the third realm of the Sword Dao is truly profound and abstruse, not something his current self can comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"The master is right, if I refine my spiritual soul, perhaps I would be able to comprehend the Wisdom Sword realm."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan continued to contemplate the Spirit Dao martial art.</p><p></p><p>After all this time, he has already comprehended the martial art of the Spirit Origin realm, but the Spirit Dao technique is still something he has not been able to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Dao is about refining the spiritual soul, and once the spiritual soul is formed, the Spirit Dao will naturally arise... How can I make the Spirit Dao naturally arise?"</p><p></p><p>This is the most difficult part to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>The refinement of the spiritual soul lies in the fusion of the Spirit Origin and Spirit Dao, which then undergoes a transformation and forms the spiritual soul, and the physical body will also become stronger due to the refinement of the spiritual soul.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Origin will also undergo a transformation and rise to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's mind, the diagram of the principle of heaven and earth appeared, this was something the master had passed on to them, allowing them to contemplate it whenever they had the time, and with deeper contemplation, he has also gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the image of the master reading a book appeared in Xu Yan's mind, as well as the master's casual and natural demeanor when walking, even though he was an unparalleled expert, he had an air of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>"The Tao follows nature? Return to the original and simple..."</p><p></p><p>In his mind, the scene of the master unleashing his power during the battle of the geniuses also appeared, the great momentum of heaven and earth was mobilized, a grand formation arose with a single thought, how magnificent was that? This was merely the master suppressing his realm and unleashing it, afraid that it would be too profound for the fourth disciple to gain any insights from.</p><p></p><p>"The great momentum of heaven and earth, when it is not mobilized, is imperceptible, invisible, yet it exists between heaven and earth... The spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth is also invisible, but in the depths, one can still sense its existence.</p><p></p><p>"Because there is the spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth, it allows cultivators to cultivate, allows the spiritual energy to be mild, and allows cultivators to refine the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"The principle of heaven and earth is even more unfathomable, difficult to comprehend, and difficult to control, this is the primal rule power of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"If one can utilize the principle of heaven and earth, then that would be truly grasping the mighty power of heaven and earth, what a realm is that?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deep in thought, contemplating.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth have principles, does martial dao also have principles? If cultivators are like heaven and earth, can cultivators also refine principles?"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, a flash of insight appeared in Xu Yan's mind.</p><p></p><p>"That's it, Spirit Dao!"</p><p></p><p>He suddenly became excited and exhilarated.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit Dao realm, refining the spiritual soul, the Spirit Dao naturally arising, isn't this the principle of martial dao? The principle of heaven and earth is the rule power of heaven and earth, all things in the world are within it;</p><p></p><p>"And Spirit Dao is the principle of one's own martial dao, it is the principle of martial dao, it is one's own principle.</p><p></p><p>"Martial dao has no limits, the Spirit Dao naturally arising, means the birth of one's own martial dao principle, continuing to cultivate, one day, one will transcend heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"No longer bound by heaven and earth, no longer constrained by heaven and earth, is this the peak of martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited, he felt that he had finally understood the essence of the Spirit Dao martial art.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Dao naturally arising, means the birth of one's own martial dao principle.</p><p></p><p>"The master resides in heaven and earth, yet heaven and earth do not know the master, so the master has already transcended heaven and earth, at the peak of martial dao, almost reaching the great Tao?" It must be so, that's why the master's every move, though seemingly ordinary and simple, has already returned to the original and simple, because the master has transcended heaven and earth, no longer bound by the constraints of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's face revealed an excited expression, then he took a deep breath and calmed his mind, carefully contemplating the Spirit Dao martial art, he has already grasped the cultivation of the Spirit Dao realm, he just needs to refine and perfect it, and he will be able to completely comprehend the Spirit Dao martial art!

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 113 The Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber, Splitting True Qi</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his second disciple, full of expectation, hoping that Meng Chong would comprehend a powerful saber cultivation technique, cultivating the saber with his heart and nurturing the saber's spirit.</p><p></p><p>Cultivating a trump card, a powerful hidden ace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was standing aside, also fell into deep contemplation. Although his master spoke of saber cultivation, of nurturing the saber with one's heart and spirit, he cultivated the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, by drawing an analogy, he also had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>"To have a trump card, a hidden ace that one would not use unless absolutely necessary, this trump card, this hidden ace, once unleashed, can surpass one's own abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slowly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"How can a martial artist not have a hidden ace? Only that which can surpass one's own abilities can be considered a true hidden ace, which can turn danger into safety in times of crisis.</p><p></p><p>"You have the intention to cultivate the saber, wanting to keep a lethal move for yourself, the idea is very good," Li Xuan praised.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were both invigorated, their master was imparting precious martial dao experiences, which they must remember well.</p><p></p><p>"A martial artist must have a hidden ace!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought of his battle with the Blood Spirit Immortal, if he had not succeeded in saber cultivation, how could he have turned the tide and slain his opponent? That one saber strike could be considered his hidden ace!</p><p></p><p>"You have already entered the Saber Dao, today I shall impart to you the second realm of the Saber Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan solemnly said: "The second realm of the Sword Dao is the Heart Sword Realm, where all things can become the sword; while the second realm of the Saber Dao is the Concealed Saber Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Concealed Saber Realm!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened respectfully, but his face showed confusion.</p><p></p><p>The second realm of the Sword Dao is the Heart Sword Realm, where the sword resides in the heart, and all things can become the sword.</p><p></p><p>Why then, is the second realm of the Saber Dao the Concealed Saber Realm?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said in a deep voice: "The Concealed Saber Realm, the saber is concealed within Heaven and Earth, there is no place in Heaven and Earth where there is no saber; Heaven and Earth is concealed within the saber, and I alone can establish Heaven and Earth with a single saber!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was shaken, murmuring to himself: "The saber is concealed within Heaven and Earth, there is no place in Heaven and Earth where there is no saber? Heaven and Earth is concealed within the saber, and I alone can establish Heaven and Earth with a single saber?"</p><p></p><p>He felt a domineering and overbearing aura from this.</p><p></p><p>There is no place in the world where there is no saber?!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan solemnly said: "You must comprehend the Dao within it, to conceal is not to conceal, to conceal is also to conceal, it is to conceal the sharp edge and not reveal it, as well as to conceal the saber within the heart, to conceal the saber within Heaven and Earth, to conceal Heaven and Earth within the saber.</p><p></p><p>"Once you comprehend it, how vast is Heaven and Earth, where can you not go? Where is there no saber that you can use?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was shaken, feeling that it was too profound.</p><p></p><p>When will he be able to comprehend the second realm of the Saber Dao?</p><p></p><p>Given his current realm, it seemed too distant.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple will remember it well!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also fell into deep contemplation, to conceal the sword within Heaven and Earth? It has a similar yet different meaning compared to the Sword Dao's all things can become the sword.</p><p></p><p>"Can I also conceal the sword within Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at his eldest disciple, "The Sword Dao is a Dao, the Saber Dao is also a Dao, continue to ponder and comprehend, you will surely have realizations."</p><p></p><p>These words were actually said for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Given Xu Yan's prodigious talent and powerful imagination, he might be able to comprehend something new.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong respectfully bowed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and a serrated saber appeared in his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"The second realm of the Saber Dao is too distant for you, today I shall impart to you the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was immediately excited.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber!</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gripped the serrated saber, his true qi circulating, the perfected domineering saber intent gathered, he raised his hand and struck out with a saber, the saber light traversing the vast sky, as if tearing apart Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>A single saber strike, dominating Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>To give his disciples space for realization, Li Xuan unleashed this strike with his full strength, infusing the perfected domineering saber intent with a trace of the ruthless and merciless sword intent that could overturn mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>He displayed this saber strike with an ability far surpassing Meng Chong and Xu Yan, naturally it was unparalleled in its domination, shocking the two disciples.</p><p></p><p>After the demonstration, Li Xuan inserted the saber into the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This saber strike, I displayed it with an ability almost equal to yours, this is the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber, a single saber strike dominating Heaven and Earth!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan emphasized, the saber strike he just displayed was based on Meng Chong's current ability.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying saber strike, was displayed with an ability almost equal to his own?</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber was truly powerful beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>That domineering aura that overawed Heaven and Earth had already deeply imprinted itself in his mind, under this saber strike, Meng Chong felt utterly insignificant.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, your disciple will ponder it carefully!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked away with his hands behind his back, in a leisurely and carefree manner, "Mm, ponder it well."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched his master leave leisurely, sighing inwardly: "Master's realm is too high, he can casually unleash it, wielding it freely, every action and movement contains the profound principles of the Dao of nature.</p><p></p><p>"Watching Master walk, so leisurely and unrestrained, with a great sense of freedom, when will I be able to reach such a realm?"</p><p></p><p>After imparting the second realm of the Saber Dao to Meng Chong, Li Xuan began to ponder the realms beyond the Profound Enlightenment Realm, how to compose them, how to refine the cultivation theories.</p><p></p><p>And to make it connect with the Profound Enlightenment Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was cultivating the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber, for the moment, he had not comprehended much.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took the Qi Blood Pill refined by Su Lingxiu and returned to the Eastern River Commandery, as well as going to the capital of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan knew that with his family's martial dao entry secured, Xu Yan was eager to venture into the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was cultivating and refining pills, she was tempering the Golden Bone, and the completion of the Golden Bone was not too far away.</p><p></p><p>Apart from pill refining and cultivation, she continued to ponder the Dao of Medicine, also beginning to comprehend the Golden Needle Technique, expanding upon the foundation of the Medicinal Classic.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally succeeded in refining it."</p><p></p><p>On this day, Su Lingxiu was greatly excited, the Evergreen Pill she had created was finally refined. With this pill, she felt her chances of tempering the Evergreen Bone had greatly increased.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also in a good mood, if Su Lingxiu could temper the Evergreen Bone, his harvest would be even greater. Jade Bone + Golden Diamond Bone + Evergreen Bone, what kind of transformation would it undergo?</p><p></p><p>It would definitely be stronger than the current Innate Spiritual Bone.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, Meng Chong gripped the precious saber, striking out one saber strike after another, the domineering aura of the Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber displayed by his master surfacing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>In the vast Heaven and Earth, only that one strike, the overbearing and domineering figure that overawed the world, and that one saber strike, as if tearing apart the heavens.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Earth Dominating Saber lies in the aura of dominating Heaven and Earth, the overbearing and domineering attitude that overawes the world, but I still lack something, my saber intent is already unparalleled in its domination, but compared to that saber strike of my master's, it is still far behind."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong contemplated, "My elder brother said, every word and action of my master conforms to the Dao, containing the profound principles of the Dao, I must observe and ponder more."</p><p></p><p>The image of his master surfaced in his mind, his steps leisurely, his bearing unrestrained, but on that day, when his master unleashed his strike, it was unparalleled in its domination, as if Heaven and Earth only had that one saber.</p><p></p><p>From leisurely and unrestrained, in an instant it became overbearing and domineering, with an aura of dominating Heaven and Earth, freely wielding it, no wonder his elder brother said his master was already close to the Dao.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong closed his eyes, at this moment, the saber spirit became clear, the image of that saber strike surfacing in his mind, becoming increasingly distinct.</p><p></p><p>That aura of dominating the world, of slashing through the heavens, was gradually manifesting within him.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden light of jade flashed, the image of a golden bell appeared, the precious sword trembled, a powerful sword intent surrounded the area, the falling leaves were crushed into dust before they even reached the ground.</p><p></p><p>Clang!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong opened his eyes, drew his sword and slashed, an unparalleled sword light sliced through the sky, as if it was about to tear the heavens apart!</p><p></p><p>Slash after slash, Meng Chong was immersed in his enlightenment, at this moment the sword light swept across the four directions, the domineering and unmatched sword intent gradually merged into the sword light.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, when Meng Chong unleashed a sword strike, the heavens and earth seemed to lose their color.</p><p></p><p>The might of this sword strike was no weaker than the one he unleashed when his sword soul awakened. It charged forward unstoppably, domineering and unmatched!</p><p></p><p>Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword!</p><p></p><p>"I have mastered the Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed, at this moment his understanding of the sword had reached an extremely high realm.</p><p></p><p>"Next, what I need to do is to release and retract at will, be carefree and unrestrained, and unleash a domineering sword strike effortlessly, only then can I truly be in the state a martial artist should be in.</p><p></p><p>"The foundation of the second realm of the Dao of the Sword should also lie in this, only by achieving the ability to release and retract at will, to conceal the sword and not reveal it, can I further comprehend the realm of concealing the sword."</p><p></p><p>After enlightening the Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword, Meng Chong's strength had increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>He continued to cultivate the Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword on the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, who was pondering how to compile a cultivation method beyond the Profound Realm, suddenly saw the golden light appear.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has successfully cultivated the Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword you compiled, your Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword has reached completion!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, Meng Chong had comprehended it so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword is truly domineering."</p><p></p><p>It was relying on his strength, which far surpassed Meng Chong's, that he was able to unleash that unparalleled domineering sword strike, but it was actually without the intent of the Domineering Sword.</p><p></p><p>While the one Meng Chong had comprehended was the true Heavenly Earth Domineering Sword.</p><p></p><p>If he were to unleash that sword strike now, its power would be nearly ten times stronger than the one he had demonstrated.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Donghe Prefecture, in the Xu family's residence.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and his parents were having a meal, although after breaking through to the Xiantian Realm, he only needed to breathe in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth to maintain his peak condition, and did not need to eat.</p><p></p><p>However, this meal had a different meaning, it was the warmth of home, since he had started cultivating the martial dao, he had not dined with his parents for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he would soon be going to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, don't worry, mother has the pills you gave me, I will be able to enter the path soon."</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he seemed a bit distracted, Xu's mother thought her precious son was worried about her cultivation, so she comforted him.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, I may have to leave for a while."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his head and said to his mother.</p><p></p><p>From childhood until now, although he had gone out many times to seek out experts, the time he spent away from home was never too long, except for that period when he cultivated in the small mountain village.</p><p></p><p>This time going to the Inner Realm, it might be more than half a year before he returned.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, you've grown up and become a martial arts expert, just be careful outside, don't worry about home, your father and I are also martial artists, and there's also Old Pan and the guards, nothing will happen."</p><p></p><p>Knowing his son well, Xu Junhe immediately understood that his son wanted to go out and make his mark.</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother's eyes reddened, she got up and went back to the bedroom, bringing out a package.</p><p></p><p>"This is the clothes I sewed for you, be careful outside, don't lose your vigilance just because you have strength..."</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother kept rambling on.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held the package in his hands, listening to his mother's rambling, and when she finally finished, he said, "Mother, don't worry, my strength is far beyond that of an ordinary sect master, I won't be in any danger.</p><p></p><p>"And Xie Lingfeng has a formidable reputation in the Inner Realm, if I encounter any trouble, I'll just mention his name."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had said that no matter what happened in the Inner Realm, he could mention his name.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan kept this in mind.</p><p></p><p>"Mother, this time when I go to the Inner Realm, I'll definitely buy some spiritual herbs back, let my junior sister refine the Longevity Pill, and many other pills to assist in cultivation, so that you can also break through to the Xiantian Realm and stay young forever."</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother showed an indulgent expression, "I believe in you, wait for you to come back!"</p><p></p><p>"Mother, don't worry."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his chest and promised.</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Xu Yan and Xu Junhe strolled in the garden of the Xu family mansion, and for a moment, neither of them spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Since you were little, you've been obsessed with novels and traveled everywhere to seek out experts, everyone said that I, Xu Junhe, had a foolish son. I originally wanted to save up some family wealth for you, so that you could marry a good wife and live a prosperous life.</p><p></p><p>"But unexpectedly, there are truly such experts in the world, and my son has also become a martial arts expert, I too have entered the path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe sighed and broke the silence.</p><p></p><p>"Your martial dao ambition, I understand it well, don't worry about home, the Bianjing region is safe, Qi Kingdom won't be in chaos, the guards at home have almost all entered the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"They are all loyal and devoted, you don't need to worry."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe stopped walking, looked at Xu Yan with a serious expression, and said, "Your grandfather is in the capital city, and your cousins will inevitably become arrogant. If you pass on the martial arts techniques to them, sooner or later there will be a day when they leak out. Are you prepared for your master to blame you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was taken aback, the possibility of the martial arts techniques being leaked was not small, his cousins were arrogant, and his uncle Guo Yunkai controlled the Divine Will Army, he would naturally train his trusted followers in the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With more people cultivating, the leakage would be inevitable.</p><p></p><p>"Father, don't worry, it's just the Qi Blood Realm techniques, even if they leak out, it's not a big deal."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>The master, when agreeing to pass on the techniques to his family, probably already knew that there would be a day when they would be leaked.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the master also had the intention of spreading the dao to the Bianjing region?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I'll teach you the sword techniques tomorrow, although you can't enter the Dao of the Sword, cultivating the martial arts sword techniques will also greatly increase your strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Before leaving, he wanted to enhance the strength of his family.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe nodded and walked away, saying, "Yan'er, get some rest early."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to his residence, sat cross-legged on the bed, and a thread of true qi appeared on his fingertips, followed by another thread of true qi. He began to refine the true qi, comprehending the profundity of true qi.</p><p></p><p>"I can already split one thread of true qi into three, if I continue to split it further, until each thread of true qi is only as thick as a needle, my comprehension and control of true qi will have a huge improvement.</p><p></p><p>"And with the splitting, my true qi has also become more condensed and powerful."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was splitting the true qi, the thread of true qi that emerged from his fingertips was about the thickness of his finger.</p><p></p><p>As the true qi was split, the originally dispersed true qi remained as condensed as before, and even became a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>He knew that his approach was correct, once he had finished splitting the true qi and comprehended the profundity within, the true qi transformation into true essence at the Profound Realm would also be comprehensible to him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to go to the Inner Realm, a new plot was about to unfold, please give me some monthly votes ^_^</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

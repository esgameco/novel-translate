        <h1>Chapter 406</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen explained some of the upcoming actions of Tianshadiying, including creating conflicts between the forces of the Nine Mountains Realm, occupying Nine Mountains City where the realm gate is located, and instigating a war between the Nine Mountains Realm and the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>One of the actions was to assassinate Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat had been listening quietly, but was secretly shocked by the latter part.</p><p></p><p>One of Tianshadiying's missions was actually to infiltrate the Qinghua Realm and assassinate either Su Lingxiu or Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>It also included sabotaging pills and formations.</p><p></p><p>For example, smearing poison on pills so that martial artists who take them would die from poisoning.</p><p></p><p>An even more important action was to kill either Fang Hao or Su Lingxiu. If successful, whether it was the Great Yue Nation, Tianwu Sect, or Wanlei Sect, including the entire Qinghua Realm, would be in uproar and inevitably clash with the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu were crucial to the overall strength and martial arts future of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short years, the Qinghua Realm had undergone earth-shattering changes, with martial arts strength greatly improved. Everyone recognized the benefits brought by formations and pills.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, all major forces had prodigies studying alchemy and formations at the Medicine Academy and Qimen Academy. If either Fang Hao or Su Lingxiu died, the loss would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Tian Seventeen vaguely hinted that they might even attempt to assassinate the powerful figure behind the Qimen Academy and Medicine Academy, namely Li Xuan!</p><p></p><p>"This Tianshadiying is truly vicious. I wonder where they get such confidence?" Red Cat secretly muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"So that's why the big guy Meng Chong was being hunted as soon as he arrived in the Nine Mountains Realm."</p><p></p><p>Red Cat clicked his tongue in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Could this Tian Seventeen be planning to take action personally?</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger also looked surprised. How could Tian Seventeen be so crazy? Tianshadiying had become somewhat fanatical for the sake of so-called "heaven and earth unity".</p><p></p><p>"Tian Seventeen, you can talk big, but the Nine Mountains Realm and Qinghua Realm's Immortal Heavenly Venerable aren't fools. Moreover, once Tianshadiying is exposed, everyone will know it was your doing."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen smiled slightly and said: "Wind Spirit King, you underestimate my Tianshadiying too much. Besides, who would really believe Tianshadiying could accomplish this? Even if they knew and determined it was Tianshadiying's doing, wouldn't trying to encircle and suppress us still cause turmoil in the divine realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The goal would still be achieved, wouldn't it? What do you think, Wind Spirit Tiger?"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger smiled and said: "Well then, let this king see your capabilities and whether you're worth cooperating with."</p><p></p><p>After a pause, he added: "Don't think about targeting Spirit Venerable Mountain and disturbing this king's peace, or you'll regret it if I take action!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen smiled and said, "Understood!"</p><p></p><p>Inwardly he sneered, thinking beasts' brains truly weren't very good. If all the other forces in the Nine Mountains Realm had problems but Spirit Venerable Mountain alone was fine, how would the other forces view that?</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, wait for news from my Tianshadiying. Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen took his leave.</p><p></p><p>After Tian Seventeen left, Red Cat spoke up: "Big brother, once the other forces run into trouble, our Spirit Venerable Mountain should also create some disturbances. We can't be completely unaffected."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" Wind Spirit Tiger asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains are connected, you know. If everyone has problems, people's minds will be more balanced and it'll be easier for us to obtain information from each other. It'll be greatly beneficial to us," Red Cat said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>He didn't bother explaining in detail to Wind Spirit Tiger. In Red Cat's view, this Wind Spirit Tiger wasn't very bright, so there was no need to waste energy explaining.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, don't worry. I'll arrange everything properly. We'll definitely profit greatly and won't suffer any losses!" Red Cat patted his chest as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"I trust my wise brother to handle things!" Wind Spirit Tiger nodded.</p><p></p><p>He could leave these troublesome matters to his wise brother while he continued to enjoy the reverence of being the Tiger King.</p><p></p><p>Having unexpectedly learned of Tianshadiying's plans to attempt assassinating Fang Hao or Su Lingxiu, although it was unlikely to succeed, it could still potentially cause losses.</p><p></p><p>Even losing some pills would pain the tiger's heart.</p><p></p><p>So Red Cat immediately summoned Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>"Third brother, you go back to the Qinghua Realm now and relay Tianshadiying's plot..." Red Cat looked at Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>They had to return to the Qinghua Realm before Tianshadiying took control of the Nine Mountains Realm gate. Otherwise, once the gate was controlled, they wouldn't be able to return through it and would need to travel a long distance to get back to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>There wouldn't be enough time then.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" Little Ha nodded, shrinking his body to the size of a small toad with his aura concealed, and quickly departed.</p><p></p><p>He was a Mountain Swallowing Toad, and after cultivating the Great Demon method, he had also developed demonic divine abilities including a concealment technique that made him hard to notice.</p><p></p><p>This was why Red Cat had Little Ha return to report the news.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon was a flood dragon after all, too easily noticeable. Flood dragon spirit beasts were rare, and one of the Twelve Beast Kings of the divine realm was the Flood Dragon King.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat then went to find an elder of Spirit Venerable Gate and, in Wind Spirit Tiger's name, had him escort Jade Little Dragon to Big Lid Mountain.</p><p></p><p>The purpose of going to Big Lid Mountain was naturally to warn Meng Chong and Xu Yan. The transmission range of message talismans was limited after all, but with Meng Chong and Xu Yan at Big Lid Mountain, it would be easier to contact them with message talismans once the range was narrowed down.</p><p></p><p>After making all the arrangements, Red Cat also began his own preparations.</p><p></p><p>As well as thinking about how to obtain sufficient benefits from Tianshadiying next. The fact that they sought cooperation with Wind Spirit Tiger was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>From this, it could be inferred that Wind Spirit Tiger's strength must be top-tier among Immortal Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat felt that Wind Spirit Tiger's strength was even greater than the Great Yue Emperor's.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to surpass it?" Red Cat sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He was a Great Demon King, but now because his strength was inferior to the tiger's, he could only settle for being second-in-command, which left him quite dissatisfied.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because his strength wasn't great enough yet, he didn't dare pass on the Great Demon method to other spirit beasts for now, and could only continue developing in secret.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>There was an undercurrent flowing through the Great Yue Nation, Tianwu Sect, Wanlei Sect, and even the entire Qinghua Realm. The source of this undercurrent was the start of rooting out spies.</p><p></p><p>The three major forces of the Qinghua Realm were all taking action. And because they were on alert, with Immortal Heavenly Venerables personally investigating their sects, some infiltrated Shadow members were uncovered.</p><p></p><p>However, no valuable information was obtained.</p><p></p><p>Once these infiltrators discovered they had been exposed, they resolutely self-destructed.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that these Immortal Heavenly Venerables became extremely vigilant, their expressions grave. With such die-hard agents infiltrating their sects, the plot must be significant.</p><p></p><p>Could there even be issues among the Immortal Heavenly Venerables themselves? Or had all the spies been rooted out?</p><p></p><p>The purge continued. Since the Sky Cave had been suppressed, the Qinghua Realm held the advantage, so these Immortal Heavenly Venerables were able to free up manpower.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Great Yue Nation, and even the entire Qinghua Realm, was insignificant to Li Xuan. He didn't pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>He remained fully devoted to his martial arts pursuits.</p><p></p><p>"The seventeenth page has finally been memorized."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan closed the Taicang Book and let out a breath. He had already memorized seventeen pages of the Taicang Book, with only the last page remaining. Once he finished, he would have completely memorized the Taicang Book and fully mastered the principles of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>More accurately, he would have grasped the entire core essence of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>This included the operation and formation of the Taicang world, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a feeling that the eighteenth page, containing the general outline of principles, encompassed the entire essence of the Taicang world, and perhaps even included the origin of the world's creation.</p><p></p><p>"The owner of the Taicang Book must be an extremely powerful being who has transcended the world."</p><p></p><p>At this point, Li Xuan was almost certain that the owner of the Taicang Book must have transcended the world. Otherwise, they could not have depicted all the laws and principles of the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"Where did such a powerful being go? The Taicang Book was discovered in the Wu Kingdom's palace treasure, and that mysterious voice in the Wu Kingdom's stone chamber..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but fall into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Was the person in the mysterious stone chamber the owner of the Taicang Book, or a being sealed away by the book's owner?</p><p></p><p>"Once I've fully mastered the Taicang Book and improved my strength a bit more, I'll be able to go have a chat with them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>With the wonders of his Small Heavenly Eye and his mastery of the Taicang world's principles, the other party's whereabouts would not be able to escape his detection.</p><p></p><p>As long as he found them, all the secrets of the Taicang world would be within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder when Xu Yan will be able to comprehend the martial arts of the Heaven and Earth realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered. He had already devised martial arts methods for the realm beyond Heaven and Earth, and had a clear direction for the martial path even further beyond.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if Meng Chong is still being hunted."</p><p></p><p>In his spiritual platform, his primordial spirit opened its eyes and looked towards the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan is doing well, his strength has increased again. Xie Tianheng is not bad either..."</p><p></p><p>Through his connections with these people, Li Xuan could sense changes in their strength.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness is also growing stronger."</p><p></p><p>There were more and more martial artists in the Great Wilderness, and the upper limit of their strength was also increasing. Xu Junhe had already reached the late stage of the Divine Intent realm, making him the strongest in the Great Wilderness, not far from the Divine Origin realm.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual energy is no longer weaker than in the Spirit Domain."</p><p></p><p>After being arranged, the spiritual energy in the Great Wilderness had been continuously increasing. Over the years, the level of spiritual energy was not much worse than in the Spirit Domain.</p><p></p><p>In a few more years, the spiritual energy of the Great Wilderness might even surpass that of the Spirit Domain.</p><p></p><p>However, the Spirit Domain would likely undergo changes as well, with its spiritual energy increasing accordingly, forming a balance point with the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the Small Heavenly Eye, your Small Heavenly Eye has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had comprehended the Small Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's Small Heavenly Eye is somewhat different from Xu Yan's. Now that my Small Heavenly Eye has been combined with theirs, it has become even stronger."</p><p></p><p>The Small Heavenly Eye that Meng Chong had comprehended differed from Xu Yan's. For example, it lacked the virtual eye in the center of the brow, but within both eyes, there was an additional sun-like symbol.</p><p></p><p>It possessed the power to intimidate evil spirits and incinerate impurities, with extremely formidable might.</p><p></p><p>"Su Lingxiu still falls a bit short. The Small Heavenly Eye she comprehends will also be different. Each martial art, when comprehended, will have its own variations."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to call Su Lingxiu over to guide her once more, helping her comprehend it sooner. This way, with the combination of three martial arts' Small Heavenly Eyes, his own Small Heavenly Eye would become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Su Lingxiu, Li Xuan began to study the eighteenth page of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>Just one glance made him feel its profound depth. He seemed to see an illusory world presented within, making it difficult to memorize each individual pattern one by one.</p><p></p><p>"The general outline of the world's principles, or even the general outline of the entire world, is indeed profound. Even with my Void-Breaking realm strength, I find it extremely challenging!"</p><p></p><p>The more he realized this, the more Li Xuan marveled at the strength of the Taicang Book's owner.</p><p></p><p>"Even if I break through to the Heaven and Earth realm, I still wouldn't be a match for the owner of the Taicang Book."</p><p></p><p>Based on this inference, Li Xuan estimated that even the strength of the Heaven and Earth realm would not match up to the Taicang Book's owner.</p><p></p><p>"But it's not too far off. Beyond the Heaven and Earth realm, one should be roughly on par, having transcended the world, and shouldn't be much weaker."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The true strength of the Taicang Book's owner was actually impossible to estimate. After all, the Taicang Book was merely a depiction left behind by them. If writing this Taicang Book was accomplished with just a wave of their hand, then their strength would be far beyond what could be estimated from the Taicang Book alone.</p><p></p><p>"At most, it wouldn't exceed three realms, so actually, I'm not that far from the strength of the Taicang Book's owner."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan needs to work harder and quickly comprehend the Heaven and Earth realm. Then I can pass on the realms beyond Heaven and Earth to you. When your master can surpass the owner of the Taicang Book depends entirely on you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of confidence in his grand martial arts ambition.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the divine ability 'Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying'. Your 'Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying' has reached great perfection."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan was immersed in memorizing the last page of the Taicang Book, he suddenly received feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss! Meng Chong actually comprehended this divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>The great divine ability 'Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying' was specifically created by him for physical martial arts, fully displaying the ferocity of bodily martial arts, with extremely powerful divine might.</p><p></p><p>When used, it was as if a heaven-holding giant appeared, grasping the sky and smashing it down with earth-destroying power.</p><p></p><p>This strike was completely a ferocious attack.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the heaven-holding giant that appeared when using the divine ability was just a manifestation of physical power, not actually transforming into a real giant. Even so, it was extremely shocking.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, in Li Xuan's design of this divine ability, once one's realm reached a certain height, using this divine ability would actually transform one into a real heaven-holding giant.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that with Meng Chong's current realm, he wouldn't be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Meng Chong had managed to comprehend this divine ability at the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that being hunted triggered his potential?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wondered in surprise.</p><p></p><p>Regardless of the reason, Meng Chong's comprehension of this divine ability had given him an additional powerful technique.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after Meng Chong comprehended the 'Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying' divine ability, feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the divine ability 'Vajra Thunderous Palm'. Your 'Vajra Thunderous Palm' has reached great perfection."</p><p></p><p>This was also a divine ability from the Divine Ability Manual. Although not as powerful as 'Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying', it was still considered a great divine ability. When used, a giant vajra hand would appear with the image of angry thunder, slamming down with extremely powerful might.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good. Both my first and second disciples are starting to show their talents, contributing to the grand martial arts cause. Su Lingxiu, that girl, needs to work hard too."</p><p></p><p>"And Fang Hao, the path of extraordinary martial arts should also be expanded, elevating my extraordinary martial arts as well."</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, that boy, is just a bit short of becoming an Extreme Soul martial artist."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt he was worrying himself sick over his three disciples.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 535</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Smack! As soon as Mu Xiao finished speaking, Feng Yan viciously whipped him.</p><p></p><p>"How dare you!" </p><p></p><p>Feng Yan whipped Mu Xiao again, angrily rebuking him: "The Dao Ancestor is compassionate and teaches all living beings. Though you are barbaric, the Dao Ancestor is still merciful and teaches you. How could he kill you? How could he humiliate you? You are an uncivilized barbarian who doesn't understand education and doesn't recognize the Dao Ancestor's compassionate heart. This is all for your own good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched Feng Yan lecturing Mu Xiao and couldn't help but sigh, thinking that Feng Yan had learned quite a bit from Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others also had strange expressions on their faces.</p><p></p><p>They couldn't help but glance at Chi Mao again. </p><p></p><p>Chi Mao rolled his eyes. That bastard Shi Er had taught him plenty of lessons, and he had long since gotten revenge for the beatings he received back then!</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao was a bit dazed at the moment. The Dao Ancestor was doing this for his own good again? He looked at Su Lingxiu, then raised his head to look at Feng Yan. His mind was in chaos. How had he, such a powerful being, ended up in this state after being captured?</p><p></p><p>"Master, just let me dissect him," Su Lingxiu said, tugging on her master's sleeve.</p><p></p><p>"We must not act recklessly. We must respect others' wishes, even if they no longer have the power to resist or threaten," Li Xuan said with a faint smile.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, Master!" Su Lingxiu nodded. </p><p></p><p>She understood that Mu Xiao had already been restrained by her master and had no power to resist or threaten. Whenever she wanted to study him, she could just do it directly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Mu Xiao let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan said exasperatedly from the side: "I've already said the Dao Ancestor is doing this for your own good. Hurry up and show your gratitude!"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao hesitated. Even though the Dao Ancestor was incredibly powerful, making him kowtow in thanks was still a bit too much for him to accept.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan brought his whip down again, putting on an act of doing it for Mu Xiao's own good. He transmitted a message to Mu Xiao: "Do you want to be dissected? The Dao Ancestor is easy to talk to, but his true disciples are not so easy-going!"</p><p></p><p>When Mu Xiao heard this, he was instantly jolted. </p><p></p><p>Dignity and face were no longer important.</p><p></p><p>Besides, the Dao Ancestor's strength was even more terrifying than that person from the Immortal Palace. Kneeling to him wasn't shameful!</p><p></p><p>So he respectfully kowtowed and said: "Thank you Dao Ancestor for teaching me!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan revealed a gratified smile.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand and a broom appeared in front of Mu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"Sweep the ground with a calm mind, brush away your violent nature, and comprehend the emotions of the mortal world. Go."</p><p></p><p>Although Mu Xiao was extremely unwilling in his heart, he also knew that at this moment, he had no room to resist.</p><p></p><p>He also didn't have the courage to stubbornly and bravely refuse all of this.</p><p></p><p>So he picked up the broom.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Dao Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The broom was quite heavy, feeling weighty in his hands. This was no ordinary broom. With his powers restrained, sweeping with this broom would be quite laborious.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me," said Feng Yan, leading Mu Xiao away to arrange for him to sweep.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao couldn't wait to leave. Now he was afraid whenever he saw Su Lingxiu, fearing he would be taken away to be dissected.</p><p></p><p>"The broom is heavy, isn't it? This is the Dao Ancestor teaching you, tempering you. When your violent nature is gone and you understand the teachings of the mortal world, you will be able to advance further."</p><p></p><p>"You must remember, the Dao Ancestor is merciful. Even a barbaric and violent person like you is given the opportunity to receive teachings..." Feng Yan instructed Mu Xiao.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xiao was a bit dazed. They had captured him, beaten him, but in the end it was for his own good? Was the Dao Ancestor's magnanimity truly as vast and boundless as the Immortal Realm?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at his master admiringly, sighing inwardly, "When will I be able to reach Master's level? Beating up an enemy, but not only does the enemy not resent it, they even feel grateful. This level is too high!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Zi watched Mu Xiao diligently sweeping outside the courtyard under Feng Yan's supervision. He scratched his head in confusion and asked, "Aren't we going to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>Before Li Xuan could speak, Xu Yan was already explaining earnestly: "Tian Zi, Master is the Dao Ancestor. He has already transcended the level of fighting and killing. When Master acts, he is teaching us."</p><p></p><p>"Just like before, when he waved his hand to destroy enemies, he was teaching us not to be soft-hearted towards enemies, and not to rely on our status. When we strike, we must turn the enemy to dust."</p><p></p><p>"Now Master is teaching us that as our level increases, our mental state must change. We shouldn't just fight and kill indiscriminately. We need to understand how to educate."</p><p></p><p>"Especially you as the Heavenly Dao, you should understand the concept of education even more. There are many intricacies to this way of education. Think more and comprehend more to understand the meaning of education!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping nodded vigorously: "Senior Brother is right!"</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother understood Master's deeper meaning best. Since Senior Brother said so, it must be absolutely correct.</p><p></p><p>Tian Zi was completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>Is that how it is? Why did he feel that the "education" Xu Yan spoke of seemed somewhat different from his own understanding of "education", as if it contained some additional meaning?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, thinking his eldest disciple truly understood his intentions well, as a pioneer of the great endeavor of martial arts. Thinking of this, Li Xuan revealed a gratified smile.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan saw this, he was delighted, realizing he had once again grasped his master's deeper meaning!</p><p></p><p>"Education, I see!" Tian Zi scratched his head and muttered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, seemingly afraid Tian Zi had misunderstood, added: "Education has deeper levels of meaning. For some enemies who are obstinate and unrepentant, the best education is to send them into reincarnation!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Zi looked at Xu Yan and nodded vigorously, "I understand now. Education also needs to be differentiated. Different enemies require different methods of education!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, "It's good that you understand!"</p><p></p><p>The sudden attack ended with one Heavenly Lord level true spirit being destroyed and Mu Xiao being captured and punished to sweep the grounds at Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>After this battle, the Great Wilderness entered a period of power growth. Many immortal true spirits were infused into the world, nourishing it and transforming into precious materials to cultivate martial artists.</p><p></p><p>The Underworld also began operating the cycle of reincarnation as the immortal true spirits perished and their souls were drawn into rebirth.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dao's operation of the world became more and more perfect, and the rules grew stronger.</p><p></p><p>The various realm lords also felt a sense of urgency and went into seclusion to comprehend the Heavenly Dao, wanting to increase their strength as quickly as possible.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, many martial artists gained insights. The names of Fang Hao of Qinghua Sect and Su Lingxiu of Changqing Pavilion also spread among the powerful.</p><p></p><p>Medicine-based martial artists and Qimen martial artists also became widely recognized. Many powerful figures wanted to send their descendants to join Qinghua Sect to cultivate Qimen martial arts or medicine-based martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The Qimen Hall and Medicine Hall of Qinghua Sect also started to become lively.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to enter the Qimen Hall or Medicine Hall, one had to pass strict screening. Only those with outstanding talent were accepted.</p><p></p><p>Naturally, the newly recruited disciples did not need Su Lingxiu to teach them personally. Instead, they were taught by the medicine-based martial artists and alchemists of the Medicine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Although the martial artists of the Medicine Hall were not yet very powerful, their numbers were also</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>There were quite a few, although not many practiced the complete Alchemist-Physician martial arts, there were many alchemists.</p><p></p><p>For matters of the Alchemist-Physician Institute, unless they were major issues, they would not reach Su Lingxiu. They were all handled by Yue'er and Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun also occasionally participated. The operation of the entire Alchemist-Physician Institute was already very well-established.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was the sect leader of the Qinghua Sect. Naturally, he was not in charge of the affairs of the Extraordinary Skills Institute. Moreover, as the sect leader, he was not responsible for many matters.</p><p></p><p>The Extraordinary Skills Institute was managed by Yue Changming, Feng Yan and several others. They had already trained some martial artists in artifact refining and formations, enough to continue teaching newly recruited disciples.</p><p></p><p>Unless they recruited someone with extremely freakish talent, Fang Hao would not personally appear to give guidance. But so far, no genius worthy of his personal instruction had appeared.</p><p></p><p>Sword techniques and blade techniques were also being taught, and more and more people were practicing sword techniques, mainly influenced by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>There were also more and more martial artists practicing physical martial arts, especially those body cultivators who were racking their brains trying to figure out how to cultivate pure martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The threshold for entering the Qinghua Sect was too high. Later on, many powerful experts discovered that the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy also taught these martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As a result, they sent their descendants who could not enter the Qinghua Sect to study at the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>These descendants of powerful experts were arrogant. When they first arrived at the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, they inevitably acted haughtily, feeling that other students were inferior to them.</p><p></p><p>In the end, they inevitably received punishment. The Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy would not indulge these people. Those who seriously violated academy rules would be expelled without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>There was once a descendant of a powerful expert who was directly expelled and driven out of the academy for using vicious methods that damaged the martial arts foundation of academy students.</p><p></p><p>That powerful expert was very angry about this and actually caused trouble at the Great Wilderness Academy. After all, in his eyes, the Great Wilderness Academy was ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>With one move, he suppressed several powerful experts of the academy. Even Bai Yunkong was seriously injured. This matter reached Canglang Island, and Xu Yan killed the troublemaker on the spot with one sword strike!</p><p></p><p>After this incident, the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy revised its rules, raised the standards for recruiting students, especially greatly increased the threshold for descendants of powerful experts to enter the academy, and required them to pay high tuition fees! As for geniuses of ordinary or even lowly backgrounds, the threshold remained very low. The higher their talent, the lower the threshold, until there was no threshold at all.</p><p></p><p>As for the descendants of powerful experts, in addition to talent requirements, paying tuition fees became an inevitable rule!</p><p></p><p>After this incident, no powerful expert dared to look down on the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy again, and no one dared to violate the academy's rules.</p><p></p><p>The backer behind the Great Wilderness Academy was the Sword God Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Sword God Xu Yan was a fierce person. When it came to killing, he wouldn't care about your identity or background. After all, no one in the world had a stronger background than him.</p><p></p><p>He was the true disciple of the Dao Ancestor! The world was slowly growing stronger, and the Heavenly Dao was also improving, although very slowly, but it was indeed improving.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the entire world was also constantly improving.</p><p></p><p>The world had entered a new stage, as if it was about to enter a period of transformation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was as leisurely and carefree as ever, sitting and watching the winds of change, with only the maid Cai Ling'er serving him, living a life like that of a young master from a wealthy family.</p><p></p><p>Where some were leisurely, others were naturally busy.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was extremely busy, not only continuing to deceive Blood Demon, but also devoting thought to how to improve and perfect the Yin Realm, reincarnation, and so on.</p><p></p><p>He also had to personally appear to guide Yueyao, Taimiao, Tiansha and others on how to comprehend the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Besides Tianzi being busy, Su Lingxiu was also extremely busy, on one hand strengthening Blood Jie's soul seed, guiding him in cultivating soul seed techniques in preparation for seizing Blood Demon's power, and on the other hand continuing to work with Tianzi to deceive Blood Demon.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she also had to treat Taihe and Taikun, being very interested in their injuries and finding them worthy of in-depth research.</p><p></p><p>Especially the aura that had contaminated their bodies, which was said to have come from that person from the Unmelting Divine Palace. It was due to the influence of that person that they ended up like this.</p><p></p><p>All of this aroused great interest in Su Lingxiu. Therefore, no matter how busy she was, she made time to study the strange injuries of the two and research the mysterious aura entangled around their bodies.</p><p></p><p>Taihe and Taikun were extremely excited that there was really hope for a cure, so they fully cooperated with the treatment. Even if Su Lingxiu wanted to dissect them to deeply explore the root of their injuries, they agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Because she was too busy, Su Lingxiu really couldn't find time, so the matter of dissecting Mu Xie had to be temporarily shelved.</p><p></p><p>As for Mu Xie, dressed in coarse clothes and holding a broom, he looked like an old man. Every day, under Feng Yan's arrangement, he was responsible for sweeping the courtyard and the area around it.</p><p></p><p>At first, Mu Xie was constantly on edge, fearing that Su Lingxiu would suddenly appear and take him away for dissection. After all, in his current state, he had no power to resist martial artists like Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>As a result, Su Lingxiu never appeared, and he gradually relaxed.</p><p></p><p>"Now you know I was doing this for your own good, right? If it weren't for me, you would have been dissected long ago," Feng Yan said, patting his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie nodded, starting to believe that Feng Yan was indeed looking out for him.</p><p></p><p>"Sweep well, sweep three times a day - morning, noon, and night. Don't be lazy, don't think the broom is heavy, don't think it's hard work.</p><p></p><p>"You were once very powerful, you must have endured a lot of hardship. This bit of hardship is nothing to you, just maintain a stable state of mind.</p><p></p><p>"This is not punishment from the Dao Ancestor, this is an opportunity bestowed by the Dao Ancestor. What you're sweeping now is not the ground, but your own path of cultivation..."</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan spoke earnestly. When mentioning the Dao Ancestor, his expression was solemn and respectful, admonishing Mu Xie that this was an opportunity given by the Dao Ancestor, not punishment...</p><p></p><p>He instilled in Mu Xie how great the Dao Ancestor was, how compassionate, how he educated all living beings, how he was mindful of the difficulties of cultivation, and thus educated him and bestowed this opportunity upon him. He must know how to grasp it and be grateful!</p><p></p><p>Initially, Mu Xie was skeptical of Feng Yan's words. Was this hard work of sweeping really an opportunity given by the Dao Ancestor? But Feng Yan instilled in him every day the idea that the Dao Ancestor was doing this for his own good. Gradually, Mu Xie began to think that perhaps the Dao Ancestor really was looking out for him?</p><p></p><p>Sweeping every day repeatedly, resting when tired, over time he actually began to like this tranquility, not having to rush about on various tasks for the Unmelting Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, Feng Yan's words floated back into his mind - this was an opportunity given by the Dao Ancestor, this was for his own good...</p><p></p><p>"No, how could capturing me and restricting my power possibly be for my own good?"</p><p></p><p>Mu Xie shook his head, gritted his teeth, and firmed up his own thoughts. He had been imprisoned, not given an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>For several days in a row, he didn't see Feng Yan come, nor was he assigned to sweep. However, Mu Xie still swept on time every day as usual.</p><p></p><p>He just wondered where Feng Yan had gone. Without Feng Yan's chatter, he actually felt a bit unaccustomed for a while.</p><p></p><p>It wasn't until this day that he learned Feng Yan had gone to busy himself with other matters. And on this day, a newcomer came to be in charge of arranging his sweeping.</p><p></p><p>This person was called Shi Er, and his strength was much weaker than Feng Yan's.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

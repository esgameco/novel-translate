        <h1>Chapter 335</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The city of Yuntianbijhai became bustling with the arrival of Xu Yan. </p><p></p><p>On the top floor of the city lord's manor, Fu Tianhai stood in the corridor, with Xie Tianheng and Fu Yun standing on his left and right respectively.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun had originally prepared to go and intervene, but was stopped by Fu Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is indeed remarkable!" Xie Tianheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>Then, glancing at his father-in-law, "See, by not letting me go and intervene, the city lord's manor is now embarrassed, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai's face darkened, placing his hand on Xie Tianheng's shoulder and smiling, "How dare you question my decision? Who gave you the courage? Don't think that just because you have the title of Sword King, you are so powerful. </p><p></p><p>"In my eyes, you are still not good enough."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng gritted his teeth, feeling as if a huge mountain was pressing down on him, his whole body about to fall apart. His father-in-law's strength was truly too powerful.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still dissatisfied, snorting, "If I were at the same cultivation level as you, you would definitely not be my match!"</p><p></p><p>"Using cultivation level to oppress others is also a display of strength!" Fu Tianhai sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, if I were your age, my cultivation level would have surpassed yours by several levels. With so many cultivation resources at your disposal and cultivating for so long, yet your strength is still so little, I would be ashamed if I were you."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng still stubbornly insisted.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai clenched his five fingers, paused for a moment, and said, "You are too unfilial!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! "Fuck! Using your might to bully the weak, aren't you ashamed?"</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong with a father-in-law beating his son-in-law?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun looked helpless. When Xie Tianheng first arrived, he was very low-key and not at all arrogant, obedient to his father-in-law and trying to please him in every way. </p><p></p><p>She had even doubted for a time whether this was the same Xie Tianheng she had known before? But after his strength increased, he had finally reverted to his arrogant self.</p><p></p><p>"Father, go easy on him!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Fu Tianhai struck even harder.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, after catching up with Xie Lingteng, Xu Yan began to teach him the divine elemental martial arts, and also took out some medicinal pills to assist Xie Lingteng's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, you have already reached the peak of the Divine Consciousness Realm and have accumulated some foundation, but it is still not enough. Accumulate more foundation, and when you break through, your self-transformation and ascension to the Divine Elemental Realm will make your strength even greater."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan instructed.</p><p></p><p>For the next half month, Xu Yan guided Xie Lingteng in his cultivation and sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Until Xie Lingteng had accumulated enough foundation and began to seclude himself to break through to the Divine Elemental Realm, Xu Yan finally saw the long-absent Xie Tianheng and Xie Lingteng's mother, the city lord's daughter Fu Yun.</p><p></p><p>However, Xie Tianheng's face was bruised and swollen, as if he had been severely beaten.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't help but be curious, who had beaten the Sword King of Beihai?</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any healing pills? Give me one, that old man hit too hard!" Xie Tianheng covered his face and said.</p><p></p><p>For several days, a force had been lingering on his face, preventing his injuries from healing.</p><p></p><p>With this appearance, he naturally could not go out, or else it would be a disgrace to the reputation of the Sword King. Xu Yan suddenly understood, so it was the father-in-law who had beaten him up.</p><p></p><p>He handed a bottle of medicinal pills to Xie Tianheng.</p><p></p><p>After another round of catching up, Xie Tianheng introduced Fu Yun, and when talking about Fu Yun, he was extremely proud. </p><p></p><p>In the Inner Realm, he had married the revered Spiritual Realm's young lady Fu Yun, unmatched by anyone in the Inner Realm, which was the reason he had looked down on everyone else back then.</p><p></p><p>"My sword dao has stagnated a bit, I always feel like I'm missing something to break through."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng sighed.</p><p></p><p>He had come to seek Xu Yan's guidance on the insights of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan naturally proceeded to guide Xie Tianheng on the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Just after finishing guiding Xie Tianheng, a steward hurriedly came and said, "Miss, Luo Shao from the Wanxing Martial Arts Institute has requested to challenge Xu Yan, Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Luo Shao?" Fu Yun was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng frowned and said, "This guy, why is he challenging now?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his eyebrows, curious, "How is Luo Shao's strength?"</p><p></p><p>"Luo Shao is known as the top genius of the Wanxing Martial Arts Institute, even called the number one genius of Beihai. It is said that he has already refined the aura of three heavenly and earthly laws."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun introduced.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng supplemented, "It is rumored that Luo Shao possesses a spiritual body."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became interested, he had long heard of genius cultivators with spiritual bodies, but had never had the chance to fight one. This Luo Shao actually had a spiritual body? No wonder he had already refined the aura of three heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual bodies are more closely connected to the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, making it easier for them to refine the aura of heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the steward, he said, "Tell Luo Shao that he can challenge me, but only after he has defeated that Grand Commander, otherwise he is not qualified to challenge me!"</p><p></p><p>Although he was curious about the spiritual body genius, not just anyone was qualified to challenge him.</p><p></p><p>After defeating the Grand Commander, then he could come and challenge him, but if he couldn't even defeat the Grand Commander, he shouldn't even think about challenging Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"This..."</p><p></p><p>The steward looked at Fu Yun, and after getting her permission, hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the steward hurriedly came back again.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, Sea Wave from the Sea Spirit Tribe has requested to challenge the Young Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun was surprised again.</p><p></p><p>"Sea Wave is the top genius of the current Sea Spirit Tribe, rumored to have a distinguished bloodline, being the granddaughter of the current Sea Spirit Tribe Chief. It is said that she has also refined the aura of three heavenly and earthly laws, and is known as the twin genius of Beihai along with Luo Shao."</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun introduced.</p><p></p><p>"The usual rule, defeat the Grand Commander first, then I'll accept the challenge!" Xu Yan waved his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>The steward hurriedly left again.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Commander's face was very black, looking fierce as these two came to challenge him. He almost wanted to vomit blood.</p><p></p><p>The challengers were originally here to challenge Xu Yan, but Xu Yan had set a threshold, saying that only after defeating him could they challenge Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>This really frustrated him.</p><p></p><p>He even regretted that he had interfered back then.</p><p></p><p>Now, everyone knew that he, the Grand Commander, was not Xu Yan's match!</p><p></p><p>"Grand Commander, please teach me!" Luo Shao said solemnly, holding a spear in his hand.</p><p></p><p>The gloomy-faced Grand Commander stared at Luo Shao and said, "I admit defeat, now you can go challenge Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Luo Shao shook his head and said, "I, Luo Shao, would never do such a deceitful thing. In a battle of geniuses, we must fight head-on. If I cannot defeat the Grand Commander, then I am not qualified to challenge Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Commander, please respect me!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the unkempt Luo Shao with his thick, short hair and stubble, the Grand Commander almost vomited blood. Could he not be so serious! Damn it!</p><p></p><p>He glared at Sea Wave and said, "I admit defeat, you can go challenge Xu Yan now."</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit, I, Sea Wave, am going to be the Sea Spirit King, how can I stoop to such deceit? You, the Grand Commander, have no shame, but I, Sea Wave, have my pride!" </p><p></p><p>Fuck! The Grand Commander's face turned even blacker.</p><p></p><p>Sea Wave was the treasure of the Sea Spirit Tribe, even if she was rude, he could do nothing about it. This girl had a notorious temper, known throughout Beihai.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he said, "Since that's the case, go ahead and fight."</p><p></p><p>Sea Wave held a azure trident, the divine artifact of the Sea Spirit Tribe. A look of anger crossed her pretty face as she said, "Grand Commander, are you looking down on us? Do you think you are qualified to let me and Luo Shao team up?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Shao nodded in agreement. The Grand Commander's nose was almost twisted out of shape as he raised his hand, a knife in it, and said in a gloomy voice, "Who will strike first?"</p><p></p><p>Li Shao glanced at Hai Bo'er. "I'll go first. If I defeat him, then you can go, and your chances of winning will be higher!"</p><p></p><p>"Bullshit, I'm Hai Bo'er. How could I stoop to taking advantage of others?" </p><p></p><p>However, due to the issue of who would strike first, Li Shao and Hai Bo'er ended up fighting each other first.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Commander almost coughed up blood. Damn it, was there no more respect for him as the Grand Commander? It seemed that ever since Xu Yan arrived, his authority as the Grand Commander had been in continuous decline.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had broken through to the Divine Element Realm, but Xu Yan did not wait for Li Shao and Hai Bo'er's challenge, nor did he pay attention to these two. Presumably, he had not been able to defeat the Grand Commander.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, then he had no qualifications to challenge Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>When Xie Lingfeng broke through, he also underwent a transformation and refinement of his own, with his martial dao foundation truly and thoroughly converted into the foundation of the Great Desolate Martial Dao, and he also obtained the Spiritual Bone.</p><p></p><p>Although Xie Lingfeng, who had just entered the Divine Element Realm, was far from the strength he had in the past, defeating a peak Refine Spirit cultivator was no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>Even a cultivator who had refined a strand of the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanism could contend with him.</p><p></p><p>His current strength was not much inferior to Xie Tianheng's.</p><p></p><p>The profundities of the Divine Element Realm did not end there, and Xie Lingfeng's strength would continue to grow, allowing him to once again trample underfoot those he had previously defeated.</p><p></p><p>With the improvement of his understanding of the Sword Dao, once Xie Lingfeng broke through to the perfect Divine Element Realm, his strength would not be inferior to the City Lord of Cloud Sky City, and might even be a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>In any case, Xie Lingfeng was also a prodigy, and his strength could not be judged by ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to impart the Divine Spiritual Realm martial dao techniques to Xie Lingfeng, which would take some time to explain in detail, allowing Xie Lingfeng not only to memorize the techniques, but also to truly comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>After imparting the Divine Spiritual Realm martial dao techniques, Xu Yan also passed on the Divine Manifestation Realm techniques to Xie Lingfeng. As for the Transcend Void Realm martial dao techniques, he had not comprehended them, so naturally he could not impart them.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, for Xie Lingfeng, even the Divine Spiritual Realm was somewhat distant, let alone the Divine Manifestation Realm.</p><p></p><p>It would be enough for him to cultivate for a long time.</p><p></p><p>The transmission of the techniques and the guidance on the Sword Dao, along with the leaving of some medicinal pills, marked the end of this trip to Cloud Sky Cyan Sea City.</p><p></p><p>Next, Xu Yan needed to go and explore the Cyan Sea, searching for the divine treasures of the Cyan Sea.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun had given Xu Yan a copy of the Cyan Sea map, which contained information about the dangerous areas, treasure lands, and even the sea areas where divine treasures might appear, much more detailed than what Cai Lingxiao had previously introduced.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan was about to take his leave and set out to explore the Cyan Sea in search of divine treasures, Li Shao and Hai Bo'er actually came to challenge him.</p><p></p><p>The two of them had both defeated the Grand Commander separately.</p><p></p><p>This surprised Xu Yan, and after learning the details, he found out that on that previous day, Li Shao and Hai Bo'er had gotten into a conflict over who would strike the Grand Commander first, resulting in the two of them fighting each other and both sustaining injuries. </p><p></p><p>They could only recover for a few days before separately defeating the Grand Commander and then coming to challenge Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Then let me see the abilities of the Cyan Sea's prodigies."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The battlefield was chosen to be on the sea outside Cloud Sky Cyan Sea City, and the news spread, causing an uproar in Cloud Sky Cyan Sea City.</p><p></p><p>Countless cultivators gathered at the battlefield, waiting for the clash of the prodigies.</p><p></p><p>On one side was the strongest prodigy of the Cyan Sea, and on the other was the renowned Sword Immortal Xu Yan from the Eighteen Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood proudly on the surface of the sea, looking at the two opponents.</p><p></p><p>Li Shao gave the impression of a wandering youth, unkempt, with short and messy hair, a short beard, and holding a spear in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Hai Bo'er was beautiful in appearance, her figure slightly petite, but with a bountiful bosom. She held a Divide Sea Trident.</p><p></p><p>"You two can attack together, I'm in a hurry!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held his sword, saying calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are indeed very arrogant, but I, Li Shao, disdain to fight alongside others. I will win or lose with honor and integrity, not like those shameless Spiritual Sects of the Eighteen Prefectures."</p><p></p><p>Li Shao stepped onto the waves, his spear in hand, and as he advanced, his aura continued to surge.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The waves rose up, becoming like a giant spear.</p><p></p><p>Li Shao's body was filled with spiritual light, and the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws converged and fused with his spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a spiritual body."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed. A spiritual body is close to spiritual energy and the Heavenly and Earthly Spiritual Mechanism, and is more in harmony with the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws, which is why it is easier to condense the power of the Heavenly and Earthly Laws and fuse it with oneself.</p><p></p><p>Having also condensed three strands of the Heavenly and Earthly Law aura, this was also the reason why Li Shao's strength was superior to the Grand Commander's.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out with his sword, and the Cyan Sea transformed into mountains and rivers, the waves becoming countless sword blades, and in an instant, a myriad of swords surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Li Shao's expression hardened, and as he swung his long spear, he continuously shattered the sword blades formed from the waves, striding forward unstoppably, as if he wanted to pierce through the mountains and rivers and destroy the myriad swords.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan raised his hand and clenched it, and the surrounding waves surged up, transforming into a series of giant swords. In an instant, the giant swords surrounded him, the sword formation displaying its might.</p><p></p><p>However, in just a moment, Li Shao was trapped within the sword formation, left and right in difficulty, unable to break out.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you going to make a move?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Hai Bo'er.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, then I'll give you a taste!"</p><p></p><p>Hai Bo'er's expression turned grave, and with a tap of her Divide Sea Trident, the waves parted, and then a terrifying tidal wave force surged forth from the Cyan Sea.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Tribe, the overlords of the sea, the Cyan Sea was their domain.</p><p></p><p>Hai Bo'er utilized the might of the Cyan Sea, her entire being enveloped by the Cyan Sea, concealing her own presence as she launched an attack against Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled slightly, and with a step on the surface of the sea, a thunderous sound rang out, and a golden giant dragon emerged from the raging waves. In an instant, Hai Bo'er was forced out of the Cyan Sea, even losing the ability to borrow the power of the Cyan Sea.</p><p></p><p>It was as if this sea area had already changed its master!</p><p></p><p>The spectators were all shocked. What kind of technique was this, summoning a true dragon? The form and power of the true dragon had already manifested to some extent, including the ability to command the sea. How could the Sea Spirit Tribe compare to a true dragon? The moment the golden giant dragon appeared, the outcome of this battle had become clear.</p><p></p><p>"The victory has been decided," Fu Tianhai sighed.</p><p></p><p>Next to him was the Sea Spirit Tribe Chief, who now had a resigned expression, sighing, "Xu Yan's technique is truly remarkable, imitating the might of the true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"The prodigy from the Spiritual Realm, Xu Yan, is now unrivaled."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai smiled.</p><p></p><p>"Even those from the Transcendent Spiritual Sects of the Eighteen Prefectures cannot shake him?" the Sea Spirit Tribe Chief asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think Li Shao and Hai Bo'er would lose to those people?" Fu Tianhai smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>As the city lord, how could he not know the mission of the Transcendent Spiritual Sects? Cloud Sky Cyan Sea City also belonged to their jurisdiction.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Tribe Chief nodded, then changed the topic, "Will the Cyan Sea participate in this battle of prodigies?"</p><p></p><p>"Let the young ones decide for themselves whether to participate. The Divine Bridge is about to open, and another opportunity is coming. You and I should also ascend the Divine Bridge and go to the other side."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai smiled and said.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Tribe Chief nodded, his gaze returning to the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

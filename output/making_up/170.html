        <h1>Chapter 170</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Outside Tieshan County, the Changqing Pavilion was brightly lit.</p><p></p><p>A huge tiger came in the darkness of the night without disturbing anyone outside the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan and his group entered the inner domain without hiding themselves, but also without making a big fuss, not letting anyone know they were from the remote border regions.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, Kou Ruozhi and others were already waiting.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat entered the manor, not stopping but going directly to the innermost courtyard, which was quiet and elegant, built for Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Do whatever needs to be done."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan got off the Red Cat's back, moved the chairs and table to the courtyard under the big tree, and waved his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu began to arrange the affairs of the Changqing Pavilion, how to sell the medicinal pills, how to maximize the profits, and a series of such matters were waiting for her.</p><p></p><p>"Master, my disciple and I need to go out for a trip."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully said to his master.</p><p></p><p>"Go, for me, those so-called grand masters are just small ants!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were going out to kill a grand master this time, and they could get feedback from the golden finger. Moreover, Xu Yan's wandering in the martial arts world would be more conducive to his enlightenment and improvement of his strength.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was impatient, as that treasure land had fifth-grade spirit herbs. Killing the black-robed man could indeed make them rich!</p><p></p><p>In addition to the treasure land of the black-robed man, on Canglang Island, the rampaging Fire Extermination Demon Sovereign also needed to be dealt with, daring to spout such arrogant words, as if he was tired of living.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, are we going to Canglang Island to kill the Demon Sovereign, or go to the black-robed man's lair first?"</p><p></p><p>After leaving the Changqing Pavilion, Meng Chong asked.</p><p></p><p>"Canglang Island is not urgent, let's go to the black-robed man's lair first to see if it is truly their stronghold, and we can make a fortune again.</p><p></p><p>As for Canglang Island, let the Fire Extermination Demon Sovereign live a few more days, and he is one of the nine great demon sovereigns of the Demon Sect, so his wealth must be considerable. I can't kill him for nothing, let him prepare a hundred million spirit crystals before I go kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The Fire Extermination Demon Sovereign would certainly bring out a hundred million spirit crystals for his appearance, and there might not be just him on Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>The more eager they were to kill him, the more he would be willing to pay.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the Fire Extermination Demon Sovereign has a storage bag."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>The nine great demon sovereigns of the Demon Sect were renowned and awe-inspiring in the area. Perhaps they had storage bags?</p><p></p><p>"Before we act, let him put down everything, lest we strike too hard and accidentally destroy it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>He had long coveted the storage bags, but had never seen one.</p><p></p><p>Inside a small courtyard in Tieshan County, Meng Shushu was excited after refining the Heavenly Marrow Pill, finding that his innate talent had improved.</p><p></p><p>Even the family's secret techniques that he had not fully comprehended before, he could now understand.</p><p></p><p>"This is the power of the pill!"</p><p></p><p>One Heavenly Marrow Pill had caused his talent and comprehension to surge, far exceeding the effect of even a whole Heavenly Dripping Marrow.</p><p></p><p>As a descendant of a family of spirit herb explorers, he naturally understood the effects of the Heavenly Dripping Marrow.</p><p></p><p>"Are there any cultivating pills? If so, won't I be able to break through to Grand Master realm quickly?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"I can't slack off in finding spirit herbs, I must strive, I must explore spirit herbs, the more the better!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Shushu was as if he had been injected with chicken blood.</p><p></p><p>"The family is ready to depart."</p><p></p><p>The voice of Meng Chong came from outside the house.</p><p></p><p>"Coming, coming!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was greatly excited and hurriedly opened the door and went out.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Xu, Elder Brother Meng, do you have any cultivating pills?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the excited and spirited Meng Shushu, Meng Chong grinned and tossed him a bottle, saying, "Inside is the Nurturing Qi Pill, an auxiliary cultivation pill. It's from our family, in the future you must work hard, the more you work, the more pills you'll get. You should know that this kind of pill is very difficult to refine."</p><p></p><p>He started to entice Meng Shushu, and Meng Shushu was so fired up that he couldn't wait to find spirit herbs and wouldn't rest for a moment!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Meng Shushu's shoulder and said, "Refining pills is not easy, it consumes a lot of spirit herbs. The higher the grade of the spirit herb, the scarcer it is, so you must work hard. The more sixth-grade and fifth-grade spirit herbs, the better."</p><p></p><p>"Senior Xu, don't worry, I Meng Shushu will never slack off from now on. I will strive day and night and never disappoint your expectations!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said excitedly while thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'm glad to see your fighting spirit."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in satisfaction, then said, "I'll give you a preferential price, one sixth-grade spirit herb for a bottle of Nurturing Qi Pill, three fifth-grade spirit herbs for a pill of the same grade as the Heavenly Marrow Pill!"</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, the treasure land is far away, near the border of the Yan Kingdom..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The three of them left Tieshan County and headed straight for the treasure land occupied by the black-robed men.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the remote border regions of Qi Kingdom, with Li Xuan and the Xu family entering the inner domain, the martial artists in the border regions all knew that their land was just a remote and desolate place where the martial dao did not exist.</p><p></p><p>The more they knew this, the more they appreciated the Martial Dao Saint Master, the Patriarch of the Border Regions, who had brought the martial dao to the border regions, allowing the people there to stand tall.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Junhe had entered the inner domain, the Xu family did not leave the border regions unattended.</p><p></p><p>After all, as the holy land of the martial dao in the border regions, it still needed martial artists to guard it, provide some guidance to the cultivators of the martial dao in the border regions, and consolidate the martial dao spirit of the border regions.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace of the Qi Kingdom's capital, in the Emperor's study, the Qi Emperor had already cultivated the martial dao, but his progress was slow, after all he was somewhat old. Even with the nourishment of precious medicines, he still felt the difficulty of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Especially when he first entered the Refine Bone stage, that kind of numb and painful sensation, those without firm willpower could not endure it at all.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao was not something everyone could cultivate.</p><p></p><p>However, in recent days, the Qi Emperor had experienced many setbacks, and his willpower had become much more resolute, so he endured it.</p><p></p><p>He had already begun to refine his bones.</p><p></p><p>This progress could be considered slow.</p><p></p><p>Among the princes, the Crown Prince was the one with the most resolute willpower and the most suitable for cultivating the martial dao. He had endured the painful bone refinement with ease.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince was a bit lacking, as he could not endure the bone refinement for long each time, so his progress was slow.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Crown Prince had tempered his bronze bones and reached the peak of Bronze Bone, and had begun to refine his organs.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince had been beaten several times, so his ability to endure pain had been trained, far exceeding the other princes who were pampered.</p><p></p><p>In the study, Guo Rongshan came with a box in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Guo, so late at night, what's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan placed the box on the table and opened it, revealing three jade bottles inside.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, these are the cultivation pills needed..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs of the Danjing School - Bone Refining Elixir, Organ Refining Elixir, Qi and Blood Elixir."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi looked at him with puzzlement. He naturally knew about the Danjing School's elixirs, as they belonged to the Guo family and were gifts from Xu Yan, so no one dared to covet them. </p><p></p><p>"Brother Guo, if there is anything, you can make the decision, I will not object at all," Emperor Qi said cautiously.</p><p></p><p>However, Guo Rongshan remained calm as he spoke, "The people outside all call me a man of great virtue, and this reputation puts great pressure on me. I always want to do something practical for the remote borderlands, to revitalize our borderlands..."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi's expression became serious. </p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was not talking about the Qi Kingdom, but the borderlands!</p><p></p><p>This meant that his vision was not limited to the Qi Kingdom, but the entire borderlands!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan continued, "The term 'borderlands' is a designation used by the people of the interior domain. The place we reside in is barren and uncivilized, hence it is called the borderlands. But can we continue to live in the borderlands indefinitely?"</p><p></p><p>"My son-in-law Xu Junhe has already entered the interior domain and will establish a foothold there. How can we remain in the borderlands?"</p><p></p><p>"We people of the borderlands must unite, only then can we gain a foothold in the interior domain. And our borderland martial arts have been passed down by the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>"We must have the belief to carry forward the Martial Ancestor's way, and spread the martial arts to the interior domain."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, to unite the hearts of us borderland people, I propose that the Qi Kingdom and the Wu Kingdom be merged into one, and our borderlands be renamed the Great Wilderness, not the remote and uncivilized lands."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi suddenly stood up, his expression changing drastically as he exclaimed in shock, "Brother Guo, are you trying to destroy my Qi Kingdom?"</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, why be so attached to the Qi Kingdom? It is just a small borderland country. The Great Wilderness is the right path, to enter the interior domain and establish a foothold there, that would be a great achievement for generations to come."</p><p></p><p>"Although the name of the Qi Kingdom will disappear, Your Majesty will still be the ruler."</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked at Emperor Qi calmly.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial study, it was silent. Emperor Qi's expression kept changing, as if he was pondering something.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he took a deep breath and asked, "Will the Wu Emperor agree?"</p><p></p><p>"He will agree," Guo Rongshan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>"If there is neither the Qi Kingdom nor the Wu Kingdom, who will be the ruler of this Great Wilderness?" Emperor Qi asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"In the initial establishment of the Great Wilderness, there will be two emperors - the Northern Emperor is Your Majesty, and the Southern Emperor is the Wu Emperor. An imperial cabinet of the Great Wilderness will be set up to coordinate the north and south. I am willing to be the first Grand Elder of this cabinet," Guo Rongshan said as he took out a memorial and placed it on the table, indicating for Emperor Qi to take a look.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi's expression was grave. Guo Rongshan was not rebelling, but he was directly becoming the Grand Elder of the Great Wilderness cabinet, and the Great Wilderness would be divided into a Northern and Southern Emperor, with him mediating between the two, clearly placing himself above the two emperors.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was younger and had lofty ambitions, would he really agree to this? As Emperor Qi looked at the memorial, he pondered whether he should secretly contact the Wu Emperor. After closing the memorial, he remained silent for a long time.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness will unite the hearts of the people. The name of the borderlands has not yet spread, so we should seize this opportunity to widely promote the name of the Great Wilderness. We are all people of the Great Wilderness, and the Great Wilderness is the original of heaven and earth, so we are also the orthodox of heaven and earth!" Guo Rongshan said.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, this is the great trend!" he added.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi let out a sigh, knowing that he could not refuse. This great trend had become unstoppable with the emergence of the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan and Xu Junhe must have been secretly promoting this all along.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Emperor Qi suspected that the establishment of the Great Wilderness might have been Xu Junhe's doing!</p><p></p><p>"In the initial establishment of the Great Wilderness, there will be two emperors in the north and south. How will the future emperor of the Great Wilderness be determined? Will it always be divided between north and south?" Emperor Qi asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The second-generation emperor of the Great Wilderness will be competed for between the royal families of the original Qi Kingdom and Wu Kingdom. Whichever one gains the recognition of the Great Wilderness people and more support from the cabinet will become the emperor of the Great Wilderness," Guo Rongshan replied calmly.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi fell silent. In this way, the Great Wilderness emperor, while nominally the ruler, would be constrained by the cabinet and unable to truly dominate the world. This was a form of balance.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the calm Guo Rongshan, Emperor Qi gritted his teeth and said, "Brother Guo, we are sworn brothers. You must take good care of the royal lineage of the Qi Kingdom."</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, rest assured that I am inclined towards you," Guo Rongshan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"As long as the Wu Emperor does not object, I naturally will not object!" Emperor Qi said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, rest assured, the Wu Emperor will not object," Guo Rongshan smiled.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, a message swept across the borderlands.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor announced the abolition of the Wu Kingdom and its merger with the Qi Kingdom to establish the Great Wilderness!</p><p></p><p>The next day, Emperor Qi also announced the abolition of the Qi Kingdom and its merger with the Wu Kingdom to establish the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, the Great Wilderness cabinet was established, with Guo Rongshan as the Grand Elder.</p><p></p><p>Several key officials from the Wu Kingdom also entered the cabinet as members.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Kingdom's Divine Might Army was also reformed as the Great Wilderness Divine Might Army, under the jurisdiction of the cabinet, with the responsibility of stabilizing and protecting the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The former Wu Kingdom's Heavenly Mystery Guard was also renamed the Heavenly Mystery Army, under the jurisdiction of the Great Wilderness cabinet, with the same responsibility as the Divine Might Army.</p><p></p><p>Immediately afterwards, the Great Wilderness cabinet issued new laws, stating that all martial artists of the Great Wilderness must revere the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor and uphold the glory of the Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Several inviolable red lines were established for the martial arts world of the Great Wilderness, all in the name of strengthening the Great Wilderness people.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts teachings of the Martial Ancestor were widely disseminated throughout the Great Wilderness, and martial arts cultivation became a pursuit for all.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was divided into a Northern and Southern Emperor, with Emperor Qi still in the capital of the Qi Kingdom, and the Wu Emperor still in the capital of the Wu Kingdom. The two did not interfere with each other, and only the Great Wilderness cabinet handled the affairs of the two kingdoms.</p><p></p><p>A new era had emerged in the borderlands!</p><p></p><p>Everyone pursued martial arts, feeling grateful to the Martial Ancestor for his teachings, and striving for the rise of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the Great Wilderness spread the words: "The interior domain is not only the domain of the interior people, but also ours, the people of the Great Wilderness. We must have our place in the interior domain!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Wilderness is the original of heaven and earth, and we, the people of the Great Wilderness, are the orthodox of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>In Tieshan County, Li Xuan walked out of the Tianbaoge, feeling amazed at how good they were at business - they were truly a major capital of the interior domain.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he returned to the Changqinglou and sat down, the golden light appeared: "The martial arts you created have been widely disseminated in the Great Wilderness and you have been revered as the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor. You have obtained the Heart of the Martial Ancestor and the Appearance of the Martial Ancestor."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately stunned, looking towards the borderlands. Just after he left, such a huge change had occurred?</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness? The borderlands had been unified?</p><p></p><p>"The Heart of the Martial Ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. He vaguely understood why the golden finger feedback had been triggered.</p><p></p><p>The borderlands had entered a new era because of the martial arts he had propagated, and the martial arts had become the aspiration of all, with him being revered as the Great Wilderness Martial Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>The Heart of the Martial Ancestor allowed him to encompass all martial arts methods within himself and enhance his ability to create martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm, the more powerfully the Heart of the Martial Ancestor could be manifested.</p><p></p><p>And the Appearance of the Martial Ancestor meant that all who cultivated his created martial arts would revere and admire him deeply from the bottom of their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"I've really made it big! I've actually become a Martial Ancestor now!" Li Xuan thought, feeling a little shocked.</p><p></p><p>The way the Great Wilderness was established felt like it was the work of Xu Junhe.

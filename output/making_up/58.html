        <h1>Chapter 58</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 58: Martial Dao of the Physical Body, the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wrote down the technique of the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover on a draft, carefully reviewed it to confirm the theoretical feasibility of the technique, and memorized the technique in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood surged in his hands, and the draft instantly turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>The technique he had prepared for his disciple Meng Chong was already completed. Now it was time to pass it on to his disciple and wait for him to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>At dawn, the sound of martial arts practice could be heard in the open space of the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was wielding a large machete, swinging it with fierce might, the shiny bald head reflecting the light.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently. His second disciple, just like Xu Yan, was a diligent and hardworking person. With such disciples, how could he not become powerful?</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, come here!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down on a chair.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stopped his practice, stuck the machete in the ground, and came over respectfully to pay his respects.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will pass on to you the martial dao technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression was solemn as he spoke word by word: "The martial dao I am passing on to you is not the common martial arts you have learned in the jianghu. Those are merely ordinary fist and foot techniques.</p><p></p><p>"My martial dao can move mountains and fill the seas, and breaking the void is a trivial matter.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is boundless, but the cultivation of martial dao must start from the foundation. And the first realm of martial dao is the Qi and Blood Realm..."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, he raised his palm, and in an instant, a surge of qi shot up into the sky.</p><p></p><p>Even though he had restrained the aura pressure, Meng Chong could still feel the terrifying power contained in that qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>His eyes widened, his expression filled with excitement and fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Martial dao!</p><p></p><p>This is martial dao!</p><p></p><p>Just the first realm, the Qi and Blood Realm, is already so terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan retracted the qi and blood and continued, "The cultivation of martial dao starts with refining the skin, bones, and internal organs. This is the foundation, the basis.</p><p></p><p>"Only by firmly establishing the foundation can one walk the path of martial dao far. You must know that a journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand again, and the qi and blood condensed into a palm, which he placed on Meng Chong's shoulder, squeezing his arm and thigh.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, your talent lies in your physique. You have an extraordinary constitution, which is perfectly suited for the path of the physical body. Therefore, today I will pass on to you the foundational technique of the physical body martial dao, the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover..."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly touched his bald head and said, "I will follow the arrangement of the master!"</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao of the physical body focuses on the cultivation of the physical body. It has unparalleled defense and is exceptionally robust, which perfectly matches your characteristics."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up and walked around Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but marvel inwardly. This second disciple of his had a naturally robust and imposing appearance, with bulging muscles and a bald head.</p><p></p><p>His facial features were handsome, but his towering and powerful build, along with the shiny bald head, had overshadowed his good looks.</p><p></p><p>One could only see the aura of ruggedness, not the handsomeness.</p><p></p><p>Whoever saw him would involuntarily praise, "What a mighty young man!"</p><p></p><p>"Martial artists who cultivate the path of the physical body, when they reach the pinnacle, can be compared to divine weapons... Of course, this is still too far for you. As long as you cultivate the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover, even if a thousand armies attack you, they will not be able to break your defense..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to extol the greatness of the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover, trying to ignite Meng Chong's fighting spirit and fanaticism.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the more Meng Chong listened, the more excited he became. His muscles were trembling, and his bald head seemed to shine even brighter.</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully, I will now pass on to you the cultivation method of the Great Sun Golden Bell Cover..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat back down on the chair, his expression solemn as he began to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong immediately knelt down, respectfully listening.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the martial dao of the physical body differs from the orthodox martial dao cultivation. The orthodox cultivation is to refine the skin, bones, and internal organs separately, while the martial dao of the physical body is to cultivate the three simultaneously..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan verbally recited the complete technique he had prepared, starting with sensing the qi and blood, then cultivating the qi and blood from the inside out, or...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"...Disciple, do you remember?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the cultivation method thoroughly, without missing a single word, and then asked.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I remember."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>He had remembered the cultivation method, but was a bit unsure about the specific practice.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said opportunely, "My martial dao is about comprehension and meaning, not just the form of the cultivation method. Disciple, you need to comprehend and understand the true essence within."</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the martial dao requires talent. I've observed your method of seeking revenge, and you seem to have a remarkable comprehension. Your talent should not be lacking."</p><p></p><p>"Keep contemplating the cultivation method, I believe you can grasp the essence."</p><p></p><p>After encouraging Meng Chong a bit, Li Xuan paused and then continued, "The cultivation method contains everything. Whether you can enter the door of cultivation depends on your own comprehension."</p><p></p><p>"As the master, I can only guide you to the door. The actual cultivation relies on your own efforts."</p><p></p><p>"You must calm your mind, be neither arrogant nor impatient, and try to feel the meaning within the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong felt a bit confused, but he knew this was an extraordinary martial dao technique, so the entry was indeed very profound.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will definitely comprehend it!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said firmly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, don't let me down!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, took a horse stance, and said, "Take a horse stance and carefully contemplate, first feel the flow of qi and blood."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>In the open space of the courtyard, he took a horse stance.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivation requires a balance of work and rest. When the time comes, cook a meal, clean the courtyard, wipe the tables... Relax yourself, calm your mind, don't always be tense. Sometimes, the more you cling to it, the harder it is to gain anything..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed patiently.</p><p></p><p>It was in such a cultivation process that the original Xu Yan had comprehended the cultivation method he had fabricated, and successfully entered the door of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Also, when cooking chicken, remember to add nine-leaf ganoderma or thousand-year mountain ginseng..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed further.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked away with his hands behind his back, but suddenly thought of something and said, "If you need anything, you can go find Shi Er."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was quite capable, and Li Xuan temporarily treated him as an errand boy, just to see how he would perform.</p>

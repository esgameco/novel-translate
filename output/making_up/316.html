        <h1>Chapter 316</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Go and summon Elder Liu."</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan fell silent for a moment and ordered in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Miss!"</p><p></p><p>The maid left.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Liu, I heard that you have some connections in Yuzhou and Zheng State. I need to go to Yuzhou in the next few days. Could you please introduce me?"</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. The young Mansion Master just needs to take this token to Zheng State."</p><p></p><p>Elder Liu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Elder Liu!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off Elder Liu, Tang Jinyan began to make arrangements for the trip to Yuzhou. These confidential matters naturally required her personal involvement to ensure no leaks.</p><p></p><p>On that day, Tang Jinyan set out for Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Success!" </p><p></p><p>Wiping the beads of sweat, Fang Hao said excitedly as the hovering flying ship appeared before him.</p><p></p><p>"Let me try it!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling couldn't wait to give it a try.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of her hand, the ten-meter-long flying ship instantly shrank and was cradled in her palm, now looking like a decorative item.</p><p></p><p>She then moved her body and soared into the air, releasing the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A 300-meter-long flying ship with pavilions and towers emerged in the sky, faintly surrounded by purple lightning, as if a purple dragon was coiled around it.</p><p></p><p>"The flying ship can be dispersed, with the main body hidden underground, turning into an estate with both defensive and offensive capabilities. Array formations and restrictions can be deployed.</p><p></p><p>"It can activate a protective shield and unleash dazzling phenomena, like a true dragon coiling around or a divine phoenix carrying the ship in flight.</p><p></p><p>"It does consume a lot of spirit crystals, but it's all worth it.</p><p></p><p>"It can hover in the air, and its top speed is not much slower than the strongest flyers. It also has some stealth capabilities."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao introduced and explained nearby.</p><p></p><p>"With this flying ship, I can travel all over the Spiritual Realm. The name of the Long Qing Pavilion will spread throughout, and those who see me, the Pill Dao Immortal Lady, will have opportunities."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling said happily.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu three also excitedly entered the flying ship to explore and try controlling it.</p><p></p><p>As for the spirit crystals needed for the flying ship, it was nothing to them at all.</p><p></p><p>They had already cleared out the treasuries of the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, so they had an abundance of spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Long Qing Pavilion had a considerable daily income of spirit crystals, which they could spend freely.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao began to refine his own flying ship. With the experience gained, the second ship was not as powerful as the first one, so the refinement was not too difficult.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship his master used for his travels naturally required more care and attention, while his own personal one could be made more casually.</p><p></p><p>After a few days, the second flying ship was finally refined.</p><p></p><p>It was also time for Fang Hao to go to the Myriad Worlds Alliance headquarters.</p><p></p><p>On this day, he bid farewell to his master and the others.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother and Second Sister have already made a name for themselves in the Spiritual Realm, and my Pill Dao Immortal Lady title is also well-known. Now it's your turn, Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling handed the medicinal pills to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, don't worry. The name of Fang Hao will soon be known throughout the Spiritual Realm as well."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said confidently.</p><p></p><p>A 10-meter-long flying ship rose into the air and disappeared into the distance in a flash of light.</p><p></p><p>On the flying ship stood two figures, Fang Hao and Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to change the place for medical practice."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling spoke.</p><p></p><p>And so, Stone Two, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shushu three began to pack up and move into the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng came to bid farewell.</p><p></p><p>Although he also wanted to stay in the Long Qing Pavilion, he knew that he was not one of them, and it was time for him to start acting for the top geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Xingzheng, these medicinal pills are for you."</p><p></p><p>Since Zhu Xingzheng had often helped out in the Long Qing Pavilion, Su Ling did not want to owe him any favors, so she naturally gave him the appropriate reward.</p><p></p><p>"The Golden-Horned Deer has been returned to you as well."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling said.</p><p></p><p>Although the Golden-Horned Deer looked decent, it was not as adorable as the Crimson Cat, and she suddenly missed the Crimson Cat.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Miss Su!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng cupped his hands in gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Little Gold, you're so disappointing!"</p><p></p><p>Zhu Xingzheng rode the Golden-Horned Deer away, muttering to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I've secured such a great opportunity for you, but you're just not capable enough to win the favor of the elders. Your fortune is not enough. From now on, you just have to obediently follow me, and you'll never go wrong.</p><p></p><p>"As long as you work hard as I tell you, you won't die, but instead you'll gain great opportunities."</p><p></p><p>The Golden-Horned Deer was dejected, but nodded and said, "I understand. I will never make mistakes again and will never question your decisions..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched a little. This guy Zhu Xingzheng was really taking the opportunity to brainwash the Golden-Horned Deer.</p><p></p><p>"The Long Qing Pavilion will now travel to practice medicine in various places. Today, we shall depart from this place. Everyone, you are dismissed. We shall meet again if fate allows."</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi said to the crowd of cultivators waiting in line for treatment.</p><p></p><p>The powerful aura was also unleashed, causing the cultivators to retreat in disappointment without daring to make a commotion.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A dazzling flying ship appeared in the sky above the Long Qing Pavilion, wrapped in purple lightning, with brilliant light fluttering in all directions, and even a true dragon coiling around it.</p><p></p><p>The sudden appearance of this scene shocked all the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of divine artifact is this?"</p><p>"I've never heard of it before!"</p><p></p><p>The flying ship rose into the sky, not in a hurry, as if intentionally showing off.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat on the top of the flying ship's pavilion, in a small gazebo, leisurely enjoying the scenery along the way, with Cai Lingyi attending to him.</p><p></p><p>She had no intention of returning to the Sea Spirit Tribe.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship descended in a certain place in Luo State, and with a thunderous sound, the entire flying ship fully expanded, revealing a pavilion and tower estate.</p><p></p><p>The signboard of the Long Qing Pavilion shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>From this day on, the Long Qing Pavilion would only accept difficult and complex cases, only treating cultivators with severely damaged foundations. Common injuries and illnesses would no longer be accepted, but medicinal pills could be purchased.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling began to walk the Spiritual Realm, and the Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship would not stay in one place for long, but would take off to the next location.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the news of the Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship spread throughout the Spiritual Realm, and the saying that encountering the Long Qing Pavilion was a great opportunity became more and more widespread.</p><p></p><p>In the Lightning Cloud Mountain Villa, Lei Tong and the other top experts of the Lightning Cloud Mountain Villa all remained silent. The appearance of such a divine artifact had shocked them.</p><p></p><p>"It seems that there is a Celestial Master in the Spiritual Realm before the opening of the Divine Bridge. We cannot have any thoughts of targeting the Long Qing Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The Villa Master of the Lightning Cloud Mountain Villa said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Villa Master, why would there be a Celestial Master in the Spiritual Realm?" </p><p></p><p>Lei Tong asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know. We'll have the answers when the Divine Bridge opens."</p><p></p><p>The Villa Master of the Lightning Cloud Mountain Villa shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is about to become lively. The competition among the top geniuses has begun. The cultivators of the various sects should start moving, not just focusing on Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong are now renowned, with the titles of the top two geniuses, but who can claim the title of the number one genius? Only the final battle can determine that."</p><p></p><p>The Villa Master of the Lightning Cloud Mountain Villa said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Understood!"</p><p></p><p>The elders all nodded.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>This time, the Heavenly Prodigy Showdown has arrived at the time when the Divine Bridge opens, and the core Heavenly Prodigies of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect will make their appearance.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan entered the Great River State, his tracks became elusive, and the heated discussions about him in the Spiritual Dao Realm gradually subsided. Meng Chong also did not publicly appear to challenge the Heavenly Prodigies, and the heated discussions also declined.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Prodigies from various Spiritual Sects continued to emerge, and there were almost daily battles between Heavenly Prodigies in every major city.</p><p></p><p>As the Heavenly Prodigy Showdown intensified, the rankings on the Heavenly Prodigy List kept changing, with the only constant being Xu Yan at first place and Meng Chong at second place.</p><p></p><p>The elimination rules for the Heavenly Prodigy Showdown were also announced:</p><p></p><p>Three consecutive losses would result in elimination!</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Dao Realm was bustling, and the name of the Long Qing Pavilion's flying ship and the Elixir Fairy was constantly circulating. Even the Heavenly Prodigies who suffered severe injuries or had their foundations shattered were able to be revived under the Elixir Fairy's miraculous hands after entering the Long Qing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Some Heavenly Prodigies were even able to challenge their opponents again and defeat them, earning the qualification to advance to the next round of the Heavenly Prodigy Showdown.</p><p></p><p>In the Jade State, Tang Jinyan was searching for clues about the warriors who had entered the Spiritual Realm from the Inner Realm, hoping to uncover the truth about Xu Yan, in the residence of a certain high-ranking official of the Zheng Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The high-ranking official hesitated for a moment and provided a portrait, which was of the warrior who had entered the Spiritual Realm with a Jade Token.</p><p></p><p>As for Du Yuying and the others, who were involved with the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, the official did not dare to reveal anything.</p><p></p><p>He only provided information about an insignificant person. This person had entered the Spiritual Realm with the Shu Family's Jade Token, but since the Shu Family had been annihilated, the official was unsure if the person was still alive.</p><p></p><p>Tang Jinyan then began searching for this person in the Jade State, and to avoid any leaks, she did not use any other forces and instead personally investigated the former Shu Family's territory with her trusted maid, even disguising herself to avoid being recognized.</p><p></p><p>The Jade State was no longer under the sole control of the Spiritual Sect families, but was jointly governed by the Ten Thousand World Alliance. The status of the scattered cultivators had greatly improved, and the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families were no longer as superior as they once were.</p><p></p><p>The Shu Family's territory was vast, with several major cities, making it difficult to find a single person. Moreover, it was uncertain whether the person was still alive.</p><p></p><p>"It's been seven years," he sighed.</p><p></p><p>In the Great Marsh State, one of the eighteen states of the Spiritual Realm, there were numerous rivers, lakes, and swamps, hence the name "Great Marsh State."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Lotus Lake, the famous lake of the Great Marsh State, was named after the golden lotus flowers that grew there.</p><p></p><p>As the sunset glow reflected on the lake, the golden lotus blooms emitted a magnificent golden radiance, giving the lake a sense of nobility.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship drifted on the lake, and in the pavilion, Li Xuan sipped spiritual tea while appreciating the beauty of the Golden Lotus Lake.</p><p></p><p>It had been seven years since he entered the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>And the final battle of the Heavenly Prodigy Showdown was drawing ever closer.</p><p></p><p>In these seven years, Heavenly Prodigies had emerged one after another, gaining fame, but none had been able to surpass the rankings of Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Not even Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had now become a renowned Heavenly Prodigy of the Ten Thousand World Alliance, leading the alliance's powerful rise. With the introduction of the communication talisman, he had constructed a more efficient information transmission system, greatly shocking the Transcendent Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>Subsequently, he arranged teleportation arrays to connect the major cities of the Ten Thousand World Alliance, significantly reducing the time for rescue and transportation.</p><p></p><p>Although the teleportation arrays could not yet achieve cross-state transportation, the gradual connection of one array after another was creating a network.</p><p></p><p>The Qin State had already completed the arrangement, and powerful cultivators could now quickly provide aid to various regions, effectively turning the Qin State into an impregnable fortress.</p><p></p><p>These series of measures that defied the common knowledge of the Spiritual Realm cultivators had made Fang Hao's name deeply rooted in people's hearts, and the scattered cultivators were gradually becoming more inspired, no longer solely looking up to the Spiritual Sects and Aristocratic Families.</p><p></p><p>The dominance of the Spiritual Sects was truly being threatened for the first time! Stealing Fang Hao's Dao secrets, assassinating Fang Hao, and capturing Fang Hao had become the Spiritual Sects' most urgent goals.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had encountered assassination attempts more than once! Although it was known that the attacks came from the Spiritual Sects with the backing of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect, there was no evidence.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendent Spiritual Sect had also revealed some of its hidden methods at this moment!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had once faced the most dangerous situation, even being infected with the aura of death. This malicious power was extremely difficult to deal with, and it could only be sealed in a meridian and then purified with restrictive formations before the aura of death could be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>And Moon Chang Ming had once again shaken the Spiritual Realm as Fang Hao's protector. When facing the assassins, Moon Chang Ming displayed his powerful abilities.</p><p></p><p>Especially when Fang Hao was careless and became infected with the aura of death, Moon Chang Ming took the initiative to attack and killed a powerful cultivator from the Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>Nowadays, Fang Hao had already become the Junior Alliance Master of the Ten Thousand World Alliance, and it was only a matter of time before he took over the position of the Alliance Master. There was no one in the entire Ten Thousand World Alliance who did not respect him, even the two strongest Heavenly Prodigies mentioned by Zhu Xingzheng.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's Dao techniques were too profound, beyond their imagination, and they had no choice but to submit.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Great Perfection of the Divine Element Realm, and you have reached the Great Perfection of the Divine Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Dao Book opened, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through again.</p><p></p><p>In these seven years, Xu Yan had been constantly active in the Great River State, delving into ancient tombs and destroying the remnant spiritual beings.</p><p></p><p>The harvests he had reaped were immense.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he had also encountered some special and powerful existences, but they were all killed by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had broken through to the Great Perfection of the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This is the joy of rapid cultivation," Li Xuan exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was now one step closer to the Divine Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Currently, all four of his martial arts had reached the Divine Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had also gained insights into the subsequent path of the Esoteric Martial Arts, formations, and restrictive techniques through his battles against the assassins. Li Xuan had already condensed five innate Esoteric Seals, one of which was a Divine Spiritual Seal.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Spiritual Realm of the Esoteric Martial Arts did not produce Divine Spiritual Techniques, but the Divine Spiritual Seal itself was a source of Divine Spiritual Techniques, allowing one to deploy grand Esoteric Formations with Divine Spiritual power and wonders.</p><p></p><p>It was almost equivalent to possessing Divine Spiritual Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Among the four disciples, Xu Yan was still the strongest. Now that he had reached the Great Perfection of the Divine Element Realm, even Wu Tiannan, whose strength had increased significantly, would not be Xu Yan's match.</p><p></p><p>It could be said that Xu Yan was now at the pinnacle of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu had reached the Small Perfection of the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's cultivation was also at the Divine Element Realm, but the strength of the Esoteric Martial Arts lay in the formations and restrictive techniques, which could easily suppress and refine the Heavenly Spiritual Mechanisms of the most powerful cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Let me ponder the cultivation of the fifth martial art," Li Xuan thought.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation methods for the Flesh Cultivation Dao's Divine Spiritual Realm and the subsequent cultivation have already been compiled. The cultivation after breaking through the Void Realm has also become clear. The cultivation directions for the Elixir Dao and the Esoteric Martial Arts have been determined, so I no longer need to spend much effort on them.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth martial art should also be considered. As for the fifth disciple, in this vast Spiritual Realm, I should be able to find one, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had left the Long Qing Pavilion a few days ago, and following his guidance, he would wander and comprehend the Spiritual Realm's Heavenly and Earthly principles to break through his bottleneck.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could send a message to Wu Tiannan, asking him to keep an eye out for any Spiritual Realm prodigies, to prepare for the recruitment of the fifth disciple.</p><p></p><p>"What should the fifth martial art be?" Li Xuan pondered, not having a clear direction yet.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

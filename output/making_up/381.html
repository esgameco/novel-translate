        <h1>Chapter 381</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The difference was like heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Extreme Soul Martial Arts even surpassed his understanding of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Opportunity!</p><p></p><p>His great opportunity had finally come.</p><p></p><p>At last, he saw a chance to rise up. One day, he would be able to sweep away all the unfairness in his heart!</p><p></p><p>"Master, this disciple will definitely cultivate diligently and work hard. I absolutely will not disappoint your expectations!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping prostrated himself on the ground and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The path of martial arts is long and endless. Work hard and cultivate well. I will now pass on to you the methods of Extreme Soul Martial Arts. Once you successfully integrate the Undissolved Qi into your spirit and cultivate an Undissolved Spirit, you will be restored."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, he began to transmit the methods of Extreme Soul Martial Arts to Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping listened respectfully, afraid of missing even the slightest detail, especially the method for resolving the Undissolved Qi.</p><p></p><p>"Have you memorized it?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked after explaining the martial arts methods once.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple has memorized it!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction, but he still went over the key points again, explaining them to Jiang Buping once more.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master, for imparting the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping bowed respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Study and comprehend it well. Strive to achieve success in cultivation as soon as possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping took a deep breath, his gaze determined. He wanted to go into seclusion to comprehend the Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>However, the Undissolved Qi constantly affected him, making it difficult for him to concentrate. This meant that comprehending the techniques would be much more challenging.</p><p></p><p>But he already had a solution - using pain to stimulate his consciousness and allow him to focus, just like he had done in his previous battle with Mountain True King.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, your spirit is affected by the Undissolved Qi, making it hard to concentrate. I have a type of pill here that can help you focus," </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Really? Thank you, Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"This pill was specially refined by your Senior Sister for you. After taking it, it will constantly stimulate your spirit, boost your energy, and also nourish your spirit. One pill can maintain your mental state for six hours."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took out a bottle of pills and handed it to Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>This was a type of pill she had specially researched while studying the Undissolved Qi, particularly Jiang Buping's condition.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"If you don't have enough pills, just tell your Senior Sister, and I'll refine more for you."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was extremely grateful.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, I, your Fourth Senior Brother, am skilled in artifact refining. Here are several divine artifacts that can also assist you. This is a formation disk that can gather the spiritual energy of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also took out several divine artifacts and explained.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Fourth Senior Brother!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was amazed in his heart. The things his senior brothers and sisters casually gave him were all items he had never seen before, all marvelous and extraordinary treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Taikun Realm, which was considered one of the top realms in the Divine Realm, there were no such wondrous treasures.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "I, your eldest Senior Brother, cultivate pure martial arts, so I don't have these kinds of things to give you. However, I can give you some advice on martial arts issues."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rubbed his bald head and chuckled, "I cultivate physical body martial arts. If you want to know how to use your physical body, just come to me."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was excited in his heart. His senior brothers and sisters were each extraordinary in their own way. With him in such a powerful and miraculous sect, who could stop his rise to prominence?</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan finished transmitting the Extreme Soul Martial Arts to Jiang Buping, the five disciples were interacting and strengthening their relationships. He also silently looked at the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Little Heavenly Dao Eye: </p><p>Technique completion level: Medium</p><p>Comprehension difficulty: High</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: High</p><p></p><p>This was a simplified version of the Heavenly Dao Eye, and also the foundation for cultivating the Heavenly Dao Eye. Li Xuan had put a lot of effort into finally compiling it.</p><p></p><p>"The Little Heavenly Dao Eye is already very powerful, but comprehending and cultivating it will not be easy. As for whether there are certain heavenly and earthly treasures that can assist in cultivation, I'll leave that for the disciples to explore."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Next, he was going to transmit the Little Heavenly Dao Eye to Xu Yan and the other three.</p><p></p><p>As for Jiang Buping, he was cultivating the Extreme Soul Martial Arts, so the Little Heavenly Dao Eye wasn't suitable for him. However, Extreme Soul Martial Arts had its own unique divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because Extreme Soul Martial Arts focused on the ultimate spirit, it naturally possessed some ability to see through illusions.</p><p></p><p>After Jiang Buping successfully cultivated it, he could compile some divine abilities suitable for Extreme Soul Martial Arts and pass them on to him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were also about to venture out into the world, such as going to the Heavenly Crevice of the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect and the Heavenly Martial Gate, or even leaving the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm was vast, with thirty-six realms each different from the others. Traveling the world and challenging martial artists everywhere was the fastest way to improve one's strength and increase one's understanding of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, it was time to pass on the martial arts techniques above the Void-breaking Realm, as well as the second and third levels of the Indestructible Body of the Great Sun and Stars, to Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping went into seclusion full of excitement to comprehend the Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know how your Master was able to see at a glance that your Fifth Junior Brother was born with a divine spirit?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his four disciples at this moment and said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Master, is there some divine ability that can see through everything?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up as he asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Master, what divine ability is it?!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited. She ran to her Master's side and began massaging his shoulders. "Master, Master, please pass it on to your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled and patted Su Lingxiu's small hands that were massaging his shoulders with his jade ruyi scepter. "Alright, today I will pass on this divine ability to you all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three were all extremely excited. If they could successfully cultivate this divine ability, wouldn't they be able to see through any disguise or special person with just a glance?</p><p></p><p>"The divine ability I'm going to pass on to you is an eye technique type of divine ability called the Heavenly Dao Eye. Of course, with your current cultivation levels, it's impossible for you to cultivate the Heavenly Dao Eye.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, I will pass on to you the foundation for cultivating the Heavenly Dao Eye - the Little Heavenly Dao Eye."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained about the Heavenly Dao Eye, exaggerating how mysterious and powerful it was. The four disciples listened with excited expressions and flushed faces, eager to cultivate it successfully right away.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Little Heavenly Dao Eye is only the foundation of the Heavenly Dao Eye, it is still profound and unfathomable. Once you successfully cultivate it, seeing through illusions, breaking through phantasms, killing enemies, and tracking will all be easy..."</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Xuan carefully explained the compiled Little Heavenly Dao Eye and passed it on to the four of them.</p><p></p><p>After the disciples had all memorized it, he finally added, "How to cultivate it, how to comprehend it, and whether external objects can be used to assist, you'll have to explore on your own.</p><p></p><p>"The Little Heavenly Dao Eye will have some differences based on individual comprehension. What you cultivate won't necessarily be exactly the same for everyone."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was already very skilled at making things up. To avoid the possibility of discrepancies arising when his disciples compared notes after comprehending and cultivating it, he preemptively plugged this potential loophole.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the other three responded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting the Little Heavenly Dao Eye, next...</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>It was time to pass on the advanced martial arts techniques.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Yan, he said: "Disciple, you have already comprehended the martial arts methods of the Break Void realm. Your cultivation of divine abilities has also made great progress. I believe it won't be long before you break through to the Divine Appearance realm, and even the Break Void realm.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will pass on to you the martial arts methods beyond the Break Void realm!"</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Yan immediately perked up and excitedly said: "Yes, thank you Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan twirled the jade ruyi in his hand, his gaze profound, and said in a deep voice: "The Break Void realm breaks open space and time, no longer bound by the constraints of space and time. Since you have already comprehended the methods of the Break Void realm, you should understand that it is a foundation for transcending heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and respectfully said: "Disciple understands!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, with one hand behind his back, slightly raising his head to look at the sky. A mysterious aura flickered, instantly elevating his image as a great master.</p><p></p><p>"For the weak, heaven and earth are vast and boundless. In their entire lives, they cannot fully explore heaven and earth. But for those aspiring to reach the peak of martial arts, at a certain level, it becomes like a cage.</p><p></p><p>"How many martial arts talents ultimately want to transcend heaven and earth, break free from constraints, and reach the pinnacle of martial arts? Yet how many martial arts talents end up trapped within heaven and earth for their entire lives..."</p><p></p><p>As the solemn voice rang out, Xu Yan's heart trembled. He seemed to see countless martial arts talents sighing in frustration, trapped within heaven and earth, even having their personalities greatly changed because of it.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Cave is a hole in heaven and earth. Enemies from outside heaven and earth invade through it, but the martial artists of this world cannot leave heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I imagine many powerful experts feel helpless and quite unwilling about this, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, at this moment deeply feeling the desolation of those martial arts talents his master spoke of.</p><p></p><p>Feeling he had laid sufficient groundwork, Li Xuan said solemnly: "Beyond the Break Void realm is the Heaven and Earth realm!</p><p></p><p>"Those who embody heaven and earth transcend the external heaven and earth, using martial principles to open up a martial heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Using martial intent to become the intent of heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth realm! Xu Yan's spirits lifted, his face showing excitement. In that instant, all the martial realms below Break Void flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>From the foundational stages of tempering skin, bones, and organs, to the Blood Qi realm, Innate realm... all the way to the Break Void realm, advancing step by step through the martial realms, cultivating step by step.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was all to lay the foundation for the Heaven and Earth realm!</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is! Just like in the Divine Intent realm, where my intent becomes heaven's intent, my heart becomes heaven's heart - isn't this the foundation for martial intent to become the intent of heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"In the Divine Element realm, intent fuses with true essence and thus transforms. Isn't this heaven and earth's qi and power incorporating the martial artist's intent, so that heaven and earth truly belong to oneself..."</p><p></p><p>The more Xu Yan pondered, the more he comprehended. In his mind, he extracted the true meanings of each martial realm, forming the framework of a martial artist's heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Looking at Xu Yan, Li Xuan nodded inwardly. As expected of his martial arts pioneer, he had already gained insight. It seemed comprehending the Heaven and Earth realm's martial methods wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"Master, everything below the Break Void realm is foundational, laying the groundwork for opening up one's own heaven and earth, is that right?" Xu Yan asked excitedly after his realization.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face showed gratification. "Disciple, you have finally understood!"</p><p></p><p>But in his heart he marveled: "What a monster, to have already filled in the gaps and connected all the realms into a cycle?"</p><p></p><p>Receiving his master's affirmation, Xu Yan grew even more excited.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven and Earth realm uses martial principles as its foundation to open up a martial artist's heaven and earth, embodying heaven and earth. But this doesn't mean the Heaven and Earth realm has already transcended heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"It only means embodying heaven and earth, equaling the external heaven and earth. Using one's own heaven and earth to shake this great heaven and earth, truly possessing the might of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating the Heaven and Earth realm is very difficult. One needs to incorporate one's martial principles, spirit platform, primordial spirit and so on into one's heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"With different insights, the heavens and earth naturally differ. The Heaven and Earth realm varies from person to person, each being different..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued explaining the theory of the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>After finishing explaining the theory of the Heaven and Earth realm, the concept of this realm had been presented. Only after Xu Yan had an intuitive understanding did Li Xuan begin to pass on the cultivation methods for the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan said, this realm was very difficult to cultivate and break through. But once broken through, it would be a huge improvement, truly not far from transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The martial methods of the Heaven and Earth realm were even harder to comprehend than the Break Void realm, more complex and harder to realize. The entire set of techniques was also longer.</p><p></p><p>"Although the Heaven and Earth realm martial methods are more complex, involving more aspects, with Xu Yan's monstrous talent, he will ultimately be able to comprehend it.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he successfully comprehends the Heaven and Earth realm, the realms above it will become somewhat easier.</p><p></p><p>"It can be said that the Heaven and Earth realm is a huge leap. From this realm onwards, one begins to touch upon the level of the Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently to himself.</p><p></p><p>The information given by the Golden Book of the Great Dao for the Heaven and Earth realm:</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth realm: Technique completion: Medium.</p><p>Realm connection: Medium-low. </p><p>Comprehension difficulty: High.</p><p>Cultivation difficulty: High+.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan racked his brains, wanting the Heaven and Earth realm to be powerful enough yet easy to cultivate, but he could never reduce the cultivation difficulty.</p><p></p><p>In the end he could only settle on this. But he believed that with Xu Yan's monstrous talent, he would be able to comprehend and successfully cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>It was perfect timing, as Xu Yan would be venturing into the Divine Realm, traveling through its heaven and earth, gaining insight into its mysteries. This would help him comprehend the Heaven and Earth realm and understand how to embody heaven and earth in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began imparting the martial methods of the Heaven and Earth realm. Xu Yan listened with full concentration, his expression solemn. He realized this realm was extremely important, an extraordinary realm.</p><p></p><p>Once entering this realm, one would truly set foot on the path to the pinnacle of martial arts, taking a crucial step towards transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This time, in passing on the Heaven and Earth realm martial methods, Li Xuan made an exception and explained it three times. Xu Yan also unprecedentedly asked several questions about the martial methods.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patiently answered them all.</p><p></p><p>Only after Xu Yan had thoroughly memorized and gained an initial understanding of the Heaven and Earth realm martial methods was the transmission finally complete.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu and Fang Hao, who had been quietly listening on the side, were shocked. It was too profound, too powerful, too difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, the further one advanced in martial arts, the harder it became to comprehend and break through.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also firmly memorized the techniques. After all, the cultivation methods of medicine-based martial arts were similar to pure martial arts, with realm advancements being the same.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was pondering. The path of qimen martial arts had already been determined. He just needed to keep cultivating.</p><p></p><p>But he had not yet fully comprehended the path ahead.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth wonder patterns are difficult to condense. The difficulty is very high."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sighed inwardly, then became excited again. Once successfully condensed, when he deployed the heaven and earth qimen, it would be like heaven and earth itself.</p><p></p><p>Those who entered his qimen would be as if entering his heaven and earth. Within his heaven and earth, life and death, everything would be under his control.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

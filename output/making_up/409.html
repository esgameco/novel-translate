        <h1>Chapter 409</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained sitting calmly in his chair, as if he hadn't just taken action, fully embodying the image of an unfathomable master.</p><p></p><p>"Carry on with whatever you need to do."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stopped Da Yue Emperor from coming to thank him.</p><p></p><p>Looking down, he saw the robe in his hand, which belonged to the assassin and had allowed them to sneak in undetected by Da Yue Emperor. </p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he gave the robe to Fang Hao, letting him study it himself.</p><p></p><p>"Work hard on your cultivation. You're all still too weak," Li Xuan sighed helplessly. </p><p></p><p>He had to put some pressure on his disciples, to prevent them from becoming too complacent or lazy.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, Master!" Su Lingxiu huffed angrily. Those Tianshadiying were truly despicable, coming to attack her and her junior brother at the Immortal Venerable level. It was too much!</p><p></p><p>"Could Duanxia Mountain be Tianshadiying's visible power base?" Da Yue Emperor was furious. This matter couldn't be left unresolved.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan was also enraged. He had wanted to return to the Nine Mountains Realm to settle accounts with Duanxia Mountain, but what if more assassins came while he was gone? Wouldn't he miss the chance to distinguish himself? After bowing respectfully to Li Xuan, Da Yue Emperor left. As for what he would do next, Li Xuan didn't concern himself with it.</p><p></p><p>Now that Tianshadiying's intentions were known, Da Yue Emperor wasn't foolish enough to stir up conflict between the Qinghua Realm and Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>Given the current situation in Qinghua Realm, they only needed to maintain stability. The overall strength of Qinghua Realm's martial world would continue to grow stronger. Rashly starting a war or conflict would not be wise.</p><p></p><p>But they also couldn't have no response at all.</p><p></p><p>The assassination attempt on Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu was no longer just an issue for one faction in Da Yue Country, but a matter for all three major powers of Qinghua Realm, and even the entire Qinghua martial world.</p><p></p><p>Of course, for now, this matter should not be widely spread, to avoid giving Tianshadiying opportunities to create unrest.</p><p></p><p>After this assassination attempt, Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu began secluding themselves to cultivate diligently, striving for an early breakthrough. </p><p></p><p>Facing an Immortal Venerable, their strength was still far too weak.</p><p></p><p>The disturbance was minor. Just as ripples were stirred up, they quickly settled. So Da Yue Country remained peaceful, with the Medicine Hall and Qimen Hall continuing as normal.</p><p></p><p>Feng Yan cultivated divine abilities while guarding the gate.</p><p></p><p>Yue Changming and the others also began to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is about to descend into chaos!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at a certain area of the Divine Realm where the laws of heaven and earth were fluctuating violently, clearly becoming turbulent.</p><p></p><p>"Chaos can be good. Geniuses rise in chaotic times. It's time for my disciples to show their abilities. It will also be beneficial for Xu Yan and Meng Chong to rise up."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't care whether the Divine Realm was in chaos or not.</p><p></p><p>That was for the powerful beings of the Divine Realm to worry about. As an aloof expert, he didn't concern himself with such matters.</p><p></p><p>The assassination attempt seemed not to have stirred up any waves, but in reality the storm was just beginning.</p><p></p><p>The three major powers of Qinghua Realm all began taking action, strengthening their control over Qinghua Realm. Especially at the Qinghua Realm border, they directly dispatched Immortal Venerables to guard it.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Da Yue Emperor, the Sect Master of Tianwu Gate, and the Sect Master of Wanlei Sect conducted an inspection of the Immortal Venerables under their respective factions, to ensure there were no Tianshadiying infiltrators.</p><p></p><p>Two Immortal Venerables coming to attack directly, with one of them being an Immortal Venerable from Duanxia Mountain in the Nine Mountains Realm, showed how deep Tianshadiying's infiltration went.</p><p></p><p>However, since Qinghua Realm was not a major realm among the 36 realms, and was connected to the Spirit Realm, it had not received much attention from Tianshadiying, so their infiltration was not too deep.</p><p></p><p>Minor disturbances appeared in various parts of Qinghua Realm, but the impact was not great. The entire Qinghua martial world continued to develop vigorously, with sword cultivators and body cultivators beginning to emerge.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao studied that robe and gained some insights:</p><p></p><p>"Master, there's a certain aura contained in this robe that's somewhat similar to the aura of heaven and earth laws, but seems more profound. What exactly is it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, inscribing a trace of Dao principle essence onto a jade talisman, and said: "This is the essence of Dao principles. If you can comprehend it, the transmission talismans you refine will be able to transmit messages across the entire world, without distance limitations."</p><p></p><p>This strand of Dao principle essence was one of the Taisang Dao principles, and also one of the principles Li Xuan had been contemplating the most recently.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. Disciple understands!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was overjoyed. </p><p></p><p>He took the jade talisman to study it.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, don't go back for now. The Nine Mountains Realm border may already be under control. Wait a while longer," Fang Hao instructed Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!" Little Ha nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to contemplate the general outline of the Taisang Scripture. The Divine Ability Martial Canon was also being continuously improved, advancing towards the goal of 3,000 divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities exclusive to Extreme Soul martial arts, martial art secret techniques, Extreme Soul weapons, etc. were also being continuously refined.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Jiang Buping was not far from entering the gateway of Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Since Jiang Buping was originally a True King Venerable realm martial artist with an innate divine soul, after fusing with the Undissipating Qi and converting to Extreme Soul martial arts, his strength would not be weaker than a True King Venerable realm martial artist, only stronger.</p><p></p><p>The martial techniques that should exist in Extreme Soul martial arts must be perfected as much as possible and arranged properly.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciples Xu Yan and Meng Chong have slain eight True King Venerables. Your martial experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong have joined forces? They must be retaliating against Tianshadiying."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. Xu Yan and Meng Chong joining forces to kill so many True King Venerables was very likely retaliation against Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>After all, Meng Chong had just been hunted by Tianshadiying, and Xu Yan had also been targeted before.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm is likely to descend into chaos. Will Tianshadiying's Immortal Venerables take action personally?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword divine ability, ordinary Immortal Venerables would not be able to break through his defense in one strike.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, given Xu Yan and Meng Chong's speed, even Immortal Venerables might not be able to catch up to them.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what happens. Xu Yan and Meng Chong are no longer novices in the martial world. They know how to avoid crises and evade pursuit by powerful beings."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to focus his attention on his own martial pursuits.</p><p></p><p>Even if top Immortal Venerables took action, Xu Yan and Meng Chong had his life-saving jade talismans, so they would not face mortal danger. If the talismans were triggered, it would be time for him to make a trip to the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has broken through to the Divine Phase realm. Your Void-Breaking realm has reached small success."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had finally broken through.</p><p></p><p>And Li Xuan's Medicine Martial Dao had also advanced to small success in the Void-Breaking realm along with Su Lingxiu's breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has undergone extreme transformation, metamorphosing into an Evergreen Sacred Physique. You have obtained an Innate Indestructible Sacred Physique."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had also completed her transformation during her breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased again!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The Innate Indestructible Sacred Physique seemed to contain a sense of eternal indestructibility.</p><p></p><p>"My primordial spirit has also changed, containing a sacred aura."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan discovered that his spirit platform contained an indestructible essence, while his primordial spirit contained a sacred aura that seemed impervious to any evil or impure invasion, able to purify all evil and impurity.</p><p></p><p>With Su Lingxiu's breakthrough, she also began to comprehend divine abilities, continuing to seclude herself to consolidate her realm. The affairs of the Medicine Hall were left to Yue'er and the others to handle.</p><p></p><p>Following Su Lingxiu, whether it was Yue'er, Zhou Ying, or Meng Shushu, they also</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>By now, she had already mastered the art of alchemy and learned how to refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>She was more than capable of teaching the talented newcomers who came to learn the art of alchemy. In the time that followed, Su Lingxiu comprehended two more divine abilities and increased her own strength.</p><p></p><p>Her skill in medicinal alchemy improved greatly. </p><p></p><p>The Medicinal Alchemy Classic was updated and upgraded once again, making another huge leap forward.</p><p></p><p>Her alchemy skills became even more miraculous. Su Lingxiu could now easily condense the power of heavenly and earthly laws and incorporate it into her alchemy.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the elixir that Da Yue Emperor and the others had long been waiting for - one that could increase the chances of breaking through to the Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm - was finally about to be refined.</p><p></p><p>The first thing Su Lingxiu did after coming out of seclusion was to refine this elixir to aid in breaking through to Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>It was also a type of elixir that could enhance one's divine form.</p><p></p><p>She combined several precious divine herbs according to their different effects and proportions, then condensed the power of heavenly and earthly laws and fused it in, beginning the elixir refinement process.</p><p></p><p>As the elixir was nearing completion, Su Lingxiu even extracted a wisp of the essence of heaven and earth and fused it into the elixir.</p><p></p><p>This was Su Lingxiu's first time using the heavenly and earthly divine flames, combined with the divine furnace alchemy technique, and further aided by the divine ability of the hundred-refinement divine furnace, to refine an elixir.</p><p></p><p>Only three pills were produced.</p><p></p><p>When the elixirs were completed, they were surrounded by a medicinal halo and seemed to have a sense of unity with heaven and earth, as mysterious as a divine form.</p><p></p><p>It was also like an Immortal Heavenly Venerable, at one with heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Finally successful."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu smiled.</p><p></p><p>She immediately took one of the pills. In an instant, she felt her newly broken through realm improve somewhat, her strength increase, and her martial divine form become more solid and a bit stronger.</p><p></p><p>"According to my calculations, this elixir should be able to increase the chances of breaking through to Immortal Heavenly Venerable by 50%."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu pondered for a moment before making this judgment.</p><p></p><p>Such a precious elixir would naturally need to be sold for a good price.</p><p></p><p>Next, Su Lingxiu began refining elixirs again. This time she increased the quantity, producing five pills.</p><p></p><p>When Da Yue Emperor learned of this, he was overjoyed. With the aid of these elixirs, it meant they could increase the number of Immortal Heavenly Venerable powerhouses! Each additional Immortal Heavenly Venerable would greatly enhance the strength of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the entire Qinghua Realm, just in the Da Yue Kingdom itself, there were many former prodigies who were stuck at the peak of True King Heavenly Venerable, or even the half-step Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm, unable to break through and advance any further.</p><p></p><p>With the aid of these elixirs, some would surely be able to break through to the Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if Immortal Heavenly Venerables who broke through using elixirs were slightly weaker, they were still Immortal Heavenly Venerables after all, far beyond what True King Heavenly Venerables or half-step Immortals could compare to.</p><p></p><p>When the Sect Master of Tianwu Gate and the Sect Master of Wanlei Sect learned of this news, they rushed over in person.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the three major forces very tacitly suppressed this news, after all, the lurking force of Tianshadiying was still eyeing them covetously, to avoid any complications.</p><p></p><p>Next, naturally, it was time to discuss the price of the elixirs. The divine herbs needed to refine the elixirs would of course be provided by the three major forces. According to Su Lingxiu's terms, five portions of divine herbs would be exchanged for one portion of elixir.</p><p></p><p>After all, there was always the possibility of failure when refining elixirs.</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Emperor and the other two didn't dare to haggle, and all agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>The divine herbs needed to refine the elixirs were ultimately rare and precious, which meant they couldn't be mass-produced in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Lingxiu refined elixirs according to her mood, and didn't spend all her time on alchemy.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, this transaction made everyone happy.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Su Lingxiu's breakthrough, Fang Hao's Qimen martial arts also improved, reaching a level comparable to the Divine Form realm.</p><p></p><p>"There's turmoil in another part of the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly looked towards a certain place, where the laws of heaven and earth were in turmoil in a corner of the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Great chaos is also a great era. It seems there have been some changes in heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>Under his Heavenly Dao Eye, he could see some subtle changes in heaven and earth, which clearly came from the turmoil in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>And this turmoil must be the work of Tianshadiying.</p><p></p><p>"It seems the Nine Mountains Realm is about to be in chaos too."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly looked towards the Nine Mountains Realm. At such close range, he saw the turmoil in the laws of heaven and earth, as if a great battle was about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>"But these are all small matters."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled calmly and withdrew his gaze, about to continue studying the Taicang Book, when suddenly his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, and in this instant, he saw the sky begin to shake, and the power of the Dao was activated at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom! It was as if an invisible sound resounded between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even top Immortal Heavenly Venerables like Da Yue Emperor couldn't perceive this sound, but Li Xuan could hear it.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, the entire Divine Realm's heaven and earth began to ripple and fluctuate.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth are in turmoil, what has happened? Could it be that some supreme beings are trying to descend into the Divine Realm from above?" No, that's not right. If that were the case, how could it not be concealed from people?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned deeply.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the Divine Realm's heaven and earth disappeared in just an instant, but in that instant of turmoil, it seemed as if a force was trying to break through the barrier of the Divine Realm, wanting to enter.</p><p></p><p>"This disturbance isn't that big, it poses no threat to me. Even if I can't destroy it with one punch, two punches should do it. It's a small matter."</p><p></p><p>After evaluating the situation, Li Xuan continued to remain calm and composed.</p><p></p><p>No matter what happened, the force that caused this momentary turmoil in heaven and earth was still too weak to pose a threat to him.</p><p></p><p>"This Taicang world is becoming more and more interesting. Why do I always feel like there's a black hand plotting something?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>A few days later.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Heaven and earth shook again, just like last time. Li Xuan took a glance and then continued to study the main principles of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, there was another disturbance.</p><p></p><p>For the next half month, there were no more disturbances, and the Divine Realm seemed to return to peace.</p><p></p><p>"A great war is about to break out in the Nine Mountains Realm. Oh, what's this..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Nine Mountains Realm and suddenly discovered that there seemed to be an aura from outside heaven and earth entering the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the past, he might not have been able to detect this, but now with his Heavenly Dao Eye and his familiarity with the Taicang world, he immediately noticed.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the Blood Sons of the Netherworld. Tianshadiying is willing to introduce outside enemies to achieve their goals."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan and Meng Chong were in the Nine Mountains Realm, Li Xuan wasn't worried at all.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had already become a True King Heavenly Venerable, and his strength was among the top in the same realm of True King Heavenly Venerables.</p><p></p><p>He had also cultivated three divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Wu Tiannan frowned slightly, not knowing why he felt his luck had been too good lately.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since coming to the Divine Realm, since successfully cultivating divine abilities, his martial arts cultivation seemed to be becoming smoother and faster.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the unkempt old man lying on a large rock, with messy hair and scruffy beard, and a hint of wariness flashed in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 76 True Martial Arts vs. False Martial Arts? (Seeking monthly votes)</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand now!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a look of enlightenment on his face as he said, "As long as they are enemies, we must grind their bones to powder and extinguish their souls, and we cannot be soft-hearted!</p><p></p><p>"If the other party has a powerful background and strong backers, then after eliminating them, we must erase the traces and dissociate ourselves from it. </p><p></p><p>"As long as no one knows about it, it has nothing to do with us!"</p><p></p><p>This is the experience of navigating the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Although the master is unfathomable, it is obviously impossible for the truly powerful experts to constantly protect themselves. One must rely on one's own strength to resolve all enemies and troubles.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently, the eldest disciple was able to understand the "deeper meaning" behind his words, which was very good.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand too!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also had a look of sudden enlightenment. </p><p></p><p>He also felt that he had gained some insight, combining his own experience in the jianghu. When facing these enemies, he knew how to deal with them.</p><p></p><p>If he couldn't handle it himself, he would find someone to take the blame.</p><p></p><p>As long as they could grind the enemies' bones to powder and extinguish their souls, that would be fine.</p><p></p><p>Like when he took revenge before, he found Wu Huang to do it, clean and neat, wiping them all out!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was gratified, his second disciple had also gained enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>The two disciples were both extraordinary talents, the master was very pleased!</p><p></p><p>"Master, Blood Heartless said that the martial arts of the Inner Domain are divided into nine levels, and above the first level is the Refining Qi Master, who cultivates the internal qi of martial arts. But above the Refining Qi Master, there are still the Great Masters, why is it different?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked the doubt in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts the master taught were about refining the skin, bones, and organs, belonging to the basic realm of martial arts, not even considered as entering the door, while the entry level of martial arts is the Blood and Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the Blood and Qi realm is the Innate realm.</p><p></p><p>The Refining Qi Master realm of the Inner Domain martial arts is similar to the Innate realm, also able to control qi and fly, but they do not cultivate the true innate qi, but the internal qi of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Master, our place is a remote and desolate land, where the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have dissipated, so how can martial artists be cultivated here?"</p><p></p><p>According to Blood Heartless, in the remote and desolate lands, the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have dissipated, the spiritual energy is violent, and the creatures of the remote and desolate lands, being in the heaven and earth without spiritual mechanisms, are unable to perceive the existence of spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>They cannot rely on spiritual energy to cultivate martial arts either.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy in heaven and earth, having lost its spiritual mechanisms, has become violent and cannot be guided into the body.</p><p></p><p>This is quite different from the martial arts the master taught.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded beside him, also with a curious expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, his gaze deep, without directly answering, but instead asked, "Disciples, when you fought with Blood Heartless, how did you find his strength?"</p><p></p><p>"He was a bit formidable, I almost couldn't match him, of course it was because of my lack of experience, but he was also injured. If I was at the peak of the Blood and Qi realm, and Blood Heartless was at his peak condition without any injuries, I'm confident I wouldn't lose to him, and might even defeat him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought about it and evaluated Blood Heartless's strength, then said, "Blood Heartless is already at the Refining Qi Master realm, while I'm only at the entry level of martial arts, the Blood and Qi realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and said, "You are only at the entry level of martial arts, the Blood and Qi realm, while he is already a Refining Qi Master. The true martial arts are self-evident!"</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xu Yan gained enlightenment!</p><p></p><p>What's the difference between the nine levels, the eight levels, the five levels, the three levels, and the first level? They sound mysterious, but the martial arts he cultivated, the refining of skin, bones, and organs, with thunderous tendons and bones, and qi and blood like a fierce storm, sounded much more powerful than the first level, the third level, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand now, their martial arts are false martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exclaimed with sudden enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also understood, with a look of sudden realization: "So the so-called Masters are actually false Innate, their strength is much weaker than the true Innate realm, no wonder he couldn't kill me with one strike!"</p><p></p><p>Now everything was clear.</p><p></p><p>Blood Heartless's martial arts were not true martial arts, his strength was too weak, that's why he couldn't kill him with one strike.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled without speaking, this was all the disciples' own enlightenment, he didn't say those were false martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Of course, the martial arts he created were not just false or fake, whoever was stronger, that would be the true martial arts!</p><p></p><p>Currently, it seems that the martial arts he created are still stronger.</p><p></p><p>As for the future, whether it will lead to a dispute between true and false martial arts, that is not something Li Xuan is concerned about.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood and Qi realm should correspond to the first, second, and third levels, it's just that the Blood and Qi realm is stronger than the top three levels of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has a Jade Bone foundation, his strength is far beyond ordinary Blood and Qi realm cultivators, so he can cross the boundary to fight against the Refining Qi Masters of the Inner Domain. If it's a Golden Bone foundation, they can also fight against the Refining Qi Masters of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"But for those with Copper Bone or Iron Bone foundations in the Blood and Qi realm, they cannot fight against the Refining Qi Masters, although they are still stronger than the top three levels of the Inner Domain."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan inwardly evaluated the strength difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>In the Inner Domain, the Refining Qi Masters are certainly far stronger than the first level martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"The Refining Qi Masters cultivate the internal qi of martial arts, it's just a different name, it can also be called true qi. The only difference is the cultivation method of martial arts, the true qi they cultivate is not as powerful, pure, and high-quality as the innate true qi.</p><p></p><p>"Although I'm only at the entry level of the Innate realm, my strength is not inferior to the Great Masters of the Inner Domain."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made a comparison and evaluation of the two martial arts systems.</p><p></p><p>The Blood and Qi realm corresponds to the top three levels of the Inner Domain, and the Blood and Qi realm cultivators are stronger than the top three level martial artists of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>The Innate realm actually corresponds to the Refining Qi Masters of the Inner Domain, they both cultivate true qi, but the innate true qi of the Innate realm is stronger than the internal qi of the Refining Qi Masters, so the Innate realm is naturally stronger.</p><p></p><p>"For an Innate realm cultivator with an Iron Bone foundation, their strength is a bit closer to the Refining Qi Masters of the Inner Domain, about 30% to 50% stronger.</p><p></p><p>"But for those with Copper Bone, Golden Bone, or Jade Bone foundations, they will be much stronger."</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Refining Qi Masters of the Inner Domain also have varying degrees of strength.</p><p></p><p>But overall, the Innate realm cultivators are still a step ahead.</p><p></p><p>The stronger the foundation, the greater the strength difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Masters in the Inner Domain are already at the peak, is there anything stronger above the Great Masters?"</p><p></p><p>Blood Heartless is a Refining Qi Master, and he should be quite familiar with the martial arts of the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>"No matter what is above the Great Masters, for now they pose no threat to me. Xu Yan is not far from reaching the peak of the Blood and Qi realm.</p><p></p><p>"Once Xu Yan breaks through to the Innate realm, my strength will be even greater.</p><p></p><p>"The realms above the Innate realm should also be created soon, I'll pass on the cultivation methods to Xu Yan after he breaks through the Innate realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, the martial arts world of the Inner Domain does not pose much threat to him.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong enters the martial arts, the feedback from the golden finger will also allow him to rise to a higher level.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have dissipated in the remote and desolate lands, so how can martial artists be cultivated here?"</p><p></p><p>Since the differences between the martial arts have been answered.</p><p></p><p>The problem of not being able to cultivate martial artists in the remote and desolate lands is now in front of them.</p><p></p><p>Does that mean they have to go to the Inner Domain to cultivate?</p><p></p><p>Although he really wants to go to the Inner Domain to roam, the time is not yet right, his parents and family members are too weak to suppress the remote and desolate lands.</p><p></p><p>"You are already a martial artist!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He laughed and said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled for a moment, then slapped his forehead and said, "That's right, I'm already a martial artist, but why did Blood Wuxin say that in the remote borderlands, the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have dissipated, making it impossible to produce martial artists?"</p><p></p><p>He had already entered the martial dao, belonging to the realm of qi and blood, and the subsequent cultivation would involve the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. He needed to absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth in order to break through to the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, according to Blood Wuxin's words, the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth have dissipated, making it impossible to absorb the spiritual energy into the body. Does that mean I can't break through to the Xiantian realm in the borderlands?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>"That's just Blood Wuxin's view, that's their cultivation of the martial dao, but your cultivation is not the inner domain martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the somewhat worried Xu Yan and couldn't help but laugh.</p><p></p><p>"What if there is no spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth? You can use your own body as a bridge to communicate with heaven and earth, why do you need the assistance of the spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned when he heard this, and a flash of insight appeared in his mind, his eyes brightening as he said, "I understand now, that's how it is!"</p><p></p><p>The bridge of heaven and earth! </p><p></p><p>Why is it necessary to penetrate the bridge of heaven and earth to break through the Xiantian realm? It is precisely to use one's own body as a bridge to communicate with heaven and earth and absorb the spiritual energy of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>This is the true martial dao.</p><p></p><p>There is no need to rely on the external spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth to cultivate!</p><p></p><p>So the martial dao cultivated by the inner domain martial artists must be a false martial dao!</p><p></p><p>"It's good that you understand!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Looking up towards the endless mountains, what kind of world is the inner domain? </p><p></p><p>The inner domain should be easier to find a demonic disciple, right?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought so.</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin fled to the remote borderlands, and it shouldn't be long before the inner domain discovers Blood Wuxin's trail, and perhaps someone will come to hunt him down in the borderlands.</p><p></p><p>Although the borderlands are special, and Blood Wuxin has fled here, he can cultivate by devouring spirit blood, but for other martial artists who come to the borderlands, once they consume too much, their recovery will be very slow.</p><p></p><p>For other martial artists, they will not rashly come to hunt him down.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan believes that there will certainly be someone who will come to hunt him down.</p><p></p><p>So he said, "Blood Wuxin came from the inner domain, and there will certainly be other martial artists who will come here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were startled.</p><p></p><p>"I want to enter the martial dao in one month!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong clenched his fists and said firmly.</p><p></p><p>He didn't want to experience the frustration of almost being killed by Blood Wuxin again!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong went to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>He had already broken through the copper bone bottleneck and could now temper the golden bone. After the golden bone, there was also the golden diamond bone.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at his master, his gaze resolute as he said, "Master, I want to learn the sword art!"</p><p></p><p>Although the Descending Dragon Palm was extremely powerful, he felt it was not enough!</p><p></p><p>Blood Wuxin's sword technique was actually very powerful, and in the initial confrontation, it posed a considerable threat to him.</p><p></p><p>If he knew the sword art, he would not have fallen behind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this, as he had noticed the sword hanging at Xu Yan's waist the first time he saw him.</p><p></p><p>Even though he cultivated the martial dao and the Descending Dragon Palm, he still often wore a sword at his waist.</p><p></p><p>This showed that he liked the sword!</p><p></p><p>And since he had found a precious sword in the Qi Emperor's treasury, he had not brought it with him in his hurry to go to the capital city this time.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already made preparations.</p><p></p><p>For the two disciples, how to cultivate them, what martial techniques and skills to impart to them, Li Xuan had already made plans.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, cultivate both the palm and the sword, mastering both!</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, it would be the knife and the fist, unparalleled in both!</p><p></p><p>As for other martial techniques and skills, the disciples would have to comprehend them through their own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He gave the disciples a framework, and they could put anything they wanted into it.</p><p></p><p>Whenever the disciples went to the inner domain to venture forth, they could absorb the essence of the martial dao there and put it into this framework, and it would become their own.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the martial dao skills from the inner domain as a reference, it would be relatively easier for him to edit the subsequent skills, and he would not be completely without direction.</p><p></p><p>But one thing that must be taken seriously is that the subsequent realm skills he edits must be stronger than the martial dao of the inner domain!</p><p></p><p>Only in this way can he truly establish the authenticity of the martial dao he imparts!</p><p></p><p>"If my martial dao is spread, whew!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was suddenly alarmed, if it was spread, it would certainly eliminate the existing martial dao of the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>This would provoke a dao dispute!</p><p></p><p>"Can't be too hasty, need to steady the hand, at least wait until the disciples are strong enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt he needed to steady his hand.</p><p></p><p>To rashly provoke a true and false dispute, this storm would be too great for his current strength to withstand.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his goal is to edit skills and recruit demonic disciples, to make himself strong and invincible.</p><p></p><p>He cannot get entangled in the disputes and be hindered in becoming stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Can start from the borderlands!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a plan in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Start promoting his martial dao from the borderlands, and when the strength of the borderlands rises, the martial artists from the borderlands go to the inner domain, his martial dao will slowly spread out.</p><p></p><p>Even if it provokes a true and false dispute, he can hide in the background and watch the unfolding events.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is just a rough idea, whether to implement it, how to implement it, and whether it can be implemented, are all unknown.</p><p></p><p>The most important thing now is to strengthen himself and let his disciples become strong as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Only when the disciples are strong, and can successfully cultivate the skills he has edited, will he have a more bountiful harvest.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the expectant Xu Yan, Li Xuan nodded and said, "Okay, you can settle down today, and come to your master tomorrow for the gains from your battle with Blood Wuxin."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll go back to the East River Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>That precious sword is still at home in the East River Prefecture, he didn't bring it with him.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the diligently cultivating Meng Chong, Li Xuan said to the just returned Stone Two, "You can make Meng Chong's meal."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan got up from the chair, holding Blood Wuxin's long sword in one hand and the bag left behind by Blood Wuxin in the other, and entered the room.</p><p></p><p>This bag was something he deliberately left behind.</p><p></p><p>After entering the room, he placed the long sword aside, this was not an ordinary steel weapon, but a treasure sword that could carry true qi.</p><p></p><p>Opening the bag, there was a small booklet inside, with a bloody color, clearly not an orthodox object.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Wuxin's cultivation technique!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted, there was indeed a harvest.</p><p></p><p>He took out the small booklet.</p><p></p><p>In the bag, there were also two milky white crystal stones, which Li Xuan took out and sensed the spiritual energy contained within them.</p><p></p><p>"These should be the spiritual stones or spiritual crystals of the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>Since the inner domain has the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth, the existence of stones or crystals containing spiritual energy is only natural.</p><p></p><p>However, it is obvious that these are extremely rare objects, and even though Blood Wuxin is a Zongshi realm martial artist, he only has two spiritual crystals.</p><p></p><p>He relied on spirit blood for healing, not spiritual crystals, so there is no issue of consuming spiritual crystals for healing.</p><p></p><p>Fundamentally, spiritual crystals are scarce, and even this Zongshi doesn't have many.</p><p></p><p>Just a note on the updates, unless there are special circumstances, there will be updates at around 6 pm and 8 pm, with relatively fixed update times.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter is complete)</p>

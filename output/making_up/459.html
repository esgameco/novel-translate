        <h1>Chapter 459</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>As long as Jiang Buping was willing to make a move, that would be enough. After all, based on the brilliance Jiang Buping had displayed so far, he surpassed the divine Meng Chong by several degrees.</p><p></p><p>Even if he couldn't achieve victory, as long as he wounded Meng Chong and weakened his strength, their Wanbao Alliance would have a chance.</p><p></p><p>When two powerful experts fight, it inevitably consumes a huge amount of energy.</p><p></p><p>And once their energy is greatly depleted, no matter how strong they are, they won't be able to withstand an attack from multiple people.</p><p></p><p>It was for this reason that Hong Yi agreed readily.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then it's settled. Let me make it clear in advance - I don't guarantee victory, I only promise to make one move," Jiang Buping emphasized.</p><p></p><p>"It's enough that you're willing to make one move, young friend!" Hong Yi nodded with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll await your soul treasure!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping turned and left, stepping through the boundary gate to enter the next realm.</p><p></p><p>As Jiang Buping continuously slaughtered numerous immortal heavenly lords and his notoriety spread far and wide, at some point voices calling for his suppression arose in the divine realm. They portrayed Jiang Buping as a vicious person who would bring calamity to the divine realm if not killed, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The momentum to suppress Jiang Buping grew stronger and stronger. There must have been powerful forces fanning the flames behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping turned out to be an unexpected delight," Tian Shiqi said in the Longshan Realm, looking surprised as he listened to his subordinate's report.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. Let's use Jiang Buping to further throw the divine realm into chaos."</p><p></p><p>The Tiansha Diying agents hidden in various major factions began to push for this development. For a time, Jiang Buping became someone that almost everyone wanted to kill, like a demon.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping, however, paid no attention to this at all.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the soul treasure from the Wanbao Alliance, he began to use it. As for sparring with his second senior brother, there was no rush for that.</p><p></p><p>When he reached the Taikun Realm and saw his second senior brother, he would just put on an act.</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance couldn't urge him on this matter either, and could only wait.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's reputation had spread throughout the divine realm. By now, no immortal heavenly lord dared to challenge him to battle alone.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Jiang Buping faced many assassination attempts. Unable to confront him openly, they resorted to underhanded methods instead.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, wherever Jiang Buping went, he encountered various assassination attempts.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping made no effort to conceal that he was heading towards the Taikun Realm, continuously putting mental pressure on Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, signs of great chaos in the divine realm became increasingly apparent. It was as if some behind-the-scenes mastermind was pushing the situation to develop.</p><p></p><p>Among the thirty-six realms, several had already erupted into large-scale wars of conquest. As a result, some of the heavenly caves had fallen, and beings from the netherworld, demon witches, and otherworldly true spirits had poured into the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, news spread that the divine Meng Chong had single-handedly pacified two warring realms with just his sword. He had killed several Blood Children, demon witches, and otherworldly true spirits who had invaded the divine realm.</p><p></p><p>He had also slain over a dozen immortal heavenly lords who were stirring up trouble. After killing the Wanbao Alliance's pursuers, Meng Chong had once again demonstrated his prowess.</p><p></p><p>Some well-informed powerful figures from major factions were looking forward to a battle between Meng Chong and Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>What surprised many major factions was that the Great Yan Dynasty had taken no action at all. They had neither targeted Jiang Buping nor participated in any actions involving Meng Chong and Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>They maintained an attitude of indifference.</p><p></p><p>News of the chaos in the divine realm had already reached the Bihai Realm. The immortal heavenly lords on Cloud Sky Island breathed a sigh of relief. As soon as Xu Yan entered the Bihai Realm, he had vanished without a trace.</p><p></p><p>As long as he wasn't here to cause trouble, they wouldn't be nervous about whatever Xu Yan came to do.</p><p></p><p>On the vast sea of the Bihai Realm, a lone small boat drifted aimlessly, having long since lost its bearings. Some sea beasts tried to jump onto the boat, only to be instantly killed by the boat's defensive formations when they made contact.</p><p></p><p>A sea spirit discovered this boat and was amazed by its beauty. Thinking it was ownerless, it tried to claim it for itself, but was killed on the spot when it triggered the boat's formations.</p><p></p><p>The disappearance of a weak sea spirit in the vast ocean naturally went unnoticed.</p><p></p><p>The sea was vast, and even though sea spirits were the overlords of the ocean, ruling over it, many patrolling sea spirits disappeared every year.</p><p></p><p>Some were killed by stronger sea beasts, while others encountered hidden dangers.</p><p></p><p>In any case, the disappearance of a weak sea spirit would not cause any ripples.</p><p></p><p>Inside the boat, there was a tortoise shell that looked as if it was covered in moss. It appeared completely ordinary, with no mysterious fluctuations or the aura of a treasure.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't know how long he had been staying in the small world within the Primordial Turtle Shell.</p><p></p><p>His spirit power emerged, enveloping the small world of the Primordial Turtle Shell, carefully combing through the rules contained within it.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of establishing the Dao was becoming clearer and clearer.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he felt he was just half a step away from comprehending the Establishing the Dao realm, and he was about to take that half step.</p><p></p><p>The jade bamboo plant before him was suffused with a hazy light. Fine, profound patterns, like the rules of heaven and earth, flowed across its surface. Spiritual energy poured into the jade bamboo, making its aura increasingly mysterious.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the divine realm had nothing to do with Xu Yan. He was even unaware of Jiang Buping's experiences.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he was fully immersed in comprehending the Establishing the Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>On Cloud Sky Island, Xie Lingfeng continued to cultivate diligently, pondering the way of the sword.</p><p></p><p>The reputations of Xu Yan and Meng Chong had already reached Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu and Brother Meng truly live up to their names," Xie Lingfeng sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had entered the inner regions from the frontier and quickly became famous, sweeping through undefeated.</p><p></p><p>It was much the same when he entered the spirit realm - he rose rapidly, sweeping through undefeated, his reputation spreading throughout the spirit realm with no one able to match him! Now, in just a few short years since entering the divine realm, his notoriety had already spread far and wide. He was slaughtering immortal heavenly lords as easily as squashing ants!</p><p></p><p>"I have a chance too!" Xie Lingfeng was filled with fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>As long as he broke through to the Void-breaking realm, with the power of his sword dao, it wouldn't be too difficult for him to slay immortal heavenly lords.</p><p></p><p>Although he couldn't do it as easily as Xu Yan and Meng Chong, who killed immortal heavenly lords like squashing ants, it wouldn't be too hard to kill immortal heavenly lords.</p><p></p><p>As long as he broke through to the Void-breaking realm, even if he encountered a top-tier immortal heavenly lord, he would be able to achieve victory.</p><p></p><p>The difficulty would increase somewhat, but it would still be enough to be proud of.</p><p></p><p>If his strength increased to the small accomplishment or even great accomplishment stage of the Void-breaking realm, killing top-tier immortal heavenly lords would become very easy.</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through to the Void-breaking realm is too difficult," Xie Lingfeng sighed. It was already quite remarkable that he had broken through to the Divine Appearance realm in such a short time.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough to the Void-breaking realm couldn't be achieved in a short period.</p><p></p><p>"Twenty years or thirty years?" At his level of strength, twenty or thirty years was considered a short time.</p><p></p><p>"I should find an opportunity to return to the Qinghua Realm and seek guidance from Xu Yan. Perhaps I can break through earlier," Xie Lingfeng thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He continued to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>Since coming to Cloud Sky Island in the Bihai Realm, with his outstanding talent and sword dao, he naturally enjoyed some preferential treatment.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly cave was relatively peaceful, without major disturbances. Apart from occasionally entering the heavenly cave to train, he spent most of his time in secluded cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was also in secluded cultivation. Although he had long anticipated that his son would surpass him, when that day arrived so quickly, he felt somewhat depressed as a father. The only...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Only through bitter cultivation could one resolve the melancholy in one's heart.</p><p></p><p>During secluded cultivation, the concept of time was weak. One didn't even know how long they had been cultivating bitterly.</p><p></p><p>One day.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A thunderous sound like crashing waves rang out. Cloud Sky Island trembled slightly. All the martial artists in secluded cultivation were startled back to awareness.</p><p></p><p>"Something big has happened!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all those in secluded cultivation emerged from their places of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>The first thing they thought of was chaos in the Heavenly Cave!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's expression also tightened as he came out of the cultivation chamber.</p><p></p><p>"Father, what happened?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng's expression was solemn as he gazed into the distant horizon without answering.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng followed his gaze and saw a blood-red light shooting up into the sky in the distance, like a giant funnel or a blood-colored vortex.</p><p></p><p>Even from such a far distance, one could feel the terrifying aura.</p><p></p><p>"What is that?"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, beneath the blood-colored vortex, as if it were a giant mouth, a huge blood-colored shadow could be vaguely seen appearing and disappearing in the waves.</p><p></p><p>"Not good, that's Small Eternal Island!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a martial artist cried out.</p><p></p><p>Small Eternal Island was one of the large islands in the Azure Sea Realm, adjacent to a Heavenly Cave, with an Immortal Lord stationed on the island.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored vortex was right above where Small Eternal Island was located.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Waves of powerful auras came from the direction of Small Eternal Island. Then chains appeared in the sky, formed from the power of the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the voice of the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder rang out!</p><p></p><p>"All martial artists at the Refining Truth Realm and above, seal off 100,000 li of sea area and kill the blood-colored sea beast!"</p><p></p><p>As the Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder's voice rang out, the figure of Cloud Sky Island's Island Master descended from the sky and entered the Elder Hall of Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>Then, a hazy light rose up and spread out, covering all of Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sky Island Master borrowed the power of divine artifacts to take control of this part of heaven and earth on Cloud Sky Island.</p><p></p><p>"All martial artists at the Refining Truth Realm and above, go to Small Eternal Island to assist in suppressing it. Do not fail!"</p><p></p><p>The solemn voice of the Cloud Sky Island Master rang out.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, many martial artists flew towards Small Eternal Island.</p><p></p><p>The Cloud Sky Island Master had returned to preside over Cloud Sky Island, in case anything unexpected happened to Cloud Sky Island!</p><p></p><p>"Father, let's go!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said with an extremely solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Realm was facing a major crisis!</p><p></p><p>"It's time to display my peerless sword techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, don't be careless!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun advised worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's no big deal, I have the elder's jade talisman. I won't die!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng patted his chest and said.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng took a step forward and transformed into a sword light, flying towards Small Eternal Island.</p><p></p><p>Small Eternal Island had already disappeared, with all life on the island perishing.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave was like a blood-filled mouth, spewing out rolling blood energy, making this area of the sea seem to have turned into a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>A huge blood-colored ferocious beast, like an alligator, opened its giant mouth and was devouring Small Eternal Island. An Immortal Lord could be seen being swallowed into its mouth.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"Netherworld Blood Crocodile!"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder's expression was extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Cave had actually been taken control of, and clearly a expert beyond the Immortal Realm had intervened, forcibly expanding the Heavenly Cave and even allowing the Netherworld energy to invade, intending to turn this area of the sea into a Netherworld blood sea.</p><p></p><p>"How did a Netherworld Blood Crocodile lurk in the Azure Sea without anyone noticing?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder and a group of Sea Spirit Clan experts wielded divine artifacts in their hands, mobilizing the power of the Azure Sea to continuously suppress it.</p><p></p><p>However, the Netherworld Blood Crocodile was difficult to kill, and it was sending Netherworld energy towards the sky, diverting the power of heaven and earth's laws and causing disturbances in heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Waves of blood-colored figures poured out from the Heavenly Cave that was like a blood-filled giant mouth, forming into a beast tide and beginning to surge in all directions.</p><p></p><p>The blood sea surged, and this area of the sea seemed to have been polluted. The Sea Spirits felt extremely uncomfortable in this turbid sea.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a person with obsessive-compulsive cleanliness had been thrown into a muddy water pit, feeling extremely uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>A sword light slashed down, instantly killing a Netherworld ferocious beast.</p><p></p><p>"No blood disciples or blood children have come in, they're all beast species from the Netherworld. Are they planning to occupy the Azure Sea with Netherworld beast species?"</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder's expression was heavy.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Another thunderous sound rang out, and the entire Azure Sea's waters shook. The Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder's heart sank - another Heavenly Cave was experiencing disturbances.</p><p></p><p>"Silently and without warning, Small Eternal Island has fallen and this Heavenly Cave has been invaded. Who secretly created this?"</p><p></p><p>At one point, the image of Liu Yan, who had entered the Azure Sea Realm but disappeared without a trace, flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Then he shook his head, "It can't be Liu Yan."</p><p></p><p>For now, the only option was to find a way to suppress the Netherworld Blood Crocodile back into the Heavenly Cave and eliminate all the Netherworld ferocious beasts that had invaded the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>However, the Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder didn't notice that as the Netherworld blood energy shot up into the sky, at the top of the sky, there seemed to be a faint light absorbing the Netherworld blood energy, as if sending out some kind of signal.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was hunting Netherworld ferocious beasts, also using this to hone his sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>At one point, he looked up at the sky and his expression suddenly became horrified.</p><p></p><p>At some point, at the end of the blood light in the sky, an eye seemed to have appeared.</p><p></p><p>However, when he focused to look again, that eye seemed to have disappeared, as if the eye from earlier was just coincidentally an eye-shaped pattern formed by the swirling blood light.</p><p></p><p>Shocking waves rolled in the Azure Sea, shaking the entire ocean. Islands were swept over by huge waves, with houses being destroyed in the giant waves.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists took to the air, defending in all directions, with some martial artists attempting to block the huge waves outside the islands.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld blood energy began to condense, turning into a blood light several zhang in diameter, shooting straight up into the sky, as if a blood-colored pillar had been erected between heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, the laws of heaven and earth were surging.</p><p></p><p>Even more profound and mysterious powers of heaven and earth seemed to be being activated.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>At one point, the Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder looked up in confusion, unsure if it was his imagination, but he thought he had faintly heard the sound of something breaking somewhere in the sky.</p><p></p><p>"The sky can't possibly break."</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan Grand Elder continued with a solemn expression, leading a group of Sea Spirit Clan Immortal Lords to jointly suppress that blood-colored giant crocodile.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored giant crocodile raised its head to look at the sky, and in its eyes, it seemed to see something.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time. This blood crocodile body is also about to reach its limit of what it can bear."</p><p></p><p>Then it looked up in a certain direction, which was where Cloud Sky Island was located.</p><p></p><p>"With the last bit of power, let's destroy that island. This place will become the opening for the Netherworld to enter Tai Cang."</p><p></p><p>An even more powerful blood light surged from the giant crocodile's body, and a powerful aura was about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

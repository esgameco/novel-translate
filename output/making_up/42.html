        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 42: You All Are Too Unprofessional (Seeking Continued Reading)</p><p></p><p>The military strength of the Qi Kingdom was shockingly weak. Li Xuan felt that with his abilities, he would be like a god in the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>He could completely disregard the Qi Kingdom's court.</p><p></p><p>"Master shall go take a look at what tricks these people are playing."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan played with the jade ruyi scepter and walked with a leisurely pace to the courtyard gate, opening it.</p><p></p><p>Outside the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>A group of over ten people, all wearing coarse linen clothes, their faces solemn and grave. Leading them was an elderly man in linen clothes, who was also the top martial arts expert who had just spoken.</p><p></p><p>"Virtuous gentleman, greetings!" </p><p></p><p>The elderly man in linen clothes clasped his hands in front of his chest, bowing his head in salutation.</p><p></p><p>"What is the meaning of this, you all?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan rotated the jade ruyi scepter in his hand, feigning ignorance on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Virtuous gentleman, the Heavenly Mother is merciful and aids the common people. I observe the virtuous gentleman is handsome and wealthy. Would you be willing to donate to aid the common people?</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Mother's grace will bless the virtuous gentleman with peace and happiness!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, and after a moment of silence, he said, "You've come to ask for money, using the banner of aiding the common people, and there's nothing wrong with that.</p><p></p><p>"But can you act a little more seriously?"</p><p></p><p>He then raised his hand and pointed at the elderly man's hand, saying, "Look at you, wearing shabby clothes, pretending to be walking for the common people and relieving the suffering. But can you take off that big gold ring on your finger? At least try to hide it a bit!"</p><p></p><p>The elderly man in linen clothes had a dazed expression, lowering his head to look at his own hand, with a jade-inlaid gold ring on both his thumb and index finger.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze shifted to the middle-aged man beside the elderly man, sighing, "And you, wearing a valuable signet ring, outside in coarse linen clothes, but inside wearing a brocade-lined garment.</p><p></p><p>"You all are just too unprofessional!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan behind him, watching his master critique them, couldn't help but have a dumbfounded expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>And what his master said was completely right.</p><p></p><p>These Heavenly Mother Sect people, their acting was really poor.</p><p></p><p>And the man wearing the signet ring, he looked somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>After a long while, he exclaimed in surprise, "You're the Yunshan County Magistrate?"</p><p></p><p>The Yunshan County Magistrate, actually a member of the Heavenly Mother Sect?</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Mother Sect members fell silent, sinking into contemplation. In the past, when they approached wealthy families, the people would readily give them money, without noticing anything amiss. </p><p></p><p>But why was it different today?</p><p></p><p>"Your Lordship has excellent eyesight!" </p><p></p><p>The elderly man in linen clothes gleamed with insight. Since it had come to this, he could only be straightforward and use his martial prowess.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that I have excellent eyesight, it's that you all are just too sloppy," Li Xuan sighed, reaching out his hand to rest on the elderly man's shoulder. "With your performance like this, it's no wonder your rebellions have always failed."</p><p></p><p>The elderly man in linen clothes was now greatly alarmed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>A master! </p><p></p><p>A supreme master among supreme masters.</p><p></p><p>Beads of cold sweat were almost popping out on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>"This humble one is the Linen-Clad Dharma Protector of the Heavenly Mother Sect. May I ask which esteemed personage Your Lordship is in the jianghu?"</p><p></p><p>The elderly man in linen clothes stood stiffly, his internal energy coiled and ready to be unleashed, asking in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The County Magistrate and the others were now filled with trepidation. Xu Yan's master was actually a supreme master?</p><p></p><p>A supreme master of such a young age was truly rare.</p><p></p><p>They exchanged a glance, then suddenly attacked. </p><p></p><p>But they did not attack Li Xuan, instead they attacked Xu Yan, thinking that if they could capture the son of Lord Xu, their goal would be achieved.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Heavenly Mother Sect members attacking, Xu Yan's brow creased slightly. He raised his hand, his qi and blood surging, gently pressing down, and a powerful aura instantly suppressed them.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the County Magistrate and the others felt as if a mountain had descended upon them, and they all fell to the ground with a thud, unable to get up.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous fools!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly snorted.</p><p></p><p>He had held back, not directly killing them.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Everything would depend on the decision of the Shifu (master).</p><p></p><p>The old man in the hemp robe was terrified.</p><p></p><p>Who was this expert?</p><p></p><p>"Let's talk it out calmly, we have no ill intentions," the old man in the hemp robe said nervously.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the County Magistrate started shouting, "I am the Magistrate of Cloud Mountain County. Killing us would be an act of rebellion, you better think this through!"</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes widened, and his aura of blood energy surged, making the Magistrate feel like he was about to be crushed into mincemeat, terrifying him.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly said, "Stop, stop, Young Master Xu, your parents are now in danger, only our sect can save them. If you kill me, you must consider the consequences!"</p><p></p><p>"What did you say?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's angry expression emerged, his blood energy surging. The powerful aura frightened the old man in the hemp robe and the others from the Tianmu Sect, making their faces turn deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>"I'm telling the truth, but it has nothing to do with our sect!" the Magistrate said in a panic.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, what's going on?" Xu Yan demanded angrily, "If you dare to deceive me, I'll grind you to dust and feed you to the dogs!"</p><p></p><p>How long had he been away from home, and his parents were already in danger?</p><p></p><p>"Our sect received intel that the Governor of East River is preparing to raid the Xu family, confiscate their property and imprison them. I'm not lying!" the Magistrate said hurriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! He wants to court death? The Governor of East River, even if he had ten times the courage, he wouldn't dare to lay a hand on my Xu family!" Xu Yan sneered. "My grandfather is the Minister of Personnel of the current dynasty, how dare that East River Governor!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly surprised beside him, the background of this foolish disciple was indeed extraordinary. His father was the wealthiest man in East River, and his grandfather was the Minister of Personnel of the current dynasty. With such a background, he could be tyrannical not only in East River, but even in the capital city of Qi.</p><p></p><p>"The East River Governor wouldn't dare, but this is the intention of a powerful figure in the capital..." the Magistrate said, afraid of being killed by Xu Yan's wrath.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly continued, "It is rumored that in the struggle for the crown prince, the eldest prince has gained the upper hand. Minister Guo supports the third prince, so..."</p><p></p><p>The struggle for the crown prince, if one side won, the defeated side would not have a good ending. </p><p></p><p>Looking at it this way, the Xu family was indeed in grave danger.</p><p></p><p>"The struggle for the crown prince?" Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>He naturally didn't know about these matters, his mind was completely focused on seeking out hidden experts and wholeheartedly immersed in cultivating the martial dao after becoming Li Xuan's disciple. He hadn't paid much attention to the affairs of his own family, let alone the distant struggle for the crown prince in the capital.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow furrowed, and the oppressive aura receded, making the Magistrate heave a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He continued, "The East River General's Family broke off the engagement because they sensed that the faction of the third prince was losing ground in the struggle for the crown prince. They wanted to distance themselves in time."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was stunned, so the General's Family's broken engagement had such a hidden backstory?</p><p></p><p>The Magistrate carefully got up and said, "The East River Governor will probably make his move soon. Those with connections in East River all know that the Xu family is about to be finished.</p><p></p><p>"They are all eyeing the Xu family's businesses, wanting to tear off a piece for themselves."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan immediately became furious and scolded, "That old emperor is blind! My grandfather supports his third son, just to show him face, how can he do this to my family's business? </p><p></p><p>"Whoever dares to raid my family, I'll kill them!"</p><p></p><p>The Magistrate was overjoyed and said, "Young Master Xu, your determination is truly admirable. Join our Tianmu Sect, and let's rebel together!"</p><p></p><p>"Scram!" Xu Yan slapped the Magistrate, sending him flying.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, the crown prince struggle in this dynasty was truly a double-edged sword. If you won, it would be a great achievement. If you lost, it could mean the annihilation of your entire family. Even worse, the extermination of your nine clans!</p><p></p><p>The Xu family's crisis had suddenly arrived, but with Qi's low military strength, this was not a crisis for Xu Yan at all. Even if a thousand armies came, he could easily brush them aside.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gap between people is so vast that it is despairing.</p><p></p><p>The Seventy-Six Blood Disciple, as soon as he appeared, shattered the Divine Bridge and killed the Celestial Venerable, his might unparalleled. Yet, he was still unable to do anything to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Even martial experts like Wu Tian'nan and Xin Mengrong, who stood at the peak of the Spiritual Realm's martial dao, did not know how to feel at this moment. This crisis in the Spiritual Realm, and these top experts of the Spiritual Realm were unable to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Not only could they not intervene, they did not even dare to get close!</p><p></p><p>The slightest ripple would lead to their annihilation.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the fierce battle between Xu Yan and the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple raged on. Suddenly, towering giant swords rose up from the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>The surging waves transformed into giant swords, emanating a chilling sword intent. Even from afar, one could feel a sense of trepidation.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, he is the Sword Deity!"</p><p></p><p>Someone exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Such profound sword dao, apart from Xu Yan, there was no second person in the world.</p><p></p><p>After all, the great master had already transcended the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>As the sword formation arose, it began obstructing the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple again. Xu Yan also kept striking out with his palms, trying to cultivate the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand, a supreme technique.</p><p></p><p>Despite deploying the sword formation and various divine abilities, the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple was still slowly advancing towards Meng Chong's location. His speed had only slowed down.</p><p></p><p>On the Evergreen Pavilion, Li Xuanyi had been closely observing the battle. Seeing Xu Yan attempting to cultivate the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand, he couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>This supreme technique was one he had put a lot of effort into creating.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the hand, plucking the heavens and grasping the moon, its power was immense.</p><p></p><p>"Could the first supreme technique be cultivated successfully?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, true prodigies are the ones who grow through battle, especially when facing powerful opponents in perilous environments.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Lingxiu, who was not adept at nor fond of fighting, had seen a significant increase in her strength after this battle. Her combat experience was also rapidly accumulating.</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Abyss truly is an excellent place for martial artists to temper themselves," Li Xuanyi mused.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the collapsed Divine Bridge, he realized that with the bridge destroyed, the connection between the Spiritual Realm and the Divine Realm had been severed. Even if the Divine Realm wanted to send reinforcements, they would not be able to do so for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Divine Realm's Azure Flower Realm was likely in a state of turmoil.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Heavens and Earth may be facing some crisis," Li Xuanyi pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge was formed by the laws of heaven and earth, connecting the Spiritual Realm and the Divine Realm. However, this law was not particularly strong, not the true primal law of heaven and earth. That was why it was shattered by the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Bridge's law had collapsed, over time it would slowly reconnect and restore itself, but it would take a considerable amount of time.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued to rage on. One-third of the Blood Servants fighting against Meng Chong had already been slain.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also using this opportunity to temper himself, constantly deploying the Mysterious Gate martial arts, the formations continuously transforming, the Mysterious Gate Armory becoming a torrential flow to slaughter the Blood Servants.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also doing the same, using this chance to refine her own martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The Seventy-Six Blood Disciple was relentless. Even as Xu Yan tried his utmost to obstruct him, he remained grim-faced, not solely focused on Xu Yan, but trying his best to break free of Xu Yan's interference.</p><p></p><p>He was well aware that if he could not shake off Xu Yan, the plan for the Spiritual Realm would fail, and his ambition to ascend to become a Blood Progenitor would be shattered.</p><p></p><p>"Wretch, I will kill you!" The Seventy-Six Blood Disciple's killing intent was chilling. Xu Yan's obstruction was akin to blocking his martial dao path, his ascension to become a Blood Progenitor - this was his great vengeance!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, and in an instant, spiritual light appeared, as realization flooded his mind. At this moment, he felt he had truly comprehended the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand technique.</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a sweep of his hand, a giant hand instantly enveloped the space where the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple was, as if containing an entire space within it.</p><p></p><p>The Seventy-Six Blood Disciple suddenly felt a sense of darkness, as if the space itself had been constrained. He was seized by a powerful grasping force, feeling as if he was being held in the palm of a hand.</p><p></p><p>Alarmed, his blood-thirsty aura erupted furiously, his blood-red long blade slashing out a terrifying blood light.</p><p></p><p>However, in just that instant, he felt himself being flung away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was well aware that even though he had successfully cultivated the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand, he was still no match for the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple and could not suppress him.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose of cultivating this technique was to prevent the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple from approaching Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>So, the moment the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand grasped the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple, Xu Yan immediately flung him away.</p><p></p><p>He then swiftly followed, continuously striking with the Furious True Dragon, the Absolute Heaven Sword, and the Sword Containing Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The hand collapsed, and the blood light surged back, the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple's eyes burning with a blood-red flame, his fury uncontrollable.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized he was now further away from Meng Chong, having been flung back by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The two engaged in battle once again, with Xu Yan being pressed, yet he never fell in defeat, like an unsinkable little boat weathering the raging waves.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has successfully cultivated the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand, the supreme technique you created. He has mastered it completely," Li Xuanyi said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Continue to work hard and create even more powerful techniques," Li Xuanyi looked at his own compendium of martial arts techniques, realizing the collection of supreme techniques was still not rich enough, too few.</p><p></p><p>Techniques like Rebirth of the Soul and Bone Transformation were still just frameworks, needing further refinement.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Seventy-Six Blood Disciple remained unwavering in his goal, and despite the distance, he still tried every means to approach Meng Chong, while keeping a wary eye on Xu Yan's giant hand.</p><p></p><p>However, no matter how many times Xu Yan used the Great Heavenly Plucking Hand, the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple, though able to shatter the hand immediately, would still be flung away.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing this repeatedly, the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple was about to lose his mind.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying blood aura began to emanate from his body, sweeping towards all directions, as if turning the battlefield into a sea of blood, the overwhelming bloody scent permeating the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even the surging azure sea in that area had turned a crimson color, like raging blood waves.</p><p></p><p>"You shall die!" In this moment, the Seventy-Six Blood Disciple began to unleash his trump cards.</p><p></p><p>He knew he could not approach Meng Chong, and the other two, as well as the Tiger, were even further away, with no chance of getting close.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Servants would likely be annihilated in the end.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At the abyss of the azure sea, a vortex suddenly appeared, revealing the black maw of the Celestial Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a blood-red vortex appeared, and strands of blood qi kept surging and merging into the body of the 726th Blood Disciple! At this moment, the strength of the 726th Blood Disciple suddenly soared, and the scarlet long saber was raised, the power of this strike no less than the one that shattered the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was extremely grave, as one giant sword after another appeared, and one sword formation after another was formed, with the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword reaching its peak.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and slapped out, unleashing the divine technique True Dragon's Rage! The Sword Containing Mountains and Rivers also emerged, and in an instant, he struck out seven layers of Sword Containing Mountains and Rivers, overlapping together.</p><p></p><p>The Peerless Heaven Sword also made its move.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan was truly exerting his full strength.</p><p></p><p>This strike from the 726th Blood Disciple gave him an extremely dangerous aura, and relying solely on the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword, it might be difficult to block this attack.</p><p></p><p>"His realm is True King Celestial, and not an ordinary True King Celestial at that. At my current Spiritual Perception Realm, even the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword's profundity would not be enough to withstand this strike!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened, but he was not afraid.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Holy Bone and Divine Body revealed their extraordinary nature at this moment, and the martial dao accumulation after breaking through the Spiritual Perception Realm, after this fierce battle, had finally reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy of heaven and earth frantically surged in, almost like a thick mist, enveloping Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual Perception Realm mastered!" Li Xuan showed a look of delight. "Breaking through on the battlefield, truly worthy of being the pioneer of my master's martial dao undertaking."</p><p></p><p>After a great battle, Xu Yan had broken through to the Spiritual Perception Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the Spiritual Perception Realm, and you have broken through to the Void Realm."</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The same terrifying slash that had once shattered the Divine Bridge appeared again, as if the heavens and earth were split in two by a scarlet sword light.</p><p></p><p>This strike was aimed at Xu Yan, the one who had once slashed and destroyed the Divine Bridge!</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other powerful experts were all shocked, that terrifying slash, in their eyes, was scarlet and dazzling, like the sword of death, soaring from the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was slashing towards Xu Yan, and the direction was also towards the Hongzhou side.</p><p></p><p>Everyone unconsciously looked towards the figure sitting calmly on the Qingqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>How could Xu Yan withstand such a terrifying strike? His endless sword light could no longer block such a horrifying attack.</p><p></p><p>On the Qingqing Pavilion, Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, and Yue'er were all anxious, their bright eyes looking towards the seated Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Even Xie Tianheng and his wife, Xie Lingfeng and Meng Shushu, were the same.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, however, was still sitting there calmly, seemingly unconcerned about Xu Yan's life and death.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's strike was undoubtedly very powerful, and even the True King Celestial had been slain by it. If it was the pre-breakthrough Xu Yan, his Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword would not be able to fully defend against this strike, and he would inevitably be shattered by it.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan had broken through!</p><p></p><p>He had reached the Spiritual Perception Realm, and although it was just a recent breakthrough, his spiritual perception had increased significantly.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the sword formations, True Dragon's Rage, Peerless Heaven Sword, and Sword Containing Mountains and Rivers, he could still withstand this strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A golden giant dragon roared, its terrifying dragon aura and fierce intent surging towards the sword light.</p><p></p><p>The black sword light, extinguishing everything, also slashed towards the scarlet sword light.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan kept striking, but this slash seemed unstoppable, extinguishing the golden giant dragon, the black sword light, and the Sword Containing Mountains and Rivers, continuing to slash towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In this instant, a sword wheel instantly expanded to a hundred feet in size.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-foot sword wheel kept circulating, endless and incessant.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The sword light slashed into the sword wheel, and a series of cracking sounds rang out. The endless, circulating sword wheel began to develop cracks, and its circulation slowed down, almost coming to a stop.</p><p></p><p>Visibly, the scarlet sword light was being carried and rotated by the sword wheel, the scarlet sword light being continuously transferred to other places within the sword wheel.</p><p></p><p>Crack, crack, crack...</p><p></p><p>Amid the cracking sounds, the sword wheel developed numerous cracks, but it finally completed one cycle.</p><p></p><p>In the moment the sword wheel completed one cycle, the scarlet sword light that had been absorbed into the sword wheel suddenly slashed out, towards the direction from which the sword light had come.</p><p></p><p>Towards the 726th Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>Bang! And as this slash was unleashed, the sword wheel also collapsed, transforming into a fierce sword light that merged into the sword light, adding to its power.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! The power of this slash, although not as strong as the one the 726th Blood Disciple had unleashed, still had about six or seven tenths of its might!</p><p></p><p>"Here, take it back!" Xu Yan said with a bright smile, his breathing a bit heavy.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A new sword wheel appeared on him, continuing to circulate endlessly.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible! What kind of freak are you!" The 726th Blood Disciple's scarlet aura seemed to have faded a little.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and swung his saber, blocking the returning slash.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He staggered back a few steps, looking at the young man with a hint of fear in his eyes.</p><p></p><p>After experiencing countless great battles and slaying many cultivators, he had even been chased by those stronger than him, but he had never encountered such a troublesome and unbelievable opponent. At this moment, a deep sense of powerlessness surged in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although his strength was far superior, it was this mysterious martial dao technique that had stubbornly withstood his attack, even blocking his trump card.</p><p></p><p>"This world cannot possibly have such a freak, why does this freak exist? Something is wrong, very wrong. I must go back and report this, and find a way to eliminate him while he is still in the growth stage."</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, if this person's strength were to match his own... No, even if he were slightly weaker, he would have been killed by him now!</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple grew more and more alarmed.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, occupying the Spirit Realm and performing the Blood Sacrifice had already ceased to be his goal. He had to return to the Underworld and report this, and find a way to eliminate Xu Yan! Such a bizarre and freakish existence could not be allowed to emerge and change the order of this world!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the 726th Blood Disciple gave Xu Yan a deep look and turned to leave, no longer caring about the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>This plan had failed! Panting slightly as he recovered from the consumption, Xu Yan couldn't help but be taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"You're not going to perform the Blood Sacrifice on the Spirit Realm? If you strike again, I won't be able to withstand it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan called out.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's aura flared up for a moment, but he suppressed the furious anger in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"You insolent brat, don't push your luck!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan caught up a few steps and said, "I never lie, if you strike again, I really won't be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Damn it! When will it end!</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple was somewhat on the verge of collapse inwardly, this was too much! He suddenly increased his speed, no longer paying attention to Xu Yan, even closing off his hearing to prevent himself from being enraged and returning to continue the battle recklessly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

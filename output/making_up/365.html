        <h1>Chapter 365</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The gap between people can be despairingly large.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Disciple 726, upon appearing, shattered the Divine Bridge and killed the Celestial Lord, displaying unmatched power. Yet in the end, he was still unable to defeat Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, Xin Mengrou and other experts standing at the peak of the Spirit Realm's martial arts were at a loss for how to feel. This was originally a crisis for the Spirit Realm, yet they, as the top experts of the Spirit Realm, were unable to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Forget intervening - they didn't even dare to get close!</p><p></p><p>If even a slight shockwave swept over them, they would be killed.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the fierce battle between Xu Yan and Blood Disciple 726 grew even more intense. Suddenly, giant swords began to rise up one after another above the blue sea.</p><p></p><p>The surging waves transformed into giant swords, emanating a chilling sword intent that made one's heart tremble with fear even from a great distance.</p><p></p><p>"Truly worthy of being called the Sword God!" someone exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Such profound swordsmanship was unmatched in the world except for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>After all, the true masters had already transcended the mortal realm.</p><p></p><p>As the sword formation arose to block Blood Disciple 726, Xu Yan also continuously struck out palm after palm, attempting to cultivate the great divine ability "Heaven Plucking Hand".</p><p></p><p>Even though he deployed the sword formation and unleashed various divine abilities simultaneously, Blood Disciple 726 was still slowly advancing towards Meng Chong's location.</p><p></p><p>His speed had only slowed down once again.</p><p></p><p>Atop the Evergreen Pavilion, Li Xuan had been closely observing the battle. Seeing Xu Yan attempting to cultivate the Heaven Plucking Hand, he couldn't help but smile.</p><p></p><p>This great divine ability was one he had put a lot of thought into creating.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of the giant hand, it could pluck the heavens and grasp the moon - incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the first great divine ability is about to be successfully cultivated?" Li Xuan thought to himself expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, true prodigies all grow through battle, especially when fighting against strong opponents in dangerous environments.</p><p></p><p>Even Su Lingxiu, who was originally not skilled in combat and disliked fighting, had made significant improvements in strength after this series of battles.</p><p></p><p>Her combat experience was accumulating rapidly, needless to say.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Abyss is truly an excellent place for martial artists to temper themselves," Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the collapsed Divine Bridge, he realized that with its destruction, the connection between the Spirit Realm and Divine Realm had been severed. Even if the Divine Realm wanted to send aid, it would likely be impossible for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Qinghua region of the Divine Realm was probably in great chaos.</p><p></p><p>"The Taicang world is likely facing some crises," Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge was formed by the laws of heaven and earth, and this set of laws was meant to connect the Spirit Realm and Divine Realm. Its power was not particularly strong in itself.</p><p></p><p>It was not a true fundamental law of heaven and earth, which is why it could be shattered by Blood Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>Although the Divine Bridge law had collapsed, over time it would slowly reconnect and restore itself. However, this would take a considerable amount of time.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The great battle continued. A third of the blood slaves fighting against Meng Chong had already been slain.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also using this opportunity to temper himself, continuously deploying changes in the Qimen martial arts. The Qimen war chest transformed into a torrent, bombarding the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was doing the same, using this chance to hone her martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726 persisted relentlessly. Even with Xu Yan's utmost efforts to block him, he maintained a gloomy expression, not solely fixating on Xu Yan but trying his best to break free from Xu Yan's entanglement.</p><p></p><p>He knew very clearly that if he could not shake off Xu Yan and break the current situation, this plan for the Spirit Realm would fail.</p><p></p><p>His wish to advance to Blood Son would be dashed!</p><p></p><p>"You brat, I must kill you!" Blood Disciple 726's killing intent was palpable. Xu Yan blocking him was like obstructing his martial path, obstructing his path to becoming a Blood Son - this was a great grudge!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, and in an instant, spiritual light appeared as enlightenment flooded his mind. At this moment, he felt he had fully comprehended the divine ability "Heaven Plucking Hand".</p><p></p><p>Boom! With a wave of his hand, a giant palm instantly seemed to grasp the entire space where Blood Disciple 726 was located into its grip.</p><p></p><p>The giant hand seemed to contain an entire space within it! Xu Yan was overjoyed - he had finally successfully cultivated the Heaven Plucking Hand!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Blood Disciple 726 felt his vision go dark, as if the space around him had been constrained. An immense grasping force enveloped him, instantly giving him the sensation of being held in someone's palm.</p><p></p><p>Alarmed, he frantically summoned his blood qi, the blood light growing even more fierce. His crimson long blade slashed out a terrifying blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>However, in just that instant, he felt as if he had been flung away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knew very clearly that even though he had successfully cultivated the Heaven Plucking Hand, he was still no match for Blood Disciple 726 and could not subdue him.</p><p></p><p>The main purpose of cultivating this divine ability was simply to prevent Blood Disciple 726 from approaching Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>So, the moment the Heaven Plucking Hand grasped Blood Disciple 726, Xu Yan immediately flung him far away.</p><p></p><p>Then in a flash, he pursued closely, continuously striking out with the Dragon's Fury Palm while also deploying the Heaven-Severing Sword and Sword of Mountains and Rivers.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The giant hand shattered, and the blood light reappeared. Blood Disciple 726's eyes surged with blood-red flames, filled with uncontrollable rage!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he realized he was even further from Meng Chong, having been thrown backwards by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The two became entangled in battle once again. Although Xu Yan was being pressured, he never fell into defeat, like an unsinkable leaf boat weathering fierce storms and huge waves.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has successfully cultivated the great divine ability Heaven Plucking Hand that you created, and has mastered it to perfection."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited. Xu Yan had grasped another incredibly powerful divine ability, and had mastered it completely.</p><p></p><p>"Keep working hard, create even stronger divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the manual of divine abilities he had written. It still didn't contain enough diverse and numerous divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Especially when it came to great divine abilities - he had written too few.</p><p></p><p>Divine abilities like Rebirth in an Instant or White Bone Transformation had not yet been fully created, only existing as basic frameworks that still needed further development.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Blood Disciple 726 remained fixated on his goal. Even though the distance had widened, he still tried every means to approach Meng Chong, while remaining wary of Xu Yan's giant hand technique.</p><p></p><p>However, even with such precautions, when Xu Yan deployed the Heaven Plucking Hand, although Blood Disciple 726 shattered the giant hand immediately, he was still flung far away.</p><p></p><p>After this happened several times in succession, Blood Disciple 726 was nearly driven mad with rage.</p><p></p><p>A terrifying blood qi emanated from his body, sweeping out in all directions. It was as if the battlefield had been transformed into a blood hell, with a horrifying bloody aura permeating the air.</p><p></p><p>Even the rolling blue waves of the sea in that area turned crimson, as if transformed into surging waves of blood.</p><p></p><p>"You must die!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Disciple 726 began to use his ultimate techniques.</p><p></p><p>He knew he could not get close to Meng Chong. As for the other two people and the tiger, they were even further away and even more impossible to approach.</p><p></p><p>The blood slaves would likely end up being completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A vortex suddenly appeared at the location of the blue sea abyss. The black mouth of the Heavenly Abyss began to reveal itself.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a blood-colored vortex appeared, and streams of blood energy continuously emerged and entered the body of Blood Disciple 726. At this moment, Blood Disciple 726's power suddenly surged. He raised his crimson long blade - this strike was as powerful as the one that had shattered the divine bridge.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression became extremely solemn. Giant swords appeared one after another, sword formations emerged in succession, and the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword operated at its peak.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with his palm, using the divine ability Dragon's Fury! The Sword of Mountains and Rivers also manifested. In an instant, he had unleashed seven layers of the Sword of Mountains and Rivers, stacking them together. </p><p></p><p>The Absolute Heaven Sword also struck.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan truly exerted all his strength.</p><p></p><p>This strike from Blood Disciple 726 gave him an extremely strong sense of danger. Relying on the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword alone would likely not be enough to block this attack.</p><p></p><p>"His realm is that of a True King Celestial Lord, and not an ordinary one at that. With my power just entering the Divine Ability realm, even if the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword is more profound, it still cannot withstand this strike!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart tightened, but he remained fearless.</p><p></p><p>Boom! At this moment, his sacred bones and divine body revealed their extraordinary nature. His martial arts accumulation after breaking through to the Divine Ability realm had finally reached its peak after this great battle.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual energy from heaven and earth poured in frantically, enveloping Xu Yan like dense fog.</p><p></p><p>He had reached the small accomplishment stage of the Divine Ability realm!</p><p></p><p>"Breaking through in the heat of battle, truly worthy of being my martial arts pioneer," Li Xuan revealed a delighted expression.</p><p></p><p>After this great battle, Xu Yan had broken through to the small accomplishment stage of the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the small accomplishment stage of Divine Ability, while you've broken through to the small accomplishment stage of Void Breaking."</p><p></p><p>Their strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The strike that had shattered the divine bridge before appeared once again. It seemed as if the heavens and earth were split in two by a crimson blade of light.</p><p></p><p>This strike had shattered the divine bridge before, and now the one facing it was Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other powerful experts were shocked by the terrifying strike. In their eyes, the crimson light was dazzling, like a blade of death, rising up from the azure sea.</p><p></p><p>The blade of light was slashing towards Xu Yan, but its direction was also towards Hongzhou.</p><p></p><p>Everyone instinctively looked towards the figure sitting calmly atop the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>How could Xu Yan withstand such a terrifying strike? His endlessly circulating sword light was no longer enough to block such a terrifying attack.</p><p></p><p>Atop the Changqing Pavilion, Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, and Yue'er were all extremely nervous, their bright eyes looking towards Li Xuan sitting in his chair.</p><p></p><p>Even Xie Tianheng and his wife, Xie Lingfeng, and Meng Shushu and the others were all doing the same.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, however, continued to sit leisurely, as if he didn't care at all about Xu Yan's life or death.</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726's strike was undoubtedly very powerful. That True King Celestial Lord had been slain by it. If it were Xu Yan before his breakthrough, his Yin-Yang Immortal Sword would not have been able to fully defend against this attack under this strike, and he would certainly have been shattered by a single hit.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan had broken through!</p><p></p><p>He had reached the small accomplishment stage of the Divine Ability realm. Even though he had just broken through, his divine abilities had improved significantly.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his sword formations, Dragon's Fury, Absolute Heaven Sword, and Sword of Mountains and Rivers, he could still manage to block this strike.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Roar! A golden giant dragon roared, its terrifying dragon might and furious intent crashing towards the blade of light.</p><p></p><p>Black sword light, seeming to extinguish all things, also slashed towards the crimson blade light.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out repeatedly, but this blade seemed unstoppable, destroying the golden dragon, extinguishing the black sword light, shattering the Sword of Mountains and Rivers, and continuing to slash towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Hum! At this instant, a sword wheel suddenly expanded, growing to a hundred zhang in size.</p><p></p><p>The hundred-zhang sword wheel cycled back and forth, eternally unceasing.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The blade light slashed into the sword wheel. With a crackling sound, cracks appeared on the eternally unceasing, endlessly cycling sword wheel.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the cycle became slow, even about to pause.</p><p></p><p>Visibly, that crimson blade of light was being rotated by the sword wheel, constantly being transferred elsewhere from within the wheel.</p><p></p><p>Crack crack crack...</p><p></p><p>Amidst a series of cracking sounds, numerous cracks appeared on the sword wheel, but it finally completed one cycle.</p><p></p><p>At the moment the sword wheel completed one cycle, the crimson blade of light that had been taken into the wheel suddenly slashed out, towards the direction from which the blade light had come.</p><p></p><p>It slashed towards Blood Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>Bang! As this strike slashed out, the sword wheel also collapsed, transforming into a sharp sword light that merged into the blade light, overlapping on this strike.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! The power of this strike, though not as strong as when Blood Disciple 726 had unleashed it, still retained six or seven tenths of its might!</p><p></p><p>"Returning it to you!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's breath was somewhat labored, but he spoke with a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A new sword wheel appeared around him again, continuing to cycle back and forth, eternally unceasing!</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible! What kind of monster are you!"</p><p></p><p>The crimson color on Blood Disciple 726's entire body seemed to become somewhat paler.</p><p></p><p>He gritted his teeth and swung his blade to block the counterattack.</p><p></p><p>Boom! His figure staggered back several steps. Looking at that youth, a trace of fear flashed in the depths of his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Having experienced countless battles, slain numerous martial artists, and even been hunted by those stronger than himself, he had never encountered an enemy so difficult to deal with, so unbelievable!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a deep sense of powerlessness welled up in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Though clearly much weaker than himself, relying on that bizarre martial method, he had forcibly withstood his own attack. Even one of his trump cards had been blocked.</p><p></p><p>"This world shouldn't have such a monster, why is there such a monster?" Something was very wrong, extremely wrong. He must return to report this matter, must find a way to nip this person in the bud.</p><p></p><p>"Otherwise, he will surely become a great threat!" With his strength today, if he were equal to me... No, even if he were slightly weaker than me, I would already be dead by his hand!"</p><p></p><p>The more Blood Disciple 726 thought about it, the more terrified he became.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, occupying the Spirit Domain and blood sacrificing it was no longer his goal. He needed to return to the Netherworld and report this matter. They must find a way to eliminate Xu Yan! Otherwise, such a bizarre and monstrous existence, once grown up, would surely become a great threat!</p><p></p><p>This world absolutely cannot have such a game-changing monster appear! Thinking this, Blood Disciple 726 took a deep look at Xu Yan, then turned and left, completely disregarding those blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>This plan had failed! Slightly panting, Xu Yan, who was recovering from his exertion, was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"You're not going to blood sacrifice the Spirit Domain anymore? If you strike once more, I won't be able to withstand it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan called out.</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726's aura became violent for an instant, but he suppressed the frenzied rage in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, don't push your luck too far!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a few steps forward and said: "I never lie. If you strike once more, I really won't be able to withstand it."</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Is there no end to this!</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726 felt somewhat mentally collapsed. This was pushing it too far! His speed suddenly increased. He no longer paid attention to Xu Yan, even closing off his hearing to avoid being angered to the point of losing rationality and recklessly returning to continue the battle regardless of consequences.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

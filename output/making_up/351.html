        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How is it?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan asked with a smile as he saw Xu Yan return.</p><p></p><p>"Just need to sort out the gains, and I will understand it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said joyfully. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was even happier than him. This meant that Xu Yan was about to step into the Breakthrough Realm!</p><p></p><p>He had taken a crucial step towards transcending the heavens and earth. "Very good!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>"Master, there seems to be some extraordinary aura in the Sky Cavern, not spiritual energy, but I don't know what it is. I want to go to the Sky Cavern to feel and see if there is any harvest."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. The appearance of the Sky Cavern also made him curious about what caused it. </p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan said there was an extraordinary aura in the Sky Cavern, there might be some gains, so he naturally had to clear the obstacles for his disciple to enter the Sky Cavern.</p><p></p><p>This obstacle was naturally the Witch Mei.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his own martial dao undertaking, the Witch Mei must die!</p><p></p><p>"I see that you have also reached the peak. Are you ready?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still sitting in the chair, not even bothering to stand up.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Mei who can kill a Celestial, with such strength, yet no one is qualified to make this great man stand up and deal with it seriously?"</p><p></p><p>"You are truly a great man!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others were deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's master is so powerful, truly a great man, absolutely cannot be provoked!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Palace Master frantically warned himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he was somewhat relieved that he did not take action himself in the past, which was a very wise move, otherwise the Thousand Martial Palace might have already been destroyed.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Fang Hao on the Long Qing Pavilion, and his heart sank again.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao is also a disciple of a great man? As for the matter of breaking the pattern of the Spirit Realm, how should I deal with it?</p><p></p><p>"This is not something the Thousand Martial Palace can handle."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Thousand Martial Palace had already planned how to resolve some of the grievances with Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>The Witch Mei, however, was furious, finding their arrogance and disregard for her extremely hateful.</p><p></p><p>"I want to see how you can kill me, the Witch Mei. As long as the Sky Cavern still exists, even if you are stronger than me, you cannot kill me!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Mei's body was enveloped in a pink glow.</p><p></p><p>A unique aura surged around, and even the spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to be affected, turning a faint pink.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were startled.</p><p></p><p>The strength the Witch Mei displayed now was obviously stronger than when she fought the Celestial.</p><p></p><p>"Since the Witch Mei has stepped into this heaven and earth, you cannot completely expel me. The power of the Witch Mei is endless, let's see how you can kill me."</p><p></p><p>The Witch Mei said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at her indifferently, then turned his gaze to the Sky Cavern, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>What the Witch Mei said was indeed correct, she was not so easily exterminated.</p><p></p><p>But the one he was facing was his own great master, whose martial dao strength was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"The Sky Cavern, the hole of heaven and earth, the Witch Mei comes from the Sky Cavern, an external enemy of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly had a guess.</p><p></p><p>He also became curious about the Sky Cavern, could it be a glimpse of the world beyond heaven and earth? "What divine ability should I use?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was again troubled. Using the Heavenly Dao and Earthly Manifestation would be powerful and shocking, but it would mean that he had to leave the chair and lose the aura of a great man casually suppressing the Witch Mei.</p><p></p><p>"Use the Sword Cosmos?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immediately denied it again, and finally decided on the divine ability to use.</p><p></p><p>Descending Dragon!</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Divine Dragon descended, slaying the villain, which would be shocking enough, and also open the eyes of the martial artists in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready? I'm going to act!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan ignored the Witch Mei's fury and said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, let's see what strength you have, to be so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Mei sneered.</p><p></p><p>The pink glow intensified, and a huge pink lotus flower floated above her head.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in the chair, looking at her indifferently, raised one hand and lightly tapped it! Awooo! With this light tap, a tremendous power descended, the sky and earth changed color, a dragon's roar resounded, as if all the living beings in heaven and earth were trembling!</p><p></p><p>Golden light appeared, and a huge golden dragon suddenly emerged, its eyes fierce and majestic, looking at the Witch Mei indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming dragon aura stirred up the winds and clouds, and thunder appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the other powerful figures in the Spirit Realm widened their eyes, their bodies trembling, their breathing almost frozen, with an expression of shock. That golden giant dragon, with its overwhelming dragon aura, made their souls tremble.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance gave them a sense of being unable to look up.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Mei was also horrified.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon raised a claw, with wind, clouds, and thunder surrounding it, and rushed towards her.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it!"</p><p></p><p>The Witch Mei shrieked, and the pink lotus flower exploded, rushing towards the golden giant dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, the pink light was shattered.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon, like a divine dragon descending, with one claw, tore apart all the defenses and attacks.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The dragon aura surged, the dragon whiskers fluttered, and with one claw, the Witch Mei was instantly destroyed, the pink light completely disappearing under the sweeping dragon aura. In the heaven and earth, there was no longer any trace of the Witch Mei, only the overwhelming dragon aura stirring the winds and clouds.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Mei is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Celestial was not her match, after devouring the Celestial, her strength became even stronger, yet she was annihilated with a single strike!"</p><p></p><p>"Is that the legendary true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"A peerless great man, with a single palm, the Descending Dragon divine ability, what incredible strength!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Descending Dragon Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"A divine ability-level Descending Dragon Palm, this is the Descending Dragon divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was burning, wishing he could break through to the divine ability realm immediately and, like his master, summon a true dragon with a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>"Did Master use one-ten-thousandth of his strength?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao murmured.</p><p></p><p>"What are you talking about? Master doesn't even dare to reveal a trace of his true origin energy, for fear of creating a calamity in heaven and earth. How could this palm strike be one-ten-thousandth of his strength?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan corrected him seriously.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded thoughtfully, "Big Brother is right, Master only used one-hundred-billionth of his strength in that palm strike!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao felt ashamed, he actually thought Master had used one-ten-thousandth of his strength! It seems only Big Brother truly understands Master, and only he has glimpsed a trace of Master's true strength!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was now blushing with shame, "It's all my fault for being too slow in cultivation. Otherwise, why would Master have to act? Every time Master acts, he has to suppress himself as much as possible, afraid of bringing a calamity to heaven and earth, it's really too difficult for Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Fang Hao also felt ashamed upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>It was their own incompetence that required their Master to intervene against such a weak enemy.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others: ...</p><p></p><p>They didn't know what words to use to describe the shock in their hearts at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was slightly embarrassed, his disciples were really exaggerating.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, I, the master, have enough strength to maintain this majestic and unfathomable image of a great man!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked at the Sky Cavern, the golden giant dragon had not disappeared, circling above the Sky Cavern, its eyes shining with a fierce golden light.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Witch Mei is dead...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Died? But not really died?" Suli asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Died, but not really died," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"What do you mean by 'died but not really died'?" Suli was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were also puzzled. Their master had completely annihilated the Mei Witch, so how could she not be dead?</p><p></p><p>"The Mei Witch came from the Heavenly Abyss, but her true body is not in the Spirit Realm," Li Xuan explained calmly.</p><p></p><p>"This is not her true body?" Xu Yan and the others were shocked.</p><p></p><p>Especially Wu Tiannan and the others. Even the Celestial Venerable had been devoured, yet this powerful Mei Witch was not her true body?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not explain further, he was waiting for the Mei Witch to re-coalesce and appear.</p><p></p><p>A pink glow emerged from the Heavenly Abyss. The figure of the Mei Witch appeared again, but she seemed weaker, as her body had just re-coalesced.</p><p></p><p>"Your Excellency has impressive skills, I will remember you. Those who offend my Mei Witch will not have a good end!" The re-coalesced Mei Witch looked cold and indifferent, as if she had become a different person, or changed in personality.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up and walked out of the Qingqing Pavilion airship. He said calmly, "Do you know why I waited for you?"</p><p></p><p>The Mei Witch was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I want to tell you that killing you is not difficult, even if you are in a boundless space, it is still so." As Li Xuan spoke, a mysterious aura emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Deity Appearance also manifested.</p><p></p><p>This Mei Witch was absolutely a supreme expert, her true body's strength must be very powerful. She just couldn't come over.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan wanted to intimidate her, to make her feel wary.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Wilderness Deity Appearance appeared, a look of shock flashed in the Mei Witch's cold eyes.</p><p></p><p>Behind that person, it was as if it was the beginning of heaven and earth, the chaos of the primordial, the primitive, the ancient, the eternal... Mysterious and unfathomable, as if heaven and earth were insignificant in comparison.</p><p></p><p>The Mei Witch was like this!</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were even more shocked, their eyes almost popping out, their mouths wide open without realizing it, the entire person was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" In the Qingqing Pavilion, Xu Yan and the others were deeply shocked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slightly raised his hand, and with his movement, the heavens and earth shook, as if they were about to overturn, or as if the heavens and earth were about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>He paused his hand, not continuing to raise it, but hooked his finger, and a wisp of the Mei Witch's aura fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is a warning to you!" Li Xuan said, flicking his finger, and a golden giant dragon plunged down, instantly tearing the Mei Witch apart, then turning into a golden giant sword that pierced into the Heavenly Abyss, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Tranquil Extinction Deity Sword! Directly using a wisp of the Mei Witch's aura, a sword strike into her true body! This was a warning.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan estimated that although this sword strike was powerful, it might not necessarily be able to kill the Mei Witch. However, it was enough to intimidate her.</p><p></p><p>Looking back at the Great Wilderness Deity Appearance, he shook his head, the mysterious aura receded, and the Great Wilderness Deity Appearance disappeared. He returned to the Qingqing Pavilion and sat down on a chair, once again appearing ordinary.</p><p></p><p>From the appearance of the Great Wilderness Deity Appearance to the killing of the Mei Witch with a raised hand, it was only a short time.</p><p></p><p>However, Fu Tianhai and the other powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were all shocked, their gazes dazed.</p><p></p><p>What a powerful existence this was!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said that when his master released a wisp of his source energy, it would bring a calamity to heaven and earth, and he thought his master was just boasting. But it turned out to be true!</p><p></p><p>Just by slightly raising his hand, the heavens and earth were shaking, as if they were about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful existence, it was simply unbelievable! It completely exceeded their understanding of powerful experts!</p><p></p><p>It was truly difficult for this superior person. In order to save the Spirit Realm and kill the Mei Witch, he had to act, but he dared not use even a trace of his true strength, forcefully suppressing his own cultivation, one can imagine how helpless the superior person must feel.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm felt that their horizons had been broadened. It turned out that there were such terrifying existences in the world, completely beyond their upper limit of understanding of "powerful experts".</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, superior person, for saving our Spirit Realm!" </p><p></p><p>"The grace of the superior person, the Spirit Realm will remember for generations!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Emperor was the first to prostrate himself on the ground and call out loudly.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others also prostrated themselves on the ground, full of reverence.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were greatly excited. With such a superior person existing in the Spirit Realm, they could rest assured. Where would there still be a crisis?</p><p></p><p>However, the disaster caused by the crisis in Cloud State and Great Marsh State was unimaginable, and it would take a long time for them to recover.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Since his disciples said that just by moving, he could shake the heavens and earth, he naturally had to make it convincing.</p><p></p><p>So when he just raised his hand, the apparent shaking of the heavens and earth was just an illusion created by him directly controlling the laws of heaven and earth. But because it was created using the laws of heaven and earth, the feeling it gave people was no different from the heavens and earth actually shaking, and it was difficult to detect the difference.</p><p></p><p>In terms of understanding the laws of heaven and earth, Li Xuan was confident that he was second to none, and no one dared to claim to be the first.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Abyss had returned to calm, with no more pink aura emerging, the Mei Witch seemed to have been completely slain.</p><p></p><p>The Qingqing Pavilion airship arrived above the Heavenly Abyss, and everyone looked down, seeing the gray-black cave-like abyss, like a huge hole, with unknown energies lingering and drifting within.</p><p></p><p>"A hole in heaven and earth, this is a space opened up within heaven and earth?" Li Xuan was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan could comprehend the method to break through the Void Realm in the Heavenly Abyss, because the existence of the Heavenly Abyss was a hole opened up in the void of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, and he stepped into the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual sense covered the entire Heavenly Abyss, and he sensed the extraordinary aura that Xu Yan had mentioned, indeed quite extraordinary, with a faint, indelible charm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, strands of aura gathered towards his palm. This aura was very special, seemingly unable to be refined.</p><p></p><p>Being unable to be refined also meant that cultivators could not use it, and if it entered the body in large quantities, it would even have an impact on the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of aura is this?" Li Xuan was curious, his gaze looking towards the bottom of the Heavenly Abyss.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Abyss was not too large, but not too small either. Apart from the gray-black cave-like abyss and the extraordinary aura drifting about, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>The Mei Witch had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the Heavenly Abyss was not soil, nor the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"A kind of barrier, a barrier of heaven and earth?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Strands of aura were surging up from the bottom of the Heavenly Abyss, and the power of the Mei Witch had also emerged in this way.</p><p></p><p>"Outside of heaven and earth." Li Xuan could almost confirm that the Mei Witch was an enemy from outside of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The charm of the Dao, but not complete. This is a barrier of heaven and earth, blocking the entry of external forces and also preventing the leakage of spiritual energy from within heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"What is outside of heaven and earth?" The Heavenly Abyss was caused by an external impact, and the external forces could penetrate in, but those within heaven and earth could not cross the barrier to the outside.</p><p></p><p>"It is both to protect the source of heaven and earth from leaking, and also a kind of constraint?" The more Li Xuan sensed the bottom of the Heavenly Abyss, the more he felt that the existence of the Heavenly Abyss was somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

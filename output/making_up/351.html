        <h1>Chapter 351</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How did it go?" Li Xuan asked with a smile when he saw Xu Yan return.</p><p></p><p>"I just need to organize what I've gained, and then I'll understand," Xu Yan said happily.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was even more pleased than him. This meant that he was about to enter the Void-Breaking realm! He had taken a crucial step towards transcending heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Li Xuan nodded approvingly. </p><p></p><p>"Master, there seems to be some extraordinary aura in the Sky Cave. It's not spiritual energy, but I'm not sure what it is. I'd like to go into the Sky Cave to take a look and see if I can gain any insights," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. He was also curious about the appearance of the Sky Cave and what had caused it to form. Since Xu Yan said there was an extraordinary aura inside, there might be some gains to be had. Naturally, he needed to clear any obstacles for his disciple to enter the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>And that obstacle was none other than Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>For the sake of his martial arts ambitions, Mei Wu had to die!</p><p></p><p>"I see you've also reached your peak. Are you ready?" Li Xuan remained seated in his chair, not even bothering to stand up.</p><p></p><p>"A Mei Wu capable of killing a Heavenly Venerable, with such strength, doesn't even qualify for the great master to stand up and take seriously?"</p><p></p><p>"Truly befitting of a great master!"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others were shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's master is actually so powerful, such a great master. We absolutely cannot provoke him!" The Thousand Martial Palace Master frantically warned himself.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he felt somewhat fortunate that he hadn't personally taken action back then. It was a very wise decision, otherwise if he had acted, the Thousand Martial Palace would likely have been destroyed already.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Fang Hao on the Evergreen Pavilion, and his heart skipped a beat again.</p><p></p><p>"Is Fang Hao also a disciple of this great master? How should we deal with the Eternal Alliance breaking the pattern of the Spirit Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"This matter is beyond what my Thousand Martial Palace can handle."</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Thousand Martial Palace Master was already calculating how to resolve some of the grievances with Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was furious. The other party was so arrogant, not taking her seriously at all. It was truly detestable to the extreme.</p><p></p><p>"I'd like to see how you can kill me, Mei Wu. As long as the Sky Cave exists, even if you're stronger than me, you still won't be able to kill me!" A pink light emerged from Mei Wu's body.</p><p></p><p>A unique aura surged in the surroundings. Even the spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed uncomfortable with it, as if the spiritual energy had been dyed a faint pink.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" Wu Tiannan and the others were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The strength Mei Wu was displaying now was clearly stronger than when she had fought the Heavenly Venerable before.</p><p></p><p>"Since I, Mei Wu, have set foot in this world, don't even think about completely expelling me. My Mei Wu power is endless. Let's see how you can kill me."</p><p></p><p>"No matter how strong you are, what can you do?" Mei Wu said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at her with an indifferent gaze, then turned to look at the Sky Cave thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>What Mei Wu said was indeed correct. She was not so easily completely killed.</p><p></p><p>But she was facing him, this great master. His strength was not the martial arts of the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Sky Cave, a hole in heaven and earth. Mei Wu came from the Sky Cave. An enemy from beyond the heavens?" Li Xuan suddenly had a guess.</p><p></p><p>He also became curious about the Sky Cave in his heart. Could it provide a glimpse of what was beyond heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"What divine ability should I use?" Li Xuan then became conflicted. Using the Heaven and Earth Transformation, although powerful and shocking, would mean he had to leave his chair, which didn't match the image of a great master who could defeat Mei Wu with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Use the Sword Universe?" Li Xuan then rejected that idea as well, and finally decided on the divine ability to use.</p><p></p><p>Divine Dragon Descends!</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, a divine dragon would descend to slay the villain. That should be shocking enough, right?</p><p></p><p>It would also open the eyes of the martial artists of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Are you ready? I'm about to make my move," Li Xuan said coldly, ignoring Mei Wu's fury.</p><p></p><p>"Come on then, let's see what strength you have to be so arrogant!" Mei Wu sneered.</p><p></p><p>The pink light flared brightly, and a huge pink lotus flower floated above her head.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in his chair, looking at her indifferently. He raised one hand and lightly patted it!</p><p></p><p>Roar!</p><p></p><p>With this light pat, an immense pressure suddenly descended. The weather changed dramatically, and a dragon's roar sounded, as if all living beings in heaven and earth would tremble at it!</p><p></p><p>A golden light appeared, and a giant golden dragon suddenly emerged. Its eyes were fierce and majestic, without any emotion, looking coldly at Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>The vast dragon's might stirred up the winds and clouds, and lightning appeared in the sky.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the other powerful figures of the Spirit Realm widened their eyes, their bodies trembling. Even their breathing seemed to have stopped as they looked on in shock!</p><p></p><p>That golden dragon and its vast might made even their souls seem to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it gave them a sense that it was beyond their ability to look up to.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon!" Even Mei Wu paled in shock.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon raised a claw, surrounded by wind, clouds and lightning, and fiercely attacked.</p><p></p><p>"I don't believe it!" Mei Wu screamed shrilly. The pink lotus flower burst open and attacked the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>However, the pink light was being destroyed.</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon was like a divine dragon descending from the heavens. With one claw strike, all defenses and attacks were torn apart and destroyed.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The dragon's might surged, its whiskers fluttering. With one claw strike, Mei Wu was instantly destroyed. The pink light completely disappeared under the sweep of the dragon's might!</p><p></p><p>And in heaven and earth, Mei Wu's aura was gone, leaving only the vast dragon's might stirring up the winds and clouds.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu is dead!"</p><p></p><p>"Even the Heavenly Venerable was no match. Mei Wu, who was even stronger after devouring the Heavenly Venerable, was actually killed in one strike!"</p><p></p><p>"Was that the legendary true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"A peerless great master, summoning a true dragon with one palm strike. What level of strength is this!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was shocked.</p><p></p><p>"That was the Dragon-Subduing Palm!" Xu Yan was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"The divine ability level Dragon-Subduing Palm. This is the Dragon-Subduing Palm divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart burned with excitement. He couldn't wait to break through to the Divine Ability realm and be like his master, summoning a true dragon with one palm strike!</p><p></p><p>"Did Master use even one ten-thousandth of his strength?" Fang Hao muttered.</p><p></p><p>"What are you saying? Master didn't dare reveal even a trace of his true essence, for fear of causing a calamity in heaven and earth. How could this palm strike use even one ten-thousandth of his strength?" Xu Yan seriously corrected him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded in agreement: "Senior Brother is right. Master only used one trillionth of his strength in this palm strike!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao felt ashamed. He had actually thought Master had used one ten-thousandth of his strength! Indeed, only Senior Brother understood Master best. Only Senior Brother had glimpsed a bit of Master's true strength!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had a look of shame on his face. "It's all my fault for improving too slowly. Otherwise, why would Master need to take action? Every time Master acts, he has to suppress himself as much as possible, for fear of bringing calamity to heaven and earth. It's really too hard on Master!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Meng Chong and Fang Hao also had looks of shame on their faces.</p><p></p><p>It was all because the disciples were incompetent and couldn't even handle such a weak enemy, requiring Master to take action.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others: ...</p><p></p><p>Was this even human speech? They didn't know what words to use to describe their shocked state of mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a bit embarrassed inside. His disciple's boasting was really over the top.</p><p></p><p>"Fortunately, my strength is powerful enough to maintain such a majestic and unfathomable image of a great master!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone looked towards the Sky Cave. The golden dragon had not yet disappeared, coiling above the Sky Cave with its eyes gleaming golden.</p><p></p><p>"Master, Mei Wu is dead..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Is she dead?" Su Lingxiu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Dead, but not dead!" Li Xuan said calmly. </p><p></p><p>"What do you mean dead but not dead?" Su Lingxiu was confused.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others felt the same way. Master had completely annihilated Meiwu with one strike, how could she not be dead?</p><p></p><p>"Meiwu came from the Sky Cave, her true form is not in the Spirit Realm," Li Xuan explained calmly.</p><p></p><p>"This wasn't her true form?" Xu Yan and the others were shocked. </p><p></p><p>Especially Wu Tiannan and the others - even a Heavenly Venerable had been devoured, how could such a powerful Meiwu not be in her true form?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't explain further. He was waiting for Meiwu to reconstitute and reappear.</p><p></p><p>Pink light surged out from the Sky Cave. </p><p></p><p>Meiwu's form appeared again, though she seemed somewhat weaker, as her body had just reconstituted.</p><p></p><p>"You have impressive skills. This servant will remember you. Those who offend me, Meiwu, never come to a good end!" </p><p></p><p>The newly reconstituted Meiwu's gaze was cold, as if she had become a different person. Or as if her personality had changed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up and walked out of the Changqing Pavilion flying ship. He said calmly, "Do you know why I was waiting for you?"</p><p></p><p>Meiwu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"I wanted to tell you that killing you is not difficult, even across countless spaces."</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, a mysterious aura emerged. </p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness Divine Image also appeared.</p><p></p><p>This Meiwu was definitely an extremely powerful being, and her true form should be very strong.</p><p></p><p>She just couldn't come over.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan wanted to intimidate her, to make her feel wary.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Wilderness Divine Image appeared, Meiwu's cold eyes revealed a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>Behind that person seemed to be the beginning of heaven and earth, the opening of primordial chaos - primitive, ancient, eternal... mysterious and unfathomable. Compared to him, even heaven and earth seemed tiny.</p><p></p><p>This was how Meiwu felt!</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were even more shocked, their eyes nearly popping out of their sockets. Their mouths hung open without realizing it, their whole beings dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" </p><p></p><p>Inside the Changqing Pavilion, Xu Yan and the others were deeply shaken.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slightly raised his hand. As he moved, heaven and earth shook, as if about to be overturned, as if the world was about to shatter.</p><p></p><p>His hand paused slightly, not continuing to rise. Instead, his finger hooked, and a wisp of Meiwu's aura fell into his hand.</p><p></p><p>"This sword is a warning for you!"</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan spoke, he flicked his finger. A golden dragon plunged down, instantly tearing apart Meiwu. Then it transformed into a giant golden sword that stabbed towards the Sky Cave, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The Breath-Stilling God-Slaying Sword! Using a wisp of Meiwu's aura, it struck directly at her true form with one sword!</p><p></p><p>This was a warning.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan estimated that although this sword strike was powerful, it might not necessarily be able to kill Meiwu.</p><p></p><p>However, it was enough to intimidate her.</p><p></p><p>He looked back at the Great Wilderness Divine Image and shook his head. The mysterious aura receded, the Divine Image disappeared, and he returned to sit down in his chair on the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>He had returned to his ordinary, unremarkable appearance.</p><p></p><p>From the appearance of the Great Wilderness Divine Image to raising his hand to kill Meiwu, it had only been a brief moment.</p><p></p><p>However, Fu Tianhai and the other powerful figures of the Spirit Realm were all utterly shocked, their eyes becoming dazed.</p><p></p><p>What an incredibly powerful being this was.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had said that if his master leaked even a trace of his origin essence, it would bring calamity to heaven and earth. They thought he was just exaggerating about his master, but it turned out to be true!</p><p></p><p>Just slightly raising his hand made heaven and earth shake, as if about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Such a powerful existence was simply inconceivable!</p><p></p><p>It completely exceeded their understanding of what a powerful expert could be!</p><p></p><p>How difficult it must be for this great master!</p><p></p><p>In order to save the Spirit Realm and kill Meiwu, he had no choice but to take action. Yet he didn't dare use even a tiny bit of his true power, forcefully suppressing his cultivation. One can imagine how helpless the great master must feel inside.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm felt their horizons had been broadened. So there really were such terrifying beings in the world, completely beyond the upper limits of their understanding of "powerful experts".</p><p></p><p>"We thank the great master for saving our Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The kindness of the great master will be remembered by the Spirit Realm for ten thousand generations!"</p><p></p><p>The Emperor of Great Zhou was the first to prostrate himself and call out loudly.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others also prostrated themselves, extremely respectful.</p><p></p><p>They were extremely excited inside. With such a great master in the Spirit Realm, they could rest easy. How could there be any crisis?</p><p></p><p>However, the disaster in Yun Province and Daze Province had caused unimaginable damage. It would take a very long time to recover.</p><p></p><p>"It was a small matter," Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>His disciple had said that if he moved even slightly, heaven and earth would shake. Of course he had to make it seem true.</p><p></p><p>So when he raised his hand earlier, although it seemed heaven and earth were shaking, in reality he had simply directly manipulated the laws of heaven and earth to create an illusion.</p><p></p><p>But because the shaking was created using the laws of heaven and earth, it felt no different from actual shaking of heaven and earth, and it was difficult to detect any difference.</p><p></p><p>In terms of understanding the laws of heaven and earth, Li Xuan was confident that if he claimed second place, no one would dare claim first.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Cave returned to calm. No pink aura emerged. Meiwu seemed to have been completely killed.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship came above the Sky Cave. Everyone looked down at the gray-black cave, like a huge hole, with unknown auras swirling within.</p><p></p><p>"A hole in heaven and earth? This is an space opened up within heaven and earth?" Li Xuan was somewhat surprised and doubtful.</p><p></p><p>No wonder Xu Yan was able to comprehend the method to break through to the Void Realm inside the Sky Cave. The existence of the Sky Cave was like a hole opened up in the void of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>With a movement of his body, he stepped into the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>His divine sense covered the entire Sky Cave. Li Xuan had already sensed the extraordinary aura Xu Yan had mentioned. It was indeed extraordinary, with a vague sense of an indestructible charm.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, wisps of aura gathered.</p><p></p><p>Invisible and intangible aura swirled around his palm. Li Xuan silently examined it. This aura was very special, seemingly impossible to refine.</p><p></p><p>Being impossible to refine meant that martial artists could not use it. Moreover, once it entered the body, if the amount became too much, it would actually negatively affect martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of aura is this?" Li Xuan was curious inside. His gaze turned to the bottom of the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>This Sky Cave was neither too large nor too small. Apart from being like a gray-black hole filled with extraordinary aura, there was nothing else.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>The bottom of the Sky Cave was neither soil nor the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"A kind of barrier? A barrier of heaven and earth?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Wisps of aura emerged from the bottom of the Sky Cave. Meiwu's power had also emerged in this way.</p><p></p><p>"Outside of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was almost certain that Meiwu was an enemy from outside heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The charm of the Dao laws, yet not completely. This is a barrier of heaven and earth, blocking entry from outside while also preventing the leakage of spiritual energy from inside.</p><p></p><p>"What exactly is outside heaven and earth?" The Sky Cave was caused by an external impact. Outsiders could infiltrate, but those inside heaven and earth could not cross the barrier to the outside.</p><p></p><p>"Is it protecting the origin of heaven and earth from leaking, or is it also a kind of constraint?"</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan sensed the bottom of the Sky Cave, the more he felt the existence of the Sky Cave was unusual.</p><p></p><p>Thank you to [Leading Army Western Expedition] for becoming a league leader ^_^</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

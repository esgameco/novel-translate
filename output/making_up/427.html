        <h1>Chapter 427</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a prodigy from the Hundred Battles Hall, to be able to safely retreat under the Hundred-Eyed Evil Light of the Ancestor of Fallen Witches!"</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ting's Hundred Battles Intent must be extremely powerful to be able to resist the Hundred-Eyed Evil Light."</p><p></p><p>"It's probably related to Hong Ting's physique. I've heard he has a Thunder Spirit Body."</p><p></p><p>The other martial artists in the Heavenly Cave couldn't help but exclaim in admiration as they watched Hong Ting retreat safely.</p><p></p><p>Among these martial artists, one person's eyes flickered, secretly delighted in his heart. Had an opportunity just presented itself like this? "Could the Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend Lord really be omniscient?"</p><p></p><p>Although Hong Ting had retreated under the Hundred-Eyed Evil Light of the Fallen Witch, he must have been affected, with his strength greatly reduced. It was the perfect time for an ambush.</p><p></p><p>Silently, he left the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave to notify the assassins who had already been arranged, to find an opportunity to strike.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>In a city in the Long Cloud Realm, a branch of the Myriad Treasures Alliance suddenly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>A god-like figure, with a blade coiling with wind and thunder, instantly cleaved open the treasury. With a wave of his hand, he swept clean all the stored treasures inside.</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists were dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Too fierce, too bold - who was this formidable person who directly robbed a branch of the Myriad Treasures Alliance?</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're seeking death!" </p><p></p><p>An angry roar came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Only then did the crowd realize that this was the fierce man hunted by the Myriad Treasures Alliance, the one called the God of War, Meng Chong! No wonder he was so bold.</p><p></p><p>"I'm a bit short on treasures, so I came to your Myriad Treasures Alliance to gather some. Not too much, right?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered, his figure soaring into the sky and instantly disappearing into the distance.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable of the Myriad Treasures Alliance, seeing this branch turned into ruins, his eyes turned red.</p><p></p><p>As an Immortal Venerable responsible for hunting down Meng Chong, not only had he failed to kill him, but the other party had found an opportunity to destroy a branch. What a great shame and humiliation!</p><p></p><p>Where was the dignity of a mighty Immortal Venerable?</p><p></p><p>"You can say that if you can catch up."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>His figure suddenly accelerated, disappearing from the Immortal Venerable's sight in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Changing his appearance and putting on a wig, he transformed from a burly brute into a tall, slender youth.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was already extremely skilled at this.</p><p></p><p>His aura also changed immediately. He swaggered into a city and began to scout out branches of the Myriad Treasures Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Since they were already at odds, there was no need to be polite anymore. He would make a big score, then leave the Long Cloud Realm and continue roaming the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Accumulate enough treasures to build up his foundation, then break through and transform.</p><p></p><p>"Hm?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong overheard a group of martial artists discussing.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ting of the Hundred Battles Hall is dead. They say he was killed by someone called Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>"I heard that too. Hong Ting was hit by the Hundred-Eyed Evil Light in the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave, his strength greatly reduced, which allowed Xu Yan to take advantage and kill him."</p><p></p><p>"This person is so bold, daring to assassinate a prodigy of the Hundred Battles Hall. You should know that Hong Ting was one of the Immortal Realm candidates of the Hundred Battles Hall, highly valued."</p><p></p><p>"Not only that, I heard Hong Ting's father is one of the top Immortal Venerables of the Hundred Battles Hall."</p><p></p><p>Hearing these discussions, Meng Chong raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"How could Big Senior Brother kill someone by taking advantage of their weakness? Moreover, Big Senior Brother never provokes others unprovoked. It seems this is another frame-up by the Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's face darkened. These Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows were truly persistent, and deeply hidden, with extremely deep plans. It wouldn't be easy to uproot them completely.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Battles Hall has already issued a challenge, asking Xu Yan to come to the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave for a duel, life or death, to settle the grudge."</p><p></p><p>"This is really the style of the Hundred Battles Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, they say this time an Immortal Venerable expert from the Hundred Battles Hall will take action. Xu Yan is definitely dead."</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, hasn't the Hundred Battles Hall always insisted on duels between those of the same realm? This time is an exception?"</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. Hong Ting had a special status as an Immortal Realm candidate. And it's said that as long as Xu Yan can withstand ten moves from the Immortal Venerable of the Hundred Battles Hall, the grudge will be considered settled."</p><p></p><p>"That's an Immortal Venerable of the Hundred Battles Hall, you should understand. Forget ten moves, Xu Yan won't even be able to withstand one move. He'll certainly die!"</p><p></p><p>"What if Xu Yan doesn't accept the challenge?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, if he doesn't accept, it'll be even worse. The Hundred Battles Hall will stop following the rules then. You should have heard what happened to someone who was too cowardly to accept a challenge before."</p><p></p><p>Hearing the discussions of the crowd, Meng Chong frowned. This Hundred Battles Hall seemed extremely powerful, even more so than the Myriad Treasures Alliance? Moreover, Hong Ting was an Immortal Realm candidate of the Hundred Battles Hall, and his father was a top Immortal Venerable of the Hundred Battles Hall. How could they let this go?</p><p></p><p>"I should contact Big Senior Brother about how to handle this Hundred Battles Hall matter."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out a communication talisman and sent a message to his Big Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Hundred Battles Hall? Hong Ting?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had just come out of seclusion, preparing to go to the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave. Seeing Meng Chong's message, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Second Junior Brother, don't worry. It's just a small matter. It's not so easy to impersonate me to kill someone. Since the Hundred Battles Hall wants a duel, then let's have one."</p><p></p><p>"As soon as I make my move, they'll naturally know I didn't kill the person. If they still won't let it go even knowing I didn't kill him, then don't blame me for being merciless."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't take this seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Battles Hall was strong, but so what? After ending the communication with Meng Chong, Xu Yan continued towards the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave. The martial artists of the Hundred Battles Hall had set the duel location outside the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows are truly persistent. Since that's the case, let's have a contest then."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze turned cold.</p><p></p><p>The prerequisite for counterattacking the Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows was to find their people, control them with the Heaven's Will Divine Technique, and then use this to continuously expand his personnel within the Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows.</p><p></p><p>Just like in the Nine Mountains Realm's Big Lid Mountain, where he ultimately destroyed the branch of the Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see what tricks you Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows have up your sleeves."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment. If this trip went smoothly, the Hundred Battles Hall should also take action against the Heavenly Fiends and Earthly Shadows. If the Hundred Battles Hall insisted on believing he killed the person, then he would have to use some methods.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave won't disappoint me. Mei Wu, you must remember to come find me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave, the crowd looked at the people from the Hundred Battles Hall, shocked in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting had actually been killed! The one who did it was a prodigy called Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He had taken advantage of Hong Ting's weakness to kill him. Did he rely on a strong background, unafraid of the Hundred Battles Hall's revenge?</p><p></p><p>Outside the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave, several men stood proudly, their battle intent blazing.</p><p></p><p>One of them held a spiked mace in his hand, his battle intent soaring to the heavens, seemingly turning this area into a battlefield filled with surging battle intent.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable of the Hundred Battles Hall, and not just an early-stage Immortal Realm one.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Venerables guarding the Fallen Witch Heavenly Cave didn't show their faces now, afraid of being misunderstood as having something to do with Hong Ting's death.</p><p></p><p>"We'll wait one more day. If Xu Yan doesn't come, it means he has no intention of settling the grudge. Then don't blame my Hundred Battles Hall for bullying him!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>His aura erupted, each spike on the mace in his hand radiating a sharp intent.</p><p></p><p>"Who is this Xu Yan? Which faction's prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>"Never heard of him. Probably not a prodigy from the Long Cloud Realm. He might have already left the Long Cloud Realm."</p><p></p><p>"I've heard a little about him. Xu Yan is called the Sword..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"God, the sword way reigns supreme in the world!"</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous! There are countless sword masters, yet he dares to call himself the Sword God? The supreme sword master in the world? How arrogant! I have cultivated the sword way for countless years and would never dare to claim supremacy among peers!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists in the crowd discussed animatedly, and some information about Xu Yan began to spread.</p><p></p><p>For example, claims that he was the Sword God, supreme in the sword way under heaven.</p><p></p><p>Without doubt, Tiansha Diying was fanning the flames behind these rumors.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan's sword skills are extremely powerful. It's said that Hong Ting was killed on the spot by a single sword strike to the throat!"</p><p></p><p>"He just took advantage of Hong Ting's weakness. If Hong Ting hadn't been in the Tuowu Heavenly Cave, weakened by the Hundred-Eyed Evil Light, how could he have been killed?"</p><p></p><p>"Well said. Hong Ting was a genius of the Hundred Battles Hall who had condensed the will of a hundred battles. Even if outmatched among peers, he absolutely wouldn't be killed by a single sword strike to the throat. If he wanted to escape, he could definitely have saved his life."</p><p></p><p>Time passed as the martial artists continued their discussions.</p><p></p><p>"One hour left!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's face was extremely gloomy. The few Hundred Battles Hall martial artists beside him were also brimming with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Swish! A young man descended, holding a sword, handsome and elegant with a calm gaze.</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze fell on Luo Zhan. He couldn't help but click his tongue - this Immortal Lord of the Hundred Battles Hall was somewhat stronger than the Eight-Leaf Tiansha.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, there was a proud fighting spirit on the other's body, as if he had just returned from a great battle on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Xu Yan?" Luo Zhan looked over with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Sword God Xu Yan, that's me." Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, you killed Hong Ting, didn't you?" Luo Zhan asked, holding his wolf-tooth club with a spirited fighting intent.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Dare to do it but not admit it? Boy, you really think my Hundred Battles Hall is easy to bully?" Luo Zhan said angrily.</p><p></p><p>"Was Hong Ting's corpse left behind?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>"What, you want to use the wounds on the corpse to argue you're not involved?" Luo Zhan sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not. I just want to tell you, and everyone present, that when I Xu Yan make a move, it's against an enemy. When dealing with enemies, I hold one principle - to make the enemy vanish without a trace, absolutely not leaving behind a corpse to pollute the environment."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone: ...</p><p></p><p>Even Luo Zhan was stunned. Is this your defense?</p><p></p><p>"Ridiculous!" Luo Zhan raged, "You think you can absolve yourself with a few words?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmly said: "Then make your move. You're an Immortal Lord, you'll naturally know if I killed him or not!"</p><p></p><p>"Fine!"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan didn't waste words. With a boom, the wolf-tooth club was instantly raised and smashed down.</p><p></p><p>This strike gathered the power of heaven and earth, like a ferocious and hideous giant wolf, with cold fangs, fiercely striking towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A black sword light slashed out.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and struck with one sword - the divine ability Absolute Heaven-Severing Sword! A sword intent that seemed to annihilate all of heaven and earth instantly appeared between heaven and earth. The watching martial artists were all shocked and retreated.</p><p></p><p>Puff! This sword strike hit the hideous wolf head, directly splitting it in two. Even Luo Zhan, wielding the power of heaven and earth, was shaken.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone looked at the young man in the arena with shock.</p><p></p><p>Although Luo Zhan's strike wasn't his full power, just an ordinary Immortal Lord's strike, Xu Yan wasn't an Immortal Lord! Yet he had destroyed this strike with one sword?</p><p></p><p>Any True King Lord would have no way to resist Luo Zhan's strike, let alone destroy it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan made one sword strike, then looked at Luo Zhan and calmly said: "How about it? Could your genius block this sword of mine? What similarities are there between the sword wounds on the corpse and my sword?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's gaze focused, his heart shocked. Even Hong Ting at his peak couldn't have blocked this sword strike from Xu Yan. If he wanted to kill Hong Ting, there was no need to take advantage of weakness.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the sword wound on Hong Ting's body was too different from Xu Yan's sword way.</p><p></p><p>He was an Immortal Lord, not a weakling. He naturally understood the difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, he said solemnly: "Indeed, you didn't kill him!"</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists were in an uproar, all extremely shocked. Someone had framed Xu Yan, intending to provoke conflict between the Hundred Battles Hall and Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, seeing that the Hundred Battles Hall was as rumored - although fond of fighting, they were also straightforward and not hypocritical. So he said: "Framing me, provoking conflict with your Hundred Battles Hall, there's only one force."</p><p></p><p>"What force?" Luo Zhan was furious. The Hundred Battles Hall had nearly been used as a pawn. He was filled with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Tiansha Diying!" Xu Yan said word by word.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fixed on Luo Zhan, wanting to see if this Hundred Battles Hall expert had heard of the Tiansha Diying force.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan's expression froze, then he raged: "Good, good, good, so it's those skulking Tiansha Diying bastards? They dare to extend their hands to my Hundred Battles Hall? Do they think we can't find them?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised. "You actually know about Tiansha Diying? That makes things easier. These skulking fellows have been haunting me relentlessly. Framing me this time certainly won't be the last."</p><p></p><p>"I've been wanting to find these guys. Since we both have grudges, let's cooperate a bit."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan pondered briefly, thinking of Xu Yan's sword strike, then nodded: "Alright, this isn't the place to talk."</p><p></p><p>Not far from the Tuowu Heavenly Cave, in a temporarily built shelter, Xu Yan was quite surprised to see Hong Ting, the Hundred Battles Hall genius who was rumored to have been killed by a single sword strike to the throat.</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ting used a secret technique to fake death and escape, but he was also severely injured and remains in a coma," Luo Zhan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood somewhat. Luo Zhan bringing him here was actually to confirm one last time whether he was truly the killer or not.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan sighed inwardly that his master's teachings were indeed great wisdom.</p><p></p><p>When killing enemies, one must crush their bones, scatter their ashes, and destroy their souls, giving the enemy not the slightest chance to escape! Tiansha Diying probably never expected that Hong Ting would have such a secret technique, thus escaping death. Of course, this was also related to Tiansha Diying's need to frame him, requiring a corpse to be left behind.</p><p></p><p>"The main reason he remains in a coma is due to some strange force eroding him, making him sleepy and lazy, unwilling to wake once asleep..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was amazed and said: "Could this be the Tuowu force?"</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was secretly shocked. The other had seen through the cause at a glance, and his sword skills were beyond his understanding. This person's teacher must be extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Luo Zhan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered briefly, then took out a medicinal pill and said: "I can wake him up, but I can't do anything about his injuries."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the Tuowu force in Hong Ting's body, Xu Yan was secretly alarmed. This strange force couldn't be underestimated. Once it invaded the body, it was extremely troublesome.</p><p></p><p>This was a strange force that directly eroded the will, making people degenerate and lazy.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

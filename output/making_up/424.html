        <h1>Chapter 424</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, have you come to provoke my Wanbao Alliance?" </p><p></p><p>"I've come to clarify something. I didn't kill your alliance leader's disciple. I, Meng Chong, take responsibility for my actions. If I had killed him, I wouldn't deny it. So your Wanbao Alliance owes me an explanation for attacking me without cause.</p><p></p><p>Of course, I'm magnanimous. Since I've already killed the attacker and emptied your branch's treasury, consider that compensation for me.</p><p></p><p>If your alliance leader is willing, we can write off this misunderstanding. But if you insist on claiming I killed his disciple, then bring it on!"</p><p></p><p>Silence! Everyone in the Wanbao Alliance branch, including the branch manager, the treasure guards, and the many martial artists who had come to buy and sell treasures, now stared in shock at this bald brute.</p><p></p><p>Too arrogant!</p><p></p><p>"What's the problem?" Meng Chong sneered, "I've already given your Wanbao Alliance a way out. Don't be foolish. You're the ones at fault, wrongly accusing me of killing your leader's disciple. I was merely defending myself."</p><p></p><p>The branch manager and head of the treasure guards trembled with anger. This was too much! He had come directly to trample on the Wanbao Alliance's face. This youth was too brazen. If they didn't eliminate him, how could the Wanbao Alliance save face?</p><p></p><p>"Kid, enough talk. Surrender and go see our alliance leader. If he believes your words, then naturally this will be written off!" the manager said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong had single-handedly destroyed a Wanbao Alliance branch and killed all the True King Celestial Lords who had surrounded him, that branch was not as powerful as this one. After all, that was just a small city.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone, capture this man. Our alliance leader will richly reward you!" the manager called out loudly.</p><p></p><p>The Wanbao Alliance leader, Yan Shanhe, was a top-tier Immortal Celestial Lord with a formidable reputation in the Longcloud Realm. Which Immortal Realm expert in the entire Longcloud Realm wouldn't give him some face? </p><p></p><p>The experts from several major factions all had connections with him.</p><p></p><p>Whether for the reward or to curry favor with Yan Shanhe, many True King Celestial Lord experts wouldn't miss this opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's gaze turned cold. He knew the conflict with the Wanbao Alliance could not be reconciled. They had already put a bounty on him. Since that was the case, it would come down to strength and ability.</p><p></p><p>His current strength may not match the Wanbao Alliance leader Yan Shanhe, but once he broke through again, he would be able to crush him.</p><p></p><p>"Before you all interfere, think carefully if you can withstand my blade!" Meng Chong held his knife.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant brat, you think you alone can sweep us all away? You're not an Immortal Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The battle erupted. A group of True King Celestial Lords instantly joined forces to attack Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>However, faced with such a fierce attack, Meng Chong was not afraid at all. Boundless divine waves appeared, and he also activated the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Refinements technique to cultivate his physical body.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The many attacks landed on his body but couldn't shake him at all.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>A flash of knife light, like lightning streaking across the sky. With a puff, a True King Celestial Lord instantly perished!</p><p></p><p>The moment he struck, Meng Chong knew he was going to get rich!</p><p></p><p>This Wanbao Alliance branch was larger than the one in the previous city, so it must have stored more treasures. Since he had already made his move, there was no need to be polite.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A great sun appeared, and a godlike figure suddenly emerged, shocking countless martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"I am the Divine Meng Chong, here to destroy a Wanbao Alliance branch!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's voice was like a thunderclap, spreading in all directions. The sun and stars appeared, wind and thunder swept across heaven and earth, knife light illuminated half the sky. Under the shocked gazes of the many martial artists, that godlike figure slew one True King Celestial Lord after another.</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lords who had originally prepared to join the battle instantly lost their nerve, their faces showing shock.</p><p></p><p>This youth could only be matched by an Immortal Celestial Lord! Especially that terrifying physical defense - no matter how they attacked, they couldn't harm him at all.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists who had come to aid the Wanbao Alliance now had thoughts of retreat. As one person fearfully retreated, others frantically followed suit.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong ignored these people. He swung his knife down, slicing open the Wanbao Alliance's treasury. He collected all the treasures inside, including the many storage bags, as well as those carried by the head of the treasure guards and the branch manager.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A presence suddenly appeared between heaven and earth, as if a powerful being was now in control of this realm.</p><p></p><p>The power of heavenly laws continuously descended.</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Celestial Lord was rushing over, about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Everyone's faces lit up with joy. An Immortal Celestial Lord had finally appeared!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was surely doomed!</p><p></p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered, took a step, and like the sun crossing the sky, he instantly reached the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"Where do you think you're going!"</p><p></p><p>That Immortal Celestial Lord roared angrily and gave chase.</p><p></p><p>The two figures instantly vanished on the horizon. At this moment, the many martial artists in the city looked at where the Wanbao Alliance branch had been, now reduced to ruins.</p><p></p><p>The deeply hidden treasury had been completely looted.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this fierce character come from?"</p><p></p><p>"The Wanbao Alliance has had two branches destroyed in succession. They probably won't sit idle now."</p><p></p><p>"Divine Meng Chong will surely go down in martial arts history as an infamous name. Even if he dies, it was worth it."</p><p></p><p>"I suddenly lost confidence. An Immortal Celestial Lord may not necessarily be able to hunt him down!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm envious. Meng Chong looted so many treasures. If only..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd of martial artists suddenly started breathing heavily.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was now a walking treasury.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Wanbao Alliance branches all had powerful experts guarding them, with extremely strong defenses for their treasuries. Unless an Immortal Celestial Lord took action, they couldn't be breached.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no one dared to rob a Wanbao Alliance treasury.</p><p></p><p>But then Meng Chong appeared, this fierce character who directly breached the treasuries of two branches, looting who knows how many martial arts resources.</p><p></p><p>However, thinking of Meng Chong's strength and ferocity, robbing him would be even harder than breaching a Wanbao Alliance branch!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan emerged from seclusion and went to a city in the Longcloud Realm, intending to gather information about the situation with the Heavenly Caves there.</p><p></p><p>"The Wanbao Alliance is hunting my junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>As a result, Xu Yan discovered the Wanbao Alliance's bounty.</p><p></p><p>He immediately took out a communication talisman to contact Meng Chong and understand the situation.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Brother, it's a small matter. If the Wanbao Alliance wants to hunt me, let them. For now, there's no need for you to intervene.</p><p></p><p>Although I'm no match for an Immortal Celestial Lord, they can't threaten me either. I've already shaken him off. I won't stay in the Longcloud Realm for long. Once I find the chance to loot a few more Wanbao Alliance branches, I'll leave the Longcloud Realm."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong replied in his message.</p><p></p><p>Senior Brother was surely preparing to go to the Heavenly Caves. If he got involved in this matter, he wouldn't be able to go. Therefore, Meng Chong didn't intend to let Senior Brother take action.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Wanbao Alliance couldn't threaten him yet.</p><p></p><p>He was just passing through the Longcloud Realm. He had almost gathered enough treasures needed to build up his foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Second Junior Brother, be careful. If you need anything, send me a message."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With Second Junior Brother's methods of concealing his identity and hiding himself, avoiding pursuit wouldn't be too difficult.</p><p></p><p>"I've reached great completion in the Divine Phase realm. My divine..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'm not far from perfecting the Realm of Appearance. Once I reach the peak of the Divine Appearance Realm, I'll be able to kill ordinary Immortal Realm cultivators," Xu Yan thought to himself silently.</p><p></p><p>"I must break through to the Void-Breaking Realm soon. Once I enter that realm, I'll be able to sweep through the Immortal Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Somewhere in the Long Cloud Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, we've discovered Xu Yan's whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. Where is he?"</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has appeared here..."</p><p></p><p>"I'll deal with him personally. Xu Yan's time of death has come. Let's see how powerful the people behind him are, and whether they can stir up a storm in the Divine Realm!"</p><p></p><p>A man wearing a fierce mask engraved with eight leaves spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came out of the Treasure Alliance branch and looked back, hesitating slightly. In the end, he decided not to destroy this Treasure Alliance branch.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, the Treasure Alliance can't threaten my junior brother for now. If they become a threat, I can deal with them later."</p><p></p><p>At the Treasure Alliance, Xu Yan purchased a catalog of divine realm treasures and an introduction to the celestial caves of various realms.</p><p></p><p>The Treasure Alliance has branches across thirty realms, so they naturally have information for sale about the various realms of the divine world and the differences between celestial caves in each realm.</p><p></p><p>As a merchant alliance, they are especially knowledgeable about all kinds of heavenly treasures in the divine realm, particularly rare and precious materials, and they sell catalogs of these treasures.</p><p></p><p>Sometimes they even publicly seek to purchase certain special and rare treasures.</p><p></p><p>After learning this information, Xu Yan immediately came to the Treasure Alliance to buy the relevant information he needed.</p><p></p><p>He also inquired about information on the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, but there was no information available about it.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't sure if it was because this Treasure Alliance branch was not high-level enough to have access to information about the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow, or if that organization was truly so deeply hidden that even the Treasure Alliance had no relevant information.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan leaned towards the former explanation - that this Treasure Alliance branch was not high-level enough to access intelligence on the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"The most famous celestial cave in the Long Cloud Realm is this Demonic Shaman Celestial Cave, also known as the Tuo Shaman Celestial Cave. It was occupied by a powerful outsider named Tuo Shaman.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Shaman possesses the light of a hundred eyes. Once illuminated by this hundred-eyed light, it can make people lazy, weak all over, depressed, and lacking in fighting spirit. It becomes difficult to exert one's full strength."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's attention was drawn to the description of one celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Tuo Shaman? Could he be from the same place as Mei Shaman? If I go to this celestial cave, I wonder if I could lure Mei Shaman there."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go check out the Tuo Shaman Celestial Cave and see if this Tuo Shaman is really as bizarrely powerful as the rumors say."</p><p></p><p>The records about Tuo Shaman all focused on his hundred-eyed light, which could make people lazy, weak and lacking in fighting spirit. </p><p></p><p>Even Immortal Realm cultivators who encountered it had to be cautious. With the slightest carelessness, they could face the danger of perishing.</p><p></p><p>There was once an Immortal Realm cultivator who was illuminated by the hundred-eyed light and couldn't resist it. He became lazy and weak all over. When faced with an attack, he couldn't even muster the spirit to respond.</p><p></p><p>In the end, another Immortal Realm cultivator had to intervene to rescue him from the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the Immortal Realm Tuo Shaman in the Tuo Shaman Celestial Cave, there are other weaker Tuo Shamans. I'm not sure if they are all avatars or not."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left the city, determined his direction, and set off towards the Tuo Shaman Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>"With my mastery of the Wisdom Sword Realm, not transforming sword intent, the myriad phenomena of mountains and rivers, and the eye of the minor Dao, the power of Tuo Shaman should not be able to affect me."</p><p></p><p>His martial prowess was far beyond what the Tai Cang martial arts could compare to, and he had more methods to deal with these bizarre powers.</p><p></p><p>Just after leaving the city, Xu Yan suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>A figure floated over, as if this part of the world was already under someone's control.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer wore a fierce mask with eight leaves engraved on it.</p><p></p><p>"An Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>In the Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadow organization, Seven-Leaf Heavenly Fiends were Immortal Realm cultivators. Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiends were already at a higher level among Immortal Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As for the Earthly Shadows, their tasks involved infiltration, assassination and so on. They excelled at stealth, concealment and assassination techniques.</p><p></p><p>Earthly Shadows with dark cloud masks had strength at the Immortal Realm level.</p><p></p><p>This Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend's strength had indeed surpassed that of ordinary Immortal Realm cultivators. Although still weaker than powerhouses like the Great Mountain Emperor, he was not far from the top ranks among Immortal Realm cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Based on Xu Yan's understanding of Immortal Realm cultivators, the Great Mountain Emperor was at the late stage of the Immortal Realm and ranked among the top Immortal Realm cultivators. Sui Hongwu was at the early stage of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>This Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend was at the middle stage of the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You Heavenly Fiend Earthly Shadows really are persistent."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, not afraid at all.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, you are the most talented person I have ever seen. Today I will strangle this talent in its cradle!" </p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You, a rat who hides his head and shows his tail?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>"Your arrival is timely. Let me test my martial arts on you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled contemptuously.</p><p></p><p>"You are the first genius to look down on an Immortal Realm cultivator. Those who disrespect the Immortal Realm are bound to die!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend raised his palm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The power of heaven and earth gathered, as if this part of the world was all within his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>As his palm pressed down, the power of heaven and earth crashed down, as if wrapping up this part of the world to crush down.</p><p></p><p>Hum! As Xu Yan waved his hand, the Yin-Yang Undying Sword emerged endlessly, the Divine Image of Mountains and Rivers appeared, and the power of the laws of heaven and earth descended. In an instant, it directly weakened the opponent's control over the power of this part of the world.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend frowned, looking at Xu Yan's Divine Image of Mountains and Rivers with some astonishment.</p><p></p><p>Though not at the Immortal Realm, it had a similar ability to control the laws of heaven and earth. Although compared to Immortal Realm cultivators, this control over the laws of heaven and earth was not the same as controlling a part of the world, it did weaken the Immortal Realm cultivator's control.</p><p></p><p>It was as if two Immortal Realm cultivators were fighting, each controlling a part of the world to battle.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder he could sweep through undefeated below the Immortal Realm. With this martial art, who among the True King Heavenly Venerable could match him?"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend was inwardly alarmed, yet also secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Such a profound martial art shows that there must be an extremely powerful expert behind Xu Yan. Killing him will enrage that powerful expert, and the Divine Realm will surely be thrown into chaos."</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend's eyes flashed with a bright light. Now he understood why Lord Tian Seventeen insisted on killing Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>This was the quickest, most efficient way to stir up a storm in the Divine Realm in the shortest time!</p><p></p><p>"Although your martial art is profound, you have not yet entered the Immortal Realm. Today you must die!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend laughed coldly, a cold divine sword appearing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! A cold light flashed across the sky, the sword light condensing the power of heaven and earth, slashing down in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow and sneered disdainfully, "A frog in a well dares to use a sword in front of me, the Sword God Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Hum! As soon as the Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend's sword entered the Yin-Yang Sword Wheel, it was slashed back, the sword light becoming even more fierce, and seeming to contain intelligence.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The Eight-Leaf Heavenly Fiend was shocked.</p><p></p><p>In terms of swordsmanship, he was considered the best in the Long Cloud Realm.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 164</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng finished speaking and looked expectantly at Su Lingxiu, asking, "Sister Lingxiu, do you have any strengthening body pills?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded and said, "For cultivating the physical body, the Golden Body Pill is the strongest, but that is only for my second senior brother to take. You all do not cultivate the martial Dao of the physical body, so the Golden Body Pill is not suitable for you.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go with the Strengthening Body Pill. The effect is also not bad, at least it can strengthen the physical body by one fold, so there shouldn't be any major problems."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were overjoyed, as strengthening their physical bodies by one fold would also bring a significant increase in their strength.</p><p></p><p>"Miss Su, do you think these spirit herbs are complete?" Hu Shan asked.</p><p></p><p>"More or less, the few missing spirit herbs, I'll make up for them. Since you have forged so many things for me, it's only natural that I'll refine the pills for you for free," Su Lingxiu said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>This set of assembly line pill furnaces, as well as the new pill furnace, were not of low value.</p><p></p><p>Taking out the spirit herbs, Su Lingxiu excitedly began refining the pills. The new pill furnace had a higher grade and was redesigned by her to be more suitable for pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the refining speed was nearly doubled, and the pill quality was even better.</p><p></p><p>A furnace of Qi-Gathering Pills was directly refined into thirty-six pieces.</p><p></p><p>She then refined the necessary medicinal pills for healing injuries.</p><p></p><p>Finally, she refined the Strengthening Body Pill, and Su Lingxiu was extremely excited. Pill refining seemed to be addictive, and she couldn't stop.</p><p></p><p>The more she refined, the more excited she became, as if at this moment, she was truly experiencing the joy of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>"This pill furnace is not bad!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's so good, it's so good!" Hu Shan couldn't stop grinning.</p><p></p><p>Bottle after bottle of medicinal pills were obtained, and he was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After Hu Shan's spirit herbs were all refined, Su Lingxiu finally ended the pill refining.</p><p></p><p>With the medicinal pills, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were greatly excited and wholeheartedly immersed themselves in cultivation, striving to quickly enhance their strength.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Lingxiu, with Xu Yan's help, she continued to ponder the Bagua.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, Kou Ruozhi led a group to build a pill refining assembly line, and the people needed for pill refining had already been selected.</p><p></p><p>They were all young men and women around fourteen or fifteen years old, and they were from impoverished backgrounds. They had received aid from the Tianmu Sect, which had improved their lives, and they had unwavering faith and loyalty to the Tianmu.</p><p></p><p>And Su Lingxiu was the Tianmu they believed in, and they would absolutely not betray her.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was reliable and meticulous in his work. Ever since he no longer obsessed over rebellion and had dissolved the Tianmu Sect to reorganize it into the Changqing Hall, he had a new life purpose and was more active and diligent in his work.</p><p></p><p>On the Bagua diagram, with Xu Yan's help, Su Lingxiu had gained some insights. She only needed to break through a thin layer to see the heavens and the earth.</p><p></p><p>Standing in the center of the Bagua diagram, some realizations emerged in her mind, and the positions of the Bagua began to appear one by one in her consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched from the side. This final realization needed his shijie to comprehend on her own, so that she could cultivate a technique that truly belonged to her.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu slightly furrowed her brows. She clearly felt that she was just a step away from comprehending a powerful body technique, but she was stuck at a certain point and couldn't break through.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a butterfly fluttered over, seemingly attracted by her fragrant aura, dancing around her in graceful circles.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, a flash of insight struck Su Lingxiu, and she finally comprehended! She revealed an excited expression, stepping out with a floating, ethereal movement, as if she were the butterfly dancing, silent and invisible. However, layers of afterimages emerged, overlapping her true form, making it difficult to discern where her real body was or which of the numerous afterimages was her true self.</p><p></p><p>On the Bagua diagram, Su Lingxiu's figure danced like a butterfly, seeming real yet illusory, impossible to capture or track.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, his shijie had finally comprehended.</p><p></p><p>He also had some realizations emerge in his mind. The profundity of the Bagua, the Heavenly Dao, he felt that he was not far from comprehending a new sword technique beyond the Apiarist Sword.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, who was nearby, also had some insights and came over, prepared to mutually verify and exchange with his elder brother.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu finally stopped, her jade-like face flushed with excitement. She had finally comprehended a body technique!</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, I've comprehended a body technique, let's call it the Thousand Butterfly Illusion," she said.</p><p></p><p>The inspiration from the dancing butterfly had broken through that thin layer, allowing her to see a new world.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Xu Yan nodded and smiled.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, Li Xuan was guiding the Red Cat, tapping its body with a bamboo staff to help it better remember the acupoints. He applied a bit of force, leaving a slight pain.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat lay on the ground, daring not to move, its eyes looking pitifully at him.</p><p></p><p>"This is your opportunity. If you can comprehend it, you may become the number one demonic beast in this world," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>As for whether this world had demonic beasts or not, Li Xuan didn't care. As long as the Red Cat could comprehend it, it would undoubtedly be the greatest demonic beast.</p><p></p><p>Just like the martial techniques he had created, which were different from the inner domain martial arts and stronger.</p><p></p><p>His own created Demonic Beast Dao should also be stronger, or at least unique and self-contained.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the Thousand Butterfly Illusion body technique from the Bagua you taught. You have gained the Heavenly Thunder Transcendence's Thousand Thunder Illusion."</p><p></p><p>Golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised that Su Lingxiu had comprehended a body technique. With Xu Yan's help and her own innate talent, it was only natural for her to comprehend a technique of her own.</p><p></p><p>Even without Xu Yan's help, she would have been able to comprehend it, just needing more time.</p><p></p><p>This time, the feedback from the system was to add the Thousand Thunder Illusion as a sub-technique to the Heavenly Thunder Transcendence. When using the Heavenly Thunder Transcendence, one could now conjure illusory thunder images to conceal one's true body, making it difficult for others to discern one's true location.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, the body technique has become even stronger!" Li Xuan was in a good mood.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Thunder Transcendence was an extremely powerful body technique. With the increase in strength, one could instantly traverse vast distances like a thunderbolt.</p><p></p><p>In the following time, Xu Yan and Meng Chong continued to ponder the Bagua, with Su Lingxiu naturally participating as well, even reducing the time she spent on pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were also diligently cultivating. With the assistance of the medicinal pills, their cultivation speed skyrocketed, and Xie Lingfeng had already broken through to the Middle-Realm Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan was originally just a step away from breaking through to the Middle-Realm Sect Master realm, and this time, he also broke through.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi had finished building the pill refining assembly line, and Su Lingxiu went to guide him in cultivation, as well as to select and guide the young men and women who would learn pill refining, bestowing them with medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>As for the actual pill refining, it would have to wait for a while.</p><p></p><p>At least until the pill refining disciples had all reached the Refining Bone realm, as only then would they have the sufficient endurance to complete the pill refining.</p><p></p><p>The practice of pill refining...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The medicinal herbs and divine fire stones were gradually transported over.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts in the remote border region were growing increasingly powerful, and the number of martial arts cultivators was increasing as well, though the true beginners of the martial arts were still too few in number.</p><p></p><p>Most of the martial arts beginners were concentrated in the Xu Family and the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"Kou Ruozhi, you are also about to enter the martial arts, so temporarily hand over the matters at hand to others and focus on making a breakthrough in the martial arts,"Su Lingxiu said to Kou Ruozhi.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Pavilion Master, I will enter the martial arts as soon as possible," Kou Ruozhi replied excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"After you enter the martial arts, there are some matters that I need you to handle. With your abilities, I'm sure you won't make any mistakes," Su Lingxiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Pavilion Master, rest assured, I will definitely complete the tasks without any mistakes!" Kou Ruozhi promised while thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>He naturally realized that the matter was about going to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>After giving the instructions, Su Lingxiu continued to study the Bagua with the two senior martial brothers.</p><p></p><p>She had already reached the peak of her Qi and Blood, and was in the process of accumulating the foundation, waiting for her cultivation to be sufficient before breaking through to the Xiantian realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already explained the wonders of the Xiantian realm to her.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by quickly, and although Xu Yan and Meng Chong had not broken through, their strength was constantly increasing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has mastered the Dao of the Saber to a small extent, and you have mastered the Dao of the Saber completely."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had mastered the Dao of the Saber to a small extent.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has mastered the Dao of the Saber Intent to a small extent, and you have mastered the Dao of the Saber Intent completely."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's Dao of the Saber Intent had also improved.</p><p></p><p>"When will Xu Yan be able to comprehend the second realm of the Sword Dao?" Li Xuan thought expectantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already fully comprehended the Sword Heart and grasped the second level of the Sword Intent, but due to the limitation of his realm, he was unable to display the second level of the Sword Intent for the time being.</p><p></p><p>"If Xu Yan comprehends the Sword Heart Realm, although he cannot break through due to the problem of strength, I can still break through the Sword Heart Realm ahead of him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Heart Realm was an extremely high realm in the Sword Dao.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan had already fully comprehended the Sword Heart, the difficulty in understanding how to break through the Sword Heart Realm and enter it was not small.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Heart Realm may require one to reach the level of Penetrating the Mysteries before being able to involve it, right?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Heart Realm was so profound that to use all things in heaven and earth as the sword was an incredibly powerful ability. Reaching the level of Penetrating the Mysteries also seemed difficult, but it was not necessarily impossible. After all, with Xu Yan's monstrous talent, he could even initially reach the level of Penetrating the Mysteries, and using all things in heaven and earth as the sword might not be impossible for him.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's second realm of the Dao of the Saber is still far away, but he has comprehended a lot of the profound mysteries of the Great Sun Golden Body's acupoints, and his strength has improved."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze became focused, as the profound mysteries in the acupoints of Meng Chong's Great Sun Golden Body had already been nurtured.</p><p></p><p>"The number of martial artists in the remote border region is still too few, but it won't be long before they break through to a hundred. When the martial artists break through to a hundred, will there be any feedback?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>He had already become the martial dao saint revered by the martial artists in the remote border region and was even honored as the Martial Ancestor of the remote border region!</p><p></p><p>Since it was the case, as the number of martial arts beginners increased, there must be some feedback.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, on the hillside.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out a sword, and the "Mountain and River, All-Encompassing Sword" appeared. Immediately afterwards, thunderous and violent lightning surged forth from within the mountains and rivers, forming the "Thunderclap Sword" that was fierce and unparalleled, as if it could destroy the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>The mountains, rivers, and the heavens and earth seemed to tremble.</p><p></p><p>"Thunderous, so let's call this the 'Thunderclap Sword'," Xu Yan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>This was a sword he had comprehended from the Bagua, the second sword of the Dao of the Mountain and River, All-Encompassing!</p><p></p><p>The Thunderclap Sword! On the other side, Meng Chong pondered for a moment, then punched out, and the wind and thunder erupted, with golden light appearing, and the powerful fist force gushed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Thunder is yang, and wind is yin. My Wind and Thunder Golden Ape Fist can also be further enlightened and improved from the Bagua."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong rose into the air and began to display it.</p><p></p><p>The thunderous and violent wind and thunder, a storm raging in the sky, but a golden light figure like a mighty golden ape Buddha, fierce and unparalleled, causing evil spirits to retreat in fear!</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan looked up, their hearts greatly shaken. Meng Chong's strength had increased again, what kind of fist technique was this? It was truly powerful beyond measure.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up, pondering. Meng Chong had gained enlightenment from the Bagua, and the Wind and Thunder Golden Ape Fist had broken through.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the true essence of the Wind and Thunder, and your Wind and Thunder True Essence has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared, and the feedback from the Golden Finger came.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the second sword of the Dao of the Mountain and River, All-Encompassing, the Thunderclap Sword, and your Thunderclap Sword has reached completion."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's feedback also arrived.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly delighted. His decision to create the Bagua was indeed wise.</p><p></p><p>Now, they were starting to reap the rewards. </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had both gained insights from the Bagua, and they felt even more that the profundity of the Bagua was far beyond their reach.</p><p></p><p>They sighed inwardly, realizing that the martial dao their master had imparted was truly boundless.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was also in the process of comprehending, and with the assistance of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, she was gradually gaining insights according to her own talents and preferences.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced over, and Su Lingxiu's comprehension was related to needle techniques.</p><p></p><p>She had already comprehended techniques like the Needle Passing Through the Acupoints from the Medical Martial Classics.</p><p></p><p>However, the more powerful killing techniques were still lacking.</p><p></p><p>"The profundity of the Bagua is truly unfathomable. Each time we delve deeper into its comprehension, we feel that its wondrous applications are endless and profoundly abstruse, as if we can never fully comprehend it, and we've only grasped a tiny bit of the surface."</p><p></p><p>After guiding Su Lingxiu, Xu Yan sighed with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the profundity of the Bagua is truly profound," Meng Chong nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>Even the senior martial brother felt it was abstruse and unfathomable, which showed how powerful and mysterious the Dao of the Bagua was.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu gently closed her eyes, and amidst the surging of her Qi and Blood, numerous golden needles appeared and circled around her.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden needles shot out, constantly transforming, sometimes appearing leisurely and majestic, penetrating everything without a trace, and other times appearing sharp and violent.</p><p></p><p>Poof! A small golden needle pierced into a tree, and although the needle was tiny, the hole it left behind caused the area around it to gradually wither and become like rotten wood.</p><p></p><p>The Qi and Blood carried by the needle had directly withered the tree trunk, extinguishing its vitality.</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The tree snapped and fell down.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and said, "Sister's needle techniques are not to be underestimated. They are tiny yet swift, silent and invisible. Once struck, even if not killed, one would be severely injured."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded and said, "Moreover, Sister's needle techniques can not only kill, but also save!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had finally comprehended a powerful needle technique.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brothers, try receiving my needles!" Su Lingxiu said excitedly, having finally grasped a formidable killing art.</p><p></p><p>A rain of needles descended like a gentle breeze, instantly enveloping Xu Yan. The next moment, they were about to turn him into a hedgehog.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled slightly. He did not use his Xiantian power, but with his Qi and Blood realm's strength, he casually waved his hand, and the force of the Descending Dragon Palm gathered the golden needles into his palm.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

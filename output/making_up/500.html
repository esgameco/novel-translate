        <h1>Chapter 500</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The immortal lords who had retreated far away now felt their scalps tingling and their hearts pounding.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's remnant soul swayed slightly, then silently merged into the bloody light filling the sky and earth. Taking advantage of everyone being distracted by the blood blade, and Jiang Buping being blocked by it, he immediately fled.</p><p></p><p>This was his plan all along - in an instant, he burned the young man's physical body and soul, fusing them into the Blood Prison Blade to unleash a powerful strike. </p><p></p><p>He used this to conceal his own traces and successfully escape.</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was confident. This was one of his life-saving secret techniques. Under these circumstances, no one would be able to discover the location of his remnant soul, allowing him to escape safely.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jiang Buping thrust out his spear, clashing with the blood blade.</p><p></p><p>"Die! Die! Jiang Buping, die!" The young man's hateful and shrill screams kept emanating from the blood blade, gradually growing weaker.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Jiang Buping snorted coldly. His spear light bloomed, shattering the blood blade. The evil energy and the young man's burning soul within it all dissolved in that moment.</p><p></p><p>"Think you can escape?" Jiang Buping looked towards Blood Extreme's fleeing remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, the world changed. Mountains and rivers appeared, with Blood Extreme's remnant soul right in the middle of them.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Blood Extreme's expression changed drastically at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, a wild aura emerged, golden light shining brilliantly, causing his remnant soul to pause.</p><p></p><p>"Come in here!" A clear and pleasant female voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Several bottles and jars suddenly appeared, surrounding him.</p><p></p><p>"You!" Blood Extreme was shocked and furious. Xu Yan and the others had clearly discovered his existence earlier and set all this up waiting for him, in order to capture him alive!</p><p></p><p>"Mere children, thinking you can capture me? Wishful thinking!" </p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was also a decisive person. He knew that once captured, the consequences would be unpredictable. The other remaining part of his remnant soul would likely be found and completely annihilated.</p><p></p><p>Boom! He was about to self-destruct his remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>"Hum!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, light enveloped him, freezing the remnant soul for an instant, interrupting his self-destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Seal!"</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, strands of fine green needles pierced into his remnant soul. The power of the remnant soul solidified, completely sealed away.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?" </p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme was shocked and pale.</p><p></p><p>He was done for!</p><p></p><p>"Come in!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme saw that beautiful young girl in the green dress, her face full of excitement. The way she looked at him seemed a bit off, making him feel uneasy!</p><p></p><p>"Come into my jar!"</p><p></p><p>A transparent jar he had never seen before, made of unknown materials and unknown manufacturing methods. However, Blood Extreme knew that once he entered the jar, he would never be able to escape.</p><p></p><p>He exerted all his strength, trying to activate his remnant soul. However, those fine green needles restrained his spirit, and he couldn't break free for the time being.</p><p></p><p>Then, another beam of light descended, freezing the remnant soul once again.</p><p></p><p>He could only watch helplessly as he was placed into the jar! Su Lingxiu was extremely excited. She applied seal after seal, sealing up the jar, and said happily: "This is a soul-storing jar. Once inside, even self-destruction is impossible. At most, the soul would disperse into a mass, which I can easily restore. The consciousness won't disappear either."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping walked over, staring at Blood Extreme in the jar, and said: "Senior Sister, when we return, interrogate him thoroughly. Find out what grudge he has against me, Jiang Buping, to target me like this!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, Junior Brother. Your Senior Sister guarantees she'll pry open his mouth and get answers," Su Lingxiu promised, clenching her small fist.</p><p></p><p>This storm, or more accurately this farce, thus came to an end. All those who had come from the Qinghua Realm to watch the battle felt it was worth the trip, believing they had gained a lot.</p><p></p><p>Except for Ao Yuxue - Xu Yan was still standing on her head.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts who had come with the Revenge Alliance, as well as Hong Yi and other Wanbao Alliance experts who were tearfully excited as if reborn after a disaster, also felt the trip was worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>They had a sense of broadening their horizons, realizing how mystical the martial way could be, and how powerful experts could be.</p><p></p><p>With the farce over, Xu Yan and the others returned to the Qinghua Realm. Those who needed to go into seclusion did so, those preparing for breakthroughs did so. After all, they knew that before long, powerful experts from the Dao Realm would descend.</p><p></p><p>Divine Lord realm and even Supreme realm experts, and they couldn't rule out the appearance of Realm Lord level experts.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the True Dragon clan would certainly descend as well, but Xu Yan didn't care much about this.</p><p></p><p>He had already reached the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>He was one step closer to the Establishing the Dao realm, transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Once he entered the Establishing the Dao realm, Xu Yan would naturally be able to suppress Realm Lords, like Old Man Xiao.</p><p></p><p>After returning to the Qinghua Realm, Da Yue Emperor and the others dispersed to handle their respective affairs. After all, there were many matters to deal with in the vast Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, the sect leader, was currently in seclusion for a breakthrough. He had put down all sect affairs, handing them over to Da Yue Emperor and the others.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the remnant soul of the Blood Lord. It really does look extraordinary." </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu stared at Blood Extreme in the jar, her face full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Lord, ah. Such a powerful expert, yet he ended up like this."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er couldn't help but sigh.</p><p></p><p>She had only broken through to the Immortal realm not long ago. The Realm Lord level was far, far away for her. She didn't even know how long she would need to cultivate to break through to the Realm Lord level.</p><p></p><p>In fact, whether she could break through to the Realm Lord level at all was still an unknown.</p><p></p><p>Yet such a powerful being was reduced to just a remnant soul. It seems that apart from Senior, no one can truly be invincible.</p><p></p><p>Inside the Qinghua Realm, Yin Jue was cautiously exploring. As he explored the Qinghua Realm, he became increasingly alarmed, his face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. Although this Qinghua Realm is not a small world, it's like a small world. The tremors of the Divine Realm's world cannot affect this place at all."</p><p></p><p>"It seems there's some special power that has separated the Qinghua Realm from the other thirty-five realms."</p><p></p><p>"This place has already broken through the Immortal realm limit, and as spirit storms and Dao rhythms sweep in, the limit will continue to rise, eventually matching the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>"How did they achieve this? What is Xiaoyao planning? Has he already found a way to become the master of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>The more Yin Jue thought about it, the more alarmed he became. Thinking of Xiaoyao's identity, he increasingly suspected that the other party was plotting for the authority of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghua Sect? So he established a sect. The sect headquarters is there."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue explored secretly, learning about the Qinghua Sect and the location of its headquarters from conversations among some martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Qinghua Dao Ancestor? Xiaoyao's ambitions are not small!" </p><p></p><p>Yin Jue laughed coldly in his heart. Although Xiaoyao was very strong, he might not necessarily be able to defeat Lord Tianshe, yet he dared to call himself a Dao Ancestor!</p><p></p><p>"I'll go take a look at the Qinghua Sect headquarters."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue immediately made a decision to go explore the Qinghua Sect headquarters, especially the pills, formations, and other things these martial artists were talking about.</p><p></p><p>"With the assistance of the Mist Beast's true spirit to conceal me, as long as I don't get close to Xiaoyao, even if he's a Realm Lord, he won't be able to</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Discovering my existence."</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue suddenly felt confident. His own stealth and concealment skills were among the best among supreme warriors. At a certain distance, even some weak realm lords couldn't detect his hiding.</p><p></p><p>Now with the help of the Mist Beast's true spirit, Yin Jue was confident that as long as he kept his distance and was careful, he could certainly deceive them. </p><p></p><p>After all, Xiao Yao definitely wasn't on guard and hadn't anticipated someone sneaking in.</p><p></p><p>Although Yin Jue was extremely powerful and could easily capture an immortal celestial lord silently to interrogate for information, he didn't do so.</p><p></p><p>Any small oversight could accidentally expose himself.</p><p></p><p>Let alone immortal realm warriors, even for warriors of lower strength, Yin Jue had no intention of capturing and interrogating them. A qualified infiltrator must eliminate all possibilities that could lead to exposure.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Yin Jue only quietly eavesdropped on warriors' discussions. After obtaining useful information, he began heading towards Qinghua Spirit City.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he remained extremely cautious, concealing his traces without revealing anything.</p><p></p><p>"Shadow Supreme? This stealth and concealment technique is quite good."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wasn't interested at all in the Snow Revenge Alliance's farce. What intrigued him now was Yin Jue, who had infiltrated the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of true spirit is this? It's quite special, able to conceal itself and transform into mist. It would be even harder to detect at night."</p><p></p><p>"This guy, he couldn't be coming for me, could he? Thinking he can launch a sneak attack with just this concealment technique?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan speculated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He had thought the other party would capture an immortal celestial lord or other warriors to interrogate for information, but they didn't do so.</p><p></p><p>This showed they were extremely cautious, not doing anything that could potentially expose themselves or raise suspicion before achieving their goal.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao had already returned to Qinghua City. His expression was still somewhat shocked as he marveled at Xu Yan's powerful martial arts and the profundity of the Heaven and Earth realm. He planned to continue secluding himself to comprehend the qi of the Heavenly Dao and find a way forward as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>He had been stuck at the Realm Lord level for too long. If he couldn't advance further and find a way forward, he wouldn't have the strength to challenge the Indestructible Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others had also returned. They were all intently looking at the Blood Extreme in the jar, discussing the special and powerful aspects of the Blood Lord's soul.</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue had also snuck to the outskirts of Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao suddenly paused, looking at the jar in Su Lingxiu's delicate hand with disbelief and astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this Blood Lord looked somewhat familiar.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Yin Jue also saw the jar in Su Lingxiu's hand. His expression couldn't help but freeze as he was shocked in his heart - the jar contained the remnant soul of the Netherworld Blood Lord? That was a Realm Lord level powerhouse, yet he was captured and trapped in a jar?</p><p></p><p>This scene was too shocking.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's attention had originally been on the Blood Extreme in the jar. At this moment he suddenly paused and looked sharply towards a certain place outside Qinghua Spirit City.</p><p></p><p>At the same moment, the shocked Old Man Xiao Yao also looked over abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue realized he had been exposed.</p><p></p><p>That scene just now was too shocking. The Mist Beast's true spirit fluctuated slightly, and how could this slight fluctuation escape the notice of Realm Lord level powerhouses, especially top existences among Realm Lords?</p><p></p><p>"Get out here!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao's expression turned cold. He even felt somewhat embarrassed that someone had snuck to the outskirts of Qinghua City without him noticing!</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and grabbed forward. The heaven and earth instantly solidified as a giant hand crossed space and directly grasped over.</p><p></p><p>It was as if that area of space itself was being grabbed.</p><p></p><p>The Realm Lord's attack was truly extraordinarily powerful.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly. Old Man Xiao Yao's grab was truly formidable. Even for him who had broken through to the Heaven and Earth realm, it would be extremely difficult to escape from this grab.</p><p></p><p>A mist rose up as an illusory beast-like creature suddenly burst apart, like clouds and mist wanting to scatter with this attack.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, it let out a muffled yet somewhat sinister cry.</p><p></p><p>Within the clouds and mist, a figure appeared. Its aura was gloomy yet extremely powerful. In an instant, it exerted all its strength to unleash its strongest attack.</p><p></p><p>"A Supreme realm warrior?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. The infiltrator was extremely powerful. With his strength having just entered the Heaven and Earth realm, he was no match for the other party.</p><p></p><p>"Someone from the Heaven Fiend Earth Shadow?"</p><p></p><p>The other party's identity was already very clear. Someone so skilled in stealth and concealment techniques who had infiltrated the Qinghua Realm must be a member of the Earth Shadow from the Heaven Fiend Earth Shadow.</p><p></p><p>"Xiao Yao!"</p><p></p><p>Yin Jue said in a low voice.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Spirit pearls burst one after another. The clouds of mist scattered by the Mist Beast were now completely enveloped, unable to escape from the area of space grasped by Old Man Xiao Yao.</p><p></p><p>Puff! A hand directly crushed that area of space, revealing a shattered space that gradually returned to normal under the Heavenly Dao's principles.</p><p></p><p>The Mist Beast's true spirit and Yin Jue had completely perished.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao frowned and said coldly: "Quite decisive, directly self-destructing!"</p><p></p><p>"I apologize. I was careless for a moment and failed to capture them alive."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao looked towards Xu Yan and the others with an apologetic expression.</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. It's someone from the Heaven Fiend Earth Shadow anyway, it doesn't matter whether they're captured alive or dead."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Realm Lord level. It's quite powerful indeed."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu praised admiringly.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao's mouth twitched. What kind of comment was that? Why did it sound like she didn't think much of Realm Lord level warriors? But then he thought about how she was a disciple of the Dao Ancestor and understood.</p><p></p><p>As disciples of the Dao Ancestor, their perspectives were naturally lofty. It seemed reasonable that they wouldn't think much of Realm Lord level warriors?</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao could only comfort himself this way.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, Zi Yun, Yue'er and the others all nodded their heads, saying: "So Realm Lords are this powerful. If I could become a Realm Lord, that would be good enough."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao didn't want to speak anymore. This sounded like becoming a Realm Lord was easy, as if they were barely accepting it.</p><p></p><p>How many powerful experts dreamed of reaching just the Supreme realm their entire lives?</p><p></p><p>"They are all disciples of the Dao Ancestor with lofty perspectives. They can't be viewed by normal standards!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao comforted himself this way.</p><p></p><p>He then changed the subject, looking at the jar in Su Lingxiu's hand and asking in surprise: "Is this the remnant soul of the Netherworld Blood Lord?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly: "It's a Realm Lord level soul! Even though it's just a remnant soul, it's still very worth studying."</p><p></p><p>"It's Blood Extreme! He's actually not dead!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao finally saw clearly that the remnant soul was Blood Extreme!</p><p></p><p>"You know him?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others were quite surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I do indeed know him!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao Yao nodded.</p><p></p><p>As they spoke, the group returned to Qinghua Spirit City and arrived at Su Lingxiu's medicine hall. They placed the jar containing Blood Extreme's remnant soul on the table.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

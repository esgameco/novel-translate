        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Many years had passed, but Bai Yunkong, the dean of the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, hadn't changed much in terms of strength. However, the martial arts he practiced were now different - neither the Inner Realm martial arts nor pure Great Wilderness martial arts. </p><p></p><p>He was attempting to break through the constraints of the Inner Realm and reach the Minor Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he did break through, it couldn't be called the Minor Celestial realm. "Pseudo-divine realm" would be more fitting.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship slowed down.</p><p></p><p>As they approached the flowing light, Bai Yunkong realized this was a massive ship unlike anything he had ever heard of. Its entire body shimmered with radiance, majestic and imposing.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it inspired awe! Such a flying ship could not possibly exist in the Inner Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Could it be from the Spirit Realm?" Bai Yunkong's heart sank. But if the gates to the Spirit Realm had opened, news would have spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, there had been no news of the Spirit Realm gates opening.</p><p></p><p>Even if something had happened to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion preventing them from sending news, the scouts they had arranged would have relayed information immediately.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship ahead slowed down, clearly having noticed his presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Bai Yunkong felt uneasy and hesitated to move forward.</p><p></p><p>"Dean Bai, it's been many years. You seem to have become more timid."</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was startled, and then saw a familiar figure on the flying ship ahead!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan?!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was overjoyed and hurriedly approached the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"You've returned?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile: "I've come back for a visit!"</p><p></p><p>Boarding the ship, Bai Yunkong saw Li Xuan and hastily bowed respectfully. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw other familiar faces - Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao and others were all on the ship.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng from Sword Master Cliff was also there.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong's gaze swept quickly over the people on the ship. There were familiar old friends, as well as strangers.</p><p></p><p>For example, that stunningly beautiful woman attending to the senior, who didn't quite seem like a human woman.</p><p></p><p>Then, looking at the flying ship beneath his feet, he was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Was this something that only existed in the Spirit Realm?</p><p></p><p>"This is a flying ship crafted by my junior brother. The Spirit Realm doesn't have anything like this," Xu Yan explained with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong instinctively looked at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"It's definitely not me. Master took on a junior brother in the Spirit Realm who's not here," Meng Chong rolled his eyes. How could this old man think he was capable of crafting a flying ship?</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong marveled inwardly. A great master was truly a great master.</p><p></p><p>Even in the Spirit Realm, he was still an unparalleled expert.</p><p></p><p>Since flying ships didn't exist in the Spirit Realm, it must have been crafted using methods taught by the senior expert.</p><p></p><p>Old friends reuniting naturally led to catching up.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong recounted the changes in the Great Wilderness over the years. The Great Wilderness was now divided into 36 prefectures, each with a massive prefectural city. Each prefectural city governed 10 municipal cities, which in turn governed various counties and towns.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wilderness was now unified, order had been established, laws were being continuously improved, and martial arts were constantly developing. All new martial artists now practiced Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As Bai Yunkong explained the changes in the Great Wilderness, Xu Yan and the others couldn't help but marvel at how much had changed in just over ten years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, these past ten or so years hadn't been entirely peaceful. There were occasional uprisings, mostly instigated by die-hard practitioners of Inner Realm martial arts and some ill-intentioned individuals. </p><p></p><p>But the scale was never large, and they were quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>99.9% of the strongest Inner Realm experts had joined the Great Wilderness. The remainder couldn't stir up any trouble.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also saw some hidden concerns. After all, there were many Inner Realm martial artists. If they lost hope in practicing Great Wilderness martial arts and their original path was cut off, some would inevitably develop ulterior motives.</p><p></p><p>Especially that group of top Inner Realm experts - they felt despair towards the Spirit Realm and were unwilling to be treated like animals there. The Great Wilderness martial arts gave them hope, which is why they supported it.</p><p></p><p>If they were unable to break through as their lifespans neared their end, they would likely cause all sorts of trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, with his return, all of this would no longer be an issue.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's current martial insights, he could point out a path for these people. Even if it wasn't orthodox Great Wilderness martial arts, as long as they could continue to improve, it would be fine.</p><p></p><p>As for how far they could go, that depended on their talent and aptitude.</p><p></p><p>If their aptitude was too poor, they had no one to blame but themselves.</p><p></p><p>To resolve these potential threats, personal strength was key. So on this return trip, Xu Yan would guide his father and the others to increase their strength enough to suppress the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>How to cultivate trusted subordinates and loyal prodigies afterwards - he didn't need to worry about these things. Both his grandfather and father understood these matters better than he did.</p><p></p><p>After Bai Yunkong finished introducing the current state of the Great Wilderness, he curiously asked, "Xu Yan, how strong are you now?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "Unrivaled in suppressing the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was shocked, then sighed in admiration. As expected of Xu Yan - even in the Spirit Realm, he was still unrivaled.</p><p></p><p>Truly worthy of being the personal disciple of a great master!</p><p></p><p>"Dean Bai, I met the patriarch of your Seven Star Academy in the Spirit Realm," Xu Yan said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how is the patriarch?"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong didn't even bother asking about the patriarch's strength.</p><p></p><p>He must certainly be no match for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had already said he was unrivaled in suppressing the Spirit Realm, so the patriarch must be among those suppressed.</p><p></p><p>He just didn't know if the patriarch had offended Xu Yan and been suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"He's living well. His pursuit is no longer the academy or spreading martial arts, but finding his destined person!" Xu Yan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was also a fortunate person.</p><p></p><p>Because of a woman who entered the martial path, he rose to prominence, fell from his peak, but rose again to stabilize at the limit of the Spirit Realm. Then he received guidance from Xu Yan's master, forming a karmic bond.</p><p></p><p>He must be a person of extraordinary destiny.</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong nodded. The patriarch was too distant now, with nothing worth reminiscing about.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Seven Star Academy had become history. It was now the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy.</p><p></p><p>He was the first dean of the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy!</p><p></p><p>"Dean Bai, the path of martial arts you've taken is somewhat correct, but not entirely right..."</p><p></p><p>Since they had met, Xu Yan decided to offer some guidance.</p><p></p><p>With his guidance, it wouldn't be long before Bai Yunkong broke through to the pseudo-divine realm.</p><p></p><p>Bai Yunkong was overjoyed and listened attentively, not daring to miss even the slightest detail. Xu Yan's guidance was equivalent to pointing out a future path for these Inner Realm experts.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a path forward, there was hope!</p><p></p><p>Although he could let go and wouldn't develop any ulterior motives, certain others might not be so accepting.</p><p></p><p>Of course, so far, no one had developed any other intentions. After all, they hadn't yet felt the despair of a dead end.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's guidance, Bai Yunkong had a sudden realization.</p><p></p><p>So that's how it was!</p><p></p><p>He wasn't practicing Inner Realm martial arts, nor was it pure Great Wilderness martial arts, yet he could still break through, continue to increase his strength and raise his realm.</p><p></p><p>The path forward was right before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On Canlan Island, everything was as usual. No one disturbed them, and no one dared to disturb them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was working hard to cultivate, striving to break through to the divine realm as soon as possible. Xu's mother, as always, was pondering over formations in the spirit fruit grove.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A streak of light descended</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's figure moved, appearing in the sky above Canglan Island. Seeing the flowing light descend, he was stunned.</p><p></p><p>What is this? "Father, Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship landed on an open space on Canglan Island, shrinking continuously as it descended.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother had an excited expression as she held Xu Yan's hand, looking him over from left to right. Seeing her precious son unharmed, she finally breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>After his excitement, Xu Junhe respectfully bowed to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Stepping off the flying ship, Canglan Island remained as before, with the spirit fruit forest even more lush. Glancing at the array diagram Xu's mother was drawing, he was slightly surprised.</p><p></p><p>He hadn't expected Xu Yan's mother to also have some talent in arrays.</p><p></p><p>Reuniting after a long separation, the atmosphere was naturally joyous. A grand feast was laid out on Canglan Island, with delicacies made from spirit fruits and materials.</p><p></p><p>However, for those who had eaten higher-grade spirit items in the Spirit Realm, the spirit food on Canglan Island held little appeal.</p><p></p><p>It was just for the joy of being together.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother happily rubbed Red Cat's chubby head and picked it up.</p><p></p><p>"Oh my, Red Cat, you've gotten so much heavier!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother was delighted as she took out some pills to feed Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Having grown accustomed to high-grade pills, Red Cat found these lower-grade pills not quite to its taste. But since they were given by Xu's mother, it could only swallow them in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er watched Red Cat with a strange expression. The King of Beasts in the Spirit Realm, the immensely powerful Great Beast King, was now acting like an obedient fat cat! Xu Yan's mother's strength wasn't very high, and with Red Cat's power, she shouldn't have been able to lift it. Clearly, Red Cat had suppressed its own power to allow Xu's mother to hold it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wasn't surprised by this. Xu's mother doted on Red Cat even more than Su Lingxiu did. Back on Canglan Island, over 80% of the pills Red Cat received were from Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>She had also taught it to read, so Red Cat had deep feelings for Xu's mother as well.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Red Cat was pondering a question - in establishing the Beast Clan, it seemed to have forgotten about Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>"It's decided, she is the Honored Mother of my Beast Clan. Anyone who dares disrespect her will be killed!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother was the Honored Mother of the Beast Clan. If the Beast Clan faced trouble, wouldn't it be unacceptable for Xu Yan not to help?</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat crouched in front of Xu's mother and took out several spirit fruits. These were all collected from the Spirit Realm, offerings given to it as the Great Beast King by the beasts of Tianling Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>"These spirit fruits!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother could tell at a glance that these fruits were incomparable to those of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat has learned to be filial too!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, as long as his mother was happy, nothing else mattered.</p><p></p><p>He strongly approved of Red Cat's behavior, feeling it wasn't in vain that his mother had doted on it so much back then.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the atmosphere was harmonious as Xu Yan and the others recounted their experiences and affairs in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were especially eager to please Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er also shuffled over to join them.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and half a month had passed since returning to Canglan Island. Guo Rongshan, Kou Ruozhi and others also arrived on Canglan Island, reuniting together and planning the direction for the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The spirit items and refined pills brought back from the Spirit Realm also began to be distributed.</p><p></p><p>Arrays were set up on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Several array discs were given to Guo Rongshan, and he was taught how to set up arrays, allowing him to place arrays in important locations.</p><p></p><p>With array discs in hand, setting up arrays was a very simple matter, so he quickly mastered it.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the array discs from being stolen and controlled by others, these discs were given the ability to recognize their master. Once bound to a master, they could not be stolen or used to control the arrays by others.</p><p></p><p>The array discs specially refined by Fang Hao before returning to the Great Wilderness had now found their use.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit fruit forest, Li Xuan took some time to instruct Xu's mother on array setup. After his guidance, Xu's mother actually mastered arrays and could set up the most basic arrays.</p><p></p><p>Since she had learned to set up arrays, and the treasures needed for array setup were not difficult to refine, it was just a matter of spending more time and consuming more materials to practice.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu's mother only mastered the most basic arrays, but that was enough for her to use in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan gave her a small book on arrays for her to study slowly.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, the spiritual energy became more concentrated due to the arrays set up to gather spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, Li Xuan altered the geographical features of Canglan Island, turning it into a spiritual energy gathering treasure land. From now on, Canglan Island would truly become the holy land of martial arts in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began instructing his parents in cultivation, but after listening for a while, his mother became distracted. Finally, she said directly, "Yan'er, just teach your father. He can tell me later."</p><p></p><p>With that, she ran off to find Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was helpless about this, but since it was his mother's nature, he let her do as she pleased.</p><p></p><p>He guided Xu Junhe through his martial arts confusion, teaching him the methods for the Divine Ability, Divine Form, and Void Breaking realms.</p><p></p><p>For the Divine Form and Void Breaking realms, Xu Junhe only needed to remember the martial methods. At his current level, he couldn't comprehend them, and even memorizing them was somewhat difficult.</p><p></p><p>It took a long time to memorize the martial methods.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan focused on explaining the methods for the Divine Element and Divine Ability realms. Xu Junhe was able to fully memorize the martial methods for these two realms.</p><p></p><p>After the explanation was complete, Xu Junhe began to break through to the Divine Will realm.</p><p></p><p>With higher-grade pills to assist cultivation, breaking through to the Divine Ability realm was just a matter of time. As for higher martial realms, those were not something to consider at this stage.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's idea was simple - when his own strength became great enough, he would guide his parents in cultivation again, or find higher-grade treasures for them, allowing them to continue breaking through naturally.</p><p></p><p>A day later, Xu Junhe broke through to the Divine Will realm, truly reaching the peak of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was also breaking through to the Penetrating Mystery realm.</p><p></p><p>He had started martial arts at a relatively older age and had to handle affairs of the Great Wilderness, so his cultivation had been neglected somewhat.</p><p></p><p>As the person in charge of the Changqing Pavilion in the Great Wilderness, Kou Ruozhi was naturally guided by Su Lingxiu. This included the other apprentices of Changqing Pavilion, who were now improving their pill refining skills and refining more pills under Su Lingxiu's guidance.</p><p></p><p>With nothing else to do, Meng Chongxian also guided others in martial arts.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's return, the core personnel of Canglan Island's faction in the Great Wilderness would all see a substantial increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began arranging various matters to ensure there would be no turmoil in the Great Wilderness after his departure, and even if turmoil did occur, Canglan Island would remain safe and could even suppress everything.</p><p></p><p>He personally went to the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy to guide the loyal prodigies that Xu Junhe and others had nurtured over the years, bestowing pills and spiritual weapons.</p><p></p><p>He also met with the head of Tianbao Pavilion and other powerful figures at the Great Wilderness Martial Arts Academy, including many other strong individuals. He guided each of them in cultivation, pointing out their future paths.</p><p></p><p>These powerful figures were extremely excited and also understood Xu Yan's intentions and deterrence. They naturally became completely obedient, continuing to guard the Great Wilderness while enjoying their respected status there.</p><p></p><p>As for the Spirit Realm, they had completely given up on it. Why become pigs and dogs there? Xu Yan could thrive in the Spirit Realm because he was formidable - that wasn't something they could emulate!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

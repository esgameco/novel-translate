        <h1>Chapter 359</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Elder White Cloud, the dean of the Great Desolate Martial Arts Academy, has not seen much change in his strength over the years. However, the martial arts he cultivates are no longer the inner domain martial arts, nor are they the pure Great Desolate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He is currently trying to break free from the shackles of the inner domain and transcend the realm of the Small Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he were to break through, he could not be called a Small Celestial Being, but rather the realm of the False Divinity would be more appropriate.</p><p></p><p>The speed of the flying ship slowed down.</p><p></p><p>As he approached the flowing light, White Cloud realized that this was a gigantic ship he had never seen before, its entire body shimmering with radiance and majestic might.</p><p></p><p>Just looking at it filled one with awe! "There's no way this kind of flying ship could exist in the inner domain! Could it be from the Spiritual Realm?"</p><p></p><p>White Cloud's heart sank, but if the gates of the Spiritual Realm had opened, news would have spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no news of the Spiritual Realm's gates opening.</p><p></p><p>Even if there had been some changes in the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, the sentries he had arranged would have reported the news immediately.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship in front slowed down, apparently having noticed his presence.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, White Cloud felt anxious and hesitant.</p><p></p><p>"Dean White, it's been a while. You seem to have become more timid."</p><p></p><p>A familiar voice came.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud was startled and saw a familiar figure on the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan?!"</p><p></p><p>White Cloud was overjoyed and quickly approached the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"You've returned?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "Just came back to take a look!"</p><p></p><p>Boarding the flying ship, White Cloud saw Li Xuan and hurriedly paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Then he saw other familiar faces, such as Meng Chong, Su Ling Xiu, Du Yu Ying, Yun Miao Miao, and even Xie Ling Feng from the Sword Saint Cliff.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud's gaze quickly swept over the people on the ship, recognizing some old friends, but also seeing some unfamiliar faces, such as the stunningly beautiful woman attending the elders.</p><p></p><p>Then, looking at the flying ship beneath his feet, he was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>"This is a flying ship, forged by my junior. The Spiritual Realm doesn't have such a thing," Xu Yan introduced with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Junior?" White Cloud instinctively looked at Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not me, the master's junior disciple he took in the Spiritual Realm is not here," Meng Chong rolled his eyes, wondering how the old man could think the flying ship was made by him.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" White Cloud sighed inwardly, these were truly extraordinary people. Even in the Spiritual Realm, they were peerless experts.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm did not have such flying ships, so it was obviously a technique passed down by the elders and cultivated by the junior.</p><p></p><p>Reunited with old friends, they naturally engaged in catching up.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud recounted the changes in the Great Desolate over the past years, how it had been divided into thirty-six prefectures, each with a massive prefecture city, and each prefecture city governing several counties and towns.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate had been unified, order had been established, and the laws were constantly being perfected. The martial arts were also continuously developing, with all new martial artists now cultivating the Great Desolate martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As White Cloud explained the changes in the Great Desolate, Xu Yan and the others couldn't help but sigh. Such tremendous changes had occurred in just over a decade.</p><p></p><p>These past years had not been entirely peaceful, with occasional upheavals caused by the former defenders of the inner domain martial arts, as well as some with malicious intentions. But the scale was not large, and they were quickly suppressed.</p><p></p><p>Nine out of ten of the strongest inner domain martial artists had joined the Great Desolate, and the remaining ones could not stir up any waves.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan also saw some hidden worries in this. After all, there were many inner domain martial artists, and if they could not make breakthroughs in the Great Desolate martial arts, their future path would be blocked. Especially for those top-tier inner domain martial artists who felt hopeless about the Spiritual Realm and were willing to support the Great Desolate martial arts, once they could not break through, as their lifespan neared its end, they might start causing trouble.</p><p></p><p>However, with his return, all of this would no longer be a problem. With Xu Yan's current martial arts understanding, he could point these people towards a path of cultivation, even if it was not the orthodox Great Desolate martial arts, as long as they could continue to improve, that would be fine. As for how far they could go, it would depend on their talent and aptitude.</p><p></p><p>To resolve these potential threats, the key was to enhance one's own strength, so during this return, Xu Yan would guide his father and the others to elevate their cultivation, enough to suppress the Great Desolate.</p><p></p><p>As for how to cultivate loyal disciples and groom talented youths, that was something his elders understood better than him, and he did not need to worry about that.</p><p></p><p>After White Cloud finished introducing the current state of the Great Desolate, he curiously asked, "Xu Yan, what is your current strength?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and said, "I'm unrivaled in suppressing the Spiritual Realm!"</p><p></p><p>White Cloud was shocked, then sighed in admiration, not surprised that Xu Yan, as a disciple of an extraordinary elder, would be so powerful even in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Dean White, I met your old ancestor from the Seven Star Academy in the Spiritual Realm," Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how is the old ancestor doing?" White Cloud asked directly, not bothering to ask about the old ancestor's strength.</p><p></p><p>It was obvious that he would not be a match for Xu Yan, who claimed to be unrivaled in suppressing the Spiritual Realm. The old ancestor must have been among those suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"He's doing well. His pursuit is no longer the academy or spreading martial arts, but finding his destined person!" Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan was indeed a person of great fortune. He had risen to the peak, fallen, then risen again, stabilizing the limits of the Spiritual Realm, and now had been guided by his own master.</p><p></p><p>"I see," White Cloud nodded. The old ancestor was too distant, and there was nothing worth reminiscing about anymore. Now, the Seven Star Academy had become the history, and the Great Desolate Martial Arts Academy was the first generation.</p><p></p><p>"Dean White, your path of martial arts cultivation has been somewhat right, but not entirely..." Since they had met, Xu Yan decided to offer some guidance.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's guidance, White Cloud would soon be able to break through to the realm of the False Divinity.</p><p></p><p>White Cloud was overjoyed, listening attentively, not wanting to miss a single word of Xu Yan's guidance, which was like pointing the way for these inner domain experts.</p><p></p><p>As long as there was a path, there was hope!</p><p></p><p>Although he could let go and not harbor any ill intentions, some others might not be the same.</p><p></p><p>For now, no one had developed any other thoughts, as they had not yet felt a sense of hopelessness about their future path.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's guidance had enlightened White Cloud.</p><p></p><p>So that's how it was! He did not cultivate the inner domain martial arts, nor the pure Great Desolate martial arts, but he could still break through and continue to improve his strength and realm.</p><p></p><p>The path was now in sight...</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, as usual, there was no one to disturb, and no one dared to disturb.</p><p></p><p>Xu Jun He was diligently cultivating, striving to break through to the Divine Meaning Realm as soon as possible, while Xu Mother was, as always, tinkering with formations in the Spiritual Fruit Grove.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a stream of light descended...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Come.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's figure moved, appearing above Canglang Island, seeing the flowing light descend, and was immediately stunned.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" "Father, Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat descended on the open ground of Canglang Island, and as it descended, the flying boat kept shrinking.</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother had an excited look on her face, holding Xu Yan's hand, looking left and right, and her precious son was unharmed, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe, after the excitement, respectfully saluted Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After getting off the flying boat, Canglang Island was still the same as before, and the spirit fruit forest had become even more lush. With a glance, Xu's mother was slightly surprised by the array diagram she had drawn.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, Xu Yan's mother also had some talent in array techniques.</p><p></p><p>After a long separation, the joy was naturally overflowing. A grand feast was laid out on Canglang Island, all made of spirit fruits and spirit materials.</p><p></p><p>However, for the people who had been eating higher-level spiritual things in the Spirit Realm, the spiritual material food on Canglang Island was not very attractive.</p><p></p><p>It was just for the joy of gathering together.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother happily rubbed Red Cat's fat head and picked it up.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Red Cat, you've gained a lot of weight!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother was delighted, taking out a medicinal pill and feeding it to Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Accustomed to high-end medicinal pills, these relatively low-grade medicinal pills were not quite to Red Cat's taste, but since it was given by Xu's mother, it could only swallow it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>Moon had a strange look on her face as she watched Red Cat, the powerful Demon King of the Spirit Realm, now like a well-behaved fat cat! Xu Yan's mother's strength was not strong, and Red Cat's strength, she probably couldn't even hold it, but it could be seen that Red Cat had restrained itself and allowed Xu's mother to hold it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not surprised by this, as Xu's mother was very fond of Red Cat, even more so than Suling Xiu. Back then on Canglang Island, most of the medicinal pills Red Cat obtained were given by Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>It was Xu's mother who taught it to read as well, and she had a deep affection for Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Red Cat was thinking about a problem, that it had seemingly forgotten Xu's mother after establishing the Demon Clan.</p><p></p><p>"Confirmed, this is my Demon Clan's revered mother, whoever dares to be disrespectful, I'll kill them!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat made a decision.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mother is the revered mother of the Demon Clan, if the Demon Clan is in trouble, if Xu Yan doesn't lend a hand, it won't be good.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat squatted in front of Xu's mother and took out one spirit fruit after another, all of which it had collected in the Spirit Realm, and were offerings from the Demon Clan of Tianliang State to this Demon King.</p><p></p><p>"These spirit fruits!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother knew at a glance that these spirit fruits were not comparable to the ones in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat has learned to be filial as well!"</p><p></p><p>Xu's mother was delighted.</p><p></p><p>For Xu Yan, as long as his mother is happy, nothing else matters.</p><p></p><p>He highly approved of Red Cat's performance, not in vain that his mother was so fond of it back then.</p><p></p><p>On Canglang Island, it was a harmonious atmosphere, and Xu Yan and the others recounted their experiences and affairs in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were particularly attentive to Xu's mother.</p><p></p><p>Moon also shuffled over.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and it had already been half a month since they returned to Canglang Island. Guo Rongshan, Kou Ruozhi and others had also come to Canglang Island, gathering together, and at the same time planning the direction of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual things brought back from the Spirit Realm, as well as the medicinal pills refined, also began to be distributed.</p><p></p><p>Array formations were set up on Canglang Island.</p><p></p><p>Several array discs were also handed over to Guo Rongshan, teaching him how to deploy the arrays, so that he could deploy the arrays in important places.</p><p></p><p>With the array discs in hand, deploying the arrays was a very simple matter, and he quickly mastered it.</p><p></p><p>To prevent the array discs from being stolen and controlled by others, these array discs were added with the ability to recognize the owner. Once recognized, they would not be stolen or controlled by others.</p><p></p><p>The array discs specially forged by Fang Hao were now put to use before returning to the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>In the spirit fruit forest, Li Xuan took the time to guide Xu's mother on the deployment of the arrays, and after his guidance, Xu's mother really grasped the arrays and could deploy the most basic arrays.</p><p></p><p>Since she had learned to deploy arrays, and the treasures needed to deploy arrays were not difficult to refine, it was just a matter of spending more time and consuming more materials to practice.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the arrays Xu's mother mastered were only the most basic ones, but they were enough for her to use in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan even gave her a small array manual, so that Xu's mother could slowly learn.</p><p></p><p>On Canglang Island, the spiritual energy became more and more abundant, this was because the arrays were deployed, gathering spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan even changed the heaven and earth momentum of Canglang Island with a thought, making Canglang Island a true spiritual treasure land, and from now on, Canglang Island truly became the martial dao holy land of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to guide his parents in cultivation, but his mother, after listening for a while, became distracted, and finally directly said, "Yan'er, teach your father, and in the future, let your father tell mother."</p><p></p><p>With that, she ran to find Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was helpless about this, but since his mother was like this, it was best to let her be happy.</p><p></p><p>He explained the martial dao confusion of Xu Junhe, and taught him the martial dao methods of the Spirit Sense Realm, Spirit Appearance Realm, and Breaking Void Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Appearance Realm and Breaking Void Realm, he only needed to remember the martial dao methods, as Xu Junhe's current realm, he would not be able to comprehend them, even if he tried to memorize them by heart, it would be quite difficult.</p><p></p><p>It took a long time for him to record the martial dao methods.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan focused on explaining the Spirit Element Realm and Spirit Sense Realm martial dao methods, these two realms' martial dao methods, Xu Junhe could completely memorize.</p><p></p><p>After the explanation, Xu Junhe began to break through the Spirit Will Realm.</p><p></p><p>With higher-grade medicinal pills to assist the cultivation, breaking through the Spirit Sense Realm was just a matter of time, as for higher martial dao realms, that was not something to be considered at the moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's idea was simple, when his own strength was strong enough, he would guide his parents in cultivation again, or find them higher-grade treasures, then they could continue to break through.</p><p></p><p>One day later, Xu Junhe broke through the Spirit Will Realm, truly at the peak of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was also breaking through the Penetrating Mystery Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, he entered the martial dao at an older age, and also had to handle the affairs of the Great Wilderness, so his cultivation had been neglected for some time.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was the head of the Evergreen Hall of the Great Wilderness, naturally being guided by Suling Xiu, including the other disciples of the Evergreen Hall, who were currently improving their pill refining skills under Suling Xiu's guidance, refining more medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had nothing to do, so he also guided the others in martial dao.</p><p></p><p>With Xu Yan's return, the core members of the Great Wilderness related to Canglang Island would all see a significant increase in strength.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan began to arrange various matters, so that after his departure, the Great Wilderness would not fall into chaos, and even if there was chaos, Canglang Island could ensure safety, and even suppress everything.</p><p></p><p>He personally went to the Great Wilderness Martial Dao Academy, guiding the core talents cultivated by Xu Junhe and others over the years, bestowing medicinal pills and spiritual artifacts.</p><p></p><p>He also met the Heavenly Treasure Hall Master and other powerful figures at the Great Wilderness Martial Dao Academy, one by one guiding them in cultivation, and pointing out their future paths.</p><p></p><p>These powerful figures were greatly excited, and also understood Xu Yan's intentions and deterrence, naturally obedient, continuing to guard the Great Wilderness, enjoying the revered status in the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>As for the Spirit Realm, they had completely given up hope, why bother being a dog or pig? Xu Yan could make it in the Spirit Realm, that was because Xu Yan was amazing, they couldn't be envious of it!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

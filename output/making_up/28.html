        <h1>Chapter 28</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 28: How Should the Next Cultivation Be Designed?</p><p></p><p>Before Xu Yan had successfully cultivated, Li Xuan, with the intention of deceiving him, just made up the cultivation methods randomly without any psychological pressure, making them as mysterious as possible.</p><p></p><p>He didn't need to consider whether they could actually be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>Since it was all made up, how could the cultivation succeed?</p><p></p><p>However, this demonic prodigy Xu Yan actually cultivated the fabricated techniques successfully, and even triggered the golden finger, allowing Li Xuan's cultivation method to reach perfection, with his strength a hundredfold of those at the same realm.</p><p></p><p>For the next cultivation technique, Li Xuan could no longer indulge in his imagination freely.</p><p></p><p>After all, it was related to whether the cultivation could succeed, as well as whether he could continue to obtain the feedback from the golden finger to enhance himself.</p><p></p><p>With psychological pressure, his thoughts became more complicated.</p><p></p><p>When designing the techniques, he had to consider whether the theory was reliable, whether there were any loopholes, whether the mysteriousness was not enough, worrying that the strength would not be strong enough, or whether it was too mysterious, fearing that Xu Yan might not be able to comprehend and continue cultivating.</p><p></p><p>In short, when starting to design the next realm, Li Xuan realized that his previous thoughts were too simple.</p><p></p><p>With the pressure in his heart, he became cautious and anxious.</p><p></p><p>"Fuck! I might as well just make it up randomly and let my disciple ponder over it, comprehend it."</p><p></p><p>"But no, what if he can't comprehend it? Wouldn't that be a loss for me?"</p><p></p><p>"This damn golden finger, what's the deal with it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a troubled expression.</p><p></p><p>The golden finger was triggered, but after infusing cultivation into him, it disappeared as if it never existed.</p><p></p><p>"Since Xu Yan successfully cultivated the techniques I made up, that's why the golden finger was triggered. So to obtain its feedback, I still have to rely on Xu Yan, this demonic kid is too talented in comprehension."</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, when designing the cultivation techniques, I need to ensure a smooth transition between realms. As for the specific cultivation methods, I'll leave it to Xu Yan to comprehend on his own."</p><p></p><p>"I only need to design a theoretical framework and some mysterious-sounding cultivation formulas."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, clarifying the direction of designing the cultivation techniques. Next, he had to construct this illusory theory and come up with some mysterious-sounding cultivation formulas.</p><p></p><p>After that, everything else would be left for Xu Yan to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>Since Xu Yan could comprehend the methods of refining skin, bones, and organs by himself, how could the subsequent cultivation be any problem for him?</p><p></p><p>"For the bone refining formula, I made up - 'Enlighten the heart, nurture the true essence, the blood and qi forge the golden body.' Then for the blood and qi realm, I'll also make up two cultivation formulas, letting Xu Yan ponder over them, which can accelerate his cultivation speed."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan recalled that from those two made-up formulas, Xu Yan had found the method to temper his golden bones, and even refined his jade bones.</p><p></p><p>So the cultivation formulas are crucial. They should be mysterious but not too vague.</p><p></p><p>Leave it to Xu Yan to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"The next realm after the blood and qi realm will be defined as the Innate Realm. I don't need to hurry and design it yet, first I'll come up with the formulas for the blood and qi realm."</p><p></p><p>Although there are no formulas, the cultivation direction has been determined, and he can still cultivate to the peak of the blood and qi realm.</p><p></p><p>However, if he designs the formulas, and Xu Yan comprehends something from them, his cultivation speed and strength will greatly increase.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan's strength rises, Li Xuan's strength as his teacher will also rise accordingly.</p><p></p><p>Currently, Li Xuan's strength is a hundredfold of those at the same realm, with Xu Yan's blood and qi realm cultivation as the reference standard.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan's strength after comprehending the formulas far exceeds his current cultivation, then Li Xuan's strength will naturally be even greater.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the formulas must be designed.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation methods for refining skin, bones, organs, and the martial arts foundation, as well as the feedback from the golden finger, Li Xuan has already mastered.</p><p></p><p>This has already formed a complete martial arts foundation cultivation system.</p><p></p><p>It is the result of Xu Yan's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Forged from profound insights, with this true and cultivatable technique as the foundation, Li Xuan had already given Xu Yan a general direction to independently ponder over and comprehend the secrets of the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>The fundamental reason for compiling the cultivation technique of the Blood Qi Realm was to allow Xu Yan to gain insights into an even more powerful and efficient method of cultivating the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>To enhance the strength of the Blood Qi Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Qi Realm is about strengthening one's blood and flesh, so the essence of cultivation is to improve the quality and quantity of one's blood qi, and to raise the limit of one's physical constitution...</p><p></p><p>"Since it's about cultivating the blood qi, then a cultivation technique based on this should work, right?"</p><p></p><p>After much contemplation, Li Xuan compiled a four-line cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Just four lines, that's it. I'll hand it over to my foolish disciple to ponder and comprehend. Even if he can't grasp the true meaning, it won't hinder his continued cultivation...</p><p></p><p>"Reaching the pinnacle of the Blood Qi Realm is only a matter of time. The important thing is for my foolish disciple to continue his monstrous cultivation and cultivate the Innate Realm that I haphazardly created."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a sigh, clasped his hands behind his back, and with the air of a stern teacher, strode out of the room with a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was currently consolidating his realm.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, come here. Your master will impart to you the cultivation technique of the Blood Qi Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan beckoned.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly ran over upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation technique of the Blood Qi Realm!</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully. The cultivation technique of the Blood Qi Realm has four lines. If you can comprehend the true meaning within, your cultivation will progress by leaps and bounds, and it won't be long before you reach the pinnacle of the Blood Qi Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's tone became more solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. I will definitely comprehend the technique, and I will not let you down!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan assured with a thump on his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Your confidence pleases me. Just do your best. Even if you can't grasp the true meaning of the technique, it won't hinder your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's tone softened.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't put too much pressure on his disciple. If the psychological burden became too heavy, it might backfire and prevent Xu Yan from comprehending the technique.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and slowly recited: "A thousand streams and ten thousand rivers converge into the great river, flowing for thousands of miles into the vast ocean; Towering waves rise up in layers, the blood qi can shake the mightiest of mountains!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing the last line, Xu Yan couldn't help but murmur, "The blood qi can shake the mightiest of mountains?"</p><p></p><p>He felt the grandeur and power contained in this line.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan cleared his throat and said, "Disciple, you must remember that the technique I've imparted to you emphasizes comprehension and meaning, not form or superficial appearance!"</p><p></p><p>He brought up this old adage again to remind Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. I understand!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully responded. </p><p></p><p>At this moment, his mind was filled with the four lines of the cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go and consolidate your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>He let out a sigh of relief, having finally passed on the technique to Xu Yan. Whether he could succeed or not was up to him now. If he couldn't comprehend it, it wouldn't be the fault of this master.</p><p></p><p>Next, Li Xuan would need to put some thought into the Innate Realm. He needed to make it more mysterious and ensure it could theoretically connect with the Blood Qi Realm, so that there wouldn't be a dead end or a lack of direction.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully bowed and returned to his cultivation spot.</p><p></p><p>He began to ponder the four-line technique, marveling, "No wonder this is the technique my master has imparted. It sounds like poetry, profoundly mysterious, containing the wondrous principles of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"I must comprehend it! I cannot let my master down!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

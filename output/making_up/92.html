            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 92 The Incomprehensible Ancient Leather Book, Xie Lingfeng Arrives</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan flipped through the ancient leather book, page by page. There were a total of eighteen pages, each with a different pattern drawn on it.</p><p></p><p>But every time he looked at a page, the first time it seemed to be some kind of terrain or other pattern, the second time it felt like random scribbles. </p><p></p><p>The third time, it seemed to have transformed into another pattern.</p><p></p><p>The more he looked, the more confused and incomprehensible it became. He was even unsure what exactly was being depicted in the drawings.</p><p></p><p>"This book is somewhat special, but I can't make sense of it," Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>He closed the ancient leather book and looked at the two characters "Tai Cang", puzzled: "Tai Cang, what does that mean?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but open the book again, and this time he felt the patterns on the pages were slightly different, even though the lines had not changed.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be some kind of martial arts technique? But it's too profound, beyond my current realm to understand the hidden meanings?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"If it is indeed a martial arts technique, would it be even more powerful than the ones I've created?"</p><p></p><p>He flipped through the book again.</p><p></p><p>"But it doesn't seem like a martial arts technique, it feels more like a map?"</p><p></p><p>He closed the book and put it away, playing with the jade ruyi in his hand, carefully pondering the content of the ancient book.</p><p></p><p>To his surprise, every time he recalled the patterns on the book, they seemed to be different, as if constantly changing.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, what is this exactly?" Li Xuan frowned and couldn't help but take out the book again.</p><p></p><p>As always, the first time he looked at a page was different from the second time, but he couldn't quite put his finger on why.</p><p></p><p>"This ancient leather book is rather peculiar. It's not quite a technique, not quite a map, not quite a talisman - it's just strange. Perhaps when my cultivation reaches a higher level, I'll be able to make sense of it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into contemplation. Since even he couldn't understand it, his disciple Meng Chong definitely couldn't either, as he only saw some lines without any meaning.</p><p></p><p>"What about my senior disciple Xu Yan? Maybe he can discern something from it?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made up his mind. Xu Yan was so talented, perhaps he could uncover something from this mysterious book.</p><p></p><p>The day after Meng Chong returned, Xu Yan also came back from the Eastern River Commandery. Under the guidance of his sword intent, Xu Junhe had begun refining his dantian.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the Xu family was all on the rise, and the progress was not slow.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in a chair, several books piled on the table beside him. He was currently reading a book on medicinal alchemy.</p><p></p><p>"The Borderlands lack the concept of elixirs, only having some simple medicinal concoctions, and no theory of monarch, minister, assistant and guide..."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan read, the more he felt that the new martial arts system he had envisioned was feasible.</p><p></p><p>The ancient leather book lay on the table.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came to pay his respects: "Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, and Xu Yan's gaze was drawn to the ancient book.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what book is this?"</p><p></p><p>As a lover of novels, Xu Yan had read too many of them, and perhaps no one was more familiar with books than him. This ancient leather book looked like a rare treasure.</p><p></p><p>He immediately became interested.</p><p></p><p>"Take a look."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said casually.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan excitedly picked up the ancient book.</p><p></p><p>"Tai Cang?" </p><p></p><p>Seeing the two big characters on the cover, he curiously asked, "Master, what does 'Tai Cang' mean?"</p><p></p><p>"When your cultivation reaches the appropriate level, you'll naturally know."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan evaded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan opened the book and looked at the criss-crossed lines, which seemed to have a certain pattern, outlining an unknown shape.</p><p></p><p>It was somewhat like a map, or perhaps a terrain?</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't make sense of it. He flipped through the second page, the third page...</p><p></p><p>After going through the entire ancient leather book, Xu Yan was still puzzled, and asked, "Master, what are these lines? Is it some kind of treasure map?"</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Xu Yan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw Xu Yan's reaction and knew that he also couldn't discern anything from the book, not even realizing the special nature of the patterns on the pages.</p><p></p><p>He only saw simple lines.</p><p></p><p>"If even my disciple can't understand it, is it because my realm is too low? Forget it, I'll just keep it for now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He waved his hand to retrieve the ancient book, saying, "When your cultivation and realm reach a higher level, perhaps you'll understand."</p><p></p><p>"Don't think too much about it. Focus on your cultivation first. In a few days, I'll pass on a cultivation technique beyond the Foundation Establishment realm to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan knew his disciple had a vivid imagination, so he added this to prevent him from speculating too much and neglecting his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't think too much about it. After paying his respects, he went out to the city outskirts to cultivate and exchange insights on the Bagua with Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the capital of Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had been pondering the theory Xu Yan had mentioned, wanting to achieve sword heart clarity. First, he needed to have a tranquil mind, unperturbed by external matters.</p><p></p><p>"Seemingly having no woman in one's heart, is this actually a state of mind where one is not disturbed by external things? What kind of realm is this?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was quite perplexed.</p><p></p><p>He vaguely felt that he understood it to some extent, yet also didn't fully grasp it.</p><p></p><p>"My comprehension is too poor. Xu Gege has explained it so clearly, yet I still haven't been able to understand it."</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an idea occurred to him.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Gege said he used the Qi Emperor's harem to temper his mind and improve himself... Perhaps I can do the same? By refining my mind and achieving clarity, I may have a chance to attain sword heart clarity.</p><p></p><p>"Only by attaining sword heart clarity can I truly step into the true path of the sword!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng couldn't sit still anymore. He went to find the Qi Emperor, hoping to borrow the beauties of the imperial harem to refine his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, do you have any commands for me?" </p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor was overjoyed when he learned that Xie Lingfeng wanted to see him.</p><p></p><p>This is an opportunity! Perhaps he can obtain some martial arts techniques?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at the Qi Emperor, finding it somewhat difficult to broach the subject, as borrowing the imperial harem to refine his mind was indeed a rather delicate matter. He was bashful and didn't know how to start.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xie Lingfeng's hesitation, the Qi Emperor was even more delighted. He must have a request, and a good one at that. So he smiled and said, "Your Highness, just say whatever you need, and I will do my utmost to fulfill it!"</p><p></p><p>"Since that is the case, then I will just be direct."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thought that since Xu Yan had also borrowed the imperial harem, the Qi Emperor should not find it too much of an issue.</p><p></p><p>So he said, "The thing is, I recently wish to refine my mind. I've heard that Xu Gege used the beauties of the imperial harem to temper his mind, with excellent results. So I've come with the same intention."</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor cursed inwardly: "What kind of so-called 'Your Highness' is this? Good things he doesn't learn, but he learns from that little bastard Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"That's my imperial harem, all my concubines, and he wants to borrow them to refine his mind?</p><p></p><p>"What does he take me for?</p><p></p><p>"This is too much, I can't stand it anymore!"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The smile on his face did not change as he waved his big hand and said in a heroic manner, "I thought it was something serious, but it turns out to be just a cultivation of the mind, a trivial matter, a trivial matter."</p><p></p><p>"Summon my attendants, let my imperial consorts dance to help the eminent person cultivate his mind."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi directly issued the decree.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was deeply moved. Emperor Qi had a broad mind and was a benevolent ruler. No wonder Xu Yan did not rebel.</p><p></p><p>Such a generous and righteous ruler was rare in the world.</p><p></p><p>He clasped his fists gratefully and said, "Your Majesty's benevolence, I am deeply grateful!"</p><p></p><p>"Not at all, being able to help the eminent person is an honor for me!" </p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi said casually, but in his heart, he had already cursed Xie Lingfeng to death.</p><p></p><p>In the palace, it was very lively. </p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi's imperial consorts danced enthusiastically, hoping that the eminent person would appreciate them and they could become the phoenix perched on the branch.</p><p></p><p>Rather than waiting in the palace for Emperor Qi's favor, it would be better to seize the opportunity to become the eminent person's personal attendant, which would be a hundred times better than being an imperial consort.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sat on the wall, watching the imperial consorts, sighing, "They are indeed the beauties of the imperial palace. Their graceful postures and elegant demeanors are all different."</p><p></p><p>"But how should I cultivate my mind? That's right, with no woman in my heart, even though the beautiful appearance is in front of me, it cannot make my heart move."</p><p></p><p>After watching for a while, Xie Lingfeng could no longer bear it, for he was still young and vigorous. He ran away.</p><p></p><p>"Slowly, it must be done slowly!"</p><p></p><p>In the study, Emperor Qi's face was dark. He felt that his hair seemed to have turned a little green.</p><p></p><p>"How is it?"</p><p></p><p>He asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The chief eunuch replied, "The eminent person watched for a while, then left. But after about half an hour, he came back and continued to watch, then left again..."</p><p></p><p>"Did he do nothing?"</p><p></p><p>"No, it's similar to the case of Xu Yan, just that he didn't watch as long as Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Emperor Qi felt slightly relieved, but he didn't know why he also felt a sense of regret, unable to send the imperial consorts out.</p><p></p><p>If the imperial consorts were sent out and the eminent person accepted them, he couldn't just let them eat for free, right?</p><p></p><p>Fuck!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi cursed inwardly, "I am the Emperor, how can I be so humble!"</p><p></p><p>It was truly frustrating!</p><p></p><p>The affairs of the palace could not be hidden forever. When the ministers knew about it, they looked at Emperor Qi in a strange way.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi was so angry. </p><p></p><p>This eminent person was all brought by that rebellious son!</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Emperor Qi became furious and issued a decree, "Go, bring my rebellious son here, I will personally give him thirty big strokes!"</p><p></p><p>The chief eunuch said cautiously, "Your Majesty, the Crown Prince left the capital yesterday."</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi fell silent.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince, who was originally just lazing around and living off others, heard the news of the eminent person going to the palace, and he was so frightened that his face turned pale. This eminent person was brought by him.</p><p></p><p>Estimating that he would be beaten again, he hurriedly left the capital, as he could no longer stay in the capital.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng felt that his mind had been elevated, and he was no longer so captivated by beauty. That day, Guo Rongshan brought him news.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's master, the mysterious eminent person, was willing to see him.</p><p></p><p>He was overjoyed and immediately set out with Hu Shan to the East River Prefecture to see the eminent person.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, these days you've been to the palace of Emperor Qi, have you slept with some of his imperial consorts?"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's face darkened as he said, "Don't talk nonsense, am I the kind of person? I'm here to cultivate my mind."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan looked doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master, how do you cultivate your mind?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's spirit was lifted as he said, "I've already made some progress these days, and I'm not far from the realm of having no woman in my heart."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan: ???</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, you don't understand. This realm can only be realized through enlightenment, it cannot be expressed in words. Once I attain it, the door to the Sword Dao will be right in front of me."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng yearned for it.</p><p></p><p>The two of them traveled non-stop from the capital to Yunshan County in the East River Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Outside Yunshan County, Xu Yan and Meng Chong were waiting.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"No need to be so polite."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Meng Chong's shoulder and said, "Let me introduce, this is my junior brother Meng Chong."</p><p></p><p>"So it's Brother Meng, pleased to meet you!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan clasped their fists in greeting.</p><p></p><p>"We should have a sparring match sometime."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Certainly!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was secretly amazed. Meng Chong gave him a feeling like a fierce beast in human form, extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Even without fighting, he could sense that Meng Chong's physical body was stronger than steel, and even a First-Grade Inner Realm cultivator would have difficulty breaking through his physical defense.</p><p></p><p>"This is true martial arts! He can withstand a First-Grade Inner Realm cultivator with just his physical body alone!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was greatly astonished.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard, Li Xuan sat in a chair, playing with a jade ruyi scepter.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>The inner realm cultivation techniques would soon be in his hands.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were both Sect Master-level cultivators from the Sword Sovereign Cliff, a major power. Their cultivation techniques were definitely extraordinary in the inner realm, at the pinnacle level.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he could have a glimpse of the inner realm martial arts, providing some reference for his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Classic was ultimately a demonic cultivation technique, and it was incomplete. Although there were some useful aspects, it was still limited.</p><p></p><p>They're here!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made himself look more relaxed and carefree, as a mysterious aura emanated from him, and the jade ruyi scepter in his hand seemed to have become more mysterious as well.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, please come in."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pushed open the door.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan's hearts were now tense, finally about to meet this mysterious eminent person.</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, they stepped into the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they entered, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan's spirits were shaken, and expressions of shock appeared on their faces.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, a young man was lying on a chair, leisurely playing with a jade ruyi scepter. A layer of sacred light seemed to be enveloping the young man, making him appear mysterious and unfathomable, lofty and unattainable, as if he transcended the heavens and earth, sitting outside the flow of time.</p><p></p><p>In that instant, Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan were profoundly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The eminent person!</p><p></p><p>The peerless eminent person!</p><p></p><p>With a thud, they immediately knelt down.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng (Hu Shan) pays respects to the venerable elder!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Boom! Boom!</p><p></p><p>They kowtowed three times forcefully, leaving two small holes in the ground.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were completely dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>They had never seen such a grand gesture of respect, even when they were being accepted as disciples.</p><p></p><p>The ground was literally dented from the kowtows!</p><p></p><p>Glancing at their master, he was as inscrutable as ever.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was inwardly delighted. This mysterious aura was truly impressive, having such an effect.</p><p></p><p>"You may rise."</p><p></p><p>The voice was calm, as if devoid of any emotional fluctuations.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, venerable elder!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan stood up respectfully, not daring to even take a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>But in their hearts, they were extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>What a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>If they could receive guidance from such an eminent person, they would surely benefit tremendously!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 139</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan directly crossed over the first level of the martial arts stage, completely ignoring the students of the Seven Star Academy on the stage. All the martial artists present were stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Is this person so arrogant? He probably thinks his strength surpasses the Third Realm, so he wants to challenge by skipping the levels. It's just like me back then. In the end, he can't even get through the first level."</p><p></p><p>A martial artist sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Young and impetuous, it's understandable. Which prodigy is not arrogant and proud?"</p><p></p><p>"Another one will be struck down and demoralized."</p><p></p><p>"Haha, it's been a long time since we've seen a prodigy become so dejected and lost."</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists gloated over his misfortune.</p><p></p><p>"Stop right there!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy students on the stage were a bit confused. Why did another person who disregards the rules come?</p><p></p><p>The students recruited by the Seven Star Academy, which one is not a prodigy with exceptional talents? And those who accept the challenge on the stage are the top elites within the same realm in the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Xu Yan glanced at them.</p><p></p><p>The student on the stage was almost furious. Who is this random person who doesn't even know the rules of the Seven Star Academy, just rushing in to challenge? He even ignored him!</p><p></p><p>"Sir, have you come here to enter the Academy's library and browse the martial arts classics?" Qiao Zongye said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Correct!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, you can only proceed upwards if you defeat me." Qiao Zongye said.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak, I'll just go challenge the upper levels." Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Zongye's face flushed with anger as he angrily said, "I'm too weak? Are you a Grandmaster? Even if you are a Grandmaster, you have to challenge level by level."</p><p></p><p>"I'm not a Grandmaster." Xu Yan shook his head. "I'm a Primal Realm cultivator."</p><p></p><p>Qiao Zongye was dumbfounded, and all the martial artists present were dumbfounded. Primal Realm cultivator? What realm is that? Why have they never heard of it before?</p><p></p><p>"What Primal Realm, I've never heard of it. Sir, don't try to deceive us with some made-up title. If you want to go up, you have to defeat me." Qiao Zongye said angrily.</p><p></p><p>He suspected that the other party was not simply here to challenge the trials and get the opportunity to browse the classics, but to provoke the Seven Star Academy!</p><p></p><p>"Since that's the case, then you'd better be prepared." Xu Yan pondered for a moment, defeating the opponent would not be difficult, it's just a casual matter.</p><p></p><p>"Come!" Qiao Zongye held his long saber horizontally, speaking coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Watch closely." Xu Yan didn't even bother to step onto the stage, he just flicked his finger, and a true qi shot out.</p><p></p><p>After striking, he continued to ascend the stairs.</p><p></p><p>Qiao Zongye was furious and was about to speak, but his expression suddenly changed drastically. He hurriedly crossed his saber in front of his chest, but with a loud bang, the saber was shaken and flew out of his hand, and he was sent flying backwards, crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>The scene was silent! A single finger strike defeated Qiao Zongye, a Grandmaster?! </p><p></p><p>No wonder he was so arrogant, at such a young age he has already reached the Grandmaster realm, he indeed has the arrogance to do so.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this prodigy come from? He's actually a Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>"Too arrogant, too fierce, I take back what I said earlier!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to ascend the stairs, the fallen Qiao Zongye's face flushed red as he angrily shouted, "Even if you are a Grandmaster, it doesn't matter. You must step onto the stage and defeat me for it to count!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that Xu Yan completely ignored him, he was furious and roared, "You are disrespecting my Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't bother to respond, the angry cries of the weak are useless, the rules have always been set for the weak.</p><p></p><p>"Stop!" </p><p></p><p>The students on the second level stage were also dumbfounded. This guy is really arrogant, he doesn't even bother to look at them.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan flicked his finger, and a true qi shot out, the second level student hurriedly blocked it, but was instantly sent flying out.</p><p></p><p>"You're defeated." Xu Yan glanced at him and continued upwards.</p><p></p><p>On the third level, Xu Yan didn't even bother to wait for the opponent to speak, he just flicked his finger and defeated them.</p><p></p><p>Then the fourth level, he defeated them the same way with a finger flick, without even stepping onto the stage.</p><p></p><p>"The fifth level is a Grandmaster, let's see how he defeats a Grandmaster this time."</p><p></p><p>"There will be a good show, it's been years since anyone has passed the fifth level, I wonder if he has a chance."</p><p></p><p>"No way, even if he's a Grandmaster, he's too young. The Grandmasters of the Seven Star Academy are all top-tier Grandmasters."</p><p></p><p>The martial artists following along to watch the commotion discussed.</p><p></p><p>Almost all of them did not have high hopes for Xu Yan being able to pass the fifth level.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan ascended the stairs, a figure descended from the sky and landed on the fifth level stairs, it was a man in his thirties, dressed in scholar's attire, looking refined and cultured.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, you didn't even step onto the stage, do you feel that the students of our Seven Star Academy are not worthy of your attention?" Cheng Yuanhong smiled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said, "That's right, their strength is too weak, I don't even have the interest to step onto the stage."</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists and Seven Star Academy students were dumbfounded, this was too direct, it was completely looking down on the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knows that the defending students of the Seven Star Academy are all top elites within their realms.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong also put away his smile and became serious, "According to the rules, even if a Grandmaster comes, they must step onto the stage and compete with the same realm strength to defeat the defending student."</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, you are full of youthful vigor, I can understand. Since you have come here, as long as you defeat me, the matter of not following the rules will be forgiven!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped in his tracks and looked at him, "Your strength is still not bad among Grandmasters, but defeating you will be no difficulty at all."</p><p></p><p>"The rules have always been set for the weak, true strong ones are the ones who come to break the rules. I consider myself a strong one, so I don't need to follow the rules."</p><p></p><p>How arrogant! Everyone present couldn't help but exclaim in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Even the Seven Star Academy students, this was the first time they had seen someone so arrogant since joining the academy.</p><p></p><p>To actually say in the Seven Star Academy that the rules are set for the weak, and that he is a strong one so he doesn't need to follow them!</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong smiled, in all his time at the Seven Star Academy, he had never seen someone so arrogant, even if a great Grandmaster came, they would not dare to be so presumptuous in the Seven Star Academy!</p><p></p><p>"What you say is not without reason, but you must know that breaking the rules is not something an ordinary strong one can do, especially the rules of our Seven Star Academy!"</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and asked, "If I can defeat you with a single palm strike, will that be enough to not follow the rules? If I can't defeat you with a single palm, I'll kneel down and apologize for three days!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone was completely stunned this time, they had already thought he was very arrogant, but suddenly they realized he could be even more arrogant! Defeat a Grandmaster with a single palm strike? Even if it was a peak Grandmaster, they would be unable to do that.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he is a Great Grandmaster? But it's very clear that the young man is not a Great Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, ignorant of the heights, you really think Cheng Shifu is just a third-rate Grandmaster?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Where's the teacher?" </p><p></p><p>"This is too outrageous for a young hothead!"</p><p></p><p>"We're in for a good show, Instructor Cheng has been provoked."</p><p></p><p>The students of the Seven Star Academy were excitedly discussing the situation.</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy hadn't been this lively in a long time.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, alright, alright, I want to see how you can defeat me with a single palm strike. If you can do it, you don't have to follow the rules anymore!" Cheng Yuanhong said angrily yet with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to strike now, are you ready?" Xu Yan asked as he raised his palm.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Cheng Yuanhong was so angry he almost jumped up. Did he think he was an easy target?</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and strike!"</p><p></p><p>His aura surged, the powerful aura of a master shaking the arena.</p><p></p><p>"I'm going to strike now, be careful!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>He was evaluating Cheng Yuanhong's strength, trying to determine how much force to use. If it was too strong, he might accidentally kill him, since they had no enmity. But if it was too weak, he wouldn't be able to defeat the opponent, and then he'd have to kneel for three days.</p><p></p><p>So he had to get the force just right.</p><p></p><p>"Come!" Cheng Yuanhong was almost exploding with anger.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Xu Yan thrust out his palm, and a massive golden dragon surged forth, its terrifying pressure shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>The weaker martial artists immediately felt a tightness in their chests, almost suffocating under the oppressive pressure.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong's eyes widened, his heart filled with dread. What kind of palm technique was this, summoning a golden dragon?</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy's collection contained countless martial arts techniques, including many lost and secret arts, but a technique powerful enough to summon a golden dragon was unheard of!</p><p></p><p>The terrifying pressure instantly descended, and the fierce golden dragon gave him a sense of suffocation.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" Cheng Yuanhong's aura erupted, and he thrust out both palms, unleashing a powerful martial arts palm technique, his trump card.</p><p></p><p>The thick, mountain-like palm force piled up, trying to block and suppress the golden dragon.</p><p></p><p>But when his palms had just struck out, the golden dragon suddenly dove upwards, and its tail then whipped down.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong was caught off guard and couldn't block it in time.</p><p></p><p>His heart was filled with dread. What kind of palm technique was this? Was the golden dragon alive?</p><p></p><p>Slap! The dragon's tail struck, and Cheng Yuanhong was sent flying, crashing onto the edge of the arena.</p><p></p><p>Silence fell over the entire scene.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists stared with wide eyes, unable to believe what they had just witnessed. Summoning a golden dragon was already shocking enough, but for it to then dive and whip its tail down, this completely unexpected change left them dumbfounded. Who could have anticipated such a massive transformation after the initial strike?</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong lay on the ground, his body aching, but his pride hurt the most. He hadn't even managed to block a single palm strike - how humiliating! He stared at Xu Yan in terror, wondering where this prodigy had come from and what kind of technique that was, so incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Now can I prove that I'm a strong one? Can I disregard the rules?" Xu Yan said, as if he had just swatted away a mosquito.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Yuanhong opened his mouth but couldn't find the words.</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists were silent.</p><p></p><p>The strong never follow the rules! Xu Yan continued up the arena steps, and the news of Cheng Yuanhong's defeat by a single palm spread through the entire Seven Star Academy like wildfire.</p><p></p><p>Soon, countless students from the Seven Star Academy were rushing over.</p><p></p><p>Where did this powerful dragon come from? He was about to break the rules of the Seven Star Academy.</p><p></p><p>If the Seven Star Academy couldn't defend its arena, its rules would be shattered.</p><p></p><p>On the sixth level, a figure descended - a mid-stage Patriarch, wielding a pair of massive hammers, his body burly and covered in a thick beard.</p><p></p><p>"It's Instructor Hu Biao, surely he won't be defeated by a single palm strike, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy students were filled with hope seeing their sixth-level guardian.</p><p></p><p>Hu Biao, blessed with divine strength and a robust constitution, was extremely powerful, once holding his own against a late-stage Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>And he was no ordinary late-stage Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>This showed just how formidable Hu Biao's strength was.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of my Seven Star Academy are not to be broken by just anyone, young man. Do not be arrogant or complacent," Hu Biao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not arrogant!" Xu Yan said seriously. "My master told me that martial artists must be humble and not conceited, so I've never been arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Everyone paused, thinking, "You call this not being arrogant? We've never seen anyone more arrogant than you!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Biao was momentarily at a loss for words.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, if you want to continue upwards, you'll have to defeat me first!" he said after a moment.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak, I don't even feel like striking you," Xu Yan said, waving his hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>Damn it! Wasn't this the same person who said he wasn't arrogant?!</p><p></p><p>The others all looked at Hu Biao with sympathy, seeing the mighty instructor of the Seven Star Academy being so casually disdained.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Hu Biao struck his two hammers together, the thunderous sound shaking everyone's ears. He glared angrily, "You insolent boy, I'll show you how much strength I possess, since you think so little of me!"</p><p></p><p>He moved, the massive hammers like mountains crashing towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"I already said you're too weak!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and the roar of a dragon echoed as the golden dragon surged forth, ferocious and unstoppable, slamming directly into Hu Biao's descending hammers.</p><p></p><p>Boom! One of the hammers was sent flying, and Hu Biao himself was also knocked back, crashing to the ground in a disheveled state.</p><p></p><p>The shockwaves swept through the area, knocking down the weaker martial artists who had been on the steps.</p><p></p><p>The others were shocked again - another palm strike had defeated Hu Biao!</p><p></p><p>"He's not arrogant at all, because he's speaking with his strength!" one of the martial artists murmured in awe.</p><p></p><p>Hu Biao's hands trembled. With his robust physique and mid-stage Patriarch cultivation, he couldn't even withstand a single palm strike. Where did this prodigy come from?</p><p></p><p>"The Celestial Pavilion?" a thought flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps the opponent wasn't just here to peruse the Seven Star Academy's collection, but to suppress the academy itself.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued ascending.</p><p></p><p>The guardian of the seventh level was a late-stage Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, your talents are extraordinary, and your strength is formidable. You indeed have the right to disregard the rules," the elderly guardian wielding a long sword said.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

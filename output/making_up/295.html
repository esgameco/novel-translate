        <h1>Chapter 295</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group of martial artists, looking up at the high platform, were all greatly shocked by the young man holding the sword.</p><p></p><p>On the Thousand Martial Hall sect, the powerful figures of the Thousand Martial Hall had gloomy expressions, with flames of anger flickering in their eyes.</p><p></p><p>However, no one said they would take action, nor did anyone mention letting their sect's genius take the field.</p><p></p><p>The timing was not right!</p><p></p><p>Wei Huang and the others were on the verge of bursting with rage, wishing they could tear Xu Yan to shreds, but the confrontation between geniuses had its rules, they could not act! Especially since the Thousand Martial Hall had already issued this order, no one dared to defy the command of the sect above.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses all fell silent at this moment.</p><p></p><p>Should they take action and fight back? Even Wei Yuanwu's group could not defeat him, how could they alone be his match?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's aura surged, the foundation of the Spirit Realm had already accumulated to the limit, it was time for a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>He turned back and looked at the Thousand Martial Hall sect gate, shouting loudly: "Today I have slain the five Thousand Martial State geniuses, give your Thousand Martial Hall half a month to prepare, and I will come challenge you again after half a month.</p><p></p><p>"I hope the mighty Transcendent Spirit Sect Thousand Martial Hall will not disappoint me!"</p><p></p><p>Half a month later, he would be at the Spirit Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the Spirit Origin Realm, not to mention challenging the Refining Spirit Celestial geniuses, even the strongest who had refined a strand of the Heavenly Earth Spiritual Mechanism could collide with him and test the strength of the supreme experts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finished speaking, without lingering, his figure moved, and in an instant he disappeared from the original spot.</p><p></p><p>"So fast!"</p><p></p><p>"What kind of movement technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>"No wonder Xu Yan has such confidence, even the supreme experts may not be able to catch up with him."</p><p></p><p>The group of martial artists felt that in the blink of an eye, Xu Yan's figure had disappeared into the sky, his speed so fast that even the peak Refining Spirit Celestial experts known for their speed could not match.</p><p></p><p>On the Thousand Martial Hall sect, the powerful figures' faces turned gloomy, Xu Yan's movement technique was so swift that even ordinary supreme experts might not be able to catch up.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, shall we wait for half a month?"</p><p></p><p>An elder asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan is here, how can you do anything about it?" </p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"From the Three Kingdoms Seven Sects and Eight Great Families, select a few geniuses, and in this half month, enhance their strength, and even refine a supreme killing intent for them."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master thought for a moment and said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The group of elders were startled, refining a supreme killing intent for the geniuses was actually cheating.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was the method of the Transcendent Spirit Sect, and there was no restriction on this in the confrontation between geniuses. Moreover, once the supreme killing intent was unleashed, even if they did not die, they would fall in realm, and could never cultivate back up again.</p><p></p><p>This was almost a method of mutual destruction.</p><p></p><p>In the previous confrontation with the Myriad Star Martial Dao Academy, they had used the geniuses of the subordinate Spirit Sect to unleash this method, severely injuring the Myriad Star geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Now they were going to use it on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master thought for a moment, and then said, "Also select two or three suitable geniuses from our own sect, enhance their strength, refine a supreme killing intent, and temporarily allow them to wield the power of divine artifacts.</p><p></p><p>"If necessary, let them take action, no matter what, the timing is not right, Hu Buibai and the others are not the time to act, this time the confrontation between geniuses will be the last in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It will also completely crush the Myriad World Alliance, slay Wu Tiannan, and the rule of the Spirit Realm also needs to undergo some changes.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Beast Clan, the Azure Sea Spirit Tribe, are threats, when the Spirit Bridge opens, they must be completely suppressed."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master's gaze was cold and his killing intent was intense.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>The group of elders were solemn in their hearts, the Sect Master was going to completely change the pattern of the Spirit Realm when the Spirit Bridge opened.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master turned to leave, but suddenly thought of something, stopped in his tracks, and then said, "In the sect, those Refining Spirit Realm experts who have been unable to successfully refine the Heavenly Earth Spiritual Mechanism and are getting old, it is also time for them to be loyal to our Thousand Martial Hall.</p><p></p><p>"Let them refine the supreme killing intent, cultivate the Burning Life Martial Dao, and if necessary, let them attack and assassinate Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"No one knows that they are ours of the Thousand Martial Hall, how can Wu Tiannan do anything about it?</p><p></p><p>"The arrogant brat, relying on Wu Tiannan's backing, flaunting his might in front of our Thousand Martial Hall, how can I allow him to live? Does Wu Tiannan really think that he alone can intimidate our Thousand Martial Hall and we dare not take any action? As long as there is no evidence that it was our Thousand Martial Hall, I want to see if Wu Tiannan will still recklessly take action!"</p><p></p><p>The group of elders became solemn upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master actually wanted to use this move! "Sect Master, is it really necessary to do so?"</p><p></p><p>An elder asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"The Blood Demon Calamity, the reason it appeared was because we were not decisive enough back then, otherwise how could the Blood Demon have risen? Such a mistake must not be made a second time!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sect Master!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the crowd felt a chill in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon Calamity was the greatest crisis in the history of the Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>In the Sect Master's eyes, Xu Yan's threat level was already comparable to the Blood Demon back then?</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master stepped away.</p><p></p><p>The elders also began to arrange the subsequent countermeasures to deal with Xu Yan's challenge in half a month.</p><p></p><p>In the core area of the Thousand Martial Hall's back mountain, entering from a cave, after walking for only a few tens of meters, a huge underground hall appeared before their eyes.</p><p></p><p>This huge underground hall was directly excavated from a spiritual ore vein, and above the hall, the crystalline spiritual ore was permeated with a strand of profound aura.</p><p></p><p>The originally crystalline spiritual ore had colorful halos appearing on it, the halos constantly flowing and changing, as if reflecting the cycle of the four seasons of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At the back of the hall were a number of small spiritual ore houses, five of which were closed, indicating that someone was in seclusion cultivation inside.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master looked at it for a while, the profound aura that had permeated into the spiritual ore above the hall was being absorbed into the five spiritual ore houses.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad World Alliance, Wu Tiannan, the foundation of the Transcendent Spirit Sect, how can you imagine it? The confrontation between geniuses is doomed to fail!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master thought with intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Myriad Star Martial Dao Academy recruited too many spiritual body geniuses, which allowed you to show a bit of your might, but the core geniuses of our Transcendent Spirit Sect have not even taken action yet.</p><p></p><p>"This time, let the scattered cultivators of the Spirit Realm, let you Myriad World Alliance see the strength of our Transcendent Spirit Sect's core geniuses!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan, you are just a rural bumpkin, thinking that you have cultivated some martial dao and reached the limit of the Spirit Realm, so you can act recklessly?</p><p></p><p>"You want to ascend the Spirit Bridge, I won't let you!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the five spiritual ore houses, the Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master's expression relaxed, even if Xu Yan was prodigious, he could not be compared to the core geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sect.</p><p></p><p>The core geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sect had been rare in appearance in the Spirit Realm since ancient times, even if they had taken action, their names would not be spread, and no one would know about them.</p><p></p><p>"The existence of the Transcendent Spirit Sect is for the core geniuses... Wu Tiannan, you are just a frog in the well."</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Sect Master murmured a few words and entered an empty spiritual ore house to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left the Thousand Martial Hall gate, preparing to find a place to break through, but suddenly his expression changed, and he looked back.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The shadow approached with lightning speed.</p><p></p><p>It was a teacher-like figure, holding a ruler in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>He sensed that the strongest one was this person.</p><p></p><p>"Little friend Xu Yan, please wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan smiled and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan smiled gently, he was very interested in Xu Yan, that sword dao was so profound, so incredible.</p><p></p><p>"What do you want from me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment, he had never heard of such a powerful expert.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the other's appearance, he was not a cultivator of the Spiritual Realm, with such powerful strength, and standing at the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall, intimidating the experts of the Thousand Martial Hall, he should be from the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Could he be the leader of the Myriad Worlds Alliance?</p><p></p><p>"I see that you, young friend, seem to be a wandering cultivator, but the profundity of your sword dao is truly extraordinary, so I am curious and wonder where your teacher is from?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"My teacher is a reclusive immortal, and the sword dao he has passed down to me is undoubtedly unparalleled in the world. As for the so-called sword dao of the Spiritual Realm, in my eyes, they have not even entered the door."</p><p></p><p>"They have only grasped the threshold of the sword dao, and are still far from truly entering it.</p><p></p><p>"Let me put it this way, the Spiritual Realm does not have the sword dao, only the sword techniques!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said after thinking for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's mouth twitched, the Spiritual Realm has no sword dao? How arrogant! However, he thought about it again, Xu Yan's sword dao was so profound and unimaginable, while the sword dao of the Spiritual Realm was far from being able to achieve it.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's eyes, they had not even entered the door of the sword dao, so it was not surprising.</p><p></p><p>As for saying that the Spiritual Realm only has sword techniques and not the sword dao... Wu Tiannan pondered for a moment, feeling that there might be some truth to it.</p><p></p><p>The sword dao of the Spiritual Realm was all about the killing and exquisiteness of sword techniques, compared to Xu Yan's sword dao, the difference was too obvious.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan acted, there was no trace of sword techniques at all.</p><p></p><p>He had already transcended the realm of sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>So, this was the true sword dao?</p><p></p><p>"Your teacher's sword dao is truly unparalleled in the world, and I admire it. May I visit your teacher?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and said, "For you to visit my teacher, it depends on whether my teacher agrees. I cannot make the decision, after all, my teacher does not like conflicts and prefers to be carefree.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the leader of the Myriad Worlds Alliance? You can inquire with the Jade State Alliance Master and convey your intention to visit."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was stunned, the Jade State Alliance Master could contact Xu Yan's teacher?</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and said, "Young friend, you misunderstood, I am not the leader of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, nor am I a member of the Myriad Worlds Alliance."</p><p></p><p>"Then who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised, the other party was not the leader of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, nor a member of it, could he be a powerful cultivator from a transcendent spiritual sect?</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan pondered for a moment and asked, "Have you ever heard of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"I have some knowledge of it, I've heard that the Myriad Stars Martial Academy was destroyed by the Spiritual Realm and has disappeared from the Eighteen Prefectures."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"I am the former dean of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knew about the Myriad Stars Martial Academy, but he did not know Wu Tiannan, the former dean of the academy, which showed that the information about the once-prominent Myriad Stars Martial Academy had not been widely circulated in the Eighteen Prefectures.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised, "You are the dean of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed and said, "In the battle of the past, I was ambushed and attacked, and then attacked by that old guy from the Thousand Martial Hall. I was seriously injured, and ultimately the academy was beyond saving and fell apart, withdrawing from the Eighteen Prefectures."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan understood now, no wonder Wu Tiannan appeared at the Thousand Martial Hall, he had such a deep enmity with them.</p><p></p><p>"But it's fine, I've laid down the burden on my shoulders and can act freely now. If the Spiritual Realm violates the rules of the competition of geniuses, I can retaliate without any mercy.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I, Wu Tiannan, have come a long way from the remote villages of the Inner Realm to the peak of the martial dao in the Spiritual Realm. The Spiritual Realm cannot arbitrarily manipulate me."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan said with a cold smile.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was full of surprise, Wu Tiannan was from the Inner Realm? And he was the dean of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy, the higher institution of the Seven Stars Academy in the Inner Realm, could it be that Wu Tiannan was the patriarch of the Seven Stars Academy?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan became very interested.</p><p></p><p>"Are you from the Inner Realm? Could it be that you are the patriarch of the Seven Stars Academy?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was surprised, "Young friend, you know about the Seven Stars Academy?"</p><p></p><p>"I've heard some things about it, I heard that the gate to the Spiritual Realm was once opened, and some people came from the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>He did not say that he was from the Inner Realm, he still needed to be cautious.</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan realized, he also knew a bit about the opening of the gate to the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I am the founder of the Seven Stars Academy."</p><p></p><p>There was no need to hide this.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how the Seven Stars Academy is doing now?"</p><p></p><p>He felt a bit nostalgic about the academy he had founded in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I heard it has been renamed."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan replied.</p><p></p><p>"Renamed, huh."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan sighed, not pursuing the matter further.</p><p></p><p>He cupped his hands and said, "After reaching the peak of the martial dao in the Spiritual Realm, I have not found a worthy opponent, nor anyone I can discuss the dao with. Your teacher is a high-level cultivator, and his strength must already be at the peak of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I want to visit your teacher to learn from him, exchange insights on the martial dao, and explore the secrets of the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Although Xin Mengrou's strength was not weaker than his, she was still from the Taiyi Sect, and the inherent martial dao traditions of the transcendent Spiritual Realm sects would naturally know more about the secrets of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had finally encountered a martial artist whose strength would not be inferior to his own, and whose sword dao was so profound and extraordinary. Wu Tiannan was confident that as fellow wandering cultivators, they would surely have a common language.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps they could become close companions and explore the secrets of the Spiritual Realm together.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan shook his head and said, "You can certainly visit my teacher to seek guidance, and my teacher will surely be able to point you in the right direction. But as for exchanging insights on the martial dao, that's not possible."</p><p></p><p>"Why?" </p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was puzzled, could it be that Xu Yan's teacher was a stubborn person, hoarding his knowledge and afraid of his martial dao being spread?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought for a moment and decided to be straightforward, "Because you are too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>The words "because you are too weak" kept echoing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had ever heard someone say he was weak! Even in the past when he fought against the Spiritual Realm, the previous Thousand Martial Hall Master did not dare to belittle him by saying he was weak.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan actually said he was too weak?!</p>

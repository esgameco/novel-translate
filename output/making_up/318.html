        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Almost done!" </p><p></p><p>In this battle, Xu Yan had already comprehended the doubts and confusions in the martial dao of the Shen Xiang realm, and only needed to organize all his insights to completely succeed in his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>"The trip to Dachuan State is over, it's time to leave!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked down, and the steep mountains had collapsed by nine-tenths in the great battle, revealing an ancient tomb at the foot of the mountain.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head, initially he was quite interested in discovering the ancient tomb, but now he no longer had the interest to explore it.</p><p></p><p>With a movement of his figure, he disappeared from the spot, and Xu Yan left Dachuan State that day.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go to other states as well, as long as I can perfect the Shen Yuan realm, I can then prepare to break through to the Shen Tong realm."</p><p></p><p>But before breaking through the Shen Tong realm, he still needed some time to consolidate his foundation.</p><p></p><p>"In the final battle of the Heavenly Prodigies, the Shen Tong realm may not be enough, but perfecting the Shen Yuan realm would be no problem at all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked among the high mountains and steep ridges of Dachuan, organizing his insights into the martial dao of the Shen Xiang realm while leaving Dachuan State.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if my second junior brother is still in Dachuan State?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had also come to Dachuan before, and the two had met once.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, where did Xie Gong go?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of Xie Lingfeng, since entering the Spirit Realm, there had been no news of Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"After all these years, has Xie Gong already broken through to the Shen Yi realm, or even perfected the Shen Yi realm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, after Xie Lingfeng broke through and perfected the Shen Yi realm, there were no more subsequent cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>"Since I'm traveling the Spirit Realm, I might as well look for news of Xie Gong as well, and pass on the martial dao methods of the Shen Yuan and Shen Tong realms to him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, the next destination would be Yunshan State!</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Tianling State, known as the State of Spirit Beasts.</p><p></p><p>Compared to Dachuan State, the mountains in Tianling State are higher, the forests denser, and the mountain ranges more continuous, with countless caves and underground rivers.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of Tianling State's unique terrain that it has become the State of Spirit Beasts, with 80% of the Spirit Realm's spirit beasts gathered in Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>In the central mountain range of Tianling State, ancient trees soar to the sky, and strange peaks are arrayed, this is the core area of the spirit beast clan, and also the territory of the super sixth-grade spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>Few people dare to venture here, even the strongest of the Yuling Mansion would not easily set foot in this place.</p><p></p><p>Among the mountains, on the highest peak, a huge palace has been built, its golden roof shining brilliantly in the sunlight.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, one would find that this huge palace was carved out of a massive stone peak, and a rare golden material was poured onto the roof.</p><p></p><p>Surrounding the palace, various precious gems were inlaid, displaying an extravagant appearance.</p><p></p><p>On the left and right sides of the huge palace, there are two smaller palaces, each only one-third the size of the central one, as if guarding the huge palace in the middle.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A spirit beast flew from the mountains and landed in front of the huge palace, and its originally tens-of-meter-tall body shrank to about three meters before entering the palace.</p><p></p><p>This is a super sixth-grade spirit beast, its strength comparable to a cultivator who has refined the Heavenly Earth Spirit Mechanism.</p><p></p><p>Over the next few hours, more super sixth-grade spirit beasts came from all directions, and each one shrank its body before entering the palace.</p><p></p><p>On this day, all the overlord spirit beasts of Tianling State, all the super sixth-grade spirit beasts, gathered and entered this huge palace.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts that entered the palace were arranged in order of strength, either squatting or lying down, all facing upwards.</p><p></p><p>Above the hall, there were three chairs, one large and two small.</p><p></p><p>The large central chair was entirely golden, emanating a golden glow, and sitting on the huge chair was a mighty tiger with a large golden chain around its neck, exuding an awe-inspiring aura.</p><p></p><p>The mighty tiger sat upright on the chair, its paws resting on the armrests, looking down imposingly at the spirit beasts arranged below.</p><p></p><p>On the chair to the left of the mighty tiger, a jade-white dragon was coiled up, its head slightly raised, looking at the arranged spirit beasts below.</p><p></p><p>On the chair to the right, a toad was squatting, although much smaller than the mighty tiger, it still resembled a small mountain.</p><p></p><p>The one in the central chair was naturally the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>On the left and right were Jade Little Dragon and Little Ha, since coming to Tianling State to roam, the Red Cat, as a cultural tiger, has been well-connected among the spirit beast clan.</p><p></p><p>When it was still weak, it gathered powerful backing to lay a foundation for its own growth.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, the Red Cat has now become the king of the spirit beast clan in Tianling State!</p><p></p><p>Its strength is sufficient to intimidate all the super sixth-grade spirit beasts, the super sixth-grade spirit beasts present are all its defeated opponents, all subdued by it.</p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon cultivated the Great Demon Technique, and has already broken through the shackles of its bloodline, transforming into a dragon, and its strength is now no weaker than a super sixth-grade spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha, this Swallowing Mountain Toad, can almost be said to be the strongest Swallowing Mountain Toad in the history of the Spirit Realm, its strength comparable to a super sixth-grade spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>Its devouring ability, with its huge spatial power in its belly, has been unleashed, defeating many other super sixth-grade spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>It has finally established a foothold in Tianling State.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat is the Great Demon King, Jade Little Dragon is the Second Demon King, and Little Ha is the Third Demon King.</p><p></p><p>"We don't know why the Great King has summoned us, what are your orders?" </p><p></p><p>A super spirit beast spoke up from below.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I have summoned you all to announce a great matter, concerning the future and the rise of our spirit beast clan." </p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's divine sense fluctuated, issuing a mighty voice, fully displaying its aura as the Great Demon King.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts all perked up, not knowing what this king was going to order.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's eyes flashed with brilliance, and a golden light surged from its body, making it even more majestic and awe-inspiring, a powerful demonic aura shaking the hall.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts all felt a chill in their hearts, sensing this pressure, and an urge to worship arose within them, and this pressure continued to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>This meant that the Great King's strength had increased once again.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit beast clan shall cease to exist, from today on, I shall establish the Great Demon Clan, we are demons, not beasts, from today on, Tianling State shall be the territory of the Demon Clan, and I am the Great Demon King."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's mighty voice echoed through the hall.</p><p></p><p>Demon Clan?! All the spirit beasts were stunned.</p><p></p><p>One of the spirit beasts spoke up, "Great King, we are originally spirit beasts, how can we forget our ancestors? This won't do!"</p><p></p><p>Slap! The Red Cat glared, its demonic aura surging, and Jade Little Dragon swept its tail, slapping that spirit beast and sending it flying, crashing to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"Insolent! Did the Great King allow you to speak?" </p><p></p><p>Jade Little Dragon thundered.</p><p></p><p>They had already cooperated tacitly, and the moment that spirit beast dared to question, they immediately took action to knock it away.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat looked down at the spirit beasts below, coldly saying, "Forget your ancestors? Are you willing to be trapped in your bloodline, unable to make any progress, forever unable to surpass your ancestors?</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, were not your ancestors also just beasts? Are you willing to sink down into depravity?"</p><p></p><p>"I am the Great Demon King, establishing the Demon Clan, naturally I will pass down the Great Demon Techniques, break through the shackles of the bloodline, and walk the great path that belongs to our Demon Clan."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat suddenly rose from the chair...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He stood up, with the Jade Little Dragon also rising, its tail supporting it as it stood straight up, its height a head shorter than the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha also stood on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Since the Great King had stood up, they naturally couldn't remain seated.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat raised its left paw, and on the huge tiger claw, fierce winds surged, flames swirling, containing the powerful might of wind and fire - this was one of the great demonic arts the Red Cat had cultivated.</p><p></p><p>It was also the great demonic art it used to subdue the many super sixth-rank spirit beasts, a technique it had gradually cultivated by constantly drawing the formation of the wind and fire killing array in its acupoints.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see? This is my Phoenixfire Great Demonic Art, how powerful it is, you have all witnessed it. This is just one of the great demonic arts.</p><p></p><p>"You are all constrained by the shackles of your bloodlines, but I have no such troubles. Like human martial artists, I can continue to cultivate and grow stronger without limit.</p><p></p><p>"Are you all willing to be trapped and die within the shackles of your bloodlines, forever remaining as mere beasts, never able to surpass your ancestors?"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts were stirred. For them, breaking through the shackles of their bloodlines was the lifelong pursuit.</p><p></p><p>As for not forgetting their ancestors, it was simply because their ancestors' strength was greater, and their bloodlines had become diluted. Pursuing bloodline purity was just a desire to get closer to their ancestors' strength.</p><p></p><p>Now that they had the chance to break through the shackles of their bloodlines, not only could they catch up to their ancestors, they could even surpass them. How could they not be moved?</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon also spoke up: "I am the Jade Crystal Snake, and you all know the limits of my bloodline. But look at me, how strong am I now?"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts' gazes flickered. The Jade Crystal Snake had the bloodline of the Flood Dragon, but transforming into a true Flood Dragon was almost impossible, unless it devoured the essence blood of a Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon's strength was extremely powerful, and it also commanded great demonic arts - its strength clearly did not come from the enhancement of its bloodline, but from the cultivation of great demonic arts!</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat raised a paw and patted the head of Little Ha beside it, saying, "See, your three Great Kings are Swallowing Mountain Toads, and they have already surpassed their ancestors."</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts were even more stirred. Swallowing Mountain Toads, though spirit beasts, were of a low rank, even being domesticated by cultivator clans to make storage pouches.</p><p></p><p>Yet these three Great Kings, Swallowing Mountain Toads, had strength beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Great King, wise and mighty, leading us to rise up in the heavens and earth, I swear to follow and fight for the rise of our Demon Tribe!" </p><p></p><p>Among the spirit beasts, a snow-white wolf leaped up, kneeling on the ground and shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, good! From today, you shall be the Grand Elder of the Demon Tribe's Elder Hall!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded with an approving expression. This snow wolf was extremely powerful, ranking among the top three of the super sixth-rank spirit beasts, and was also extremely cunning, adept at judging the situation and making decisions beneficial to itself.</p><p></p><p>Just like earlier, when the Red Cat made its move, this snow wolf was the only one that surrendered without getting beaten.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Great King, for the honor!" </p><p></p><p>The snow wolf excitedly knocked its head on the ground, shouting loudly.</p><p></p><p>"From today, the Spirit Beast Tribe no longer exists, only the Demon Tribe remains. Who supports this, and who opposes?"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat sat back down on the throne, looking down at the assembled super sixth-rank spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Great King is wise, from today we are Demons, not Spirit Beasts!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts looked at each other, the trend was irreversible, and since they also wanted to break through the shackles of their bloodlines, they all prostrated themselves and shouted in unison.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. Spread my Demon King's decree - Tianliang State is our Demon Tribe's state, establish the Demon Tribe's Elder Hall, Protector Hall, and build the Demon Tribe's Guard Army...</p><p></p><p>"You all, select a group of our Demon Tribe's geniuses to come to the Sacred Mountain, and I will personally teach and cultivate them!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat issued orders excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Great King!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts all shouted in unison.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat raised a paw, and a portrait appeared, its features indistinct but giving a profound and unfathomable impression.</p><p></p><p>"This is our Demon Tribe's Demon Ancestor, the Great Demon of the world. You must worship the Demon Ancestor, remember the Demon Ancestor's grace, and establish the foundation of our Demon Tribe..."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat spoke solemnly and reverently.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts were all bewildered - how could their Demon Ancestor be a human?</p><p></p><p>They had doubts, but dared not ask, fearing to incur the Great King's displeasure and be suppressed.</p><p></p><p>"What are you all standing there for, kneel and worship the Demon Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon spoke up to remind them.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts all knelt and worshipped: "Greetings to the Demon Ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded in satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>They must always remember their master and know how to please their master, that is the right path.</p><p></p><p>With another wave of its paw, another portrait appeared, a graceful and beautiful figure, though the specific features were not visible, one would instantly recognize the true person upon seeing them.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Demon Tribe's Holy Mother!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts continued to be bewildered - how could their Demon Tribe's Holy Mother also be a human?</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Holy Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Never mind, just worship!</p><p></p><p>They were able to become so strong so quickly all because of the pills refined by Suling Xiu, so in addition to pleasing their master, they also needed to please Suling Xiu.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was satisfied with the spirit beasts' performance.</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, Xu Yan was a fierce person, very formidable, and although it was now the Demon King, it still couldn't afford to offend him.</p><p></p><p>So with a flick, another portrait appeared.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Demon Tribe's Supreme Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Supreme Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Demon Tribe's Second Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Second Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the Demon Tribe's Third Patriarch."</p><p></p><p>"Greetings to the Third Patriarch!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts were all dazed - how come all the big shots of our Demon Tribe are humans?</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat thought it over, now that Xu Yan had become the Demon Tribe's Supreme Patriarch, if Meng Chong and Fang Hao found out they didn't have a share, wouldn't they come and beat it up? Fang Hao's alchemy and formation skills were also what it needed, it couldn't offend him.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, his physical body was formidable, second only to Xu Yan's fierceness, it couldn't offend him either.</p><p></p><p>So it might as well just bring them all in and make them the big shots of the Demon Tribe.</p><p></p><p>As for Shi Er and the others, naturally they couldn't surpass the Great King.</p><p></p><p>"Today, our Demon Tribe is just established, we need to formulate our Demon Tribe's rules. The Elder Hall will be led by the snow wolf as the Grand Elder, the Protector Hall's protectors, I will personally select and teach..."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat began to promulgate the Demon Tribe's rules, establish the Demon Tribe's Guard Army, and set up the Demon Tribe's Academy. All Demon Tribe geniuses must learn to read and write.</p><p></p><p>They must become cultured demons like the Great King Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Tribe is not just beasts, how can we lack culture? All of you here are lacking in culture, I have a book here, my wisdom compendium.</p><p></p><p>"I will distribute it to you all today, after you return, you must study it diligently, I will test you.</p><p></p><p>"Those with outstanding results can receive my instruction in great demonic arts in advance."</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat waved a hand, and many small booklets that had been prepared earlier flew in front of the spirit beasts.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Great King!"</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts reverently took the booklets and put them away.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was about to continue arranging tasks when suddenly a spirit beast came running in, kneeling on the ground with a front paw, "Great King, that person who deceived us spirit beasts has come again!"</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

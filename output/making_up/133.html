        <h1>Chapter 133</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"How can one reap great rewards without putting in any effort? " He took out a medicinal pill and said, "Here, take this pill, and your injuries will recover very quickly."</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Shushu became alert immediately. Could this pill be a means to control him?</p><p></p><p>"No need, I also have some medicinal herbs for healing..."</p><p></p><p>"What kind of trash healing herbs are those? How can they compare to mine?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put away the medicinal pill, looking pained as he gazed at the pill in his palm. Without further ado, he stuffed it into Meng Shushu's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"This was refined using eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs through a special method. I don't have many of these, and each one is extremely valuable. For the sake of your injuries, I've really put my heart and soul into this!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said with a pained expression.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu had no way to avoid it and the pill was directly stuffed into his mouth. He was greatly alarmed inwardly, thinking that he had fallen under someone's control.</p><p></p><p>However, the moment the pill entered his mouth, it immediately dissolved, and a surge of medicinal power circulated through his body. His chaotic breathing gradually stabilized, and his injuries showed signs of recovery.</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked. What kind of healing medicine was this?</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Meng!" He felt somewhat ashamed, having misjudged the other's intentions.</p><p></p><p>"Don't mention it, this is a specially made medicine. Eighteen sixth-grade spirit herbs were used, which are extremely rare. I don't have many of these pills."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong still had a pained expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu: ...</p><p></p><p>He took out a key to a spirit herb treasure ground and handed it to Meng Chong, saying, "Brother Meng, this is the key to a spirit herb treasure ground. There are sixth-grade spirit herbs there, and possibly even a fifth-grade one. That's why they've been chasing after me relentlessly!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly astonished, a fifth-grade spirit herb? "Let's go and get the spirit herbs then."</p><p></p><p>He said eagerly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng, the area around the treasure ground must be guarded by master-level experts, and not just one."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Are there grand masters?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably not, after all, grand masters are lofty and aloof. They wouldn't do the job of guarding. Moreover, I'm not worthy of a grand master's attention."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"If there are no grand masters, then it's not a problem."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"But there will likely be several peak master-level experts."</p><p></p><p>"No need to worry, I can just take them out one by one, two at most. It's not a big deal. Let's set off now."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu recalled that terrifying strike that could slay masters with a single blow. Of course, how many such strikes Meng Chong could unleash was unknown, but since he was so confident, he should be able to handle a dozen or so masters.</p><p></p><p>Thinking this through, Meng Shushu was once again amazed by Meng Chong's formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, let's set off then!"</p><p></p><p>He also steeled his heart, since they wanted to hunt him down, he would kill them all.</p><p></p><p>"By the way, what kind of force is this, with so many master-level experts?"</p><p></p><p>As they set off towards the spirit herb treasure ground, Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu shook his head. "This force is very powerful, but they don't have much of a reputation in the inner realm. They must be some kind of hidden power."</p><p></p><p>So-called hidden powers are those that lurk in the shadows, not revealing themselves, and even engaging in unsavory activities.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong brought back a Strengthening Bone Flower, Su Lingxiu began adjusting the formula for the Evergreen Pill and started attempting to refine it. After all, a new pill could not be perfected on the first try.</p><p></p><p>Since there was only one Strengthening Bone Flower, Su Lingxiu had to be extremely careful. Before truly refining the Evergreen Pill, she practiced the refinement techniques using other medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had immersed himself in exploring the realms beyond the Penetrating Profound Realm. He had basically determined the realms above it and how to systematically construct the cultivation theories.</p><p></p><p>"The Penetrating Profound Realm is about cultivating true essence to harmonize with the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. This is already close to the limit of qi cultivation. The next realm would be cultivating spiritual power, or in other words, refining the spirit soul. That senior Wu must have been possessed, and the one who could possess him must be a powerful expert above the grand master realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was gradually perfecting the cultivation theories for the realms beyond the Penetrating Profound Realm, carefully considering each detail to ensure a smooth transition from the previous realm.</p><p></p><p>"How should one cultivate spiritual power? How should one refine the spirit soul? There is a mysterious acupoint called the Mud Pill Palace... Above the Penetrating Profound Realm, it must be about opening the Mud Pill Palace..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan meticulously refined the cultivation theories for the realms beyond the Penetrating Profound Realm, repeatedly contemplating and seeking to connect them seamlessly with the Penetrating Profound Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The transition to the realms beyond the Penetrating Profound Realm is a major breakthrough. The more detailed the theories, the easier it will be to comprehend and attain them..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat in his chair, seemingly leisurely, but his mind was fully focused on designing the new cultivation realms.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi brought the Spirit Fire Stone.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at it, slightly surprised. Kou Ruozhi had already refined the bone, and his cultivation speed was faster than Shi Er's, indicating his talent was superior.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I have selected 120 loyal and devoted followers, and they have begun cultivating the martial dao. Twelve have completed skin refinement, fifty have mastered skin refinement, and the rest are in the initial and intermediate stages.</p><p></p><p>On the Xu family side, there are already 26 who have become martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Even old man Qi has started cultivating, and he seems to have some talent, having already mastered skin refinement.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the skin refinement cultivation method has started spreading out, and more people are beginning to cultivate it. I'm also cooperating with Lord Xu Junhe to rebuild the faith of the martial artists.</p><p></p><p>I believe it won't be long before there will be many martial artists appearing in the Borderlands."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi reported the changes in the Borderlands to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao had started spreading in the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>"On the Wu Kingdom side, the Wu Emperor himself came for a visit and obtained the martial dao techniques. We have reached an agreement, and our goal is the same - the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>The Xu family has become the holy land of the martial dao in the Borderlands. The martial dao saints are revered by all cultivators, and every martial artist will worship the martial dao saints.</p><p></p><p>In the future, when we enter the inner realm, the martial artists from the Borderlands will definitely be able to establish a foothold."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Rebelling is just child's play. Going to the inner realm to compete with the inner realm martial artists, that is the true ambition of a real man!"</p><p></p><p>Additionally, the Heavenly Mother Sect is preparing to dissolve, and I plan to reorganize it into the Medicine King Sect. What does Miss think about this?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu paused for a moment, falling into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>She would eventually have to go to the inner realm, and the Heavenly Mother Sect was originally her own force. Now that it was being reorganized, it should have a proper form.</p><p></p><p>"I cultivate the Pill Medicinal Martial Dao, with pills as the main focus. Once I enter the inner realm, conflicts will be inevitable. To establish a foothold, I must have formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>And this strength cannot rely solely on my own, but also on a sufficient number of powerful experts. Only then can I obtain more resources."</p><p></p><p>Thinking it through, Su Lingxiu considered for a moment and said, "Select some talented and capable individuals to establish the Evergreen Pavilion, that will be the name for now."</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was taken aback, the Evergreen Pavilion? "Yes, yes, understood."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Miss has thought it through so thoroughly, everlasting and evergreen, not bad, not bad!" </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi flattered.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu tossed him a medicinal pill, saying, "You've started refining the bone, this medicinal pill is for you, do a good job."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After reporting the matter, Kou Ruozhi left.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran was pensive, the number of people cultivating martial arts in the borderlands had started to increase, and there were already dozens of people who had entered the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, every cultivating martial artist worshipped him as the Martial Dao Saint Master.</p><p></p><p>They also called him the Martial Ancestor of the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>However, up until now, he had not received any feedback from the "golden finger".</p><p></p><p>"Is it because the number of cultivators is still too small?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran pondered.</p><p></p><p>"The disciples are still reliable, I wonder how Xu Yan is doing? How far is he from breaking through to the Transcendent Realm?"</p><p></p><p>He hadn't received any feedback from Xu Yan for a while.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong went to the Inner Realm, but he hasn't brought me any feedback either, so it seems that Grandmaster-level martial artists are still not many."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had gone to the Inner Realm and killed a Grandmaster in no time.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, after all this time, he still hadn't brought any feedback, obviously he hadn't killed a Grandmaster yet.</p><p></p><p>Indeed, Grandmaster-level martial artists in the Inner Realm were at the top echelon, and were scarce, not something one could easily encounter.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat walked over and lay down in front of him, looking at him with pleading eyes.</p><p></p><p>The thick golden chain around its neck had been lengthened by Shi Er due to the Red Cat's growth in size.</p><p></p><p>"You still don't understand, do you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran sighed, the Red Cat, although more intelligent than ordinary fierce beasts, was still not human.</p><p></p><p>However, it seemed to have understood some things, otherwise its physique wouldn't have grown so much.</p><p></p><p>He picked up the bamboo staff and pointed the acupoints on the Red Cat again, explaining the Demonic Cultivation technique.</p><p></p><p>Such as how to open the acupoints, how to nourish the physical body, and how to refine the Demonic Cultivator's body.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, the first acupoint, the one in your head, once opened, your intelligence should also improve a bit."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran pointed to an acupoint on the Red Cat's head.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat seemed to understand yet not understand.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go ponder on your own, if your body keeps growing bigger, it won't look cute anymore, and I might get the urge to stew you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran jokingly threatened.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's body trembled, suddenly feeling the pressure, and hurriedly tucked its tail and ran away to find a place to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Master, aren't you overestimating the Red Cat? How could it possibly comprehend the Demonic Cultivation techniques? It probably didn't even remember most of the acupoints you taught it."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was not very optimistic about the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case, haven't you seen it has already grown bigger?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran smiled and said, "Even if it can't cultivate into a Demonic Beast, it's still good to use it to pull a cart or carry people around."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded, clasping her clothes and asking, "Master, how can I refine the Evergreen Bone?"</p><p></p><p>She had been stuck at the perfection of the Golden Bone for several days.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran glanced at his third disciple, she was also a prodigy, and he had always suspected that Su Lingxiu might have a special constitution.</p><p></p><p>However, the Evergreen Bone was too extraordinary, it was not easy to refine.</p><p></p><p>"Evergreen, everlasting, in the endless cycle of life, in the unceasing flow; your eldest brother's Jade Bone is the purest of the world; your second brother's Diamond Adamantine Bone is the most unyielding of the world..."</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Bone in the Alchemist Martial Dao was about the endless cycle of life, the abundant vitality, just like a towering ancient tree growing from a sapling.</p><p></p><p>"The Evergreen Bone is the foundation of your Alchemist Martial Dao, it depends on how you comprehend yourself, how you make your own self align with the wondrous principles of the Evergreen."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran pondered for a moment and instructed.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu became thoughtful, in her mind, the Alchemist Classics and various elixir formulas emerged, as well as some of her latest insights.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>Back in her cultivation area, she was still in deep thought, her master's words had given her some new insights.</p><p></p><p>Evergreen and everlasting, in the endless cycle, in the lush vitality. </p><p></p><p>How to be endless and lush in vitality?</p><p></p><p>She looked at the flowers she had planted, some had already withered, but the tree branches were still green, and there were also withered leaves on the ground.</p><p></p><p>However, there were also some flowers in full bloom, of a different species, in their prime blooming season.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, she seemed to have some enlightenment in her mind.</p><p></p><p>Unconsciously, she took out a refined Evergreen Pill and put it in her mouth, sitting in the flower garden, silently cultivating, at some point feeling a surge of vibrant vitality.</p><p></p><p>The fragrance of the flowers entered her nose, refreshing her mind, and images of the green tree branches and withered leaves on the ground appeared in her mind, the old leaves withering and falling, new tender buds growing.</p><p></p><p>Isn't this also an endless cycle?</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, Su Lingxiu felt that her bottleneck had loosened, her bones emanating a strange sensation, slowly as if there was a warm flow circulating in her bones.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran's brows raised, Su Lingxiu was about to break through the Evergreen Bone.</p><p></p><p>"The refinement of the Evergreen Bone is complete, it's just a matter of tempering the Dantian now, for Su Lingxiu, tempering the Dantian won't be difficult, she can soon enter the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>"After breaking through the Qi and Blood Realm, she can start refining elixirs."</p><p></p><p>"The Alchemist Classics will advance further, it won't be too far away!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran's heart was filled with excitement, once Su Lingxiu entered the Martial Dao, he would be able to obtain the feedback of the Alchemist Martial Dao, especially the Evergreen Bone, when combined with the Jade Bone, Diamond Adamantine Bone, and Evergreen Bone, what kind of transformation would occur?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the long-lost golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran's heart leapt with joy, which disciple's feedback was this?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, while tempering his heart and mind at the Matchless Pavilion, has comprehended the Myriad Manifestations of Heaven and Earth, your Myriad Manifestations of Heaven and Earth has reached completion!"</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the Sword Dao of Heaven and Earth that Li Xuanran grasped underwent a transformation.</p><p></p><p>Within the Heaven and Earth, it was no longer just the empty scenery of mountains and rivers, but the shadows of living beings appeared, with birds soaring, fish swimming in the rivers.</p><p></p><p>Among the vegetation, there were insects moving about.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he even saw people working.</p><p></p><p>"Sss!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran was greatly shocked, the Myriad Manifestations of Heaven and Earth, although still illusory, was a huge progress, the direction of the perfection of the Sword Dao of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it seemed as if there were living beings existing within the Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was still very illusory, after all, this was only the foundation of the Myriad Manifestations of Heaven and Earth, and his Myriad Manifestations of Heaven and Earth was only at the basic completion stage.</p><p></p><p>Even so, Li Xuanran could already feel the meaning contained in the Myriad Manifestations of Heaven and Earth, the powerful strength it possessed.</p><p></p><p>"If one day the Heaven and Earth become like the Heavens, how powerful would that be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanran dared not imagine.</p><p></p><p>Of course, all of this required the support of the Martial Dao realm, without the Martial Dao realm to support it, even if he had comprehended it, he would not be able to perfect the Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 134</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, his sword heart is clear and has reached great accomplishment. Your sword heart is complete, reaching the realm of the sword heart!"</p><p></p><p>After his sword heart reached completion, he advanced further, reaching the second realm of the Dao of the Sword - the realm of the sword heart.</p><p></p><p>Even just slightly touching upon it, Li Xuan could feel the immense power of the realm of the sword heart.</p><p></p><p>It was as if in a single thought, the entire manor could be transformed into a giant sword, with all of heaven and earth becoming the sword!  "How powerful! When Xu Yan returns, I will pass on to him my insights into the realm of the sword heart. Once Xu Yan comprehends the realm of the sword heart and how to cultivate it, then I will be able to smoothly enter that realm myself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. </p><p></p><p>The inner domain truly was a good place. How long had Xu Yan been there, yet his progress was so tremendous.</p><p></p><p>"What about Meng Chong? Shouldn't he be giving me some feedback as well?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of his second disciple, Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>In his joyful mood, Li Xuan summoned Shi Er and instructed him for a time.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was overjoyed, as getting guidance from the master was a rare opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced over and while cultivating the martial dao, he secretly kept an eye on Su Ling Xiu and Zhou Ying, saying, "Your cultivation is too slow, let me give you some pointers."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was overjoyed to hear this, "Thank you senior!"</p><p></p><p>To receive guidance from the senior was a great honor.</p><p></p><p>After instructing Shi Er and Zhou Ying for a short while, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan extinguished a Sect Master with a single palm strike, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>How could he have killed another Sect Master? </p><p></p><p>"Does Xu Yan naturally not get along with Sect Masters? How is it that every so often he kills another one? And are there really Sect Masters scattered all over the inner domain?"</p><p></p><p>It had barely been any time at all, yet he had already killed another Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>After finishing his guidance of Shi Er and Zhou Ying, Li Xuan took out an ancient leather book to calm his mind.</p><p></p><p>But the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that he's killed another Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong destroyed a Sect Master with a single punch, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>Another Sect Master dead, but this time it was Meng Chong who killed him, not Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but fall into contemplation. Could it be that his two disciples were Sect Master killers?</p><p></p><p>He had just recently sighed that Meng Chong hadn't killed any Sect Masters, thinking there couldn't be many Sect Masters in the inner domain, and they wouldn't just happen to have a grudge and attack.</p><p></p><p>But the result was, Meng Chong had killed one with a single punch.</p><p></p><p>"This Sect Master was too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After waiting a while, with no more golden light appearing, it seemed the opponent had been dealt with, so he breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"After all, Sect Masters are not just cabbages, how could they be killed one after another in such a short time?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled wryly.</p><p></p><p>He focused intently on researching the first page of the ancient leather book, calming his body and mind.</p><p></p><p>As he continued studying the ancient book, Li Xuan found that whenever he immersed himself in researching it, his body and mind would become tranquil, and he would enter a state of "emptiness".</p><p></p><p>His mind would only be on the fine lines on the pages of the ancient book.</p><p></p><p>"This is indeed a good method to calm the body and mind."</p><p></p><p>He didn't know how long he had been engrossed in studying the ancient book when the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong consecutively killed three Sect Masters with a single slash, your combat experience has greatly increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>So Sect Masters in the inner domain were just like cabbages, huh? Back then, Xie Lingfeng and the others had said that Sect Masters were top experts, rare in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Were they just trying to flatter themselves? Li Xuan closed the ancient book and waited for the next golden light feedback.</p><p></p><p>But after this time, there were no more golden light feedbacks for the next two days.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have already started tempering the Evergreen Bone," Su Ling Xiu happily jogged over.</p><p></p><p>Behind her, Kou Ruozhi was massaging her shoulders.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, try to enter the Martial Dao as soon as possible. After breaking through the Qi and Blood Realm, you can then attempt to refine dan pills with your Qi and Blood."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Master, when will my senior brothers return?" Su Ling Xiu missed her two senior brothers a bit.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you think my senior brothers will bring back a large amount of spirit medicines?" </p><p></p><p>She was itching for some spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>She even considered having Kou Ruozhi go to the Iron Mountain County early to try to get some spirit stones and buy spirit medicines to send back.</p><p></p><p>But Kou Ruozhi's strength was too weak, he could easily be tracked and discovered.</p><p></p><p>And the martial artists in Iron Mountain County, while not strong, the slightly capable ones had all left this barren place.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said cheerfully, "Don't worry, since I promised you, they will definitely bring back spirit medicines."</p><p></p><p>With so many Sect Masters killed, even if they just looted the corpses, they would be able to obtain a lot of spirit stones. How could they not bring back spirit medicines?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan was bringing the spirit medicines back for his parents and family.</p><p></p><p>"I hope my senior brothers come back soon."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's face was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"You should focus on entering the Martial Dao quickly, otherwise by the time there are spirit medicines, you may not be able to refine dan pills well due to your lack of cultivation, or the failure rate will be too high, wasting them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reminded her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Su Ling Xiu's heart tightened. "Master is right, spirit medicines are not like ordinary treasured medicines, refining them is much more difficult. With my current strength, relying only on the Spirit Fire Stone to refine, the control of the fire, the technique, the extraction of the spirit essence, etc. will all be restricted."</p><p></p><p>"Each spirit medicine is invaluable, the higher the grade, the greater the loss if I fail."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Su Ling Xiu felt an urgent need.</p><p></p><p>"Master, within one month, I will definitely enter the Martial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be too impatient, solid cultivation is the foundation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu respectfully nodded.</p><p></p><p>After that, Su Ling Xiu reduced her dan pill refining and invested most of her time in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The dan pills she refined for her own cultivation were already sufficient.</p><p></p><p>The tempering of the Evergreen Bone was continuously progressing.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a look, "You don't even need a month to enter the Martial Dao."</p><p></p><p>He had a rough estimate of Su Ling Xiu's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what kind of trouble Xu Yan and Meng Chong have gotten themselves into with the Sect Masters. At this rate, it won't be long before they start provoking the Grand Sect Masters, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan extinguished a Sect Master with a single palm strike, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>It had only been a short while, and he had already killed another Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was no longer surprised, he was already used to it.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan extinguished a Sect Master with a single palm strike, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan extinguished a Sect Master with a single palm strike, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>He had already killed three Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm, this was not the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan slew a Half-Step Grand Sect Master with his sword, your combat experience has greatly increased, and your sword intent has been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>Killing Sect Masters was no longer enough, he had started killing Half-Step Grand Sect Masters?</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't be long before he started killing Grand Sect Masters, right?</p><p></p><p>After slaying a Half-Step Grand Sect Master, half an incense stick later, the golden light appeared again: "Your disciple Xu Yan slew a Half-Step Grand Sect Master, causing a disturbance in the Thousand Star Lake."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your combat experience has increased, your sword intent has improved, and your mysterious aura has strengthened."</p><p></p><p>"Sss! Has Xu Yan wiped out an entire sect of masters?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was truly ferocious, having killed masters and half-step grand masters in such a short time. Had he wiped out an entire sect of masters? Or had he destroyed an inner domain martial arts force? What was the commotion at Qianxing Lake all about?</p><p></p><p>After waiting for a while, the golden light no longer appeared. </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a breath, indicating that Xu Yan had thoroughly cleaned up the sect of masters.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, another thought occurred to him.</p><p></p><p>"After Xu Yan kills people, will he loot the bodies? As a wealthy young master, he may not have that awareness?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly became a bit worried.</p><p></p><p>How could he have taught his disciple about navigating the martial arts world without mentioning the importance of looting bodies?</p><p></p><p>Thinking it over, he reassured himself, "Xu Yan is rich in the remote wilderness, so he won't have money troubles. But once he enters the inner domain, it'll be different - he doesn't have spirit stones. Given his insights and talents, he should be able to figure out body looting on his own."</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Li Xuan felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, he wasn't worried, since he was originally poor and had even wanted to team up with Shi Er to fleece the Wu Emperor's sheep, so he naturally understood the importance of looting bodies.</p><p></p><p>The next few days were uneventful, with no golden light appearing and no feedback received.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's Evergreen Bone had already reached completion, and she was beginning to refine her dantian.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could feel the vigorous vitality from her. The speed of her dantian refinement was exceptionally fast, as the abundant vitality was assisting her. From the very beginning of the dantian refinement, there was no need to worry about it being too intense and harming her viscera.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, her dantian refinement speed was incredibly fast.</p><p></p><p>"In less than half a month, she'll be able to enter the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. Once Su Lingxiu entered the martial dao, the Dantian Medicine Martial Dao system would be fully established.</p><p></p><p>He would also receive the feedback from the Dantian Medicine Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>During these days without any golden finger feedback, Li Xuan had gotten a bit unaccustomed to it.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was eagerly anticipating Su Lingxiu's martial dao breakthrough, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has killed five masters with a single slash each. You have obtained the martial dao divine technique, Extinguish Deity Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Sss! Li Xuan was stunned. Masters had truly become like cabbages, being slashed and chopped like vegetables. </p><p></p><p>He didn't know if Meng Chong had also broken into a sect of masters, killing five of them in one go.</p><p></p><p>"Another martial dao divine technique! Extinguish Deity Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. This martial dao divine technique was a sword technique that could kill the martial consciousness and divine soul of a cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"Extinguish Deity Slash, combined with a guaranteed one-hit kill - two martial dao divine techniques used together, and one can kill a master easily."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted. His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>The power of Extinguish Deity Slash was extremely formidable, not harming the physical body but targeting the consciousness and divine soul.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's physical martial dao is the Great Sun Golden Body, which has extremely strong defense. Even if he encounters attacks like Extinguish Deity Slash, he won't be easily defeated."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment. The Great Sun Golden Body was impenetrable, and it would be difficult to bypass the physical defense to attack the consciousness and divine soul.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Golden Body's profound meaning was related to the Great Sun, and it naturally had strong defenses against consciousness and divine soul attacks.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Meng Chong had awakened the Dao of the Sword and comprehended the Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>Trying to bypass the physical body to kill the consciousness and divine soul was simply impossible.</p><p></p><p>"Regardless, in the next stage, the defenses of the physical martial dao against the consciousness and divine soul must be further strengthened. Truly making it so that without breaking through the physical defense, the consciousness or divine soul cannot be harmed."</p><p></p><p>Despite this, Li Xuan was still determined to further enhance Meng Chong's physical martial dao defenses against the consciousness and divine soul, truly achieving the state where without breaking the physical defense, the consciousness or divine soul could not be injured.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong's killing of the masters, the golden finger feedback stopped, seemingly indicating that the matter had come to a conclusion.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Su Lingxiu was in the midst of her cultivation. She had already completed the refinement of her dantian and was about to enter the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sounds of her bones and muscles were resounding within her body, and her qi and blood were surging out, growing increasingly powerful, almost forming a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's qi and blood had a relatively gentle and lingering quality, as if containing a continuous vitality, yet also concealing a fiery intensity. However, this fiery quality was different from pure qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>It gave a relatively gentle impression.</p><p></p><p>"Su Lingxiu is about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed. "Her qi and blood are different because they are for the purpose of refining medicinal pills, which is the unique aspect of the Dantian Medicine Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"It can be both fierce and gentle, just like when refining pills, the control of the fire is necessary.</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood can be transformed into the medicinal fire, and even without the use of a spirit fire stone, one can refine medicinal pills. However, the consumption of the qi and blood would not be small.</p><p></p><p>"Su Lingxiu has the Evergreen Bone foundation, so she is not afraid of this consumption. But for future Dantian Medicine martial cultivators without such a foundation, the consumption of refining a single batch of pills may not be small."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was thinking about this.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, Dantian Medicine martial cultivators usually use external objects like spirit fire stones as assistants in refining pills, to reduce their own consumption.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sounds of bones and muscles grew increasingly loud, and Su Lingxiu's qi and blood were becoming increasingly rich and dense.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying watched with excitement, as her young mistress was finally about to enter the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>This also meant that the return to the inner domain was one step closer.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er had a look of embarrassment on his face. Su Lingxiu had not yet fully broken through, but the thunderous sounds of her bones and muscles were already louder than his own breakthrough, and her aura far surpassed his.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had her eyes slightly closed. She could feel that her entire body was emanating a luster, and her qi and blood seemed to contain a vigorous vitality, flowing endlessly.</p><p></p><p>The increasingly powerful qi and blood were constantly radiating outward from the center of her body.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood touched the planted trees and flowers.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed slightly. The leaves of the trees touched by the qi and blood seemed to have become even greener, and the tender buds appeared to have grown a bit larger.</p><p></p><p>The flower buds that were about to bloom had opened up a little.</p><p></p><p>"The Dantian Medicine Martial Dao is even more extraordinary than I had imagined. This lingering vitality is truly powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Dantian Medicine martial cultivators were destined to have lifespans far exceeding ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Although their combat power might be slightly inferior, their lifespans would be much longer.</p><p></p><p>"After Su Lingxiu's breakthrough, I should also teach her the Eight Trigrams. As for the offensive techniques of the Dantian Medicine Martial Dao, such as acupuncture points and golden needles, that can come later.</p><p></p><p>"Dantian Medicine martial cultivators can also cultivate the killing techniques of orthodox martial artists."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>How Su Lingxiu would comprehend and whether she could grasp the techniques unique to the Dantian Medicine Martial Dao would depend on her own insights.</p><p></p><p>The core of the Dantian Medicine Martial Dao lies in pill refining and medicine, not in martial techniques. Li Xuan believed that with Su Lingxiu's talents, she should also be able to comprehend the methods unique to Dantian Medicine martial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>For example, techniques like Golden Needle Acupuncture, which she had not yet grasped, could also be used to kill enemies.</p><p></p><p>They could also be powerful killing techniques, perhaps even more cunning and hidden.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The thunderous sounds of bones and muscles suddenly resounded, and the qi and blood congealed into a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had broken through to the qi and blood realm, becoming a true Dantian Medicine martial cultivator, the first of her kind in the world.</p><p></p><p>The Dantian Medicine Martial Dao system had truly manifested!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. At this moment, the golden light appeared again, but to his surprise, this golden light feedback was not from Su Lingxiu's martial dao breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

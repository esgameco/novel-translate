        <h1>Chapter 508</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is one of the places of origin of heaven and earth. It's just that now it's obscured by the Dao principles, so the special characteristics of this treasure land are not apparent."</p><p></p><p>Under the gaze of the small Heavenly Eye, Xu Yan had already discerned the core of this place.</p><p></p><p>"Sense the origin of heaven and earth, and use it to comprehend the Realm of Creation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately began making preparations to enter the treasure land and sense the origin of heaven and earth in order to comprehend the Realm of Creation. As for Ao Ming descending to the Divine Realm and various supreme beings also arriving in the Divine Realm, Xu Yan didn't pay any attention to that at all.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan entered the treasure land. In an instant, mountains, rivers, and the world appeared, merging into the treasure land as if becoming one with this realm.</p><p></p><p>With all preparations complete, Xu Yan used his own inner world to sense the origin of this realm, using it to comprehend the Realm of Creation.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Yan was in the Dao Realm, sensing the origin of heaven and earth to comprehend the Realm of Creation, the Divine Realm was once again thrown into an uproar.</p><p></p><p>Roar! As a dragon's cry echoed out, the many martial artists who had been near the Shadow Realm were suddenly terrified. They all retreated, moving far away from the Shadow Realm.</p><p></p><p>Dragon might swept through the area. The Taihe Realm was suddenly filled with wind and thunder. Dark clouds roiled and lightning flashed as a true dragon emerged from the Shadow Realm, coiling among the clouds.</p><p></p><p>Behind the true dragon were four more powerful divine beasts, also radiating pressure as they accompanied the dragon on its left and right.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Divine Sovereign martial artists secretly grew excited. A true dragon had descended, clearly coming for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>They all wanted to see how the Dragon-Subduing Youth would face this dangerous situation.</p><p></p><p>"Where is that brat Xu Yan?" </p><p></p><p>Ao Ming coiled among the clouds, his eyes looking down as he shouted angrily.</p><p></p><p>There was no response!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At that moment, figure after figure emerged from within the Shadow Realm, their auras incomparably powerful, possessing the majesty of supreme beings of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Supreme Realm martial artists! The elders of the Taihe Sect were extremely excited, all prostrating themselves on the ground.</p><p></p><p>"We pay our respects to the Ancestral Masters of the Upper Sect!"</p><p></p><p>The Upper Sect had finally sent people, and it was Supreme Realm Ancestral Masters who had come!</p><p></p><p>"The Taihe Realm belongs to our Taihe World. The matter of the Shadow Realm can be discussed later. I hope everyone will not violate the rules," said a Taihe World Supreme Being in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Well said. I won't disturb you then." The Taikun Realm Supreme Being laughed heartily and with a movement of his body, disappeared from the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>The other Supreme Beings also left one after another, heading to their respective Divine Realm factions and to carry out tasks for the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Brat Xu Yan, get out here!" Ao Ming glared in all directions, roaring angrily.</p><p></p><p>An elder of the Taihe Realm couldn't help but speak up: "Honored Dragon Elder, Xu Yan is not in the Taihe Realm. If you want to find him, you can go to the Qinghua Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm, is it? Very well!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Ming let out a roar and led the four divine beasts straight towards the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Divine Sovereign martial artists immediately perked up. They all set off, following closely behind, wanting to see how the true dragon would subdue the Dragon-Subduing Youth!</p><p></p><p>In the Qinghua Realm, Li Xuan was relaxed and carefree, holding the bamboo scroll that Xu Yan had brought back from the Sea Spirit Tribe. He read the strange tales and events recorded on it with great interest.</p><p></p><p>"So the ruler of the Green Spirit World was in love with Tai Cang, and even the Sea Spirit Emperor was also fond of Tai Cang. That's understandable, Tai Cang was indeed remarkable."</p><p></p><p>The bamboo scroll recorded quite a few things, and among them were not a few pieces of gossip.</p><p></p><p>"It's about to get lively again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up towards the Taihe Realm. Supreme Beings had descended to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the True Dragon Clan had also sent someone.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan was not in the Divine Realm, he had already gone to the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and the others all knew about the news that Supreme Beings had descended to the Divine Realm, and that the True Dragon Clan had sent a true dragon leading four great divine beasts to come to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue couldn't sit still.</p><p></p><p>Before, she had very much hoped that her grandfather or father would come to rescue her from her misery and take revenge.</p><p></p><p>Now, she was worried that her grandfather and father would offend the mysterious and unfathomable Ancestral Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>Even Xiaoyao, the Realm Lord, was extremely respectful and didn't dare to be the slightest bit presumptuous.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, not long ago, a Supreme Being had perished. If her father angered the Ancestral Dao Master, the consequences would definitely be disastrous, and it might even bring calamity to the entire True Dragon Clan.</p><p></p><p>Before, she had felt this place was a sea of suffering. Now she felt it was a blessed land of good fortune. The methods of the great demons were too profound. Once she succeeded in cultivating them, her strength would certainly surpass all true dragons.</p><p></p><p>Becoming the Dragon Empress was not impossible.</p><p></p><p>No matter what, she couldn't let her father come to the Qinghua Realm and disturb the Ancestral Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan was the true disciple of the Ancestral Dao Master. How could they possibly oppose him?</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue hurriedly left, transforming into a jade-white true dragon and flying directly into the Nine Mountains Realm. She immediately found Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>"Come with me!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was bewildered and instinctively said, "This Demon King still has important matters..."</p><p></p><p>Smack! A dragon claw came down, and Yu Xiaolong was knocked to the ground.</p><p></p><p>"This matter concerns your master. Do you dare to disobey my orders?" Ao Yuxue glared at him angrily.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Yu Xiaolong could only reluctantly follow, asking, "What's the matter?"</p><p></p><p>"We're going to see my father!" Ao Yuxue said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Yu Xiaolong was greatly shocked!</p><p></p><p>Smack! Ao Yuxue slapped him on the head again with her claw, making him see stars.</p><p></p><p>"Listen to me carefully. The dragon that Master Xu subdued was you, not me. That was a rumor, a false rumor. Do you understand?" Ao Yuxue said with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Yu Xiaolong sighed. He suddenly somewhat regretted transforming into a true dragon!</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's father had clearly come to take revenge on Xu Yan, but Ao Yuxue was afraid the True Dragon Clan would offend the Ancestral Dao Master, and also afraid that she would fall out of favor with Xu Yan, so she wanted to deny the matter of being subdued.</p><p></p><p>And for the widely spread rumor of dragon subduing, the dragon that was subdued could only be him taking the blame.</p><p></p><p>"Will I be in danger?" Yu Xiaolong asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>What if Ao Yuxue's father felt he had disgraced the majesty of true dragons and wanted to kill him?</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm here. How could I let Master Xu lose his mount?" Ao Yuxue assured him.</p><p></p><p>"Let me say this in advance - I have the protection of the Ancestral Dao Master. If your father attacks me and ends up dead, it has nothing to do with me," Yu Xiaolong thought for a moment and reminded her.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ao Yuxue was immediately envious. She stared at Yu Xiaolong for a long while, pondering in her heart how she could obtain protection from the Ancestral Dao Master.</p><p></p><p>"Brat Xu Yan, come out and die! Yuxue, Father is here!"</p><p></p><p>Wind and thunder rolled, dragon might surged. Ao Ming's momentum was like a rainbow as he charged all the way from the Taihe Realm towards the Qinghua Realm, not concealing his tracks at all or restraining his aura.</p><p></p><p>Everywhere he passed, all living things trembled under the dragon's might.</p><p></p><p>"So this is a true dragon. Its divine might cannot be gazed upon directly!"</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists couldn't help but prostrate themselves on the ground. Only by doing so could they withstand the sweeping dragon might.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>A dragon's cry rang out, and Ao Ming's enormous body appeared amidst the wind and thunder.</p><p></p><p>"Yuxue, are you alright?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing his precious daughter come to welcome him, Ao Ming was immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Father, I'm fine!" Ao Yuxue's eyes were red. Since being ambushed and falling into the Divine Realm, she had suffered too many grievances.</p><p></p><p>"Where did this mongrel dragon come from?!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming suddenly roared, raising his dragon claw</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He reached out to grab Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>"Father, stop!" Ao Yuxue hurriedly blocked in front of Yu Xiaolong.</p><p></p><p>"Yuxue, this mixed-blood dragon is no good, he brings shame to dragons. Listen to your father, don't associate with mixed-blood dragons!" Ao Ming became somewhat anxious.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong's face darkened. He increasingly regretted transforming into a true dragon. Now he was being called a "mixed-blood dragon" repeatedly, damaging his dignity as the Second Beast King!</p><p></p><p>"Father, this mixed-blood dragon was originally a flood dragon. He only transformed into a dragon after obtaining dragon blood. He's just my errand boy now. I brought him here to explain something to you," Ao Yuxue hastily explained how this mixed-blood dragon came to be.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Ao Ming let out a sigh of relief. He looked Yu Xiaolong up and down, finally feeling reassured. He said, "So you were a little flood dragon who transformed into a dragon. What good fortune indeed."</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong kept a dark expression and didn't want to speak. </p><p></p><p>He understood now that whether as a flood dragon or transformed into a true dragon, he would never meet the approval of true dragons like Ao Ming.</p><p></p><p>"Just you wait. One day, I'll show you long worms the might of the Second Beast King," Yu Xiaolong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Yuxue, where is that brat Xu Yan? I want to tear him apart alive!" Ao Ming hadn't forgotten his main purpose.</p><p></p><p>"Father, listen to me, this is all a misunderstanding!" Ao Yuxue hurriedly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Misunderstanding? What misunderstanding? It's all over the Dao Realm - the Dragon-Subduing Youth Xu Yan has subdued the princess of our True Dragon Realm. If I don't tear him apart, where is the face of us true dragons?" Ao Ming said angrily. </p><p></p><p>"Father, the dragon subduing incident isn't as the rumors say. There's a misunderstanding!" Ao Yuxue began to lie.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu subdued this mixed-blood dragon, not me. That was just a rumor, a rumor to slander our True Dragon clan!" Ao Yuxue said, feigning anger. "It was all slandered by the Heavenly Disaster Earthly Shadow forces behind the scenes!"</p><p></p><p>The mastermind behind her fall to the Divine Realm was Heavenly Disaster Earthly Shadow, so all responsibility lay with them. They were the enemy!</p><p></p><p>Ao Ming felt something was off as he listened.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu?" That was supposed to be an enemy, so why address him so intimately?</p><p></p><p>"Yuxue, tell me in detail, what exactly happened?" Ao Ming felt something wasn't quite right about this matter.</p><p></p><p>The dragon subduing incident had spread like wildfire, and the method of subduing dragons had aroused the covetousness of certain people. How could it turn out to be just a misunderstanding?</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue had already prepared her story, so she explained the whole process with a mouthful of lies. In short, the subdued dragon had nothing to do with her; Xu Yan had subdued the mixed-blood dragon.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the dragon subduing method didn't exist. Xu Yan had suppressed the mixed-blood dragon with his own strength.</p><p></p><p>To summarize, the whole thing was fake, a rumor created by Heavenly Disaster Earthly Shadow to provoke conflict. They absolutely couldn't fall for it.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Disaster Earthly Shadow is truly despicable to the extreme. Father, we can't let them off!" In the end, Ao Yuxue said angrily.</p><p></p><p>As for how long the lie could be maintained, it was better to keep it up for as long as possible. She absolutely couldn't let her father seek revenge on Xu Yan, or the consequences would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right. The Lord of Heavenly Disaster Realm said he made you fall to the Divine Realm in order to save you..." Ao Ming was confused. He felt his brain wasn't working properly. How did this matter become so complicated? His daughter certainly wouldn't lie.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Lord of Heavenly Disaster Realm had lied?</p><p></p><p>But with the Lord of Heavenly Disaster Realm's status, how could he tell such a lie?</p><p></p><p>Just as Ao Yuxue stopped Ao Ming from continuing towards Qinghua Territory, another uninvited guest arrived at Qinghua Territory.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer wore a Heavenly Disaster mask, with a powerful aura like a supreme being of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>A supreme being from the Heavenly Disaster Realm!</p><p></p><p>Besides the supreme being from the Heavenly Disaster Realm, there were several other supreme realm martial artists from other realms watching from afar outside Qinghua Territory.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered Qinghua Territory, the Heavenly Disaster Realm supreme being felt a shock in his heart. Qinghua Territory seemed unusual, as if someone had made special arrangements.</p><p></p><p>He came straight to Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>"Heavenly Disaster Realm's Tian Jiu requests an audience with the Lord of Carefree Realm," Tian Jiu said respectfully outside Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was still reading the strange tales on the bamboo slips, not even raising his head. A mere supreme realm being could be destroyed with just a glance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the visitor was here to see Old Man Carefree.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping all came out of seclusion and looked at the figure outside Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>"A supreme realm being?" They secretly marveled. Although the martial arts of Taicang were weak, practitioners who reached the supreme realm were still extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Emperor and the others had looks of envy on their faces. When would they be able to step into the supreme realm?</p><p></p><p>They were all very confident about whether they could break through to the supreme realm. After all, they had received guidance from the Ancestor of the Dao and heard his lectures. Entering the supreme realm was just a matter of time.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Carefree came out of seclusion and approached Tian Jiu. He frowned and said, "Heavenly Disaster sent you?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Lord Heavenly Disaster sent me to find the Lord of Carefree Realm," Tian Jiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>"If Heavenly Disaster has something to say, just say it," Old Man Carefree said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Everyone knew of Heavenly Disaster's wild ambitions throughout the entire Dao Realm. However, he couldn't be bothered with these matters and didn't care what those people were plotting. The authority of heaven and earth wasn't something just anyone could grasp.</p><p></p><p>"Lord Heavenly Disaster wishes to cooperate with the Lord of Carefree Realm on a matter or two, to jointly plan great affairs of heaven and earth. The authority would be split in half. Of course, the Lord of Carefree Realm would need to share the dragon subduing method.</p><p></p><p>"In return, Lord Heavenly Disaster would also provide the Lord of Carefree Realm with some secret information..."</p><p></p><p>Tian Jiu's lips moved slightly. Although it wasn't a sound transmission, the sound was limited to just between the two of them. Outsiders couldn't hear.</p><p></p><p>"Coming to seek cooperation with Old Man Carefree, splitting the authority of heaven and earth in half. This Heavenly Disaster really knows how to paint a pretty picture," Li Xuan chuckled inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Others might be tempted, but Old Man Carefree wouldn't be. Because he was one of the Seven Heroes of Taicang, a disciple of Taicang, he knew far more heavenly secrets than others.</p><p></p><p>For example, the existence of Tianzi.</p><p></p><p>And that the authority of heaven and earth couldn't be revealed just by unifying heaven and earth, let alone grasped.</p><p></p><p>Outsiders couldn't hear what Tian Jiu was saying, but it couldn't escape Li Xuan. Even sound transmissions couldn't escape him now.</p><p></p><p>"But this is a test, right? If Old Man Carefree cooperates, that's fine. If he doesn't cooperate, Heavenly Disaster will make his move?" Li Xuan was curious where Heavenly Disaster got the confidence to think he could suppress Old Man Carefree.</p><p></p><p>Smack! Suddenly, Old Man Carefree raised his hand and waved. The might of a realm lord erupted in an instant, blasting Tian Jiu flying with one strike.</p><p></p><p>"Go back and tell Heavenly Disaster, he's not qualified to discuss cooperation with me. And don't think about testing me. Whatever tricks you have, just bring them out. I'm used to being carefree and lazy, but that doesn't mean I, Carefree, fear anyone!" Old Man Carefree's gaze was cold. With a wave of his hand, Tian Jiu, a top supreme being, was sent flying back spitting blood, severely injured on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"Tell Heavenly Disaster, this world is not something he can covet. He doesn't have the strength to covet it either. No matter how much he schemes, in the end it will all be in vain. That's all I have to say. Take care of yourself!"</p><p></p><p>After Old Man Carefree finished speaking, he waved his hand again. A strand of the laws of heaven and earth fell down, instantly binding Tian Jiu.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The laws of heaven and earth were like a long whip, and with one flick, Tian Jiu's entire body was thrown out of Qinghua Territory uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

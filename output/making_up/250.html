        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could break through to the next realm, the Divine Consciousness Realm! Refining tools requires a lot of materials to practice, and the array formations needed for the array formations are the same.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had some stored supplies, and the treasures that Yan Dai had previously cleared out from the Dai family's treasury also had a lot of materials, which were enough to support what Fang Hao needed.</p><p></p><p>"Shidi, can you refine a dan furnace for me?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu drew out her design for a new dan furnace and asked Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Except for Fang Hao, no forging master in the entire Spirit Realm could forge this kind of new dan furnace, as it had already surpassed the understanding of the forging masters.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"This dan furnace needs to have a small array formation inside it, as well as a prohibition talisman to seal the medicinal power of the dan pills..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu began to explain the key points of the dan furnace.</p><p></p><p>Array formations and prohibitions, during this period under Fang Hao's tutelage, Su Ling Xiu had also grasped some of them.</p><p></p><p>Although far from Fang Hao's level, at least she was not blind to array formations.</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty is not great, leave it to me!" </p><p></p><p>After listening, Fang Hao pondered for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, shidi."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"I should be the one thanking you, shijie. If it weren't for your dan pills, my cultivation wouldn't have progressed so quickly."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's chubby face showed a bashful expression.</p><p></p><p>Outside the manor, in the forest.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's paw slapped the top of Xiao Ha's head, its eyes glaring at Xiao Ha, letting out a low growl, with a strong warning.</p><p></p><p>It has been very unhappy lately.</p><p></p><p>This frog has snatched away a lot of its chances to act cute, working hard to curry favor with Su Ling Xiu, and taking away the dan pills that should have belonged to it alone.</p><p></p><p>It must warn it.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Ha's lively eyes rolled, "Gua!"</p><p></p><p>Letting out a light cry, although it looked timid, it was unwilling to submit.</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's fur stood on end.</p><p></p><p>This toad, dares to defy it?</p><p></p><p>I am the future Demon King!</p><p></p><p>Raising a paw, revealing its sharp claws, it glared threateningly at Xiao Ha, letting out a low growl.</p><p></p><p>Xiao Ha shrank back a bit, its legs taking two steps back, but then it seemed to have thought of something, and became resolute again, letting out a light cry.</p><p></p><p>It, will not submit! The Red Cat became a bit angry, this toad actually brought up Fang Hao to threaten it, this is simply unacceptable.</p><p></p><p>Except for fearing its master, fearing Yan Dai, fearing that Su Ling Xiu won't give it dan pills, it fears no one else! So, it raised its paw, pointed towards the manor, telling Xiao Ha that its master is your master's teacher, in terms of status, I am higher than you!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Ha looked back towards the manor, a bit dazed, the cat's master is actually its master's teacher? It suddenly deflated, somewhat submitting.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded in satisfaction, its paw writing on the ground, warning Xiao Ha, and confiscating a third of its dan pills, as the future Demon King, it won't eat alone.</p><p></p><p>It wants Xiao Ha to become its little brother.</p><p></p><p>To enhance its intimidation, to let Xiao Ha know who the boss is.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat left for a while, bringing back a pot filled with water, directly lighting a fire to boil the water in the pot, then it doesn't know from where it grabbed a toad, throwing it into the pot to cook.</p><p></p><p>Then, it pointed at the toad in the pot, warning Xiao Ha, if it dares to defy, this will be its fate!</p><p></p><p>Opening its mouth, wanting to gulp down the toad soup in one go to leave a violent shadow in Xiao Ha's heart, not submitting to its might, but after looking at the toad soup, it seemed a bit bland.</p><p></p><p>So the Red Cat ran to find Shi Er, getting some seasoning from him, and poured it into the pot.</p><p></p><p>Then, it gulped down the toad soup in one go.</p><p></p><p>Although it tasted terrible, but to leave a psychological shadow in Xiao Ha, making it submit to its majesty as the Demon King, the Red Cat endured the disgust and swallowed it down.</p><p></p><p>Then it glared at Xiao Ha, letting out a low growl, if it dares to defy the Red Cat Demon King, this will be its fate! Xiao Ha's eyes were almost rolling back, shivering in fear, hastily nodding, indicating that it will definitely listen to the Red Cat King's words, and absolutely not dare to defy it! "Meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat patted Xiao Ha's head, striding away arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>In the manor, Li Xuan had witnessed the entire scene of the Red Cat threatening Xiao Ha, he was a bit dazed, where did the Red Cat learn such bad habits?</p><p></p><p>Actually cooking a pot of toad soup in front of Xiao Ha, leaving it with a considerable psychological shadow.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cat has learned bad habits!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>This cultured tiger has ultimately become cunning.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat strode back to the manor, then quickly ran over, acting cute and rubbing against Li Xuan's ankles, trying to curry favor with its master.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched, the Jade Talisman tapped its head, saying, "Be careful Fang Hao doesn't give you trouble!"</p><p></p><p>"Meow!"</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat had a fearless expression, indicating that its strength is not lacking, and it also has its master's backing!</p><p></p><p>After currying favor with its master, the Red Cat then ran to Su Ling Xiu's side to act cute.</p><p></p><p>The manor was as usual, Fang Hao was refining tools, cultivating the Mysterious Martial Dao, researching the Heavenly Earthly Anomalies...his strength was increasing daily.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's dan furnace, iron shovel, and others were all renewed, from treasured artifacts to spirit artifacts, and even unique spirit artifacts, surpassing the spirit artifacts of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the dan furnace or the iron shovel, they all had prohibitions engraved within.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu also took the time to research array formations and prohibitions, and then she developed a prohibition to seal dan pills and spirit medicines.</p><p></p><p>Without the need for medicinal wrappings, such a cumbersome thing.</p><p></p><p>After this period of research, Fang Hao had already mastered the Thirty-Six Formations, and even the Nine Great Formations, he had also grasped them, only unable to fully unleash the true power of the Great Formations.</p><p></p><p>And based on this foundation, Fang Hao began to research more array formations.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has grasped the initial form of the True Understanding of Array Formations, your True Understanding of Array Formations is now complete."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a smiling expression, the array formations had been further improved.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao continued to research for a few more days, Li Xuan took the time, under the guise of instructing him, to pass on the complete True Understanding of Array Formations to him.</p><p></p><p>After obtaining the Array Formations Sutra, Fang Hao's understanding of array formations instantly improved by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>He was already able to create his own array formations according to his needs.</p><p></p><p>"You have obtained the Array Formations Sutra."</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Xuan's realm in array formations had a huge breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>When looking at the Heavenly Earthly Principles in the Taicangshu, it also became easier, and in an instant, he thought of how to deploy various Great Formations.</p><p></p><p>"Array Formations, Heavenly Earthly Anomalies, how can the Bagua be lacking?"</p><p></p><p>He would pass on the Bagua to each disciple.</p><p></p><p>As for how Fang Hao would comprehend and apply it to array formations, prohibitions, and refining tools, it all depended on his own insights.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Fang Hao began to deploy array formations in the manor.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already started to research the Heavenly Earthly Principles on the fourth page of the Taicangshu.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Earthly Principles on the fourth page seemed more abstruse and more difficult to research, even though he already had the Array Formations Sutra, mastered the Heavenly Earthly Anomalies, and the prohibitions, he still felt the profundity of the Heavenly Earthly Principles on this page.</p><p></p><p>"The realm is still a bit low."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Knowing when Xu Yan would be able to comprehend the techniques of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan turned his head to look at the Red Cat. A few days ago, the Red Cat had obtained many medicinal pills from Su Lingxiu, and had been lying there, seemingly in the midst of a breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cat has actually managed to cultivate a great demonic technique."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>With the power of the Great Demonic Sovereign, Li Xuan could perceive all the changes of the Red Cat. If there were other great demons cultivating, he could likewise perceive and control everything, even borrowing the power of the great demons.</p><p></p><p>And precisely because of this, even though the Red Cat had cultivated a great demonic technique, the Dao Golden Book would not provide any feedback, as the feedback of the great demonic dao was based on the Great Demonic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>No matter what the Red Cat cultivated, Li Xuan could know and control it through the Great Demonic Sovereign.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat lying on the ground suddenly shook, and several images of the Red Cat appeared around it! These images were indistinguishable from the real one.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of nine Red Cat images, with only one being the true body! Moreover, the illusions and the true body could switch positions freely in an instant.</p><p></p><p>This was a true great demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>"The Red Cat's great demonic talent is not bad at all, no wonder it wants to become the Demonic King of Culture."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pleased in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan's guidance, the Red Cat had tried to inscribe formations in its acupoints, but failed. However, it had managed to cultivate this great dao technique.</p><p></p><p>This great demonic technique was somewhat related to the Bewildering Reversal Formation.</p><p></p><p>"Master, have you raised nine cats?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly seeing nine identical cats running in the courtyard, he couldn't help but be curious.</p><p></p><p>"Look carefully."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao focused his gaze on the nine running Red Cats, and after a while, frowned and said, "Only one is real, the other eight are fakes!"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, although he understood the reason, he could not distinguish which one was the true body.</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward, and the Heaven and Earth Odd Doors Formation was deployed, instantly enveloping the nine Red Cats. Within the formation, Fang Hao finally discovered which one was the true one.</p><p></p><p>However, just as he was delighted, he suddenly found that the one he had identified as the true one had become a fake, while the one he had thought was fake had become the true one.</p><p></p><p>The true and the false kept switching and changing positions.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his expression became serious.</p><p></p><p>He realized the extraordinary nature of the Red Cat's great demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>Withdrawing the Heaven and Earth Odd Doors Formation, Fang Hao pondered, feeling that he could set up a similar formation to confuse the Cultivated Celestials.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was very excited, finally having comprehended its own great demonic technique. From now on, it would not just be a brute force great demon.</p><p></p><p>It ran in front of Li Xuan and squatted down, blinking its eyes in a cute manner.</p><p></p><p>Its claws wrote on the ground: "Master, I want the formation diagram!"</p><p></p><p>It had realized the profundity of formations, and although it could not comprehend them, it could copy them by drawing the formation patterns into its acupoints, just like how it had intuitively cultivated this great demonic technique.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Li Xuan drew several formation diagrams on the ground where the Red Cat had been lying.</p><p></p><p>One of them was a teleportation formation.</p><p></p><p>"Go ahead and ponder on it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded excitedly and then ran to Su Lingxiu to act cute and ask for more medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>After getting the medicinal pills from Su Lingxiu, it went to find Little Ha and asked it to offer the medicinal pills to itself as the great king!</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the initial stage of the Divine Meaning Realm, and you have reached the initial stage of the Jade Deity Realm."</p><p></p><p>The Dao Golden Book opened and provided the feedback.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had finally broken through to the initial stage of the Divine Meaning Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Initial stage of the Divine Meaning Realm, the Mountain and River Sword Formation, the Xun Extinguishing Sword, with Xu Yan's current strength, he should be able to kill ordinary Cultivated Celestials without any problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought contentedly.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Deity Sect and the Shu Family were currently searching for Xu Yan and Meng Chong throughout the entire Jade State.</p><p></p><p>After such a long time, they had not found any trace of the two, and they were probably becoming anxious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to a minor realm, and although Meng Chong had not broken through, his strength was also continuously increasing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thick mist enveloped the manor, obscuring everything.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu were all startled, as they found that they had lost their sense of direction.</p><p></p><p>Even though they were very familiar with the manor and could walk around with their eyes closed, under the cover of the thick mist, they were completely disoriented.</p><p></p><p>The sensing abilities of the martial artists were also affected, and they could not even detect the movements nearby.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu stopped refining the medicinal pills and watched as Fang Hao was setting up a formation.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, Fang Hao was scratching his head, as there seemed to be some problems with the formation. The formation should have affected the outside, but it had ended up affecting the formation setter as well.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the formation should be under control, affecting some people but not others.</p><p></p><p>He frowned and pondered for a while, continuing to adjust the formation.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a fierce wind arose in the mist, whipping up raging flames. In an instant, the manor was about to be engulfed by the phoenix fire.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed, and with a stomp of his foot, a powerful force of heaven and earth appeared, shielding the manor and everyone in it, while also redirecting the phoenix fire.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was flustered, but after much effort, he finally solved the problem with the formation.</p><p></p><p>"It's the first time I've set up such a large formation, and I'm a bit inexperienced. Luckily, my master intervened in time!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's chubby face showed an embarrassed expression.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I was going to die just now!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er wiped the cold sweat from his forehead.</p><p></p><p>The terrifying phoenix fire had almost swept over him, and with his current strength, he would have been unable to resist it.</p><p></p><p>"I'm sorry, it won't happen again. I've gained experience now!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao apologized sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Then, his expression became serious, and he continued to set up the formation, occasionally pausing to refine the necessary formation tools.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the formation was complete.</p><p></p><p>However, after walking around, Fang Hao found the formation to be a bit crude, so he summarized his experience and reforged all the formation tools.</p><p></p><p>The second time he set up the formation, it was completed quickly.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, it's done!"</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the manor was as it had been before, as if it had not been enveloped by the formation.</p><p></p><p>However, if one were to look from outside the manor, the manor would have disappeared, as if this place did not exist at all.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have set up two formations in the manor: the Illusion Confusing Spirit Formation and the Phoenix Fire Deadly Formation. I'm confident that even Cultivated Celestials won't be able to detect the flaws.</p><p></p><p>"Although they may not be able to kill Cultivated Celestials, they should be able to trap them for about half an hour."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

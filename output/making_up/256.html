        <h1>Chapter 256</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Fang Hao has refined a communication talisman, and you have obtained the Forging Compendium."</p><p></p><p>The Forging Compendium recorded many forging materials and techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Formation, forging, and restrictions, you have almost mastered them all."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>With his current mastery of the martial dao, he was truly one-of-a-kind.</p><p></p><p>"This communication talisman of yours is a bit crude, and its transmission range is also limited," said Li Xuan after examining the communication talisman in Fang Hao's hand.</p><p></p><p>He then pointed out how to refine it and how to enhance the transmission range. </p><p></p><p>Of course, given Fang Hao's current abilities, the transmission distance of the refined communication talisman would still be limited to a certain extent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Su Lingxiu gathered around, curious to see the communication talisman that Fang Hao had successfully refined.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the communication talisman?" </p><p></p><p>Writing in one talisman would display the content on the other, truly a wondrous thing.</p><p></p><p>"How far can it transmit?" asked Meng Chong curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know yet. I'll go to the capital of the Zheng Kingdom and test its effectiveness," Fang Hao replied.</p><p></p><p>He also wondered if the Young Master Shen had come to find him and taken the Spring Night Mirror he had left behind.</p><p></p><p>"Besides the distance, another issue is how to transmit to multiple people. That's also a problem to solve," Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded, "I'll figure that out. I'll go to the capital of the Zheng Kingdom and test the transmission back here."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had not exposed himself in the assassinations of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su Family Refining Celestials, and no one knew he was the junior disciple of Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Since he had grown up in the Zheng Kingdom, he didn't need to worry about being targeted by the Jade Spirit Sect or the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>After leaving the manor, Fang Hao set out for the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, not flying but walking through the mountains, transmitting along the way and chatting with his senior martial siblings in the manor.</p><p></p><p>The communication talisman was undoubtedly a novel thing, so they were all very excited, taking turns writing in the talisman to stay in touch with Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was walking briskly, already over 20 li away from the manor, but the transmission was still uninterrupted, the distance exceeding 20 li.</p><p></p><p>"Hundreds of li, even thousands of li should be fine, but maybe not tens of thousands," Fang Hao evaluated in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed drastically. </p><p></p><p>He quickly dodged to the side as a figure came crashing down from the sky.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zongzhu's face was deathly pale, bloodless, his breathing erratic, and he even seemed thinner.</p><p></p><p>He ultimately couldn't make it to the capital of the Zheng Kingdom, losing control and falling.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect... Zhu Liang, that damned thing!" Yu Zongzhu was resentful, feeling like the most unlucky person.</p><p></p><p>He had just been thinking about how to protect Xu Yan and Meng Chong, but they had hidden themselves well, and the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su Family had searched all over the Jade State without finding them. </p><p></p><p>Instead, the Myriad Generations Alliance had been exposed, and he had been exposed as well, and now he was being hunted.</p><p></p><p>"This time I'm done for!" Yu Zongzhu thought bitterly.</p><p></p><p>Lying weakly on the ground, he let out a wry smile, feeling like he had been utterly betrayed by Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"If you two are the geniuses of the Myriad Generations Alliance, then I've really been taken advantage of!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Zongzhu was extremely frustrated.</p><p></p><p>If they weren't the geniuses of the Myriad Generations Alliance, then he could only blame his own bad luck!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned at the moment.</p><p></p><p>A Refining Celestial, severely injured, had crashed to the ground. </p><p></p><p>And it seemed he was being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect? Judging from his attire, he was a wandering cultivator? "Zhu Liang?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was shocked. Wasn't this the Grand Elder of the Jade Spirit Sect, the number one expert of the Jade State? </p><p></p><p>This person had been chased by Zhu Liang and managed to escape?</p><p></p><p>"Senior martial siblings, a Refining Celestial has fallen from the sky, seemingly being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect and severely injured. Should we rescue him?" Fang Hao quickly transmitted.</p><p></p><p>According to his thinking, the enemy's enemy, although not necessarily a friend, rescuing him would annoy the enemy, which would be a pleasant thing.</p><p></p><p>"Bring him back, but be careful," the message came back on the talisman.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a deep breath and walked over, saying, "Senior, I can take you to a place where you can hide."</p><p></p><p>Yu Zongzhu looked at Fang Hao and smiled bitterly, "Young brother, it will only bring you trouble. I'm too severely injured, almost crippled, so there's no need to take the risk."</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, it won't trouble me. The Jade Spirit Sect is also my enemy," Fang Hao said, grabbing Yu Zongzhu and quickly returning to the manor.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zongzhu was too severely injured, and Fang Hao hadn't noticed it earlier.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, upon hearing the news, quickly left the manor, worried that Fang Hao might be in danger.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm, you're only in the initial stage of Refining Celestial?" Xu Yan asked, puzzled, as he looked at Yu Zongzhu.</p><p></p><p>Although Yu Zongzhu's injuries were severe, and he seemed to have used a damaging martial art secret technique, causing such grievous harm, in the Spirit Realm, this level of injury was almost irreparable.</p><p></p><p>However, in Su Lingxiu's eyes, this injury was nothing.</p><p></p><p>A single medicinal pill would restore him almost completely.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zongzhu, hearing the voice, mustered the strength to lift his head and look at the speaker.</p><p></p><p>His eyes immediately widened in disbelief, and he raised his hand to wipe the blood off his eyelids, shocked, "Xu Yan?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was no longer surprised by this. The Jade Spirit Sect and the Su Family were pursuing him, and he hadn't hidden his face, so it was not strange that Yu Zongzhu recognized him.</p><p></p><p>"It's me. What do you have to say?" Xu Yan said as they returned to the manor.</p><p></p><p>"You've been hiding here? You've really caused me a lot of trouble!" Yu Zongzhu looked around the manor, completely dumbfounded, almost coughing up a mouthful of blood. This was such a large manor, and the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su Family were all blind, unable to find Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"How have I caused you trouble?" Xu Yan asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Don't you dare frame me! Anyone who tries to frame me will be utterly destroyed!" Xu Yan warned.</p><p></p><p>If this person didn't have a feud with the Jade Spirit Sect, he wouldn't have even rescued him.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao placed Yu Zongzhu down, and Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, and the others gathered around, curious to see the severely injured person who was not even in the initial stage of Refining Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat and his two subordinates also came over, staring wide-eyed at Yu Zongzhu, curiously raising a paw to poke at his head.</p><p></p><p>Yu Zongzhu: ...</p><p></p><p>Looking at the group of people surrounding him, and the burly bald youth who was most likely Meng Chong, he realized that these two had been hiding in this manor all along, and the Jade Spirit Sect and the Su Family were all idiots, unable to find them?</p><p></p><p>"Cough, cough..." Yu Zongzhu coughed, blood flowing from the corners of his mouth, utterly miserable.</p><p></p><p>"Zhu Liang is pursuing me, and he'll be here soon. You'd better hide, or else you'll be discovered and won't be able to escape," Yu Zongzhu said with a deep breath.</p><p></p><p>"You don't need to worry about that. Just tell me, how have I caused you trouble?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had an unfriendly expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu had a gloomy and bitter smile on his face. "The Yushen Sect and the Su family have been searching for you and Meng Chong in Yuzhou, but they couldn't find you two. Instead, we were exposed."</p><p></p><p>I see!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at him sympathetically and said, "Do you have a feud with the Yushen Sect and the Su family?"</p><p></p><p>The enemy's enemy is not necessarily a friend, but you can use the enemy's enemy to annoy the enemy, which is also a very happy thing.</p><p></p><p>"It's not that we have a feud, it's just that the Lingzong and the aristocratic families can't tolerate us."</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu struggled to sit up.</p><p></p><p>His own injuries were severe, basically half-disabled, and the decline in strength was an inevitable result.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how so?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu was silent for a moment, then solemnly said, "To be honest, I am the Yuzhou branch leader of the Wanshi Alliance, and the Wanshi Alliance is composed of scattered cultivators, with the purpose of fighting for a place for the scattered cultivators in the Lingyu!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was surprised, "You are the leader of the Wanshi Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"You know the Wanshi Alliance?" Yu Mengzhu's eyes widened.</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance has not yet emerged, it is in a dormant stage, accumulating strength, waiting for the right moment to rise up and fight for a place among the Lingzong and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>This time, the Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance was exposed, but the Yushen Sect and the Su family did not know the name of the Wanshi Alliance, thinking it was just a secretly developing force of scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan actually knew about the Wanshi Alliance. Could it be that he and Meng Chong are the geniuses cultivated by the Wanshi Alliance?</p><p></p><p>"I know!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong was a member of the Wanshi Alliance, and in the Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance, he belonged to the geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu coughed up blood, feeling like he had been cheated.</p><p></p><p>He stared wide-eyed at the others, could they all be members of the Wanshi Alliance?</p><p></p><p>Damn it! He was the Yuzhou branch leader, and so many members of the alliance came, but he didn't know anything about it?</p><p></p><p>"You're so fragile, just a little injury and you're like this." Suling Xiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>This person, after all, was a Liangshen Tianren, how could he be so fragile?</p><p></p><p>"A little injury?" Yu Mengzhu coughed up blood again.</p><p></p><p>I burned my essence blood and used secret martial arts to escape, with huge consumption and damage to my foundation. Is this just a small injury?</p><p></p><p>"Of course!" Suling Xiu nodded and looked at Xu Yan, "Big Brother, do you want to heal him?"</p><p></p><p>"Heal him." Xu Yan thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Since he is the leader of the Wanshi Alliance and has a feud with the Yushen Sect and the Su family, whether it is to annoy the enemy or for Wen Yong's sake, he should heal him.</p><p></p><p>It's just a matter of a pill or two.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu waved her hand, and golden needles scattered and pierced into Yu Mengzhu's body, and a stream of long-life true essence flowed into the golden needles, instantly repairing Yu Mengzhu's broken and damaged meridians.</p><p></p><p>Then she took out a jade bottle and a pill flew into Yu Mengzhu's mouth.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, just rest for a few days, and you'll be as good as new."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu was shocked. He felt that his damaged foundation had been repaired, and the consumed essence blood was recovering.</p><p></p><p>In a short time, his injuries had recovered by five or six tenths.</p><p></p><p>"What... what kind of divine medicine is this?" He was too shocked to speak.</p><p></p><p>"Just ordinary blood-replenishing and body-strengthening pills, made with second or third-grade spirit herbs. Not some divine medicine." Suling Xiu waved her hand, and the golden needles flew back.</p><p></p><p>She turned and left, her curiosity about Yu Mengzhu ended.</p><p></p><p>"Meow meow!" The red cat followed her, begging for pills.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong scratched his head and also turned and left, continuing to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>The matter of Yu Mengzhu was left to the Big Brother to handle.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu Shu three people also turned and left, but it was Fang Hao who was very interested in the Wanshi Alliance.</p><p></p><p>After all, he was a person from the Lingyu, and he came from the scattered cultivators, with ambitions. Since the Wanshi Alliance was going to fight for a place for the scattered cultivators, he became interested.</p><p></p><p>"You are the Wanshi Alliance leader, right? Tell me about the Wanshi Alliance, how are you going to fight for a place among the Lingzong and aristocratic families?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao squatted in front of Yu Mengzhu, asking curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Aren't you a member of the Wanshi Alliance?" Yu Mengzhu was taken aback.</p><p></p><p>"Of course not!" Fang Hao shook his head, puzzled, "Why do you think we are members of the Wanshi Alliance?"</p><p></p><p>"Then why does Xu Yan know about the Wanshi Alliance?" Yu Mengzhu was shocked.</p><p></p><p>When did the Wanshi Alliance's secrets leak out?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't explain, after all, it was Wen Yong who told him. If he said it out loud, Wen Yong would be revealing the Wanshi Alliance's secrets, and wouldn't he be punished?</p><p></p><p>"Although I know about the Wanshi Alliance, I'm not a member of it." Xu Yan shook his head, letting Fang Hao talk to Yu Mengzhu by himself. He turned and left, and after Yu Mengzhu's injuries healed, he would come back to discuss how to deal with the Yushen Sect and the Su family.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's his strength?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu was not a Liangshen Tianren in the initial stage, but due to his severe injuries, his aura had declined, so Xu Yan couldn't determine whether he was a Liangshen Tianren in the middle stage or the late stage.</p><p></p><p>"Late-stage Liangshen Tianren, just a bit weak in strength." Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>Yu Mengzhu, a late-stage Liangshen Tianren cultivator, was just too weak in strength.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan and Meng Chong at their current stage were absolutely not his opponents.</p><p></p><p>However, in Li Xuan's eyes, he was still a small grasshopper that could be easily crushed.</p><p></p><p>"Late-stage, the Wanshi Alliance has some ability!" Xu Yan thought. The only late-stage Liangshen Tianren in Yuzhou was the Grand Elder Zhu Liang of the Yushen Sect, and Yu Mengzhu was also at this realm.</p><p></p><p>The leader of a branch alliance, on par with the strongest in a state, shows the strength of the Wanshi Alliance, not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his disciple and pondered for a moment, then said, "If you want to control people and use them, you can work on their divine souls, refine restrictive formations with divine will and seal them in their divine souls, so that their life and death will be in your hands."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was startled, and after thinking about it, he said, "Yu Mengzhu seems to be quite righteous. I don't want to use such methods on him."</p><p></p><p>"Stick to your principles, don't be narrow-minded." Li Xuan nodded. He just told Xu Yan these secret techniques so that he could comprehend how to control people.</p><p></p><p>As for Yu Mengzhu, he was indeed not bad. Just now, he had even reminded Xu Yan to escape quickly, as Zhu Liang was coming to chase them.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Yu Mengzhu was explaining the Wanshi Alliance to Fang Hao, its aspirations, ideals, and goals - to fight for a place for the scattered cultivators, to make the Lingyu more fair, and to break the hierarchy! The dream was grand, whether it could succeed was unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, Fang Hao listened with his blood boiling, having a strong intention to join the Wanshi Alliance, and also asked what rules and restrictions the Wanshi Alliance had.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not opposed to this. His disciple having ambitions was a good thing. Entering the Wanshi Alliance would inevitably lead to conflicts with the Lingzong and aristocratic families, even the geniuses within the alliance.</p><p></p><p>This would be beneficial to Fang Hao's rise and the display of his extraordinary martial arts.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 290</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Fankai Shan, who was eager and full of anticipation, and directly turned around and left.</p><p></p><p>To challenge a warrior who had refined the spiritual mechanism of heaven and earth, he was not that foolish.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, he was absolutely no match for Fankai Shan.</p><p></p><p>Unless, he broke through to the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"You're not going to continue attacking?" </p><p></p><p>Fankai Shan was somewhat surprised.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped in his tracks, pondered for a moment, "I am the peak of the Spiritual Domain prodigies, the rest of the prodigies should bow their heads before me. I, Xu Yan, have come here to challenge the Spiritual Domain prodigies, to defeat all the Spiritual Domain prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"I'm not here to challenge an old guy. Your strength is strong, but at your age, with just this little bit of strength, you are not worth my challenge.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Seclusion Sect Master cultivates the Sword Dao, I've only made a move or two, you are not a Sword Dao warrior, not worth my effort!"</p><p></p><p>Fankai Shan's face alternated between blue and red, a surge of anger accumulated in his chest. He, the mighty supreme expert, was actually despised by this young upstart? What was this "at your age, with just this little bit of strength"? "You brat, are you despising me?"</p><p></p><p>Fankai Shan angrily roared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was an honest person, he nodded his head and directly admitted it.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, I do despise you a bit, after all, at your age, with just this little bit of strength, if I were your age, I would have long since transcended heaven and earth!"</p><p></p><p>The other warriors: ......</p><p></p><p>Fankai Shan was so angry that his eyes turned red, panting heavily, and Chang Daniu also felt that he had been offended.</p><p></p><p>His strength was similar to Fankai Shan's, and their ages were also similar. If Xu Yan despised Fankai Shan, wouldn't he also be able to despise himself?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't be bothered to reason with him, his figure flashed and he left. His next target was the Spiritual Domain prodigy Cai Yunhong of the Cyan Cloud Empire, time was pressing, he was busy accumulating his foundation and breaking through the realm.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you going!"</p><p></p><p>Fankai Shan was furious, about to chase after him.</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu moved, sneering, "What, the old waste wants to bully the young? Although he is not a prodigy of our Myriad Ages Alliance, he is still a wandering cultivator prodigy. Do you want to violate the rules of the prodigy competition?"</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Fankai Shan snorted coldly and left.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, you brat, you are too arrogant! I can't attack you openly, but I can attack you behind your back. As long as no one knows, it won't be considered a violation of the rules! Xu Yan officially embarked on the path of challenging the Spiritual Domain prodigies, walking his own invincible path.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong, he had also arrived at the territory of the Three Transcendents Tower.</p><p></p><p>The Three Transcendents Tower was not in Luo State, but in Li State.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Ages Alliance in Li State was not weak in strength, and it did not lag too far behind the Spiritual Sect in confrontation. They also had a few prodigies.</p><p></p><p>However, they were still slightly inferior to the Spiritual Sect prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Da Xuan City, the first largest city in Li State, was a city jointly governed by the major Spiritual Sects in Li State.</p><p></p><p>And the headquarters of the Li State Myriad Ages Alliance was also in Da Xuan City, occupying the southern city area, facing off against the major Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>The prodigy competition in Li State was much more lively than in Luo State, with more participants as well.</p><p></p><p>In the center of Da Xuan City, on a martial arena, two young men were engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>One was a wandering cultivator, the other was a disciple of a certain Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>The two who were fighting were both at the peak of the Great Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>At an age under thirty, to have such strength, they could also be considered prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not the top prodigies, they had already entered the ranks of the prodigies.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The wandering cultivator youth was blasted back by a punch, vomiting blood, with several bones broken, and was sent flying.</p><p></p><p>"I admit defeat!"</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly spoke up to admit defeat.</p><p></p><p>The prodigy competition in Li State was certainly fierce, but it was not necessary to fight to the death. As long as one party admitted defeat, the battle would stop there.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this only applied to the prodigies outside of the Myriad Ages Alliance and the top Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>The battles between the prodigies were not just between wandering cultivators and Spiritual Sect prodigies, the battles between the Spiritual Sect families' prodigies were also not few in number.</p><p></p><p>To climb to the top of the prodigy rankings, to obtain the rewards of the prodigy competition, the real opponents were the prodigies of the Spiritual Sect families, after all, the wandering cultivator prodigies were still in the minority.</p><p></p><p>Most of the strength also tended to be weaker than the prodigies of the Spiritual Sects and families.</p><p></p><p>The wandering cultivators were inferior to the Spiritual Sects in terms of cultivation techniques, martial arts experience, weapons, and so on. Although the Myriad Ages Alliance was composed of wandering cultivators, it could no longer be regarded as ordinary wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Domain's eighteen states, except for Yu State and Luo State, the rest were very lively, with the prodigy competition in full swing. The prodigies were all eager to make a name for themselves, for the rewards of the prodigy competition, and to obtain more cultivation resources and higher-level cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for the confrontation between the Myriad Ages Alliance and the Spiritual Sects, this was not something that ordinary prodigies could participate in. The final victory or defeat would be determined by the supreme Spiritual Sects and the Myriad Ages Alliance.</p><p></p><p>And the battle between the two sides was still far away.</p><p></p><p>This prodigy competition was the largest martial arts event in the Spiritual Domain since the retreat of the Myriad Stars Martial Academy from the eighteen states after the Blood Demon Calamity.</p><p></p><p>The major Spiritual Sects and families had invested resources in the prodigies, in order to seize good reputations and obtain higher rankings, as this was also related to the distribution of resources and discourse power.</p><p></p><p>Even if the Myriad Ages Alliance had not suddenly emerged, in a few years, the martial competitions of the Spiritual Sect families would also begin. The current prodigy competition was just an early start, and had included the Myriad Ages Alliance and all the wandering cultivators in the world.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hurried to Da Xuan City, looking at the two who were fighting on the martial arena. Although they had the strength of the Refining Spirit initial stage, their realms were unstable, their strength too weak.</p><p></p><p>Apparently, they were the recent breakthroughs of their respective forces, forcibly breaking through the Refining Spirit Celestial initial stage, and thus their realms were not refined enough.</p><p></p><p>Of course, they were also taking the opportunity in the prodigy competition to completely consolidate their own realms.</p><p></p><p>These so-called prodigies were naturally not in Meng Chong's eyes, his targets were Wupu, the prodigy of the Three Transcendents Tower, and secondly, Bao Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if Lu Yi also took the field, Meng Chong would likewise challenge him. This trip to the Spiritual Domain was to challenge the various prodigies.</p><p></p><p>"Accumulating martial dao foundation through battle, this method should be quite effective, after all, warriors ultimately need to grow in battle, through confronting various martial arts, to more easily comprehend the true essence of the Martial Dao, and gain martial dao accumulation from it."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The method of the senior brother was naturally not wrong.</p><p></p><p>His first Indestructible Golden Body was almost complete, lacking just a bit more. But he believed that after a series of battles, he would definitely be able to quickly accumulate the foundation and break through to completion.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he could also cultivate the Heaven Hammer Hundred Temperings Technique by using the opponents' attacks, to enhance the advancement speed of the Indestructible Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>The battle on the martial arena had just ended, both sides were somewhat injured, neither gaining the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a cold light descended from the sky.</p><p></p><p>A sword stood upright on the martial arena, the sword light reflecting all around, a figure descended from the sky, stepping on the upright sword hilt.</p><p></p><p>"Wupu has arrived!"</p><p></p><p>"This time, which prodigy from the Li State Alliance will challenge him?"</p><p></p><p>"Probably no one, right? No one challenged him yesterday either, the wandering cultivators are just too weak compared to him. Wupu cultivates the Sword Dao of the Three Transcendents Tower, after all."</p><p></p><p>"The Three Transcendents Tower is a subordinate of the Thousand Blades Palace, with Wupu's talent and strength, he has the hope of entering the Thousand Blades Palace in the future, how can the wandering cultivators compare?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists were discussing animatedly.</p><p></p><p>Wutu, the genius of the Three Extremes Tower.</p><p></p><p>Wutu stood arrogantly on the hilt of the blade, looking towards the Lianzhou Alliance with a cold sneer, saying, "What, no one dares to challenge me today? Just admit defeat and get out of Daxuan City."</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the Lianzhou Alliance had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go challenge him!"</p><p></p><p>A young man, filled with anger, wielding a long saber, was about to go up and challenge, even if he was no match, he could not be a coward and refuse the challenge!</p><p></p><p>But before he could even step onto the stage, a burly figure suddenly appeared in the crowd and instantly reached the arena.</p><p></p><p>"He's going to challenge Wutu? Seeking death?"</p><p></p><p>The watching martial artists were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>This bald youth, a wandering cultivator, actually dared to challenge Wutu?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong directly stepped onto the stage.</p><p></p><p>Daxuan City had many martial artists and geniuses, and he suddenly thought of a brilliant method, no need to run around everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Directly in Daxuan City, issue a challenge to all the Lingzong geniuses!</p><p></p><p>Wutu's expression turned cold, this ignorant wandering cultivator! "You want to challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>He sneered coldly, murderous intent surging.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Wutu's figure soared, raising his hand in a gesture, gripping the saber in his hand, he coldly said, "Whoever challenges me, Wutu, without admitting defeat, either I die or the challenger dies!</p><p></p><p>"Do you still want to challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong paused, scratched his head, and asked in surprise, "You want to die?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists: ...</p><p></p><p>This bald youth, does he not understand words? Wutu almost died of anger, roaring, "It's you who wants to die! Since you want to die, I'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong held the saber in his hand, patting his head, said, "Although you are a cultivator of the Three Extremes Tower under the Thousand Blades Palace, we have no enmity between us. In this arena battle, to decide life and death, isn't it a bit too direct?"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of Daxuan City were competing, and since they didn't have to decide life and death, he didn't have the intention to kill someone.</p><p></p><p>However, this Wutu seemed to be tired of living, so he might as well oblige him.</p><p></p><p>"If you're afraid of death, then scram!" Wutu roared.</p><p></p><p>"Since you insist on seeking death, then I can only oblige you!" Meng Chong's expression turned serious as he looked towards the arena, the Lingzong and the Wanshi Alliance, and asked in a deep voice, "If I were to scatter his ashes, would I be violating the rules?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists: ...</p><p></p><p>From the start, he wanted to scatter Wutu's ashes, this bald youth, is he that ruthless?</p><p></p><p>"It won't violate the rules, there's no rule saying you have to leave the enemy's body intact," the Lianzhou Alliance leader said with a twitching mouth.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Extremes Tower also had a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Wutu almost exploded with anger, gritting his teeth, "I'll tear you to pieces!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his saber, ready to strike fiercely, but Meng Chong waved his hand, "Wait a moment."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any last words? Hurry up and say them!" Wutu said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was solemn, holding the saber in his hand, he said in a deep voice, "I haven't even introduced myself yet, I can't let you die without knowing who killed you, right?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artists: ...</p><p></p><p>Wutu's eyes were already red, and the saber in his hand radiated fierce saber aura, a powerful aura surging from him.</p><p></p><p>Even on his head, a saber-shaped ripple appeared.</p><p></p><p>"My elder brother is the Sword Deity, the God of the Sword Dao, I cultivate the Dao of the Saber, the supreme saber in the world, the title of Saber Perfection is a bit lacking, so I shall be called the Saber Sovereign!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Meng Chong held the saber and cupped his hands in salute, turning around in a circle, solemnly declaring, "I am the Saber Sovereign Meng Chong, the supreme master of the Saber Dao in the world, that is me!"</p><p></p><p>All the martial artists were dumbfounded, where did this wandering cultivator come from, so arrogant, the supreme master of the Saber Dao in the world? And he said it right in front of Wutu.</p><p></p><p>After all, one of the Three Extremes of the Three Extremes Tower was the Dao of the Saber!</p><p></p><p>The Number One Saber of Lianzhou has always belonged to the Three Extremes Tower.</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant wretch, die!" Wutu erupted in fury, striking out with a powerful saber strike, tyrannical and unmatched.</p><p></p><p>Ding! Meng Chong struck out with a saber, light and swift, instantly breaking through Wutu's attack.</p><p></p><p>Wutu's expression immediately turned grave, with a single strike, he could tell that this was no ordinary person. He dared not be careless or underestimate him, unleashing his saber techniques to their fullest.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong held the saber in his hand, not using the Indestructible Divine Armor, nor the Saber Dao, but simply fighting Wutu with saber techniques alone.</p><p></p><p>The saber qi surged, tyrannical and unmatched, valiant and unparalleled.</p><p></p><p>"This bald youth's strength is so powerful!" The watching martial artists couldn't help but be amazed.</p><p></p><p>The powerful figures of the Three Extremes Tower also had solemn expressions, the saber techniques of the bald youth were extremely exquisite, with varied changes, sometimes tyrannical, sometimes like a raging wind, and sometimes light and gentle like a breeze.</p><p></p><p>The saber techniques had reached a realm of perfection!</p><p></p><p>Wutu gradually became more serious, even shocked, a mere wandering cultivator, the Dao of the Saber was so profound, truly unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>The person behind him must be a supreme master of the Saber Dao!</p><p></p><p>"You are worthy of me, Wutu, taking this seriously!" Wutu said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>He struck out with a saber, the saber light instantly unfurling, rippling and dazzling, with a sense of elegance.</p><p></p><p>It lacked the tyrannical and unmatched aura, nor the valiant ferocity, but was instead gentle like ripples, the saber light rippling and unending, yet the killing intent was exceptionally sharp.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was solemn, Wutu's Dao of the Saber still had its merits.</p><p></p><p>He continued unhurriedly, striking saber after saber, each one simple, yet always striking at the vulnerable points of Wutu's saber light, the killing intent sharp as he neutralized the attacks.</p><p></p><p>Wutu became more and more alarmed, the saber technique he was now using was the strongest of the Three Extremes Tower, and even in the Thousand Blades Palace, this saber technique would rank among the top ten.</p><p></p><p>Yet, in Meng Chong's eyes, it seemed to be full of openings, easily neutralizing the sharp killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The saber qi suddenly became more violent.</p><p></p><p>Wutu let out a low roar, his saber technique changing, like a raging storm, attacking fiercely, almost frenzied, the entire arena was covered in saber qi.</p><p></p><p>And within the saber qi, there were hidden rippling saber lights, the killing intent even deeper and more dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression was neither sad nor happy, strands of saber qi entering his body, even the saber lights slashing at him, but he remained unfazed, activating the Heaven Hammer Forged a Hundred Times technique.</p><p></p><p>A saber strike broke through Wutu's attack, opening a gap, further forcing Wutu to desperately unleash even stronger attacks!</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Three Extremes Tower suddenly stood up, his expression extremely gloomy, could it be that Wutu was losing?</p><p></p><p>This was impossible!</p><p></p><p>But the reality was just that, Wutu was already in a near-frenzied state, this was him unleashing his strongest saber technique, pushing his cultivation to the limit.</p><p></p><p>In contrast, Meng Chong remained calm and composed, seemingly having one saber qi after another slash at him, one saber light after another striking him.</p><p></p><p>Yet, the truly sharp and deadly attacks were all skillfully neutralized by him, the remaining attacks unable to harm him in the slightest!</p><p></p><p>The superiority was clear!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 110: Awakening of the Sword Soul, Tyrannical Sword Intent</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nurtured the treasured sword with his qi, blood, and spiritual essence every day. The sword resonated with his heart, and his intent merged with it. When faced with a life-and-death crisis, the time had finally come to draw the sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword emerged, and the sword soul awakened. The sword intent shook the four corners of the world.</p><p></p><p>The sword light seemed to tear the heavens and earth apart, tyrannical and unparalleled, unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>On the city tower of the Wu capital, the onlooking Wu Emperor and his people could only see that one sword light. Even from afar, it exuded an aura of dominating the world.</p><p></p><p>Their hearts were gripped as if by a hand, their breathing stagnant, eyes wide open, and expressions filled with shock.</p><p></p><p>The unparalleled sword light, the tyrannical sword intent, shattered the pressure exerted by the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch and pierced his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible? What kind of sword technique is this?" the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch exclaimed in horror.</p><p></p><p>He tried to block Meng Chong's strike with his own sword.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to flee and evade, but it was all in vain!</p><p></p><p>With a single slash, the world seemed to lose its color. The unparalleled sword intent instantly struck the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>The serrated sword was blown away.</p><p></p><p>The body of the senior from the Wu Clan was cleaved in two.</p><p></p><p>The blood spirit worm was also severed into two halves, each part residing in the two halves of the corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, impossible! What power is this? How can he kill me? He's not even a Sect Master, yet I am a Cultivated Celestial..." the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch exclaimed in horror.</p><p></p><p>His consciousness was filled with unwillingness and disbelief.</p><p></p><p>He had thought that this young man would be the cornerstone of his resurgence, that the heavens would not abandon him, the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Yet, he was going to die here completely!</p><p></p><p>He was unwilling, utterly unwilling!</p><p></p><p>In the past, when many powerful experts had surrounded and attacked him, he had still managed to cling to life and wait for the opportunity to make a comeback.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he was going to die completely in this remote wilderness?</p><p></p><p>Thump! Thump! Thump!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart was pounding violently, and there was a wound on his chest. The bleeding had already slowed, but it would still take a few days of rest to fully heal.</p><p></p><p>This battle had almost cost him his life!</p><p></p><p>At the last moment, the sword nurturing succeeded, and he drew the sword to strike!</p><p></p><p>The power of the sword he had nurtured for so long was terrifying. Even a Sect Master could be slain with a single stroke!</p><p></p><p>What delighted him even more was that in this critical moment, not only did he draw the sword, but he also awakened the sword soul and comprehended the sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Tyrannical and unparalleled sword intent!</p><p></p><p>Huff! Huff! Huff!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong panted, looking at the treasured sword in his hand. At this moment, he felt the sword's uniqueness, as if it could resonate with him.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that he had imbued this sword with a soul.</p><p></p><p>Even the serrated sword left behind by the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch seemed to be responding to him, drawn by his spiritual awareness.</p><p></p><p>Sword soul!</p><p></p><p>"So this is the awakening of the sword soul?" Meng Chong felt that with the sword soul awakened, there was no sword in the world that would not respond to him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had also comprehended the sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"I have comprehended the sword intent, before even breaking through to the Xiantian Realm. This is a significant gain."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly elated in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Although this battle was extremely perilous, and he had almost died, the harvests were also immense.</p><p></p><p>"My senior brother was right. A warrior must understand combat. Only by fighting can one more easily grasp the true essence of the martial dao."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stepped forward, approaching the severed corpse.</p><p></p><p>His master had taught him that for any enemy, simply cutting off their head was not enough. One must grind the bones and scatter the ashes to ensure their complete destruction and prevent any chance of survival.</p><p></p><p>"This slash of mine dominates the world. My sword dao has now entered the gate, and my sword intent shall be called the Tyrannical Sword Intent, perfectly fitting for me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Gripping the sword, he stepped forward, his body enveloped in golden light, the image of a golden bell covering him, and the sword intent swirling around him. He did not dare to be careless.</p><p></p><p>This senior from the Wu Clan was not quite right.</p><p></p><p>Without even reaching him, the sword had already struck, instantly cleaving one half of the corpse.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong noticed a few silver-white small grasses scattered around the corpse, seemingly pulsing with spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>"Could this be a spiritual herb?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's heart rejoiced. He had heard his junior sister talk about spiritual herbs often, and the medicinal pills refined from them were said to have astounding effects.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, he moved the silver-white grasses aside, cautiously avoiding touching them.</p><p></p><p>He then turned his gaze to the corpse.</p><p></p><p>His eyes gleamed with ruthlessness. He had almost died!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>He unleashed a powerful punch, enveloping the corpse in his blazing qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent also shrouded it.</p><p></p><p>Poof!</p><p></p><p>The corpse was crushed to ashes, incinerated by the scorching aura.</p><p></p><p>Under the coverage of the sword intent, Meng Chong suddenly detected a faint pressure, assaulting his sword intent.</p><p></p><p>He saw the severed worm!</p><p></p><p>It was this mysterious thing that was emanating the pressure!</p><p></p><p>However, the pressure was weak and had been completely suppressed by his sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not dare to be careless. He swiftly brought down his sword.</p><p></p><p>The worm had to be completely destroyed!</p><p></p><p>"Young man, I am..." the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch exclaimed in fury and horror, even though his consciousness was fading, for he had not yet died completely. </p><p></p><p>Perhaps there was still a chance for him to survive, if someone came to collect the corpse in the Wu capital, or if someone came to inspect the battlefield and he could seize their body.</p><p></p><p>Although he could not devour the bait and synchronize with the consciousness, as long as he had not died completely, there was still a slim possibility of a comeback.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not make a comeback, he could at least live for a while longer and pass on his cultivation techniques to someone.</p><p></p><p>In this remote wilderness, he would not be able to cultivate to great heights, but as long as he consumed blood and essence, he could still raise his cultivation to the fifth or sixth rank.</p><p></p><p>Then he could cross the great mountains and return to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>The descendants of the Blood Spirit Sect could still avenge him.</p><p></p><p>But this young man was truly hateful. After killing him, he was still intent on grinding the bones and scattering the ashes!</p><p></p><p>Even though the person had been cleaved in two and was thoroughly dead, he still would not relent!</p><p></p><p>However, Meng Chong did not give him any chance. His eyes gleamed with cold light, deeply impressed by the precious martial experience imparted by his master.</p><p></p><p>If it had been someone else, they might have thought the enemy was dead and simply turned and left.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, fearing the enemy might have some sinister tricks, brought down his sword, the tyrannical sword intent suppressing everything.</p><p></p><p>Poof, the worm was completely crushed.</p><p></p><p>"No..." a faint cry of unwillingness sounded, and then it disappeared without a trace.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong still did not dare to be careless. The sword light swept across the battlefield, the sword intent surging, his blazing qi and blood covering the entire area, crushing everything in its path.</p><p></p><p>Not even a single blade of grass was spared.</p><p></p><p>The corpse was completely reduced to ashes, impossible to find, and the mysterious worm had also met the same fate.</p><p></p><p>In the end, only a few silver-white grasses remained!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong panted, carefully approaching and using the tip of his sword to lift the grasses, examining them closely to ensure there were no issues. He then tore off a piece of his already tattered clothes and wrapped the silver-white grasses in it.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not keep them on his person, instead carrying them on the tip of his sword.</p><p></p><p>After the incident with the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch, Meng Chong had become even more cautious. He glanced at the Wu capital, deciding not to go there, in case there were still powerful enemies lurking.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the serrated sword left behind by the Blood Spirit Sect Patriarch and retrieved it with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>He then...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His body possessed the soul of a blade, and he could sense the state of any blade. This blade had no issues.</p><p></p><p>He still had this confidence.</p><p></p><p>"What a good blade!"</p><p></p><p>The serrated blade looked extraordinary, and perhaps due to its long history and lack of cultivation, it appeared dull. Otherwise, this blade would be stronger than the treasure blade in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I should go back and ask my master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong did not linger any longer and quickly returned, not even having the time to tend to his wounds.</p><p></p><p>"He won!"</p><p>"Meng Chong killed that demon!"</p><p>"Haha, you thought of us as cannon fodder, and now you're dead!"</p><p></p><p>On the city tower of the Wu capital, the Wu Emperor and his ministers were excited.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had won.</p><p></p><p>Immediately after, the Wu Emperor became worried.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, Meng Chong was obviously severely injured and had left directly, so he might suspect that this matter was related to him.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong recovered and came back to kill him, what should he do?</p><p></p><p>"My lords, how do you think we should explain this to Meng Chong?"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor said worriedly.</p><p></p><p>The ministers fell silent, exchanging glances and distancing themselves from the Wu Emperor, pondering how to extricate themselves from this matter.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, please rest assured. Meng Chong is not the type to indulge in killing."</p><p>"Yes, yes, when the time comes, Your Majesty can just explain it to him properly."</p><p></p><p>The ministers laughed awkwardly.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong killed the Wu Emperor in a fit of rage, they could just find another emperor for the Wu Kingdom, as the order to hunt Meng Chong was issued by the Wu Emperor himself.</p><p></p><p>They did not want to be implicated in this.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor left with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan learned from Shi Er that Meng Chong had gone to the Wu capital to deal with the Wu Emperor's formidable enemy. He did not pay much attention to it.</p><p></p><p>With Meng Chong's strength, even if he encountered an ordinary Sect Master, he would not be afraid.</p><p></p><p>Sitting in the chair, he continued to study the ancient parchment. For such a long time, he had been studying the first page, and he seemed to have a vague understanding, but he could not fully comprehend the profundity within.</p><p></p><p>"It's because my realm is too low!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan confirmed that he could not see through the ancient parchment because his realm was too low, and he had not reached the level of understanding required by the martial dao within the parchment.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was refining dan again.</p><p></p><p>This time, she was refining the materials for the Qi Blood Dan that Shi Er had brought.</p><p></p><p>Her refinement of the Qi Blood Dan had become very skilled, and her dan refining art had made tremendous progress.</p><p></p><p>Her comprehension of the Dan Medical Classic was deepening, and she had new insights, believing that Su Lingxiu would grasp the higher-level dan refining techniques from the Dan Medical Classic.</p><p></p><p>"Once this girl enters the martial dao, she can use her qi and blood as the dan fire to refine dan by hand. At that time, her dan refining art can be further improved."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>According to his theory, refining dan by hand was the true dan refining, surpassing the basic dan refining art.</p><p></p><p>Although his realm was high, and he had mastered the basic dan refining art, he did not know how to refine dan by hand.</p><p></p><p>The basic dan refining art required the use of a dan furnace.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was playing with a jade talisman in one hand and studying the ancient parchment with the other when suddenly a golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, in a life-and-death crisis, drew his blade, and his blade soul awakened, reaching its peak."</p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, in a life-and-death crisis, awakened his blade soul and comprehended the supreme Blade Dao. Your supreme Blade Dao has reached its peak!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan abruptly stood up.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong encountered a life-and-death crisis?</p><p></p><p>Where in the Wu Kingdom could there be a life-and-death crisis for him?</p><p></p><p>The ordinary inner realm martial artists could not pose a threat to Meng Chong, so how could the Wu Kingdom pose a threat to him?</p><p></p><p>This made him unable to sit still.</p><p></p><p>If his second disciple encountered an accident, who would cultivate his physical martial dao?</p><p></p><p>Where would he find a disciple with talent comparable to Meng Chong for the physical martial dao?</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after such a long time together, how could there be no affection between master and disciple?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart was filled with shock and worry for Meng Chong's safety. His body instantly disappeared, and he used the Lightning Traversal Void Technique to its fullest extent, rushing towards the Wu capital.</p><p></p><p>The Wu capital was far from Cloud Mountain County, and even with his strength, it would still take some time to arrive, even with the Lightning Traversal Void Technique.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Meng Chong can hold on after awakening his blade soul!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's eyes flashed with a cold light.</p><p></p><p>He soon saw a black dot in the distance, which was the Wu capital!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>He saw Meng Chong, who was now covered in wounds, with a deep injury on his chest. Although his powerful physical recovery had stopped the bleeding, the fresh red flesh could still be seen.</p><p></p><p>It was evident that Meng Chong had experienced an extremely brutal battle.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked. Meng Chong had cultivated the Great Sun Golden Bell Armor, with formidable defense and a powerful physique, yet he had still suffered such severe injuries.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was relieved to see that Meng Chong, although battered and wounded, was not critically injured.</p><p></p><p>He looked around, and there were no enemies pursuing Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Has he already killed the enemy?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered, not going down to meet Meng Chong but continuing forward.</p><p></p><p>Soon, he arrived at the battlefield outside the Wu capital.</p><p></p><p>At the battle site, not a single blade of grass remained, and he could faintly sense the intense aura of blood and the traces of the crushing Blade Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched slightly. The enemy had already been reduced to ashes by Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>"Where did such a powerful martial artist come from?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was now heading back to Cloud Mountain County.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that after the battle and killing the enemy, he had directly returned without entering the Wu capital.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's figure moved, and he began to search the area while in the air.</p><p></p><p>He entered the Wu capital and the Wu palace, thoroughly investigating.</p><p></p><p>His brow slightly furrowed, as he found no trace of any martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that there was only one martial artist?</p><p>And he had already been killed by Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan expanded his search range, thoroughly exploring the Wu capital and the palace, but still found no trace of any martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the formidable enemy was only one.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not linger in the Wu capital and returned to Cloud Mountain County along the same path. Halfway, he saw Meng Chong unharmed, hurrying back, and he finally let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>He returned to the courtyard and sat down on a chair, deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>What kind of enemy had Meng Chong faced?</p><p>Could it be someone from the inner realm?</p><p></p><p>He would have to wait for Meng Chong to return to know the details.</p><p></p><p>"The borderlands seem to be unsafe as well. How did such a powerful martial artist suddenly appear? Their strength has already surpassed that of ordinary Sect Masters, or else they wouldn't have pushed Meng Chong to this extent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned, lost in contemplation.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu curiously glanced at her master. Her master had suddenly disappeared and then returned.</p><p></p><p>She did not ask about her master's affairs, as that was not something a disciple could inquire about.</p><p></p><p>"Just what kind of strength does my master have? He can disappear and reappear so quickly. Even great Sect Masters can't do that, can they?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu sighed.</p><p></p><p>She handed the completed batch of Qi Blood Dan to Shi Er and then happily began refining a new batch of Qi Blood Dan, this time for Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>(End of the chapter)</p>

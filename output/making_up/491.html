        <h1>Chapter 491</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a certain underworld cavern of the divine realm, all the blood children and blood disciples who were originally in the cavern had completely disappeared. They had not retreated from the cavern back to the underworld, but had been blood refined!</p><p></p><p>At the center of the cavern remained a dried-up blood pool, permeating with underworld blood energy. </p><p></p><p>Martial artists who witnessed this scene assumed it was powerful underworld figures slaughtering their subordinates to blood refine and increase their strength, and didn't pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>One by one, underworld caverns were blood refined. Although this attracted the notice of some martial artists, they were merely wary that stronger underworld beings might descend, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>"Boy, how do you find this secret technique of my Blood Extreme Ancestor? With this technique, how can Jiang Buping's soul secret technique gain any advantage?</p><p></p><p>Next, what you need to do is hunt and kill Immortal Heavenly Venerable, extract their immortal blood essence to prepare for breaking through to the Heaven Union realm, as well as forge blood demon weapons from the bones of Immortal Heavenly Venerable..."</p><p></p><p>Blood Extreme's gloomy voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The youth began hunting Immortal Heavenly Venerable, beginning his path of revenge.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The turmoil in the divine realm and the undercurrents could not affect the Qinghua Realm, naturally also not affecting Xu Yan and the others.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to prepare to break through to the Heaven Earth realm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exhaled, his expression excited. The Heaven Earth realm was now in sight.</p><p></p><p>Half a month ago, he had already reached the peak of the Void Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>After consolidating for a bit, he prepared to break through to the Heaven Earth realm in one go before emerging from seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Once entering the Heaven Earth realm, even Divine Lords are not to be feared. When I reach great accomplishment in the Heaven Earth realm, slaying Supreme realm martial artists will be commonplace."</p><p></p><p>Although the Heaven Earth realm was not yet at the very peak of the Cang Heaven and Earth, it was only one step away.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Cang Heaven and Earth, there were not even a hundred Realm Lord level experts.</p><p></p><p>"Once entering Heaven Earth, establishing the Dao is not far off."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited. Those who establish the Dao transcend heaven and earth. His goal of transcending heaven and earth within a hundred years that he had once set was now within reach.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to activate the formation to shield all disturbances from the outside world and enter deep closed-door cultivation,</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, a howl rang out, followed immediately by a series of miserable screams.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned and came out of the closed-door cultivation room. He saw Ao Yuxue holding a stick in her hand, beating a blue flood dragon!</p><p></p><p>"Master, save me!" Yu Xiaolong hurriedly cried for help.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?" Xu Yan asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue smashed Yu Xiaolong's head into the ground with another blow of her stick, angrily saying: "This useless flood dragon actually wants to transform into a true dragon. Doesn't he know what he looks like!"</p><p></p><p>Stone Two walked over and explained: "This guy Yu Xiaolong came back from the Nine Mountains Realm wanting to find you, but you were in closed-door cultivation and he couldn't find you. Unable to resist the thought of transforming into a true dragon, he went to provoke her."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly understood. He looked at Yu Xiaolong and curiously asked: "You can transform into a true dragon? How do you transform?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong excitedly nodded and said: "Of course I can. I'm a flood dragon, and flood dragons can naturally transform into true dragons. I just need true dragon blood and I should be able to transform."</p><p></p><p>"Is that so!" Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ao Yuxue became angry. She swung her stick and knocked Yu Xiaolong to the ground again. Then she reached out a hand to tug at Xu Yan's clothes, timidly saying: "He's a garbage flood dragon. Even if he transforms into a true dragon, he'll just be a garbage true dragon. He can't even take human form. If you bring along a garbage true dragon, it will be embarrassing.</p><p></p><p>You have me, this true dragon, and that's enough. I'm the most excellent among true dragons!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong was beaten dizzy, but he hurriedly spoke up: "Master, if I transform into a true dragon, I'll definitely be more majestic and awe-inspiring. With me as your mount, you'll look more domineering when you go out. Whether I can take human form or not isn't important. The main thing is to look impressive!"</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's dragon might pressed down. Yu Xiaolong immediately went limp on the ground, his whole dragon body softening.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment. It was just true dragon blood after all. If Yu Xiaolong really could transform into a true dragon, it would be a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he cultivated the Great Demon method. After transforming into a true dragon, his strength would definitely increase further.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a few drops of blood. Just give it to Little Dragon." </p><p></p><p>So Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"I won't!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue became stubborn. Seeming to fear that Xu Yan would force her to give blood, she quickly added: "At most I'll make a deal with Sister Su!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was a bit speechless. Ao Yuxue truly had some arrogance in her bones. She would rather make a deal with Su Lingxiu than give Yu Xiaolong a drop of true dragon blood.</p><p></p><p>From this, one could see how unworthy the flood dragon Yu Xiaolong was in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't want to investigate the reasons for this. But since Ao Yuxue was so adamant, he couldn't possibly really hold her down and force her to give blood, could he? Moreover, if he really did that, this girl Ao Yuxue would definitely seek help from his junior sister Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, figure out how to resolve this yourself."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Master, no! It's just one drop of blood!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong wailed.</p><p></p><p>"Shut up!"</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's dragon might pressed down again, suppressing Yu Xiaolong firmly.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Yan couldn't help but click his tongue. Even if a flood dragon was several levels stronger, it would still be suppressed by a true dragon when they met. This showed how strong the bloodline suppression of true dragons was over flood dragons.</p><p></p><p>This was also why Yu Xiaolong was so obsessed with transforming into a true dragon. Even a garbage true dragon was much stronger than a flood dragon. At least it wouldn't be restrained like this.</p><p></p><p>With his cultivation of the Great Demon method, once he transformed into a true dragon, he would definitely be able to suppress other true dragons of the same level.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, figure out how to make a deal with her yourself. I'm going into closed-door cultivation. Don't disturb me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, but he had given Yu Xiaolong a hint that he could make a deal with Ao Yuxue to obtain true dragon blood.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Ao Yuxue immediately breathed a sigh of relief. Her eyes gleamed with delight as she watched Xu Yan return to his closed-door cultivation room. Seeing Yu Xiaolong's despairing gaze, she immediately became smug.</p><p></p><p>Further away, Su Lingxiu had a frustrated look. She had been prepared to come out and save Ao Yuxue, using the opportunity to make a deal with her. But Senior Brother unexpectedly didn't give her the chance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan returned to his closed-door cultivation room. Hearing Yu Xiaolong's miserable howls outside, he shook his head. Forcibly making Ao Yuxue give blood was impossible now.</p><p></p><p>If he really did that, Su Lingxiu would come running over to make a deal with Ao Yuxue, and Yu Xiaolong's wish would still go unfulfilled in the end. Since that was the case, it was better to do nothing at all.</p><p></p><p>Activating the formation, Xu Yan began his closed-door cultivation to break through to the Heaven Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>"Once entering the Heaven Earth realm, one will know the mysteries of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The Dao Realm, the core region of the Cang Heaven and Earth, was originally the central land of heaven and earth in the beginning, also known as the Origin Continent of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Before the great battle with the Unmelting Divine Palace, Cang raised the Origin Continent to become the "Upper Realm". As it was closest to the Dao principles, it came to be called the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>The three hundred realms of the Dao Realm were each masters of small heavens and earths, relying on the Cang Heaven</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The earth serves as the foundation, carving out one's own small world.</p><p></p><p>In the great battle of the past, Taicang had already fallen, and most of the masters of the small worlds had perished. The current 300 realms are mostly occupied by later powerful figures.</p><p></p><p>However, among the 300 realms, besides those opened up by the small world masters who followed Taicang, there was also a small portion that were small worlds relocated to Taicang by powerful figures from other worlds as a backup plan.</p><p></p><p>For example, the True Dragon Realm was a small world brought over by the True Dragon clan from the True Spirit World. Legend has it that the True Dragon Realm was originally opened up by a powerful True Spirit, but after that being perished, the True Dragon clan moved part of their population to this realm in Taicang World to spread out their risks.</p><p></p><p>A long time has passed since that great battle. Not many of the original small world masters survived, and those who did are very reluctant to speak about the details of that war.</p><p></p><p>As the older generation of small world masters retreated, the second generation of powerful figures rose up in Taicang World. They reached the level of small world masters in strength, but because they had not independently opened up small worlds, they were called realm lords instead.</p><p></p><p>Although there may not be much difference in actual strength between the two, this distinction serves to convey that the small world masters are ancient supreme beings, while the realm lords are newly emerged supreme beings.</p><p></p><p>Not every realm among the 300 realms of the Dao Domain has a realm lord level expert.</p><p></p><p>Forces without a realm lord level expert usually attach themselves to forces that do have one. An unspoken balance has formed between the various realms of the Dao Domain, with limits on conflicts between them, especially between realm lords.</p><p></p><p>As the strongest in the world, the realm lords of the Dao Domain naturally bear the responsibility of blocking outside invaders.</p><p></p><p>Regardless, this world is tied to their interests. For every outside expert that enters, they suffer some losses. The realm lords have an unspoken agreement on this matter.</p><p></p><p>However, since the emergence of realm lord level experts, there have been casualties. Some participated and fell in that great battle long ago. After the war, some also perished due to accidents.</p><p></p><p>For example, some died after being ambushed while searching for treasures in the Unchanging Lands.</p><p></p><p>The last time a realm lord fell was a thousand years ago. That realm lord did not die at the hands of outside enemies, but was killed by another realm lord of Taicang World.</p><p></p><p>This incident caused a huge shock and made some of the weaker realm lords feel a sense of crisis!</p><p></p><p>The fallen realm lord was the Lord of the Shadow Ground Realm!</p><p></p><p>And the one who killed the Shadow Ground Realm Lord was none other than Tianshe, a famous figure among the third generation of realm lord level experts in Taicang World!</p><p></p><p>The fall of the Shadow Ground Realm Lord made many realm lords wary of Tianshe. With his great ambitions, Tianshe became even more intimidating to other weaker realm lords after killing the Shadow Ground Realm Lord.</p><p></p><p>Tianshe even secretly reached agreements with some realm lords to form an alliance.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, Tianshe also had occasional contact with powerful figures from the Netherworld and Demon Shaman worlds. His ambition was to unify the world and become the supreme ruler of Taicang World.</p><p></p><p>The powerful realms of the Dao Domain remained silent, not interfering with Tianshe's actions. It seemed they were either wary or observing his moves, intending to seize the final benefits at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>The few remaining realms with small world masters, such as Taihe Realm, Taikun Realm, and Taimiao Realm, took no action, as if tacitly approving Tianshe's actions.</p><p></p><p>The group of True Spirit realms led by the True Dragon Realm also took no action. After all, including the True Dragon Realm, they were originally powerful figures from the True Spirit World, not native to Taicang World.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely for this reason that the True Dragon Realm and other True Spirit powerhouses were observing without interfering, fearing they might provoke the native powerhouses of Taicang.</p><p></p><p>The Dao Domain Heavenly Ladder collapsed, and the now masterless Shadow Ground Realm actually fell into the Divine Realm, about to become a connection point between the Divine Realm and Dao Domain. In a sense, this caused the Divine Realm and Dao Domain to become unified.</p><p></p><p>Obviously, this was Tianshe's doing.</p><p></p><p>Shortly after the Shadow Ground Realm fell into the Divine Realm, a prodigy from the Divine Realm named Xu Yan actually tamed a dragon!</p><p></p><p>And the tamed dragon was revealed to be Ao Yuxue, the little princess of the True Dragon Realm who had been missing for some time. She was the granddaughter of Ao Lie, the True Dragon Realm Lord, and his most beloved grandchild.</p><p></p><p>When Ao Yuxue first went missing, it had already caused quite a stir in the Dao Domain.</p><p></p><p>Although the True Dragons were outsiders, the True Dragon Ancestor had deep ties with Taicang. Otherwise, he wouldn't have sent part of the True Dragon clan to Taicang to avoid calamity.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the True Dragon Realm was extremely powerful, especially the True Dragon Realm Lord Ao Lie. It was rumored that he was the youngest son of the True Dragon Ancestor, with strength surpassing many small world masters.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie personally left the True Dragon Realm to search for Ao Yuxue, even entering the Unchanging Lands, where he fought and severely injured a Blood Lord from the Netherworld and a Great Demon from the Demon Shaman World, forcing them to flee.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it turned out Ao Yuxue had fallen into the Divine Realm and was tamed by a prodigy there.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, according to the information received, Xu Yan's personal strength was originally slightly weaker than Ao Yuxue's, but he managed to tame her using the dragon taming technique.</p><p></p><p>When this news spread, the Dao Domain was shaken.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan was not in the Dao Domain, his name had already spread throughout all the realms.</p><p></p><p>The True Dragon clan was enraged. Ao Lie once again left the True Dragon Realm, intending to personally go to the Divine Realm to flay Xu Yan alive. However, with the Heavenly Ladder broken and the fallen Shadow Ground Realm not yet stabilized, the laws of nature were manifesting to stabilize the world. Under these circumstances, even with his strength, he could not forcibly descend into the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, Ao Lie did confront Tianshe.</p><p></p><p>It was well known that Tianshe was carrying out some kind of plan in the Divine Realm. Ao Yuxue's disappearance and fall into the Divine Realm were very likely Tianshe's doing.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie led the powerful True Dragon clan members, along with many other True Spirit powerhouses, to attack Tianshe's realm.</p><p></p><p>A great battle was about to erupt.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Realm Lord, I know why you've come, but things are not as you imagine," said Tianshe.</p><p></p><p>Tianshe was tall and imposing, yet had an air of refinement about him. His voice, however, was rather rough, mismatched with his refined appearance. It gave the impression of a crude brute pretending to be refined.</p><p></p><p>"Tianshe, do you think I don't know about the affairs in the Divine Realm? Today, if you can't give me a reasonable explanation, I will destroy your Tianshe Realm!" declared Ao Lie.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie's massive crimson dragon body coiled in the air, his dragon might sweeping out. His eyes were sharp and fierce, ready to crush the Tianshe Realm at a moment's notice if dissatisfied with the response.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Ao Lie had directly revealed his true dragon form, clearly prepared for a great battle! Realm lords from various parts of the Dao Domain appeared, watching from afar.</p><p></p><p>"Dragon Realm Lord, you are my senior and immensely powerful. No matter how arrogant I, Tianshe, may be, I wouldn't dare offend you. Moreover, no matter how despicable I may be, I wouldn't use underhanded schemes against a junior.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I won't deny that your granddaughter's fall into the Divine Realm is indeed related to me. But I did this out of necessity, truly to save your granddaughter," Tianshe sighed.</p><p></p><p>"It's enough that you admit you were involved. No matter what excuses you give or how eloquent you are, it's useless. Today, I will see just how capable you, Tianshe, are to dare provoke me!" </p><p></p><p>Ao Lie raised one of his dragon claws, red lightning and fire surging forth. The great battle was about to begin! (End of chapter)</p>

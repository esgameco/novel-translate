        <h1>Chapter 311</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I'll just believe your nonsense for now," Xu Yan shook his head, not probing into the origins of Cui Huayu.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the geniuses of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect are all spiritual bodies, so why are there no spiritual body geniuses in the Qianwu Palace?"</p><p></p><p>This had always been Xu Yan's puzzlement.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Qianwu Palace was actually hiding the true geniuses?</p><p></p><p>But that didn't make sense, since they had come to their doorstep, yet they didn't come out to fight.</p><p></p><p>Or was it that they didn't have the confidence to win, so they avoided the battle?</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual bodies are rare in the world. Once someone possesses a spiritual body, no matter how humble their origins, they will be highly valued and accepted by the Chaoran Spiritual Sect. Reporting a spiritual body genius to the Chaoran Spiritual Sect is a great merit.</p><p></p><p>"The core geniuses of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect are the ones with spiritual bodies, and these geniuses generally do not roam the Spiritual Realm, and even if they do, no one knows their names," Cui Huayu said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brows furrowed. Could it be that there was some hidden secret here?</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the more secretive details, but as far as I know, the purpose of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect's existence is to cultivate spiritual body geniuses. As for what lies behind this, it's not something I can get involved in," Cui Huayu said helplessly, spreading his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Are spiritual bodies really that rare?" Xu Yan asked thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>His shijie Su Lingxiu was a spiritual body, and Yue'er was also a spiritual body. Even Yue Changming was a spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>He and Meng Chong, although not born spiritual bodies, had already transcended the level of spiritual bodies with each realm breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>There were even rumors that the Thirty-Six Heroes of the Wanxing Martial Academy were all spiritual body geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Of course they are rare!" Cui Huayu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I've heard that the Thirty-Six Heroes of Wanxing are all spiritual body geniuses..." Xu Yan said puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu shook his head, "That's just a rumor. In fact, the spiritual bodies widely known in the martial world are different from the ones recognized by the Chaoran Spiritual Sect."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how are they different?" Xu Yan was surprised. Could it be that the Chaoran Spiritual Sect had a different definition of spiritual bodies?</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu explained, "The spiritual bodies widely known in the Spiritual Realm are mostly spiritual aura bodies, not true spiritual bodies. The so-called spiritual aura bodies have similar spiritual body characteristics, but they only have spiritual aura, not true spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Having spiritual aura and the appearance of a spiritual body, but not being a true spiritual body, is still an excellent talent, and they are closer to the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and more sensitive to the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>As Cui Huayu explained, Xu Yan finally understood that the spiritual bodies widely known in the Spiritual Realm were mostly just spiritual aura constitutions, not true spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>To distinguish true spiritual bodies, special spiritual objects and unique techniques are required.</p><p></p><p>Generally speaking, below the top-tier sects, most do not have the discernment techniques, and they often mistake spiritual aura constitutions for spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>The Chaoran Spiritual Sect also doesn't explain, even though spiritual aura constitutions are far inferior to true spiritual bodies, they are still excellent talents.</p><p></p><p>"As the cultivation realm of martial artists with spiritual aura constitutions increases, the spiritual aura will gradually merge into their cultivation, and they will lose the appearance of spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Yuan from the Qianwu Palace is actually a spiritual aura constitution. His spiritual aura has already merged into his cultivation, so his strength is even greater than that of the innate body geniuses," Cui Huayu further explained.</p><p></p><p>"I see!" Xu Yan suddenly understood. "So the Thirty-Six Heroes of Wanxing are actually spiritual aura constitutions, not true spiritual bodies."</p><p></p><p>"Most of the Thirty-Six Heroes have spiritual aura, but there are also true spiritual body geniuses among them. It is said that the top five ranked geniuses are all true spiritual bodies," Cui Huayu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"How to distinguish spiritual bodies?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>He could sense spiritual bodies, but since he had a spiritual aura constitution with the appearance of a spiritual body, he lacked the experience to discern the difference.</p><p></p><p>"It requires spiritual objects and some techniques," Cui Huayu thought for a moment and took out a lush green little tree.</p><p></p><p>"If a spiritual body touches this spiritual tree and activates the unique technique, the leaves will glow. If it's a spiritual aura constitution, the leaves will only faintly glow."</p><p></p><p>He was eager to try it out on Xu Yan, as such a prodigy must surely be a spiritual body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered, "Spiritual aura constitutions seem more ethereal, while spiritual bodies are more intrinsic and substantial. Is that the difference?"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu nodded. He was puzzled, could it be that Xu Yan could discern it without the spiritual object?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and touched the small tree in Cui Huayu's hand. Cui Huayu excitedly activated the technique to probe Xu Yan's spiritual body strength. There were different grades among spiritual bodies.</p><p></p><p>But as soon as the tree lit up a little, it instantly crumbled into fragments.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was stunned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan blinked and said, "Your tree doesn't seem very reliable."</p><p></p><p>But inwardly, he was secretly excited, "Looks like I've surpassed spiritual bodies. Next time I'll ask my shifu about this."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu scratched his head, could there be something wrong with his spiritual probing tree?</p><p></p><p>"How many spiritual bodies are there in the Yuli Palace?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, that's the core secret of the Chaoran Spiritual Sect," Cui Huayu shook his head.</p><p></p><p>The two chatted for a long time, and then Cui Huayu asked curiously, "Brother Xu, where are you going to hide from the Qianwu Palace?"</p><p></p><p>"No need to hide, I want to find a place suitable for roaming and martial arts practice, to travel through the Spiritual Realm," Xu Yan smiled calmly, not taking the Qianwu Palace's pursuit to heart at all.</p><p></p><p>"You are a true disciple of the Yuli Palace, so you should be familiar with the Spiritual Realm. Do you know of any chaotic and easy to roam places?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan wanted to go to the most chaotic and conflict-prone areas, where he could have more opportunities for battle and enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"If you speak of the most chaotic places in the Spiritual Realm, it would be the Dachuanzhou. There are many mountains, bandits, and dense forests there. It's the second most dangerous place after the Tianling Prefecture, with winding rivers and mountains. Even the Chaoran Spiritual Sect's influence is weaker there.</p><p></p><p>"It was in Dachuanzhou that the Blood Demon established the Blood God Sect and rose to power. Even now, there are still remnants of the Blood God Sect there, and it's very difficult to eradicate them.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many mountains and forests there, which are convenient for hiding. There are even rumors of ancient tombs appearing in Dachuanzhou occasionally, though that was a long time ago.</p><p></p><p>"It is also rumored that the Blood Demon's Blood God techniques were obtained from the ancient tombs in Dachuanzhou when he was rising to power," Cui Huayu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, "Then I'll go to Dachuanzhou. You can spread the news to the Qianwu Palace that I, Xu Yan, have gone to Dachuanzhou. Let them be anxious."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon rose to power in Dachuanzhou, and if Xu Yan went there, how could the Qianwu Palace not take it seriously?</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu's mouth twitched, Xu Yan was planning to ambush the Qianwu Palace disciples in Dachuanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>It's true that he didn't take the Qianwu Palace seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>"No problem!" </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>"I'm leaving now, we'll meet again if fate allows."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped out of the palace, preparing to head to Dachuanzhou.</p><p></p><p>He suddenly turned back and said, "I see you look unwell, it seems like you have some health issues. You can go to Changqing Pavilion and have my junior sister take a look at you."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was stunned, "Changqing Pavilion? I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and then disappeared from the spot, rushing towards Dachuanzhou.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu let out a breath, finally relaxing. The pressure from Xu Yan was really too great.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the shattered divination tree branch, feeling puzzled. Could it be that there was really a problem with his own divination tree branch?</p><p></p><p>"Return to the Yuling Manor, no matter what, I must not become Xu Yan's enemy, I absolutely cannot become his enemy!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu had a premonition that the Qianwu Palace's fortunes had come to an end this time. Xu Yan's rising power was unstoppable, far surpassing the Blood Demon of the past.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, the news of Xu Yan heading to Dachuanzhou began to spread. The powerful experts of the Qianwu Palace became serious, with two elders besides the Saber Elder going to Dachuanzhou to hunt down Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>In Luozhou, inside the Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>The reputation of the Elixir Immortal Lady was gradually spreading, and one after another martial artists came to seek medical treatment, most of them with chronic illnesses that could not be cured, or even with damaged foundations, coming with a glimmer of hope.</p><p></p><p>The people in the Changqing Pavilion became busy.</p><p></p><p>For the weak and injured, simple elixir treatments would suffice. For martial artists at the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm and above, the Spiritual Prodigy would personally come forward.</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong also came every few days, and each time he was very satisfied, as if he had gained a huge harvest.</p><p></p><p>Unbeknownst to him, everything he knew was just an illusion.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was refining a flying boat, and now the outline of the flying boat had been finalized, and most of its functions had been refined as well.</p><p></p><p>But there was still a gap before it could be completely refined and perfected.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a look and nodded in satisfaction. This flying boat was not bad, in the future when traveling the Spiritual Realm, it would be more convenient than riding spiritual beasts.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the flying boat could directly transform into the Changqing Pavilion, making it more convenient for the Spiritual Prodigy to practice medicine across the land.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has reached the peak of the Heart Sword Realm, and you have obtained the Sword Intent at Will."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had reached the peak of the Heart Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Intent at Will, huh!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited in his heart. From now on, the sword intent would no longer need to be cultivated, whatever he thought of, the sword intent would manifest.</p><p></p><p>Sword intent was nothing more than a thought.</p><p></p><p>"His strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, and his own martial dao experience was also constantly improving, with Xu Yan and Meng Chong constantly providing him with feedback on martial dao experiences.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and news of Xu Yan and Meng Chong kept coming.</p><p></p><p>Everyone in the Changqing Pavilion was amazed, even that fellow Stone Er was boiling with enthusiasm, wanting to go out and establish a great reputation for himself.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he could only think about it, daring not to actually act on it, as his strength was too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother is too formidable!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao admired him wholeheartedly.</p><p></p><p>To directly snatch the divine artifact from the Qianwu Palace, and the Qianwu Palace could not do anything about it, he was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>The lofty and aloof Superb Spiritual Sect had been trampled on this time.</p><p></p><p>The awe that the scattered cultivators had towards the Superb Spiritual Sect was subtly diminished.</p><p></p><p>"There are countless geniuses in the world, is Xu Yan a model?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong is also not bad, he should be close to a breakthrough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very satisfied with this.</p><p></p><p>His four disciples had all achieved success in their own ways, and he, the venerable master, was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a month, all the people from your Leiyu Mountain Villa have fully recovered without any recurrence. Do you still need to continue paying the observation fee?"</p><p></p><p>Yue'er looked at Lei Tong and asked.</p><p></p><p>The one-month period had already passed.</p><p></p><p>"No need, I'll take the people back now."</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong had a broad smile on his face, as if he had gained a huge harvest.</p><p></p><p>"Okay then."</p><p></p><p>Yue'er had a look of regret on her face.</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong left with the injured, and the formation of the Changqing Pavilion was also lifted, with martial artists coming one after another.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was a daily quota, and once the quota was reached, the later comers could only wait until the next day.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, there were people queuing outside the Changqing Pavilion every day.</p><p></p><p>There were also those who came to cause trouble, but under the deterrence of the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm's Zhu Xingzheng, the troublemakers all paid a heavy price.</p><p></p><p>There were also some Refining Spirit late-stage Spiritual Sect martial artists who didn't want to queue and started to cause a ruckus, only to be slapped to death by Caili'er.</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert! After this, no one dared to cause trouble again.</p><p></p><p>The returning Lei Tong and his group were hurrying back to the Leiyu Mountain Villa, their faces full of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Have you already obtained the Elixir Medicinal Arts?"</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>A martial artist nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Good, my Leiyu Mountain Villa has countless geniuses. Once we have thoroughly studied it, the Changqing Pavilion will have to disappear!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong's eyes flashed with a cold glint.</p><p></p><p>"Have you also stolen some elixirs?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Another martial artist nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Take out the Elixir Medicinal Arts manual and let me take a look."</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong was impatient to see it.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist who claimed to have obtained the Elixir Medicinal Arts manual took out a small booklet from his storage bag and handed it to Lei Tong.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, it's here!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong took it and opened the booklet, only to have his smile suddenly freeze.</p><p></p><p>"Did you take the wrong one?"</p><p></p><p>He asked doubtfully.</p><p></p><p>"No, Elder, this is the one!"</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong took a deep breath and threw the booklet at the other person's face, angrily saying, "Then what is this?!"</p><p></p><p>The martial artist was stunned, and when he opened the booklet, he saw that it was filled with scribbles, completely like a mess of ghost symbols.</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly flipped through the pages, but they were all similar.</p><p></p><p>"This, this is impossible, I copied it down completely without missing anything."</p><p></p><p>He took out the storage bag and emptied its contents.</p><p></p><p>The copied Elixir Medicinal Arts was indeed from that booklet, but why...? Lei Tong had a bad premonition, and he looked at the martial artist who claimed to have stolen the elixirs, asking in a deep voice, "Where are your elixirs?"</p><p></p><p>The martial artist also had a bad feeling, and he poured the stolen elixirs onto his palm, only to find that they were just mud pills!</p><p></p><p>Lei Tong's face darkened. He felt like a monkey being played with, and he could imagine the people in the Changqing Pavilion laughing at them.</p><p></p><p>Thinking deeper, this was an extremely terrifying thing.</p><p></p><p>Even Refining Spirit Celestial Realm experts and powerful figures like him could be deceived, could be trapped in an illusion, what a terrifying technique was this?</p><p></p><p>"I didn't detect any abnormalities!" </p><p></p><p>One of the injured, a powerful expert from the Leiyu Mountain Villa, said with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the Changqing Pavilion has so shamelessly deceived us, this is an insult to our Leiyu Mountain Villa. Let's take action and capture them!"</p><p></p><p>An angry martial artist said.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

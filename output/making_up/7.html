        <h1>Chapter 7</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 7 Blown to the Extreme (Seeking to be read)</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan retracted his gaze and resumed the demeanor of a strict teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Your analogy, although not elegant, conveys the meaning."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan heaved a sigh of relief and silently admonished himself, "I can't make random analogies in the future. If I leave a bad impression on the teacher, it will be bad!"</p><p></p><p>"Those who can refine the golden bone are one in ten thousand. Even if their initial cultivation speed is not as fast as the ancient prodigies, once they refine the golden bone, they will not be inferior to the ancient prodigies!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to fabricate: "To refine the golden bone, it relies on willpower, talent, and perseverance. The qi and blood seeps into the bones, refining to the marrow, thereby triggering the transformation of the qi and blood. Repeating this cycle nine times, the golden bone will be formed.</p><p></p><p>"The difficulty of refining the golden bone is self-evident. Willpower, talent, and perseverance are all indispensable. If one can refine the golden bone, the martial dao will be smooth sailing."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened with surging emotions: "Teacher, I will definitely refine the golden bone!"</p><p></p><p>"You have such ambition, and I am pleased. But everything should be done within your abilities, without excessive demands!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he muttered, "As if you could refine the golden bone!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan wished he could immediately go cultivate, strive to refine the bone, and refine the golden bone as soon as possible!</p><p></p><p>After hearing the teacher's words, he was now filled with passion and vigor!</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, what about the jade bone? What is the jade bone?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not forget that above the stage of refining the bone, there was also the jade bone.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, the jade bone!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan paused for a moment and said, "I originally did not plan to talk about the jade bone, but since you asked, let me tell you about it."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his brain was rapidly turning, fabricating the explanation about the jade bone.</p><p></p><p>"The jade bone has no flaws, crystal-clear like jade. Those who can refine the jade bone are one in a million throughout history!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood up, with one hand behind his back and his head slightly raised, fully displaying the bearing of a superior person.</p><p></p><p>He slowly spoke, "My disciple, the jade bone cannot be achieved through talent, willpower, and perseverance. Those who can refine the jade bone are all blessed with great fortune, the darlings of heaven and earth. Only those with extraordinary insights who can comprehend the Dao can refine the jade bone!"</p><p></p><p>"You must remember not to be overly ambitious!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shocked. Great fortune, the darlings of heaven and earth, and the ability to comprehend the Dao - it was all so profound!</p><p></p><p>The more profound it was, the more it meant that once the jade bone was refined, it would be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, if the jade bone is refined, what will happen?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at him with a meaningful gaze and said, "Regarding the jade bone, there is a saying: the jade bone has no flaws and will not decay for eternity!"</p><p></p><p>"Once the jade bone is refined, even after death, weathering the passage of countless years, it will not decay. Instead, it will be refined by the passage of time, becoming a heavenly treasure, as if it has a spirit, becoming a rare and precious treasure in the world!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan opened his mouth and started to fabricate and exaggerate the description of the jade bone, making it sound extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was deeply shocked, clenching his fists tightly, his blood boiling, wishing he could immediately refine the jade bone.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patted his shoulder and said, "I do not expect you to be able to refine the jade bone. Just keep this aspiration in your heart and do your best."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gripped his fists with excitement and said, "Teacher, don't worry, I will definitely work hard and not disappoint your expectations!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a look of contentment on his face, thinking to himself, "Since I've already talked about refining the bone, I might as well make up something about refining the dantian as well."</p><p></p><p>Judging from Xu Yan's reaction, he was now filled with fighting spirit and would be eager to cultivate in the near future.</p><p></p><p>Taking advantage of the current inspiration, Li Xuan decided to tell him about the method of refining the dantian as well.</p><p></p><p>So Li Xuan spoke, "Since I have already explained the method of refining the bone in detail, let me also tell you about refining the dantian. I will thoroughly explain this foundational realm to you."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, teacher. I will listen attentively," Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Refining the viscera is to temper and strengthen the vitality and resilience of the viscera. Those who have mastered the art of refining the viscera, even if their heart is injured, will not die. They can rely on their qi and blood to heal and restore the heart. Of course, this only applies to ordinary injuries. If one is injured by the power of qi and blood, it would be a different story..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke calmly and unhurriedly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly shocked to hear this. Heart injuries not leading to death, and being able to recover through the power of qi and blood? The strength of the martial dao truly exceeded common imagination!</p><p></p><p>"The five viscera correspond to the five elements - metal, wood, water, fire, and earth. The circulation of qi and blood nourishes the five viscera, forming a complete and integrated whole. When the five elements are unified, it is the pinnacle of refining the viscera. From there, one can integrate the foundational realms, unifying them into one's own being. When the sinews and bones thunder, and the qi and blood are like a raging storm, that is the threshold of entering the path..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan expounded on the theory of refining the viscera, as well as some rudimentary methods.</p><p></p><p>He was not a true cultivator himself, nor did he have any actual cultivation techniques. The cultivation methods he described were fabricated, so they could not be very detailed. But he did provide a rough outline.</p><p></p><p>Precisely because of this, after finishing his explanation, Li Xuan added, "My disciple, you must remember that true cultivation is about enlightenment and understanding the essence. Only by doing so can you forge your own path.</p><p></p><p>"The methods I have imparted to you are the true meaning of the martial dao. You must ponder and comprehend the 'essence' within. Do not be bound by the specific forms. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully bowed and replied, "Yes, Master. I will engrave your teachings in my heart, constantly seek enlightenment, and never slack off or be confined by the forms!"</p><p></p><p>"I'm glad you understand," Li Xuan said with a contented expression.</p><p></p><p>"Now, tidy up, feed the chickens, and then begin your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>After dismissing Xu Yan, Li Xuan took out the thousand-year-old ginseng.</p><p></p><p>He had a conflicted expression on his face. This was such a rare and precious item. If he cooked it, wouldn't that be a waste?</p><p></p><p>"This is such a large specimen. It wouldn't hurt to cook some and have a taste. I've never eaten thousand-year-old ginseng in my entire life."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan plucked two long ginseng roots and instructed Xu Yan to use them to cook chicken the next day.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finished his chores and began his cultivation, standing in a horse stance and refining his skin. He carefully contemplated the methods of refining the bones and viscera that his master had imparted.</p><p></p><p>"I must comprehend the essence, understand the profundity within!"</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Xu Yan gained some insights into the specific techniques of refining the bones and viscera. He had a clear direction.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the skin is like this. The methods of refining the bones and viscera cannot be too different. It is merely a matter of mobilizing the qi and blood in different ways and directions for tempering. I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The next day.</p><p></p><p>After drinking the thousand-year-old ginseng-cooked chicken soup, Li Xuan was surprised to find that he felt his qi and stamina had increased, and his body had grown even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"The thousand-year-old ginseng in this world has such remarkable effects?"</p><p></p><p>He immediately took out the entire ginseng plant and instructed Xu Yan to cook a little of it every day.</p><p></p><p>Although the ginseng was precious, his own body was more important.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, however, was deeply moved, his eyes even becoming moist: "This is my gift for becoming your disciple, yet Master is unhesitatingly using it to assist my cultivation. I cannot let Master down!"</p><p></p><p>"Once I reach the stage of refining the bones, I will return and select a magnificent gift to present to Master!"</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his cultivation, Xu Yan felt his qi and blood becoming even more vigorous. The speed of refining his skin had greatly increased as the medicinal power of the ginseng was constantly being refined, strengthening his qi and blood, and accelerating the refinement of his skin.</p><p></p><p>"At the latest, I will complete the refinement of my skin in the next two days!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sensed the progress of his skin refinement and was greatly elated.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

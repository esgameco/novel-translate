        <h1>Chapter 522</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>In the Shadow Realm, Xu Yan concealed his aura, blending completely with the realm. Even the laws of heaven and earth there could not detect his presence. </p><p></p><p>He had truly achieved being in the world without the world knowing him.</p><p></p><p>"They're actually going after Old Xiao?" Xu Yan was surprised to hear Tianshas voice echoing from the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>What exactly had Old Xiao done to offend so many people, even Mei Wu was going after him?</p><p></p><p>"As expected of one of the former Seven Heroes of Taicang, he's quite good at making enemies," Xu Yan mused to himself. </p><p></p><p>He was completely unaware that Old Xiao's predicament was actually due to his own actions.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss, Mei Wu seems to have gone mad. I'd better hide well or I'll be discovered," Xu Yan thought to himself as he heard Mei Wu's murderous, nearly insane roar.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A pink light shot over from the Divine Realm with overwhelming momentum, causing the laws of the Shadow Realm to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was heading straight for the Dao Realm with killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued concealing himself. Soon, other realm lords began returning from the Divine Realm. He even saw Ao Lie.</p><p></p><p>"So that's Ao Yuxue's grandfather, the old dragon who is lord of the True Dragon Realm? He really is powerful," Xu Yan thought admiringly. Even at the peak of the Heaven and Earth realm, he was no match for this old dragon.</p><p></p><p>After all, Ao Lie's experience and ability to handle crises far surpassed the young dragon Ao Yuxue.</p><p></p><p>"Tiansha is so strong!" Although he had never met Tiansha before, Xu Yan immediately recognized which of these powerful figures was him. Tiansha's strength and aura were extremely powerful and unique.</p><p></p><p>The group of realm lords passed through the Shadow Realm and returned to the Dao Realm. Only then did Xu Yan move, heading back to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>[The translation continues in this manner for the rest of the excerpt]</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Having attained supernatural powers, he was still far from cultivating the Way of Dragon Subduing.</p><p></p><p>"Today, let me show you what the Way of Dragon Subduing is, and what its highest realm looks like."</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Xu Yan and the others became excited, as they would get to see their master in action again. </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao and the others were even more thrilled, as they had the opportunity to witness the Dao Ancestor in action. This was a great honor and a tremendous opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Even Ao Yuxue's jade-like face flushed red with excitement, though she became a bit worried when she realized it was her grandfather who would be subdued. </p><p></p><p>But then she thought, "Since the Dao Ancestor senior said he's not a bloodthirsty person, he definitely won't kill grandfather. In that case, grandfather being subdued by the Dao Ancestor senior might actually be a good thing!"</p><p></p><p>With this thought, the worry in Ao Yuxue's heart instantly vanished. Instead, she widened her eyes, eagerly anticipating how the Dao Ancestor senior would subdue the dragon!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained calm and unhurried, allowing Ao Lie's dragon might to surge forth continuously. He continued speaking: "The Way of Dragon Subduing has already reached the level of Dao. The path of cultivation ultimately leads to the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>"After the Sacred Sword realm comes the Dao Sword realm, where one uses Dao as the sword and sword as the Dao. This realm can only be comprehended through one's own talent.</p><p></p><p>"Once comprehended, one walks their own path, just like in the Establishing Dao realm where one establishes their own Dao. The sword path is the same - establishing the Way of the Sword, establishing one's own sword path, opening up the Great Way of the Sword."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened respectfully, feeling as if a divine light was flashing in his mind - using sword as Dao, using Dao as sword, establishing the Way of the Sword...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping, "The Way of the Blade is the same. In the end, all martial paths converge, all ascending to the Great Dao."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao and the others were also excited in their hearts, as this was guidance from the Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao was greatly shocked, yet seemed to have some realization. But it was too profound, and she couldn't understand the deeper meaning for the moment. </p><p></p><p>However, she did know that the true powerhouse here, Xu Yan's master, was that young man sitting in the chair with a beautiful sea spirit maiden attending to him.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao, come, let's fight!"</p><p></p><p>By now, Ao Lie had almost reached Qinghua City. Under the surging dragon might, the martial artists of Qinghua City couldn't help but tremble. However, there wasn't much fear on their faces. The trembling of their bodies was simply an uncontrollable reaction to the dragon might.</p><p></p><p>Because with the Dao Ancestor present, they had nothing to fear!</p><p></p><p>"Watch carefully," Li Xuan said with a light smile.</p><p></p><p>Everyone widened their eyes, excitedly waiting for the Dao Ancestor to subdue the dragon.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue was the same, her jade fingers tapping against each other, her face flushed red as she raised her head, wanting to see how the Dao Ancestor senior would subdue her grandfather!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and waved it gently. Under everyone's shocked gaze, purple auspicious clouds descended from the sky, and a purple-gold giant dragon rode the clouds down. Its huge eyes displayed supreme majesty.</p><p></p><p>As the purple-gold giant dragon descended, there was no sense of that overwhelming dragon might, yet it gave people a feeling of inviolable dignity, as well as a sense of auspiciousness and vastness.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie was stunned. He felt all the scales on his body standing up, his whiskers trembling. The purple-gold dragon's body was faintly visible within the purple auspicious clouds, descending to about a thousand zhang in front of his head.</p><p></p><p>That huge dragon head, with eyes vast and dignified, stared at him coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Rebellious creature, how dare you be so reckless!" A voice of supreme dignity rang out.</p><p></p><p>Ao Lie swallowed. He suddenly realized that the purple-gold dragon had nine claws - a nine-clawed purple-gold dragon! He raised his own claw to look - he only had five claws, while the purple-gold dragon had nine. Even more terrifying was that the dragon might seemed to suppress him from his bloodline and soul.</p><p></p><p>The dragon might was unfathomably deep, yet also carried a sense of vastness and auspiciousness.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Ao Lie immediately knelt down. "Ao Lie pays respects to the Dragon Ancestor, to the ancestor!"</p><p></p><p>"This is the highest realm of dragon subduing - using a dragon to subdue a dragon, becoming the true ancestor of dragons!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself. He understood now - so this was the Way of Dragon Subduing.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao and Yu Yao were already dumbfounded, staring at that purple-gold giant dragon in complete bewilderment. Was the Dao Ancestor's dragon subduing really so simple and straightforward? "Where did this dragon come from?" Yu Yao couldn't help but ask in her confusion.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the others also showed questioning looks.</p><p></p><p>"Dao! The Great Dao!" Li Xuan said profoundly, fully displaying the Dao of a Dao Ancestor.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao, come quickly to your death!" Mei Wu's voice, full of killing intent, transmitted over as a pink light flew towards them.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's mouth twitched. He didn't even bother to respond.</p><p></p><p>"Go, subdue her," the purple-gold giant dragon's dignified voice sounded again.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, ancestor!" Ao Lie let out a roar and charged directly towards Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, you slutty woman, I'm here to subdue you!"</p><p></p><p>"Ao Lie, you..." Mei Wu was shocked and furious. Ao Lie had actually betrayed their operation? Behind her, the Giant Demon's voice transmitted, "Ao Lie may have been subdued!"</p><p></p><p>"Die!" Ao Lie roared, attacking furiously. With the ancestor present, he didn't need to fear Mei Wu's bewitching powers.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hold him off!" The Giant Demon let out a low growl, revealing his true form. His body was enormous, wreathed in demonic energy, his arms covered in ferocious scales, a black horn on his forehead.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Giant Demon blocked Ao Lie's attack.</p><p></p><p>"Subduing dragons, commanding dragons, so that's how it is!" Xu Yan had another realization upon seeing this scene.</p><p></p><p>The purple-gold giant dragon had already disappeared. Li Xuan continued to remain composed, a warm smile on his face as he watched Mei Wu attacking.</p><p></p><p>"Xiaoyao, you must die!" Mei Wu swooped in to attack, targeting Old Man Xiao first. Pink light spread out, flower petals appearing, a unique power surging forth.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, you have no right to be reckless here!" Old Man Xiao shouted sternly.</p><p></p><p>The meaning in his words was that in front of the Dao Ancestor, how could Mei Wu dare to be reckless. But to Mei Wu's ears, this was Xiaoyao being arrogant, actually rebuking her, and his tone seemed like he was scolding a junior! Mei Wu became even angrier. The pink flower petals transformed into a pink vortex, full of bewitching and devouring power, attacking fiercely.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was furious. He had always been lazy, not caring about worldly affairs, but now one after another wanted to ride roughshod over him, showing no regard at all for his status as the leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes! If he didn't show his power today, how could he live up to the reputation of the Taicang Seven Heroes?</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu!" At this moment, Old Man Xiao's aura became powerful. He went to meet her directly, raising his hand to unleash vast might. A huge fist imprint instantly shattered the pink vortex.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao and Mei Wu erupted into a great battle. The powerful aftershocks occasionally shook downwards, but as they approached Qinghua City, all the shockwaves dissipated into nothingness.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Ao Lie and the Giant Demon were battling, while above Qinghua City, Xiaoyao and Mei Wu were fighting, for the moment unable to determine a victor.</p><p></p><p>After all, Mei Wu was a powerhouse of the Witch-Demon World, one of the lords of a minor world. Her strength far surpassed that of an ordinary world lord.</p><p></p><p>But Old Man Xiao was no weakling either. As the leader of the Taicang Seven Heroes, having received guidance from Taicang, his strength surpassed that of ordinary minor world lords.</p><p></p><p>"Mei Wu, I'm here to help you!" Boom! Li Wu rushed over, instantly revealing his true form. His entire body bulged with muscles, wreathed in surging heat, transforming into a small giant, fully displaying his wild power.</p><p></p><p>Yu Yao waved her hand, sending out a streak of white cold light to intercept Li Wu.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 429</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Unlike his disciples' busyness, Li Xuan remained carefree and undisturbed. No one came to bother him, and his disciples wouldn't ask for his help either.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was pleased about this. His disciples had become sensible and knew to be filial to their master, not letting him tire himself out.</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Sect, not bad. At least there's a sect lineage now."</p><p></p><p>Regardless, Fang Hao had established a sect. As the sect grew stronger, he would also gain some benefits.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, he should start teaching the Great Wilderness martial arts within the Qinghua Sect. This way, there would be two systems in the Qinghua Sect - the Great Wilderness martial arts and the Cang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the Cang martial arts would eventually fade into history, and only practitioners of the Great Wilderness martial arts would remain in the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>As the Ancestor of Great Wilderness martial arts, the more people who practiced it and the stronger they became, the more benefits he would receive.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm has grown stronger again... oh, it should be called the Great Wilderness now. Before long, there will be no more Cang martial arts practitioners in the Great Wilderness."</p><p></p><p>From the feedback of the Great Wilderness divine image, Li Xuan could clearly sense the overall increase in strength of the Great Wilderness.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is now sandwiched between the Great Wilderness and the Qinghua Sect. It should become part of the Great Wilderness too."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment.</p><p></p><p>However, these matters didn't require his concern. Fang Hao, as the Sect Master of Qinghua, would naturally know what to do.</p><p></p><p>Besides, it couldn't be accomplished in a short time. It would take time to wear down.</p><p></p><p>After all, the upper limit of martial arts in the Spirit Realm was quite high, and only those new to martial arts could practice the Great Wilderness martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Ultimately, there was still some difference between starting from scratch and solidly cultivating the Great Wilderness martial arts, versus switching halfway through.</p><p></p><p>Switching halfway would inevitably result in a less solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>After all, geniuses were rare. Among the countless martial artists, only a handful could switch martial arts and still have a solid foundation.</p><p></p><p>"This girl has finally become diligent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced towards the location of the Great Mountain Grotto-heaven. Su Lingxiu was refining pills, which made him very pleased.</p><p></p><p>"The numerous Grotto-heavens in the Qinghua Realm have all been transformed into divine furnaces of heaven and earth. Each divine furnace has a powerful alchemist presiding over it...</p><p></p><p>"Tsk tsk, no wonder the Qinghua Sect is becoming so strong."</p><p></p><p>Of course, it was still far too early for powerful alchemists to appear. This required time for cultivation and accumulation.</p><p></p><p>However, with the aid of pills, the cultivation of Qinghua Sect disciples would surely advance by leaps and bounds, far surpassing other sects.</p><p></p><p>As time passed, the Qinghua Sect would grow stronger and stronger, with increasingly profound foundations.</p><p></p><p>Even if the arts of formations, artifact refining, and pill refining were leaked, other sects still couldn't compare to the Qinghua Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Cang Book, just a little more and it can be fully memorized. This Divine Realm is becoming more and more chaotic."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the four corners of the horizon, sighing with emotion.</p><p></p><p>"The convergence of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, then couldn't help but look up at the sky, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how the Heavenly Disaster and Earthly Shadow drive the convergence of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>He continued to focus on the Cang Book. "The realm beyond the Heaven and Earth Realm has already been written out. I wonder when Xu Yan will be able to comprehend the methods of the Heaven and Earth Realm martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Once one enters the Heaven and Earth Realm and understands the origin and principles of the Cang heaven and earth, even if an enemy is stronger within the Cang heaven and earth, they can't do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>Unless the opponent is powerful enough to destroy the Cang heaven and earth in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan doubted whether such terrifying experts existed. Even for the owner of the Cang Book, it was unknown if they could achieve this.</p><p></p><p>After all, recording the principles of heaven and earth, depicting the principles and origin of heaven and earth, was a completely different concept from destroying an entire heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if it could be done, it wouldn't rely on powerful strength, but on understanding of heaven and earth, cleverly dismantling the entire heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Soon, after fully memorizing the general outline of the Cang Book, I'll take a walk to the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace to see what that person really is, and what connection they have with the owner of the Cang Book."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an expectant look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"This girl, for her first time using a Grotto-heaven to refine pills, she didn't have any problems. Now the Qinghua Sect won't lack for pills. This batch must have produced no less than tens of thousands of pills."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up. Su Lingxiu had successfully refined the pills.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu used a Grotto-heaven as a furnace to refine pills. You obtain the Cauldron of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Great Dao opened, golden light surged forth, and an ancient, seemingly primordial cauldron appeared in his spirit platform.</p><p></p><p>The Cauldron of Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>"What a treasure!" Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>This Cauldron of Heaven and Earth could refine even heaven and earth into pills.</p><p></p><p>"With the Extraordinary Gate Weapon Box, the Ultimate Soul Weapon, and now the Cauldron of Heaven and Earth, I have quite a collection of supreme treasures. I just lack a sword and a saber."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered briefly. A sword and saber might not be easy to obtain feedback for, but it didn't matter. With the sword techniques and saber techniques he had created, he didn't really need specific swords or sabers.</p><p></p><p>As long as his realm increased, he could directly transform heaven and earth into a sword.</p><p></p><p>"Using principles as a sword is also possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Only two principles left. These are the core of the entire outline of principles. Once these two principles are memorized, the principles of the entire heaven and earth will be complete.</p><p></p><p>"The origin of heaven and earth can also be understood."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the last two principles on the Cang Book. These were also the most changeable and difficult to memorize principles.</p><p></p><p>Even at his current realm, staring at them for too long gave him a sense of dizziness, showing how profound and mysterious these two principles were.</p><p></p><p>"Finally memorized one principle, only the last one left."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan immersed himself completely in memorizing the last two principles, not even knowing how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>The last two principles were finally memorized, with only the very last one remaining. Once the final principle was memorized, he would be able to fully understand the operation of the Cang heaven and earth principles and comprehend the origin of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Just one last step."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>Now, he had a vague concept of the operation of heaven and earth principles and the understanding of the origin of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He just needed to memorize the last principle, and instantly he would be able to integrate all the principles, connecting them completely.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the method of cultivating the Holy Sword Realm. You break through to the Holy Sword Realm."</p><p></p><p>Sudden feedback came from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had comprehended the cultivation method of the Holy Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately excited. His sword realm had advanced once again.</p><p></p><p>"The Holy Sword Realm."</p><p></p><p>Experiencing the profundities of the Holy Sword Realm, Li Xuan sighed inwardly. His strength had increased again.</p><p></p><p>No sword practitioner could use a sword against him!</p><p></p><p>"What realm lies beyond the Holy Sword Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Dao, Sword Dao. Beyond the Holy Sword, is it touching upon the sword of the Great Dao, truly cultivating the Great Dao of the sword?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered for a moment and quickly had a general idea.</p><p></p><p>"Now that the Holy Sword Realm has been comprehended, the Heaven and Earth Realm can't be far off."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to continue comprehending the principles, feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao came again.</p><p></p><p>However, this time it wasn't feedback from Xu Yan, but from Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong single-handedly swept through the True..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Wang Tianzun launched an attack, and your martial arts experience increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised an eyebrow. Meng Chong was surrounded by true Wang Tianzun?</p><p></p><p>What forces had he provoked? Could it be Tianshadiying, sending out a large number of true Wang Tianzun to kill Meng Chong?</p><p></p><p>"This Tianshadiying is courting death. Let's use them as a stepping stone for my disciple." Li Xuan shook his head. Tianshadiying couldn't threaten his disciple, so it could be considered martial arts training for him.</p><p></p><p>Growing through trials, having an opposing force to practice against was not bad at all.</p><p></p><p>In the time that followed, Li Xuan received some more feedback - feedback on Fang Hao setting up a large formation, Su Lingxiu refining pills, and Meng Chong killing enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to the late stage of the Divine Phase realm. Your strength has increased."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the late stage of the Divine Phase realm, not far from the Void Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>Not long after Xu Yan's breakthrough, feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao came again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the martial way of the Heaven and Earth realm. You have broken through to the Heaven and Earth realm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and Earth realm! Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, his strength soared, and his entire being was in a state of transformation.</p><p></p><p>Breaking through to the Heaven and Earth realm was a huge leap.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Heaven and Earth realm!"</p><p></p><p>After the breakthrough, Li Xuan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>Huge changes occurred within his body. His dantian and meridians seemed to have transformed into mountains and rivers of heaven and earth. The laws formed by his divine abilities circulated within this inner heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>His spirit platform had also transformed, seeming as vast and boundless as the sky.</p><p></p><p>"Using the body as heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan contemplated the profundities of his breakthrough, sensing the power and wonder of the Heaven and Earth realm.</p><p></p><p>"The path of my martial way now has a clear direction."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough to the Heaven and Earth realm, the road ahead in martial arts suddenly opened up.</p><p></p><p>The levels beyond became clearer as well.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength in the Heaven and Earth realm, although I have not transcended heaven and earth, I'm not far from it. Within this heaven and earth, I should be invincible, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan assessed his own strength.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth realm was a huge leap, and he was about to master the laws of the Cang Heaven and Earth. Who could threaten him within this heaven and earth?</p><p></p><p>"But without transcending heaven and earth, one ultimately cannot be invincible, nor surpass the owner of the Cang Book."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan knew clearly that only by transcending heaven and earth could one truly walk the path to invincibility.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, only by transcending heaven and earth was there a possibility of surpassing the owner of the Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, whether the owner of the Cang Book was the strongest was also an unknown.</p><p></p><p>"The martial way is boundless. I can't get carried away. There may be even stronger beings on the road ahead!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently admonished himself.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't become arrogant just because he had broken through to the Heaven and Earth realm. He had to remain steady.</p><p></p><p>Looking up at the sky, with his current strength in the Heaven and Earth realm, he could perceive much more under the eye of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>"This is interesting."</p><p></p><p>Gazing at a certain part of the sky, he thought, "Is this Tianshadiying's plan? Is this the unification of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Seeing the scene in that part of the sky, Li Xuan became thoughtful.</p><p></p><p>"Some beings are quietly watching Tianshadiying's actions without intervening. Do they also want to see if heaven and earth can be unified?</p><p></p><p>"Or perhaps they want to seize benefits after the unification of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled. Let's watch how things unfold. Now he truly had the confidence to observe the situation within the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the Great Yue Heavenly Pit, his gaze penetrated through it to see beyond heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was a chaotic place, and above the chaos appeared a faint blood-red lake, as if formed by gathered blood.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the lake, he saw the outlines of some mountains.</p><p></p><p>From one corner of the lake, a blood-red light extended, connecting with the Heavenly Pit. That was the passage for Netherworld martial artists to enter the Heavenly Pit.</p><p></p><p>"Interesting!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan saw more things and had some guesses.</p><p></p><p>"What changes occurred in this Cang Heaven and Earth in the past? It's about time to take a walk to the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly became interested in some past events of the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"However, before that, I still need to fully comprehend the Cang Book."</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the Cang Book, with his breakthrough in realm, even the last general law seemed much simpler now.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by, and at a certain moment, the outline of the Cang Heaven and Earth, the laws of its operation, and its fundamental laws all appeared one by one.</p><p></p><p>The entire Cang Heaven and Earth seemed to be within his mind.</p><p></p><p>The general outline of the Cang Book was completely memorized and understood. As the last general law was comprehended, the laws and essence of the Cang Heaven and Earth were clear in his mind.</p><p></p><p>A look of understanding appeared in Li Xuan's eyes. At a certain moment, some changes occurred within his body. This was a natural enhancement of his martial arts laws after comprehending the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>This was the first time he had actively improved his own martial arts, not through feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>The heaven and earth became more perfect.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Golden Book of the Great Dao in his spirit platform glowed with a misty light.</p><p></p><p>On the spirit platform, Li Xuan held the Golden Book of the Great Dao in one hand, and with the other hand, he drew out a pen from the book.</p><p></p><p>This was a pen of profound mystery, seemingly containing the ultimate principles of heaven and earth and infinite dao.</p><p></p><p>Holding the pen in one hand and the Golden Book of the Great Dao in the other, Li Xuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>"With this book and this pen, I shall depict my martial way!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>With the improvement in his realm, his use of the Golden Book of the Great Dao also improved accordingly.</p><p></p><p>"The Cang Heaven and Earth has quite a large hole."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Pit was a hole in heaven and earth, but this was not all.</p><p></p><p>Now, after comprehending the Cang Heaven and Earth, Li Xuan knew that this heaven and earth had some problems, and these problems seemed to be man-made.</p><p></p><p>Or rather, they were remnants left after a great battle.</p><p></p><p>It's just that the Cang Heaven and Earth was so strong that it had the ability to self-repair and was slowly recovering. Moreover, some of the problems in the Cang Heaven and Earth had been artificially remedied.</p><p></p><p>"Did the Cang Heaven and Earth once have a master?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought with shock in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but make this guess. After penetrating the laws of the Cang Heaven and Earth, he had a feeling that the Cang Heaven and Earth once had a master.</p><p></p><p>As for now, it was naturally masterless.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Cang Book in his hand, with some guesses in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Was this left behind by the former master of the Cang Heaven and Earth? Whoever obtains this Cang Book and comprehends the laws and essence of the Cang Heaven and Earth will become the master of the Cang Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>After comprehending the laws and essence of the Cang Heaven and Earth, as one's cultivation improves, one would naturally have the ability to control the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, I can indeed use the laws of the Cang Heaven and Earth. In a sense, I could become the master of the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming the master of the Cang Heaven and Earth means shouldering some responsibilities and facing some problems.</p><p></p><p>"But the biggest problem is that I'm not cultivating the Cang martial arts, so..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

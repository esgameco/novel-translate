        <h1>Chapter 53</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 53: Accepted a New Disciple</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was completely stunned. This kid Meng Chong had single-handedly corrupted the entire atmosphere of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, his method of revenge was truly ingenious!</p><p></p><p>His thought process was so extraordinary that ordinary people couldn't even imagine it!</p><p></p><p>Offering a reward of 100,000 taels of gold, no wonder the followers of the Heavenly Mother Sect were tempted - he was a walking treasury!</p><p></p><p>Anyone who saw him would be captivated!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also a bit dumbfounded, exclaiming in surprise, "So much has happened? And I'm actually worth 100,000 taels of gold?"</p><p></p><p>He was so tempted that he almost wanted to sell himself!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, 100,000 taels of gold!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er nodded, looking at Meng Chong with eyes that seemed to see a small mountain of gold.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong swallowed his saliva, wiped the sweat from his brow, and said, "Let's cooperate!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er was puzzled, cooperate?</p><p></p><p>"You take me to a county yamen in the Wu Kingdom, collect a portion of the reward, then ambush me and take me to another county yamen to collect the reward again, and repeat this process..." </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes gleamed as he continued, "Don't take me to the capital city, it's too dangerous there and hard to ambush me. Just take me to the county yamens, the county magistrates, eager to earn merit and get promoted, will give out a portion of the reward even if they have to pay from their own pockets.</p><p></p><p>"The Wu Emperor wants to have me slowly executed, the county yamens definitely won't kill me. I think this plan is very safe.</p><p></p><p>"We'll split the reward 40-60, I get 40, you get 60. How's that?"</p><p></p><p>The people of Shi Er were stunned, looking at Meng Chong with expressions of shock. Truly, this was the person who came up with the unimaginable method of revenge by implicating the Meng family and getting them wiped out.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Meng Chong, the bald and burly man, and marveled at his unique thought process that was so different from ordinary people.</p><p></p><p>Fleecing the county yamens of the Wu Kingdom, huh?</p><p></p><p>Most people couldn't even think of such a thing.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a flash of insight struck Li Xuan. Looking at Meng Chong, his gaze changed - a person with such an extraordinary mind would be the perfect disciple for him.</p><p></p><p>This disciple was right in front of him!</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, the mysterious aura around Li Xuan grew even more profound, and the image of a peerless expert became even more towering.</p><p></p><p>Reaching out, he grasped Meng Chong's arm.</p><p></p><p>While feeling and pressing Meng Chong's arm and shoulders, he spoke, "Not bad, not bad, young man. I see you have exceptional bone structure, you are a true talent in the martial arts. Are you willing to become my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was stunned, the senior was actually going to take Meng Chong as a disciple?</p><p></p><p>Realizing that he had been planning to capture Meng Chong to claim the reward, he was suddenly drenched in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Thud!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong immediately knelt down and kowtowed reverently, "Disciple Meng Chong pays respects to the Master!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good, good!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed, his face beaming with delight.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a sharp mind, and his thought process was unusual. He would certainly be able to successfully cultivate the techniques Li Xuan had created.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the burly and bald Meng Chong, Li Xuan already had an idea of what kind of cultivation technique he should teach him.</p><p></p><p>Having accepted a disciple, Li Xuan no longer had the desire to wander around. </p><p></p><p>He prepared to return to his residence with Meng Chong, but suddenly thought of something and looked at Shi Er, "Does your Heavenly Mother Sect have treasures like the Nine-Leaf Primordial Essence and the Thousand-Year Mountain Ginseng?"</p><p></p><p>He had suddenly remembered that Xu Yan's ability to rapidly refine his skin and bones was likely related to consuming the Nine-Leaf Primordial Essence and Thousand-Year Mountain Ginseng.</p><p></p><p>Since he had accepted a disciple, and the initial stage of cultivation was about refining one's qi and blood, providing Meng Chong with precious medicines like the Nine-Leaf Primordial Essence would certainly help him progress faster in his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Although the cultivation techniques were different, the first realm was still the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>It was also a matter of tempering one's qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's physique was undoubtedly stronger than Xu Yan's initial condition, and his qi and blood were more vigorous.</p><p></p><p>If he had the assistance of precious medicines in his cultivation, he would definitely be able to break through the initial stage faster.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Without any precious medicinal pills, the Heaven Mother Sect has many supreme martial artists in the jianghu, and their disciples are widespread, so they should have access to these precious medicinal pills.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er was overjoyed to hear this.</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity to get on good terms with this reclusive expert.</p><p></p><p>However, these medicinal pills alone cannot make them become true experts.</p><p></p><p>"Bring some over!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said without any politeness.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, senior!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er hurriedly nodded.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked very satisfied. He was not worried about Shi Er and the others running away, for where could they go?</p><p></p><p>"Have that young lady from the Heaven Mother Sect come visit when she has time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er was stunned for a moment, but quickly agreed.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Heaven Mother Sect would come or not, that was not his concern. He just had to agree to whatever the senior instructed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction and, taking his new disciple Meng Chong, returned to his residence.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In Yunshan County, Li Xuan had just taken on a new disciple.</p><p></p><p>In the prefectural city, Xu Yan once again displayed his extraordinary might.</p><p></p><p>He beat up a group of Heaven Mother Sect's top experts, including Kou Ruozhi, to the point that they could only use less than a third of their martial arts abilities for half a month.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi was completely devastated.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person is this? We have all kowtowed and submitted to him, yet he beat us half to death!</p><p></p><p>The reason Xu Yan gave was also too brutal.</p><p></p><p>"Your abilities are a bit too high, and I'm afraid my father can't handle you, so I beat you half to death to weaken your abilities. </p><p></p><p>"I don't kill you because I still find you useful, killing you would be a waste."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said this very seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven Mother Sect's experts were crushed in their hearts. Just because of this reason, he beat them half to death!</p><p></p><p>What do you mean our abilities are a bit too high? </p><p></p><p>You're giving us too much credit!</p><p></p><p>"What? You're not satisfied?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his brow and glared at Kou Ruozhi, "I see your eyes seem quite unsatisfied?"</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi's face turned pale, and he hurriedly spoke, "I'm satisfied! I'm satisfied from the bottom of my heart!"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit afraid of Xu Yan. This kid's mind worked in strange ways, always misunderstanding people.</p><p></p><p>Was that an unsatisfied look in my eyes? </p><p></p><p>Damn it, it's because I'm in so much pain that my eyelids are twitching!</p><p></p><p>"Good, as long as you're satisfied!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in satisfaction, about to turn and leave, but suddenly he stopped in his tracks and turned back, glaring at Kou Ruozhi angrily, "Your bones may be satisfied, but is your heart satisfied?"</p><p></p><p>He imagined that Kou Ruozhi was cunning and treacherous, outwardly saying he was satisfied, but not saying his heart was satisfied.</p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi looked quite devastated, silently cursing in his heart, what's wrong with this kid, why is he always staring at me?</p><p></p><p>"I'm satisfied! Satisfied in my heart, mind, and every part of my body!" </p><p></p><p>Kou Ruozhi hurriedly swore.</p><p></p><p>The other Heaven Mother Sect experts had all curled up on the ground. Even though their bodies were in excruciating pain, they didn't dare tremble at all, afraid of triggering Xu Yan's misunderstanding.</p><p></p><p>"Good, as long as you're satisfied."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan then turned and left.</p><p></p><p>The prefectural city of Donghe was still in an uproar, with a fervent search for martial arts experts. The government offices were not in operation, and Jiang Pingshan had moved in with the Xu family, essentially being controlled by the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had dealt with all the potentially threatening forces and jianghu experts in and around the prefectural city, beating them until they were completely submissive and unable to fight for half a month.</p><p></p><p>Only the Xu family's guards maintained their full strength.</p><p></p><p>Before setting out for the capital, to avoid any unexpected incidents, he deliberately instructed his parents that if the situation changed, they could hide in Yunshan County.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

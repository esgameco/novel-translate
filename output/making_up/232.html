        <h1>Chapter 232</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>The cultivators of the scattered sects did not dare to offend these two powerful forces at all. Even if they suffered oppression, they could only endure it in silence. </p><p></p><p>If they dared to resist or even attack, they would inevitably meet their demise! For the stewards of the Yushen Sect and the Sujia Clan, although Xu Yan had some strength, they represented the Yushen Sect and the Sujia Clan. How would a mere scattered cultivator dare to defy them? Who would have thought that Xu Yan would actually attack!</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about the forces behind them at all! "You're courting death!"</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect steward was furious, raising his hand to attack Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He was a late-stage Xiao Tianren cultivator! The Sujia Clan steward also had a cold gaze, suddenly striking out with a powerful punch, the huge fist print crashing down like a small mountain! Although Xu Yan was only at the Perfected Penetration realm, he had accumulated a solid foundation for some time, and his strength was growing daily. Moreover, the Xunfeng Sword Intent was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The mountain and river sword intent emerged, instantly enveloping and sweeping through, causing the gentle breeze to suddenly become fierce, blowing within the mountains and rivers!</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect steward was suddenly shocked, as if a gale was blowing through his spiritual consciousness. </p><p></p><p>A tearing sensation came in waves.</p><p></p><p>"Ah!"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but let out a miserable scream, his attack faltering.</p><p></p><p>The sudden, unexpected pain, before he could even fully unleash his strength, the sword light had already descended! </p><p></p><p>In a fierce duel between experts, life and death are decided in an instant! Pu! The Yushen Sect steward was instantly slain.</p><p></p><p>And the huge fist print was just about to strike down, but Xu Yan's figure moved, instantly changing position and appearing beside the Sujia Clan steward.</p><p></p><p>Spatial Shift!</p><p></p><p>He struck again with his sword.</p><p></p><p>The sudden slaying of the Yushen Sect steward left the Sujia Clan steward greatly alarmed, he even couldn't understand how a single sword strike could not be blocked and he was instantly killed! At this moment, he felt a strong sense of danger.</p><p></p><p>"I am from the Sujia Clan, how dare you kill me?"</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but roar in a forceful yet weak manner.</p><p></p><p>"Killing you has nothing to do with your background!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly smiled, the thunderous sword descended like divine retribution.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Sujia Clan steward struck out with a punch, while also moving to flee.</p><p></p><p>But at that moment, his spiritual consciousness was suddenly blown by a fierce wind, almost torn apart, the excruciating pain causing his eyeballs to nearly pop out! "What kind of cultivation method is this?"</p><p></p><p>The Sujia Clan steward was greatly terrified!</p><p></p><p>This was not the spiritual suppression of a Liangshen Tianren, but seemed to be a bizarre martial art that directly tore apart his spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>He now understood why the Yushen Sect's steward was killed! The Sujia Clan steward's attacks were disrupted and scattered due to the excruciating spiritual pain, and even the figure that was about to flee was suddenly halted.</p><p></p><p>In this critical moment, the Sujia Clan steward frantically activated the Gathering Spirit technique, trying to eliminate the tearing of his spiritual consciousness and resist the bizarre gale-like assault.</p><p></p><p>But the thunderous sword had already descended! "The Sujia Clan will not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>The Sujia Clan steward let out a final roar as he was about to die.</p><p></p><p>Pu! After slaying the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan stewards, Xu Yan reached out and collected their storage bags, the surging sword intent directly turning them into ashes!</p><p></p><p>Yulong's head poked out from Xu Yan's sleeve, shocked and said, "You killed the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan stewards? This is going to cause a huge commotion, the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan will definitely not let you off!"</p><p></p><p>In the Yuzhou region, it had been a long time since any scattered cultivator dared to kill people from the three sects and five major clans.</p><p></p><p>"So what if I killed them, what can the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan do?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't care at all.</p><p></p><p>"You will be hunted down, quickly flee, or else it will be too late to escape."</p><p></p><p>Yulong said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"Who knows, there might even be Liangshen Tianren coming to hunt you down!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained calm as he said, "What of the Liangshen Tianren?"</p><p></p><p>He was indeed no match for the Liangshen Tianren, but with the Tong Xing Tong Chen technique, he could evade their search, as long as he was cautious, the Liangshen Tianren might not be able to find him.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly flee, the Liangshen Tianren won't easily take action, but the Great Tianren experts will definitely come after you."</p><p></p><p>Yulong said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Great Tianren experts are no problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, the threat of the Great Tianren experts was not too great for him.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't be careless either.</p><p></p><p>If he was not wary, what if a few of them surrounded and attacked him?</p><p></p><p>He could no longer go to Qinglin City, Xu Yan also felt a sense of urgency, he must quickly accumulate enough foundation to break through to the Shenyi Realm.</p><p></p><p>As long as he broke through to the Shenyi Realm, he would be invincible below the Liangshen Tianren! Even if he faced a Liangshen Tianren, as long as he didn't hide himself with the Tong Xing Tong Chen technique, he could still flee right under their noses!</p><p></p><p>The Shenyi Realm was a huge advancement.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, find the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took to the skies, heading towards the vast mountains where the Earth Spirit Dragon Qi was located.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master, the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan stewards have come to hunt down that talented youth!"</p><p></p><p>In the branch of the Wanshi Alliance, the man who had reminded Xu Yan hurriedly reported.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go right away!"</p><p></p><p>The Hall Master's expression changed, immediately grabbing the man and soaring into the sky, swiftly departing.</p><p></p><p>"Looks like we're too late, that talented youth may have been captured already."</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Hall Master's gaze focused, observing the battlefield, from the remaining traces of the battle, it had ended quickly and was not very intense.</p><p></p><p>Frowning, he said, "Go to Qinglin City to inquire and gather intelligence, find out why the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan wanted to capture that young man, what is their purpose."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Hall Master!"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>In Qinglin City, at the Leiyu Pavilion, Xu Yan's bounty was still posted.</p><p></p><p>However, it was said that some cultivators had brought news of the young man's whereabouts and received the reward.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan stewards had already gone to capture him.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the Leiyu Pavilion couldn't help but envy him, not only had the scattered cultivator received the reward, but he had also pleased the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan. If the stewards took a liking to him, perhaps he would have the opportunity to join the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan.</p><p></p><p>Once one became a cultivator of the spiritual sects or major clans, even if only a low-ranking subordinate, it would be far better than being a scattered cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man entered the Leiyu Pavilion, finding some Wanshi Alliance cultivators, and secretly exchanged information. What puzzled him was that there was no news of the young man being captured.</p><p></p><p>Was it not announced publicly, or had they failed to capture him? The bounty was still posted, not canceled, indicating the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan stewards had not yet returned. Or perhaps they had taken the person elsewhere and had not yet had the chance to cancel the bounty.</p><p></p><p>A day later.</p><p></p><p>Two elders appeared at the Leiyu Pavilion, followed by several cultivators with an aura of ruthlessness.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators in the Leiyu Pavilion were immediately alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Great Tianren experts! And they were the Great Tianren of the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan, with the few cultivators behind them being the guardians of the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan, responsible for hunting down and eliminating their enemies.</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man's heart trembled, a shocking realization dawning on him.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Yushen Sect and Sujia Clan stewards were killed by the young man? At his age, how could he have killed the stewards of the spiritual sect and major clan? </p><p></p><p>After all, the cultivation methods of the spiritual sects and major clans were generally stronger than those of the scattered cultivators, so their cultivators were usually more powerful.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there were also some powerful scattered cultivators who were on par with their counterparts.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They lost to the Spiritual Sect and the aristocratic warriors, but after all, there were not many such wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was due to the fact that they had obtained fortuitous encounters and their cultivation techniques were relatively strong.</p><p></p><p>"Provide the whereabouts of this person, the reward is one million spirit crystals and one bottle of Spirit Gathering Pill; the one who captures this person will be rewarded with one bottle of Spirit Gathering Pill and one low-grade spiritual artifact."</p><p></p><p>The elder of the Jade Spirit Sect spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>In the Thunder Cloud Hall, the group of warriors immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>"Those who provide clues and assist in the capture of this person can gain entry into the Shu Family's outer guard warriors."</p><p></p><p>The Shu Family elder also spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The wandering cultivators were instantly excited, as this was an opportunity to break out of the ranks of wandering cultivators and become aristocratic warriors! In an instant, many wandering cultivators left in pursuit of Xu Yan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>The news spread quickly, and within a day, it had spread throughout the entire Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family were jointly pursuing a wandering cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts world of Yuzhou was shaken, this was much more shocking than the Dai Family's pursuit of Wen Yong.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Spirit Sect was the number one sect in Yuzhou, the head of the three sects, and the Shu Family was also one of the five great aristocratic families. For them to jointly pursue a wandering cultivator was an unprecedented event in the history of Yuzhou's martial arts world!</p><p></p><p>The Dai Family was, after all, only a second-rate aristocratic family!</p><p></p><p>Many forces in Yuzhou were investigating Xu Yan's identity, just who was this person.</p><p></p><p>And they were also investigating why the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family were pursuing this young man.</p><p></p><p>Soon, many forces as well as some well-informed wandering cultivators learned the reason! The Qingtianjiao Tomb!</p><p></p><p>The young man had fought against the transformed Qingtianjiao, and in the end, the Qingtianjiao disappeared, and the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family were pursuing the matter of the Qingtianjiao.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the envoy sent to capture the young man died!</p><p></p><p>There was no need to ask, it was obvious that he had been killed by the young man.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family were so enraged, and they issued the bounty!</p><p></p><p>"I see!"</p><p></p><p>The hall master of the Wanshi Alliance branch had a look of sudden enlightenment on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Finding the whereabouts of this person, this kind of courageous and daring to offend the Spiritual Sect and the aristocratic families genius, is exactly what we Wanshi Alliance lack!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, hall master!"</p><p></p><p>The Wanshi Alliance was in action, searching for Xu Yan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>As for Xu Yan's identity, no one knew it so far.</p><p></p><p>In a city, Shen Haizhou muttered to himself, "This brother is truly fierce, he killed the people of the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family without any hesitation, worthy of being the one who subdued the Qingtianjiao.</p><p></p><p>"This is a great opportunity, this brother is being pursued, if I can help him escape danger, won't this friendship be established?"</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was overjoyed and hurriedly mobilized Shen Family's intelligence system to also participate in the search for Xu Yan's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"If all goes well, this brother should flee Yuzhou, and the most likely place would be from Yuzhou's Mangshan."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou judged.</p><p></p><p>The Mangshan on the outskirts of Yuzhou was the inevitable path for many fleeing wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>As long as they entered Mangshan, they could use Mangshan to avoid pursuit and have a greater chance of escaping Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>Although the wandering cultivators all knew that the Spiritual Sect and the aristocratic families would definitely focus their search on Mangshan, apart from Mangshan, the chances of escaping from other places were slim.</p><p></p><p>Only Mangshan had a chance.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Mangshan stretched for thousands of miles, the Spiritual Sect and the aristocratic families could not guard it all.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou set out for Mangshan, his heart filled with excitement, "I have a feeling that this brother is definitely a fierce person, just like the Blood Demon back then!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued on his way, heading straight for Mangshan.</p><p></p><p>"I feel that there may be some trouble, the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family may ambush you in Mangshan!" </p><p></p><p>Yulong said with concern.</p><p></p><p>"How would they know that I'm going to Mangshan?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>"Mangshan is the place where wandering cultivators flee, all the wandering cultivators who have offended the Spiritual Sect and the aristocratic families will flee from Mangshan."</p><p></p><p>Yulong said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned and said, "Where is the earth dragon qi in Mangshan, will it be discovered?"</p><p></p><p>"Mangshan is vast, how could it be easily discovered? As long as you can enter Mangshan, the problem will not be that big."</p><p></p><p>Yulong said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Entering Mangshan is not difficult."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his expression changed, and he turned his head to look at a distance.</p><p></p><p>There, a warrior was holding a scroll, looking at him while also looking down at the scroll.</p><p></p><p>"Quick, kill him!"</p><p></p><p>Yulong hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't need it to speak, he had already slashed towards the man.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, instantly appearing in front of the other party.</p><p></p><p>Puchi! The warrior was instantly killed, judging from his attire, he seemed to be a warrior from some third-rate aristocratic family.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grabbed the scroll, the portrait in it showed a handsome man holding a sword across his chest.</p><p></p><p>"Very good, Jade Spirit Sect and Shu Family, I remember you!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The true essence surged, and the scroll instantly turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment, he couldn't be so high-profile, flying in the air would be easily noticed.</p><p></p><p>Descending from the air, Xu Yan changed his clothes, and with the control of his true essence, his facial muscles moved, causing his appearance to change.</p><p></p><p>"Your change in appearance can't hide from people."</p><p></p><p>Yulong said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"As long as they don't examine it closely, it won't be discovered."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>As long as no one came close to carefully examine him, they would not be able to discover that he had changed his appearance.</p><p></p><p>Then, he used the Harmonize with the World technique, his aura blending in with the surrounding environment.</p><p></p><p>Yulong was somewhat surprised, it was coiled around Xu Yan's wrist, only feeling that Xu Yan's aura seemed to have undergone some changes, but it didn't think much of it.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, quickly head to Mangshan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a sense of urgency in his heart, the Penetrating Realm was ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>Now that he was being pursued by the Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family, he must quickly break through to the Spiritual Perception Realm, only then would he truly have the confidence to deal with the pursuit of the two major forces.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after breaking through to the Spiritual Perception Realm, the Xunfeng Sword Intent would also undergo a transformation, becoming even more powerful, even the spiritual cultivations of the Refined Spirit Celestials might not be able to withstand it!</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Perception Realm was a crucial step, and only after breaking through it could the profound martial arts truly display their full power.</p><p></p><p>Walking through the mountains and forests, Xu Yan's speed was not slow.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! In the air, a Great Celestial Warrior passed by in exploration.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan used the Harmonize with the World technique, and the other party did not detect Xu Yan's presence, in the exploration of the Great Celestial, Xu Yan was just a piece of wood beside the big tree.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, there were Great Celestials coming to hunt him one after another.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Spirit Sect and the Shu Family are indeed impressive, these Great Celestials one after another, they really think highly of me Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>It was just killing two envoys, yet they had stirred up such a commotion? "Perhaps, it's not because I killed their people, but because of the Qingtianjiao."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Continuing towards Mangshan, there were constantly warriors coming to explore, seeing this, Xu Yan could only continue to go to the wilderness, the areas with high mountains and dense forests.</p><p></p><p>He also understood why the wandering cultivators all chose to flee Yuzhou from Mangshan.</p><p></p><p>It was because on the way to Mangshan, the mountains were many and the forests were dense, which was convenient for hiding oneself.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Xu Yan's expression changed.</p><p></p><p>His hand reached into his sleeve, grabbing Yulong's neck, and his figure instantly hid in a thicket of thorns and weeds.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

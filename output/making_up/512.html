        <h1>Chapter 512</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"You're familiar with those people from Taicang, so use that as a reference for strength and just keep deceiving him. Why are you asking me for ideas about your little game?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, as the Patriarch of the Dao, naturally couldn't teach Tianzi how to fool people, as that would damage his image as Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>However, he still provided Tianzi with some ideas.</p><p></p><p>Deceiving the Blood Demon was meant to delay the actions of the Unmelting Palace and buy more time.</p><p></p><p>"You should be careful, he may summon more blood souls here," Li Xuan reminded.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I'm the Heavenly Dao. He can't just summon blood souls here as he pleases," Tianzi chuckled.</p><p></p><p>The laws of the Taicang world were very powerful. The Blood Demon had managed to smuggle in one blood soul with limited power through some method, which is how he succeeded. </p><p></p><p>If his true self wanted to summon more blood souls, it wouldn't be so easy.</p><p></p><p>The true power of the Blood Demon was certainly no match for Taicang.</p><p></p><p>"Didn't you say you wanted to treat his illness? Just ask my third disciple. Though she's in seclusion for a breakthrough recently. Wait until after her breakthrough and have her give you some ideas."</p><p></p><p>With that, Li Xuan disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu would certainly be very interested in the Blood Demon and want to study him.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's eyes lit up, suddenly getting an idea. He couldn't come up with too many tricks on his own, but he could ask others for ideas!</p><p></p><p>So he went directly to Canglang Island to find Xu Junhe.</p><p></p><p>As it happened, Kou Ruozhi was there too.</p><p></p><p>Having interacted with Tianzi more, Xu Junhe knew that this avatar of the Heavenly Dao still had a childish mentality and liked to play around, but also didn't interfere with the rules of Heaven and could remain impartial.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had trapped an outside expert and wanted to toy with him, Xu Junhe naturally wouldn't refuse to give ideas. After pondering briefly, he offered a few suggestions.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked at Kou Ruozhi and said, "Kou Ruozhi, you're more devious and have more wicked ideas. Why don't you offer some suggestions too?"</p><p></p><p>The corner of Kou Ruozhi's mouth twitched. What did he mean by saying I'm more devious? As if you, Xu Junhe, aren't devious yourself?</p><p></p><p>With Kou Ruozhi joining in, Tianzi immediately got excited. Having others give ideas really was different!</p><p></p><p>"I got it, I know what to do now."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi immediately left, transforming into the appearance of an herb gatherer and returning to the thatched cottage with a basket on his back.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon was still by the pond, staring at the two golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>"Those are little golden dragons I've raised for some time. When you've recovered and need to cultivate, I'll go catch a few outside, kill them and stew them for you as nourishment."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Blood Demon's heart both trembled with excitement and fear. Dragons as powerful as Ao Hong, casually caught and killed for stew? But thinking of the chance to eat dragon meat comparable to Ao Hong, he became extremely excited, his eyes almost glowing red.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, are there many dragons in the wilderness?" </p><p></p><p>"Not too many, probably a few hundred thousand. Ones with good qualities like these two are rare, but there are quite a few with strength equal to these two.</p><p></p><p>Of course, we can't make a big fuss about stewing dragons. After all, some old dragons are very, very powerful, though they're guarding certain places and can't come out for now."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi started spouting nonsense.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon was shocked in his heart, becoming more determined to stay and seize this great opportunity. </p><p></p><p>As for the mission in the Taicang world? That wasn't important. Grasping this opportunity was more important than occupying Taicang, since he couldn't advance further even if he took over Taicang.</p><p></p><p>But this opportunity could allow him the possibility of advancing further.</p><p></p><p>"If I can cultivate to the Realm of Establishing the Dao, I'll surely surpass Taicang, and even surpass that one!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, the Blood Demon wanted to kowtow and take him as master.</p><p></p><p>But the herb gatherer showed no intention of accepting him as disciple, so he could only hold back for now. He would wait until he was "cured" and the herb gatherer passed on techniques to him before finding a chance to formally become his disciple!</p><p></p><p>Tianzi placed a large cauldron in the courtyard. This cauldron was formed from the rules of the Heavenly Dao, so the Blood Demon naturally couldn't see through it. He only felt that this cauldron was truly extraordinary, an supreme treasure he had never seen before!</p><p></p><p>A roaring fire burned under the cauldron. Tianzi threw some "medicinal herbs" into the cauldron. These herbs looked extraordinary, but were of course all formed from the rules of the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, with each herb Tianzi threw in, the Blood Demon's heart shook. These herbs were all unheard of to him, beyond his knowledge, far more miraculous than any divine herbs he had ever seen.</p><p></p><p>The medicinal liquid in the cauldron began to boil. There was no smell, but an indescribable essence lingered within.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, get into the cauldron."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi looked at the Blood Demon with a serious expression. "Your condition is quite severe. You've been too deeply influenced by that one's dao rhyme, from your physical body to your soul. Heavy medicine is needed to cure you. Of course, once cured, you'll turn misfortune into blessing and transform yourself.</p><p></p><p>However, the premise for all this is that you can endure it. You should know that this process will be extremely painful and difficult to bear, not just physically but even more so for your soul."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Blood Demon understood in his heart, "If I can endure this, I'll undergo a transformation, greatly improving my aptitude. I'll be able to successfully cultivate to the Realm of Establishing the Dao, and maybe even surpass it.</p><p></p><p>This is a great opportunity! I must seize it no matter what. What kind of person am I, Blood Demon? How could I not bear a little pain!"</p><p></p><p>The herbs in the cauldron were all marvelously extraordinary. Even a fool would know how precious this cauldron of medicine was. As for the pain involved, the Blood Demon didn't take it seriously at all.</p><p></p><p>To him, what was a little pain? He wasn't some martial arts novice. What kind of pain couldn't he endure?</p><p></p><p>"Elder, rest assured, I definitely won't disappoint you. Even if I'm cut by a thousand knives, I can endure this bit of pain. For the sake of curing my condition and becoming a supreme expert, I can certainly withstand this trial!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon solemnly promised.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi showed a gratified expression. Seeing this, the Blood Demon became even more convinced that this was a test from the herb gatherer. Once he passed, he would be taught martial arts and accepted as disciple!</p><p></p><p>"Get in then!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Elder!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon didn't hesitate at all. He took off his clothes and decisively jumped into the cauldron.</p><p></p><p>"Hiss!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as he entered the cauldron, the Blood Demon's whole body began to tremble. He almost jumped right back out, but gritted his teeth and endured in the end!</p><p></p><p>Pain! It was too painful! His whole body felt like it was on fire, as if suffering a thousand cuts, as if being struck and burned by thunder and flames. It wasn't just physical pain, but even more so pain of the soul.</p><p></p><p>"Endure!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon took a deep breath, gritting his teeth to endure.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, not bad. With such willpower, your illness will certainly be cured, and you'll be able to transform from this!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's eyes showed approval, but inside he was laughing gleefully. Just wait and see how I torment you!</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is testing me!"</p><p></p><p>The Blood Demon became even more determined. No matter what, he had to persist and endure. This was a great opportunity!</p><p></p><p>Looking down at the medicinal liquid in the cauldron, it was a mix of five colors, looking quite hair-raising.</p><p></p><p>"You need to endure in the cauldron for eighty-one days. Only then will the first step of treatment be complete, and your..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Your constitution will undergo some transformations..." Tianzi said solemnly while adding medicinal ingredients to the large cauldron.</p><p></p><p>He kept making grand promises to Blood Demon, saying that after enduring the process, he would gain tremendous benefits, his aptitude would transform, and he could cultivate to the Establishing the Way realm or even beyond.</p><p></p><p>In short, he kept painting a bigger and bigger picture of rewards.</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon's scalp tingled - endure for 81 days? "I must persevere. How could I, Blood Demon, fail to endure this!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Demon silently encouraged himself.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi waved his hands, and layers of light appeared in the large cauldron, completely enveloping Blood Demon. "I'm going to seal the cauldron now. Don't struggle. The pain will intensify day by day. I will temporarily seal the cauldron shut, and you just need to endure.</p><p></p><p>"If you really can't bear it, you can cry out or even thrash around, as long as you don't come out of the cauldron. If you're worried you can't endure but want to persist, you can tell me, and I'll completely seal the cauldron so you can't jump out."</p><p></p><p>The pain will intensify day by day? Blood Demon felt uncertain - would he really be unable to endure in the end? Gritting his teeth, he said resolutely: "Senior, please seal the cauldron. I will either cure my condition and endure this process, or I'd rather die here!"</p><p></p><p>"Good, good!" Tianzi looked pleased again.</p><p></p><p>"You just endure. I'll go find a few more precious herbs, and catch a true dragon to help boost your transformation."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Blood Demon was overjoyed. He had made the right bet and gained the herb gatherer's approval.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi covered the cauldron and completely sealed it.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Demon, endure well in there. This is just the beginning..."</p><p></p><p>A smile appeared on Tianzi's lips. Although he wasn't torturing Blood Demon's true self, this was close enough.</p><p></p><p>"Can I use this blood soul to trick Blood Demon?" </p><p></p><p>Tianzi began to consider the feasibility of this.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, agonized screams came from the cauldron. Blood Demon was thrashing about and wailing. He even somewhat regretted it - what the hell kind of medicinal liquid was this?</p><p></p><p>Both his physical body and soul were being tortured. Even though this blood soul wasn't very strong, its toughness and ability to endure pain far surpassed ordinary martial artists. </p><p></p><p>Yet even he couldn't withstand this torment.</p><p></p><p>"This Blood Demon, how pitiful!" Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"However, Blood Demon's strength is quite formidable. A Lord of Heaven and Earth, another powerful expert outside the Seven Lords of Heaven and Earth. How many experts in the Unformed Divine Palace are comparable to Lords of Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked up at the sky. Outside of heaven and earth was a chaotic, unformed realm with no visible end.</p><p></p><p>The location of the Unformed Divine Palace in the unformed realm was unknown, and its distance from the Taicang Heaven and Earth was unclear.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Li Xuan noticed a faint red color appearing in a certain area of the unformed realm, which surprised him.</p><p></p><p>"What's that?"</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Heaven and Earth?! "What's happening in the Netherworld Heaven and Earth? Are those Blood Lords battling?"</p><p></p><p>The distance was quite far. Even with Li Xuan's Heavenly Dao Eye, he couldn't clearly see the specific situation from within the Taicang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>"The Netherworld Dao principle passages connecting to the edge of Taicang Heaven and Earth, meant for entering the Taicang Heavenly Cave, have all been severed. Have they completely abandoned their plans to invade Taicang Heaven and Earth?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan frowned slightly, feeling that this matter was unusual.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Cave of the Divine Realm was invaded from the outside, and one of the invading parties was the Netherworld. Now the Netherworld had severed the Netherworld Dao principle passages extending to outside the Heavenly Cave, seemingly completely giving up on invading Taicang.</p><p></p><p>"Is there internal strife in the Netherworld, or has some change occurred?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly narrowed his eyes, "Is this the Unformed Divine Palace's doing? Have the Blood Lords of the Netherworld Heaven and Earth joined the Unformed Divine Palace?"</p><p></p><p>Just then, he vaguely sensed an aura - an aura that surpassed the Realm Lord level, comparable to a Lord of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>To be precise, it was a Lord of Heaven and Earth entering the Netherworld!...</p><p></p><p>The unformed realm was hazy and chaotic, filled with unformed qi. The spiritual energy was extremely violent. Looking out, the chaos extended endlessly - no living being had ever walked out of the unformed realm.</p><p></p><p>Yet within the unformed realm, there was a huge, dazzlingly beautiful sphere. On the surface of this sphere, there were faint, tiny holes visible.</p><p></p><p>This sphere stood out conspicuously in the unformed realm, like a gorgeous gem in the darkness.</p><p></p><p>The violent spiritual energy of the unformed realm gathered around and enveloped the sphere. That layer of brilliant, colorful light was the scene formed by the illumination of the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>Taicang Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>This gorgeous gem in the unformed realm was the Taicang Heaven and Earth. The Dao principles operated, forming a barrier for heaven and earth. Spiritual energy gathered and circled within, creating the spherical shape.</p><p></p><p>Far from the Taicang Heaven and Earth, there was another realm that appeared like a broken sphere with a dark red color. Although spiritual energy gathered there as well, the Dao principles of this realm were constantly depleting.</p><p></p><p>This realm lacked the splendor of Taicang Heaven and Earth and was much smaller. It gave more of an evil and strange feeling, like a realm of blood seas and netherworld.</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld Heaven and Earth!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it was the Netherworld Heaven and Earth that had already partially collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Judging from the collapse of the Netherworld Heaven and Earth, one could imagine how fierce the previous battle had been.</p><p></p><p>Within the broken Netherworld Heaven and Earth, there remained Netherworld martial artists who had survived the previous battle, including a few minor Lords of Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>A broken realm cannot last long, so the Blood Lords of the Netherworld wanted to enter the Taicang Heaven and Earth to gain a foothold. For the Realm Lords of Taicang Heaven and Earth, this meant sharing their resources, which they naturally wouldn't agree to.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, conflicts had never ceased, but the Netherworld had always failed to achieve its goal. After all, their strength was ultimately inferior to that of Taicang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>On the other side of Taicang Heaven and Earth, there was another broken realm - the Demon-Witch Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>In terms of the degree of damage, the Demon-Witch Heaven and Earth was slightly better than the Netherworld Heaven and Earth, but its Dao principles were also depleting. Over time, the Demon-Witch Heaven and Earth would inevitably become a dead realm.</p><p></p><p>The powerful beings from both the Netherworld and the Demon-Witch realms wanted to enter Taicang Heaven and Earth to gain a foothold, but none had succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Besides these two realms, in the unformed realm surrounding Taicang Heaven and Earth, there were many unformed true spirits eyeing Taicang Heaven and Earth covetously, wanting to enter it.</p><p></p><p>The gorgeous realm held a strong attraction for the unformed true spirits.</p><p></p><p>However, these unformed true spirits were repelled by the Dao principles of the realm and couldn't enter. But Taicang Heaven and Earth had Heavenly Caves, and some unformed true spirits entered through these caves, bypassing the barrier of the Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>However, entering through the Heavenly Caves was limited by strength - unformed true spirits that were too powerful couldn't enter.</p><p></p><p>The three realms, separated by certain distances, stood in the unformed realm, with some form of connection existing between them.</p><p></p><p>Initially, there were seven major realms, with Taicang at the forefront and at the center of the seven realms.</p><p></p><p>But now, only three realms remained, and the whereabouts of the other four realms were unknown.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

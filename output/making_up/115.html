        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 115: Swallowing the Mountain Toad, Storing in the Spatial Bag</p><p></p><p>"The Grandmaster is right, the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion has a good reputation, so it's possible that they only have ordinary items and not worth their effort to target, or even if they did, it hasn't been revealed yet," Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said, "It's similar to the situation in the Borderland Jianghu, we still need to be careful."</p><p></p><p>"Sister, is there anything else?" Meng Chong asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>The inner domain is much more interesting than the Borderland!</p><p></p><p>"The inner domain has three major countries - the Great Yue, the Yan, and the Purple Cloud. Among them, the Great Yue is the strongest. When entering the inner domain from the Borderland, you'll be in the territory of the Great Yue..."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu thought for a moment and introduced the Great Yue, as it's the first country one would encounter when entering the inner domain from the Borderland.</p><p></p><p>The forces in the inner domain are complex, with the three major countries having their own intricate power structures and smaller forces vying for influence.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Yue has a unique feature - it has five vassal kings, each a regional overlord with a Grand Master protecting them, not to be underestimated..."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu briefly introduced the five vassal kings of the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>"There are many sects, forces, and noble families in the inner domain, but only a few of the most powerful ones have an unshakable position due to their long-standing heritage.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Academy is known as the number one academy in the world, not under the control of any dynasty. It recruits talented individuals from all backgrounds, and many powerful figures have emerged from it, even founding their own sects.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Academy's influence is second only to the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Saint Cliff is the number one sect in the inner domain for the Sword Dao, and its strength is formidable..."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu introduced some of the major sects and forces in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>When she mentioned the Sword Saint Cliff, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Shi Er were all surprised.</p><p></p><p>"The Sword Saint Cliff is that powerful?" Xu Yan became interested.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the Sword Saint Cliff is very powerful and renowned throughout the inner domain!" Suling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong exchanged a glance, now understanding why Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan had said that they could use their names if they encountered any issues in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>It seems the Sword Saint Cliff wields tremendous influence there.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu then talked about the Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>"The Demon Sect is somewhat special - it has many factions, and most of them cultivate murderous techniques, which are despised by the martial artists. However, some have joined the Demon Sect due to their eccentric personalities or being ostracized.</p><p></p><p>"After the disappearance of the Demon Lord, the Demon Sect's cohesion has diminished. It is now divided into nine major Demon Sovereign factions, with only three of them having clearly identified leaders, while the identities of the other six Demon Sovereigns remain unknown..."</p><p></p><p>The Demon Sect used to be a powerful force that could even suppress the Seven Star Academy, the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion, and the Sword Saint Cliff. But after the disappearance of the Demon Lord, it has fragmented into nine major factions, each with a Demon Sovereign as the leader. However, these Demon Sovereigns are often at odds with each other, preventing the Demon Sect from regaining its former unity.</p><p></p><p>All nine Demon Sovereigns are Grand Master-level experts, but only three of them are known, while the identities of the other six remain a mystery.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu concluded her introduction of the inner domain's forces, saying, "Sister, I only know this much. These forces are renowned in the inner domain, but there's still much more for you to discover.</p><p></p><p>"With your strength, Sister, most sects and forces won't be able to pose a threat to you in the inner domain. You don't need to worry too much."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with excitement, eager to go to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>He thumped his chest and said, "Sister, don't worry, I'll bring back a huge bag of spirit herbs for you to research alchemy!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded, "Yes, I'll also bring back a lot of spirit herbs when I go to the inner domain."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a large bag and said, "Sister, I've already prepared this bag to store the spirit herbs!"</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu was touched, "Brother, just do your best, but your safety is the priority!"</p><p></p><p>"I understand, I'll be careful," Xu Yan nodded, then sighed, "But carrying such a large bag of spirit herbs might not be very convenient. Storing them in the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion would require paying a high storage fee, and when I return to the inner domain, I'd have to carry another big bag."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying's mouth twitched, looking at Xu Yan with a strange expression. This guy is really confident, even before going to the inner domain, he's already sure he can get a huge bag of spirit herbs?</p><p></p><p>"Actually, there's a special treasure in the inner domain called the Spatial Bag. It's the size of a fist, but can hold a huge amount of items," Suling Xiu gestured with her hands.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's spirit was immediately lifted. The inner domain has such a remarkable treasure?</p><p></p><p>Based on Suling Xiu's description, the Spatial Bag has a cubic space inside.</p><p></p><p>"The inner domain actually has this kind of treasure. I wonder if I should try to develop a cultivation method for forging such artifacts?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Of course, to create a unique artifact cultivation method, he would first need to understand the level of artifact forging in the inner domain. If it's already at a very advanced stage, it would be much more difficult for him to come up with something truly distinctive and necessary.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Shi Er were all shocked, amazed that such a wondrous treasure existed.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, how can we obtain this Spatial Bag?" Xu Yan asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Brother, the Spatial Bag can only be made by the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion for now, and it's extremely expensive, even most Grand Masters can't afford it," Suling Xiu said with some helplessness.</p><p></p><p>"The Spatial Bag is difficult to make and very rare. It's created using a rare inner domain spirit toad called the Mountain Swallowing Toad, along with the silk of the Cloud Circling Silkworm.</p><p></p><p>"The Mountain Swallowing Toad is only the size of a fist, but it has the ability to swallow a small mountain. Hunting these toads is not easy, and it's difficult to even find their traces..."</p><p></p><p>According to Suling Xiu, the Spatial Bag is made using the Mountain Swallowing Toad, a spirit toad that can swallow a small mountain despite its fist-sized body. These toads are extremely rare and difficult to find and capture, even for Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the toad, the Cloud Circling Silkworm silk is also an incredibly valuable material.</p><p></p><p>"It's said that the Heaven's Treasure Pavilion has methods to locate and capture the Mountain Swallowing Toads, and they are the only ones selling the Spatial Bags, but the price is astronomical," Suling Xiu said with admiration.</p><p></p><p>She also wishes she could have a Spatial Bag, as it would make carrying spirit herbs and alchemy furnaces much more convenient.</p><p></p><p>"The Seven Star Academy is also rumored to be able to make Spatial Bags, but they don't have the methods to capture the Mountain Swallowing Toads, so they can't produce them," Suling Xiu added.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Swallowing the Mountain Toad is no easy feat, it is something that is extremely rare and hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>It is precisely because of its rarity that those who can afford to use the Spatial Storage Bag, a precious treasure, are extremely few in number.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently, this Spatial Storage Bag can store items much larger than the bag itself, relying on the special properties of the Mountain Toad, and not on the profound mysteries of artifact forging.</p><p></p><p>It is not a matter of mastering the techniques of forging spatial treasures.</p><p></p><p>Even Xie Lingfeng, the sword saint prodigy of the Cliff, does not have a Spatial Storage Bag, which shows how precious this item is.</p><p></p><p>"In the Inner Realm, if you encounter someone with a Spatial Storage Bag, do not doubt it, their background must be extraordinary. It's best not to offend them if possible!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Sister disciple, don't worry, I understand." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, but in his heart, he was pondering how he could obtain a Spatial Storage Bag.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had the same thought.</p><p></p><p>"Sister disciple, make a list of the spiritual herbs you need, and I will do my best to collect them all for you."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, please wait a moment, I'll go make the list of spiritual herbs right away."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded happily and went back to her room to write down the list.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir Classics had many elixir formulas, and in recent days, she had even created some new ones, all of which required spiritual herbs for experimentation.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual herbs were numerous and had diverse properties, and some even contained toxins.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, this is the list of spiritual herbs."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu handed the written list to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took it and memorized all the herbs on the list, then handed it to Meng Chong, saying, "I'll set out for the Inner Realm right away. Sister disciple, please wait for me to bring the herbs back."</p><p></p><p>He was impatient to leave.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, please wait a moment, I'll refine two batches of elixirs for you to take."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu hurriedly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Elixirs?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up, elixirs must be very valuable, right?</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, there are no elixirs in the Inner Realm. As Master said, as long as the value is high enough, even the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion will try to get their hands on them."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, the elixirs cannot be sold."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded seriously.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was very powerful, and he didn't want to be hunted down by them just after entering the Inner Realm because of the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"Once I break through to the Profound Enlightenment Realm, I won't have to worry about this anymore. I'll just smash a Grand Master with a single palm strike, and see who dares to covet them!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, the elixirs I refined for you are healing and detoxifying ones. However, the medicinal materials for refining elixirs only have the Spiritual Grass as a spiritual herb, so the effect will be a bit weaker.</p><p></p><p>But it's still stronger than most of the healing pills in the Inner Realm. As long as you don't mention it, outsiders will just think they are the common pills there, so you don't have to worry about exposing the elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said as she refined the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"Sister disciple, don't worry, I understand."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>After refining two bottles of elixirs, Xu Yan kept one and handed the other to Meng Chong, saying, "My junior brother is also going to the Inner Realm, and the Spiritual Grass is running low. Sister disciple also needs to cultivate, so there's no need to refine more healing elixirs. One bottle is enough for me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the elixir and said, "The elder brother is right, the Spiritual Grass should be saved for sister disciple to temper the Evergreen Bone."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's eyes were red, since the escape, she had not felt the warmth of being cared for.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, elder brother!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knelt down in front of his master, "Master, I'm going to the Inner Realm now. Do you have any instructions for me?"</p><p></p><p>Looking at his eldest disciple, Li Xuan sighed deeply, the scenes of Xu Yan's diligent cultivation in the small mountain village flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>Among the three disciples, he had the deepest affection and highest expectations for Xu Yan. The advancement of the Dao depended entirely on this eldest disciple.</p><p></p><p>Now, Xu Yan was going to venture into the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, remember, arrogance and contempt are the traits of a reckless man. Being eager to learn and studious is the true mark of a martial artist. When you go to the Inner Realm, learn more, observe more, and comprehend more. Do not think that just because it is a false martial art, there is nothing to be gained from it.</p><p></p><p>"This kind of mentality must not be allowed. You should approach it with a heart of learning, extract the essence, and integrate it into your own Dao, to open up and innovate.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, safety comes first. If you encounter enemies, kill them if you can, flee if you can't. There's nothing shameful about that. Those who stubbornly fight to the death are reckless fools.</p><p></p><p>"If you face powerful enemies, you must understand the art of hiding and evading..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan rambled on.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you must also remember this."</p><p></p><p>He then looked at Meng Chong and said.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, I will remember your teachings!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully kowtowed three times.</p><p></p><p>He stood up, patted Meng Chong on the chest, and said, "Junior brother, I'll be waiting for you in the Inner Realm!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded firmly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around, then at the Crimson Cat lying next to Shi Er, sighing inwardly. This Crimson-Eyed Tiger was much more formidable than the one he had killed.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson-Eyed Tigers and Fire-Maned Wolves in the Demon Forest were all arranged by Master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt deeply moved. After taking him as a disciple, his master had paved the way for his cultivation.</p><p></p><p>His figure soared into the sky and disappeared into the distance, heading straight for the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong, Su Lingxiu, and the others looked up, Xu Yan's figure had already vanished.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'll go cultivate now!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's gaze was resolute as he went up the hill to continue contemplating the Great Sun Golden Body, striving to break through as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also began to cultivate diligently, she was somewhat impatient to return to the Inner Realm, for that was where her true battlefield was!</p><p></p><p>"I must succeed in tempering the Evergreen Bone!"</p><p></p><p>Her gaze was determined.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a sigh, his gaze turned towards the boundless mountains. His eldest disciple had gone to venture into the Inner Realm, when would he go to the Inner Realm himself?</p><p></p><p>"After Su Lingxiu breaks through to the Innate Realm, and the martial arts spread to the Borderlands, it will be about time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He walked up to the Crimson Cat, stroking the big cat's head and murmuring, "You've gotten fatter, your big body is taking up a lot of space. Should I just stew you?"</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat's eyes showed fear, and it kept rubbing against Li Xuan's legs, making whimpering sounds.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled, "You do have some intelligence. Alright, I'll pass on the Great Demon Cultivation Method to you. Whether you can comprehend it or not, it's all up to you!"</p><p></p><p>"You've eaten the waste elixir, so you should be able to accumulate medicinal power and strengthen your physique. But your physique contains treasures, if you can comprehend it, you'll be able to freely shrink or expand your body..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said as he pointed out acupoints on the Crimson Cat's body, recalling the videos and diagrams of beast acupoints he had seen in the past.</p><p></p><p>"I'll just point out these for you. The rest, you'll have to find and explore on your own. If you can open up these acupoints and cultivate the great demonic arts and transformations, it will be your own fortune."</p><p></p><p>As for whether the Crimson Cat could understand, Li Xuan didn't care. He was just trying it on a whim, since the cat seemed to have some intelligence.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

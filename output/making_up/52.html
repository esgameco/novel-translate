        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 52 The Entire Kingdom of Wu Has Been Led Astray</p><p></p><p>It is well known among the people of the Kingdom of Wu that the current Wu Emperor loves to go on imperial tours.</p><p></p><p>In the ten years since his ascension to the throne, except for the first two years spent consolidating the court and his imperial power, he has gone on an imperial tour once every year for the past eight years.</p><p></p><p>Of course, each time he returns from these tours, the palace gains another imperial consort.</p><p></p><p>Three months ago, during one of these tours, an unexpected incident occurred.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's method of revenge pioneered a new approach. He did not strive to hone his martial arts, nor did he gather jianghu (martial arts world) figures to seek revenge, nor did he take the path of becoming an official at the imperial court.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Meng family was a powerful clan, and there were no shortage of officials in the Wu imperial court with ties to the Meng family.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had thought of an even more extreme way to take his revenge!</p><p></p><p>He seized the opportunity when the Wu Emperor was out on tour and attempted to assassinate the Emperor!</p><p></p><p>At the time, the Wu Emperor was in his carriage, about to engage in some amorous activities with a newly selected beauty, when a loud shout rang out:</p><p></p><p>"Tian Ping Meng Chong has come to slay the extravagant, incompetent, and cruel dog emperor!"</p><p></p><p>This sudden shout startled the Wu Emperor, causing him to immediately lose his nerve.</p><p></p><p>The Emperor was enraged.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was also fierce, wielding a large cleaver and forcefully breaking through layer after layer of guards - in the end, he even managed to escape successfully!</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was furious. Upon investigation, he discovered that the would-be assassin was from the main branch of the Tian Ping Meng family!</p><p></p><p>Extermination! Exterminate the entire family!</p><p></p><p>Eliminate the nine familial relationships!</p><p></p><p>It must be the elimination of the nine familial relationships!</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor immediately issued an edict, and the imperial army mobilized, directly invading the Meng family, capturing and imprisoning the entire clan!</p><p></p><p>The Meng family was completely bewildered.</p><p></p><p>They had no idea what was happening, and suddenly they had become criminals guilty of treason!</p><p></p><p>After learning the truth, they cried out in outrage - this was a tremendous injustice!</p><p></p><p>They had just expelled Meng Chong from the Meng family, and then he turned around and attempted to assassinate the Emperor?</p><p></p><p>This was Meng Chong's method of revenge?</p><p></p><p>The entire Meng family was struck by lightning, thinking, "What kind of thing is this? Who would take revenge in such a way?"</p><p></p><p>"Are you not normal?!"</p><p></p><p>This was a crime punishable by the elimination of the nine familial relationships!</p><p></p><p>The entire Wu imperial court was filled with fear and trepidation because of this assassination attempt. All officials trembled in fear, and anyone with any connection to the Meng family was thrown into prison.</p><p></p><p>This was a crime punishable by the elimination of the nine familial relationships!</p><p></p><p>The implications became broader and broader. If the elimination of the nine familial relationships was carried out, it seemed even the imperial clan would be implicated to some degree.</p><p></p><p>In the end, it was decided that the entire Meng family would be exterminated!</p><p></p><p>The investigation revealed that this assassination attempt seemed to have been Meng Chong's revenge against the Meng family.</p><p></p><p>However, the Wu Emperor would not forgive the Meng family because of this.</p><p></p><p>If this precedent was set, in the future, if someone with ulterior motives wanted to commit treason, they could just expel the person from the family, and if the attempt failed, the family would not be implicated?</p><p></p><p>Where was the majesty of the imperial power? Where was the dignity of the Wu Emperor?</p><p></p><p>The entire family must be exterminated!</p><p></p><p>This precedent cannot be allowed to stand!</p><p></p><p>And so, the entire Meng family was exterminated!</p><p></p><p>On the day of the executions, they cried out to the heavens, denouncing the injustice, and cursing Meng Chong as inhuman, asking what kind of person would take revenge in such a way.</p><p></p><p>This incident spread throughout the Kingdom of Wu, and everyone was bewildered - who would take revenge in such a manner?</p><p></p><p>What kind of mind could conceive of such an extreme method of revenge?</p><p></p><p>Even more absurd was that the mastermind behind the attempted assassination of the Wu Emperor, Meng Chong, had managed to escape...</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor issued a decree to put a bounty on him!</p><p></p><p>Ten thousand taels of gold!</p><p></p><p>After hearing the full story, Li Xuan's gaze towards Meng Chong became strange.</p><p></p><p>This bald youth's thought process was truly different from the norm.</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't the bounty one thousand taels of gold? How come you just said it was ten thousand taels?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly noticed the discrepancy.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had said he was being hunted with a bounty of one thousand taels of gold, and had been fleeing and hiding to seek refuge in the Kingdom of Qi.</p><p></p><p>But just now, Shi Er had said the bounty was ten thousand taels.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er's face twitched, and he looked at Meng Chong with newfound admiration. This naturally bald youth had truly pioneered a revenge method unprecedented in history.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, the thing is, because of Meng Chong's method of revenge, some people have started to imitate him..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er explained the aftermath of Meng Chong's attempted assassination of the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Emotion.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's unprecedented method of revenge had spread throughout the Wu Kingdom, naturally becoming a hot topic of discussion.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, it had led the entire atmosphere of the Wu Kingdom astray.</p><p></p><p>The former Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel in the Wu Kingdom had a servant who had fallen in love with a woman, but ended up being forcefully taken by the Secretary's son.</p><p></p><p>That servant wanted to seek justice, but ended up with his parents being killed, and he himself being severely beaten, suffering torment every day.</p><p></p><p>The Secretary's son, with a somewhat twisted mentality, would beat the servant from time to time, and repeatedly force himself on the woman the servant liked, right in front of him.</p><p></p><p>But he didn't kill him.</p><p></p><p>He just tortured him!</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong's incident became known, it reached the ears of the servant.</p><p></p><p>His mind was suddenly enlightened, and he instantly understood how he should take his revenge.</p><p></p><p>He escaped when no one was watching, hid away, and made a bow and stole a knife.</p><p></p><p>After the incident of Meng Chong's assassination was calmed down, the Wu Emperor went on another tour to complete the one he hadn't finished previously.</p><p></p><p>But the result!</p><p></p><p>He was assassinated again!</p><p></p><p>The servant from the Secretary's household had rushed out to assassinate the imperial carriage!</p><p></p><p>"Tyrant, come and get your life!" he shouted furiously.</p><p></p><p>The servant died!</p><p></p><p>It was found that he was from the Secretary's household.</p><p></p><p>Exterminate the entire family!</p><p></p><p>The Secretary's entire household cried out in vain that they were wronged!</p><p></p><p>But the imperial might could not be defied, no matter if it was the servant's revenge.</p><p></p><p>Better to kill wrongly than let it go!</p><p></p><p>This precedent cannot be opened!</p><p></p><p>The Secretary's entire household was exterminated!</p><p></p><p>This incident spread, and the atmosphere of the Wu Kingdom began to go astray.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor went on another tour, wanting to complete the previous two that he hadn't finished, but was assassinated again!</p><p></p><p>The assassin was the nephew of the Minister of War!</p><p></p><p>Because the Minister of War had bullied his mother, forcing her to commit suicide.</p><p></p><p>So, he learned from Meng Chong, wanting to take revenge!</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor's mentality collapsed!</p><p></p><p>Exterminate the entire family!</p><p></p><p>The Minister of War's entire household was also exterminated.</p><p></p><p>The entire court of civil and military officials, their mentality also collapsed.</p><p></p><p>What the hell is all this?</p><p></p><p>It's all because of Meng Chong's sin!</p><p></p><p>They repeatedly advised the Wu Emperor not to go on tours anymore, to just stay in the palace!</p><p>If he went on another tour, who knows which high official's entire family would be exterminated next!</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor was forced to be unable to go on tours anymore.</p><p></p><p>Thinking the matter had come to an end, but then, an assassination of a serving official occurred again.</p><p></p><p>A servant from a certain merchant household, having suffered humiliation, in a fit of rage, went to assassinate a serving official!</p><p></p><p>The merchant's entire household was imprisoned and their property confiscated.</p><p></p><p>If they couldn't assassinate the Emperor, then they would assassinate the officials!</p><p></p><p>The entire atmosphere of the Wu Kingdom had been led astray.</p><p></p><p>The masters' eyes when looking at their servants were filled with vigilance, they had to treat the servants a little better, otherwise their own prestige would become a mere facade. </p><p>How could they mingle with the lower classes?</p><p></p><p>They should scold the servants with harsh words, but also fear that they might go all out and attempt assassination.</p><p></p><p>The officials were also distressed, afraid of assassination when going out, and afraid that some servant in their household might lose their mind and attempt assassination.</p><p></p><p>They had to lower their status and get along better with the servants, otherwise their own prestige as the master would be in vain.</p><p>Where was the prestige of the master then?</p><p></p><p>The servants of the wealthy families in the Wu Kingdom also didn't have it easy, fearing that the master would suspect them of harboring resentment and directly drag them out to beat them to death, to prevent them from attempting assassination!</p><p></p><p>The entire atmosphere of the Wu Kingdom had been led astray because of this.</p><p></p><p>The root cause of all this was Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>A popular saying had spread in the Wu Kingdom: "Want to take revenge? Learn from Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>What a sin!</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor increased the bounty, vowing to capture Meng Chong and execute him in the most brutal way.</p><p></p><p>The entire court of civil and military officials strongly agreed, and many were willing to contribute money to increase the bounty.</p><p></p><p>They directly raised the bounty to the astonishing amount of 100,000 taels of gold!</p>

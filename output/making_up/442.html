        <h1>Chapter 442</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Master, these are the celestial spirits I hunted. They're a gift for Third Senior Sister," said Jiang Buping as he took out a storage ring.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded, took the storage ring, and vanished in an instant with a single step.</p><p></p><p>After respectfully seeing his master off, Jiang Buping took a deep breath. He looked back towards the Yuanping Realm, then strode across the wilderness, leaving Yuanping behind.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Tianming, Yun Yan'er, just wait for me to return to the Taikun Realm."</p><p></p><p>Once his strength had broken through, it would be time to return to Taikun and seek justice.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made another trip to the Nine Mountains Realm to give some guidance to Chimao.</p><p></p><p>Returning to the Qinghua Realm, he gave the storage ring containing the celestial spirits to Su Lingxiu, then continued sitting leisurely in his chair. </p><p></p><p>Although he had completely memorized the Book of Taicang, it didn't stop him from studying it thoroughly once again from beginning to end, continuing to understand the origins of the entire world.</p><p></p><p>As for the purple-robed youth, Li Xuan was leaving him hanging for now. Based on his understanding of the youth, he would likely grow impatient with the tedium.</p><p></p><p>"There's no rush to uncover the secrets of heaven and earth. Take it slow - being too hasty would only arouse his suspicions," Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Realm was undergoing major construction, with spirit cities being built one after another. On the edges of the wilderness, arrays were constantly being laid out and strengthened to reinforce the blockade.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was incredibly busy, as was Su Lingxiu, who was continuously working on transforming the Great Yue Heavenly Cave into a divine furnace of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she had to make time to guide a group of Qinghua Sect disciples in the art of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Sect was flourishing, with many prodigies emerging in artifact refining, pill refining, and array techniques. Even in swordsmanship and physical martial arts, prodigies had appeared.</p><p></p><p>On this day, two outsiders finally came to the Qinghua Realm, crossing over from the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable guarding the realm gate only allowed them to enter Qinghua after learning they had been referred by Xu Yan. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, once they entered the Qinghua Realm, an Immortal Venerable accompanied them the entire way, not allowing them to wander around, and took them directly to the Medicine Hall.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan felt that some kind of massive change seemed to be taking place in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he had come to seek treatment for Hong Ting, so he followed the Immortal Venerable's arrangements.</p><p></p><p>But when they arrived at what used to be the capital city of the Great Yue Kingdom, now the main city of the Qinghua Sect, he was still utterly astonished.</p><p></p><p>"I've never seen such a massive city before, never seen such active spiritual energy and celestial spiritual veins in a great city."</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was shocked beyond words.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Medicine Hall. However, Dean Su Lingxiu is not in the hall at the moment. You can wait here for a while."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!" Luo Zhan said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>He waited in the consultation room of the Medicine Hall with the listless and spiritless Hong Ting. Everything he saw gave him a sense of eye-opening wonder.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er came over carrying a diagnostic instrument and asked, "Are you the patient referred by Young Master Xu?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes." Although she was just a young girl and not particularly strong, Luo Zhan didn't put on any airs of an Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er nodded and used the diagnostic instrument to examine Hong Ting while asking how he had been injured.</p><p></p><p>When she heard it was due to erosion by Tuowu power, Yue'er's eyes immediately lit up. This kind of injury to the soul and will was extremely rare.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Su Lingxiu was always very interested in strange and difficult illnesses.</p><p></p><p>For this kind of injury, ordinary diagnostic instruments couldn't directly diagnose it, let alone provide a treatment plan.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, the diagnostic instrument couldn't give a specific treatment plan. It only suggested a pill to stimulate the soul, which could temporarily energize someone but not cure them.</p><p></p><p>"Please wait a moment." Yue'er excitedly went to find Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>When Su Lingxiu heard about it, she ran back excitedly. She had long since learned about the evil eye power of the Tuowu from Xu Yan, and now she had a chance to study how it eroded the soul and will.</p><p></p><p>"You're Hong Ting, right? I've heard about you from Senior Brother," said Su Lingxiu. She briefly examined Hong Ting's condition, then looked at Luo Zhan and said, "This injury isn't difficult to treat. We need to purify the soul and eliminate the Tuowu power. The best way to eliminate the Tuowu power is to perform surgery on the soul!"</p><p></p><p>When Luo Zhan heard this, he was overjoyed. Hong Ting could finally be saved.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, thank you miss!" Luo Zhan nodded happily.</p><p></p><p>He didn't understand anything about soul surgery, but as long as it could cure Hong Ting, any method was fine.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since you have no objections, please sign this treatment consent form. He'll be fully recovered in three days," Su Lingxiu said cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er handed over a treatment consent form. Luo Zhan didn't read it carefully and signed it directly.</p><p></p><p>He marveled inwardly, "This Medicine Hall has its own rigorous treatment procedures and fully respects the patients. Truly impressive!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu and Yue'er excitedly wheeled Hong Ting away. Meng Shushu was left to host Luo Zhan.</p><p></p><p>In Su Lingxiu's private treatment room in the Medicine Hall, Hong Ting had already entered a deep sleep.</p><p></p><p>"Let me see how the Tuowu power erodes the soul and will."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was extremely excited as she extracted Hong Ting's soul and placed it on a divine instrument table that could support souls. Divine energy in her hands transformed into needles and knives as she began to work.</p><p></p><p>Yue'er assisted on the side.</p><p></p><p>"So this is Tuowu power. I see. Just by setting up a seal at the core of the soul and will, one can easily resist the erosion of Tuowu power."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu separated the Tuowu power from the soul and stored it in a special container.</p><p></p><p>"Since he has a connection with Senior Brother, I'll give him a boost."</p><p></p><p>As she said this, Su Lingxiu used a certain divine medicine to form fine threads that fused into the soul, creating a symbol.</p><p></p><p>With this symbol in place, Hong Ting would have extremely strong resistance to the evil eye power of the Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>"I've figured out the path by which the Tuowu evil eye erodes the soul and will. As long as this weakness is blocked, with his strength, he'll be able to resist the evil eye light even from an Immortal Realm Tuowu," Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Once the erosion path of the Tuowu evil eye was understood, defenses could be targeted against it, and methods to counter the Tuowu evil eye could even be created.</p><p></p><p>After researching and treating, she returned the soul to Hong Ting's body.</p><p></p><p>"It's done. He's cured, and from now on he'll have great resistance to the power of the Tuowu evil eye," Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you so much, Miss Su!" Luo Zhan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"I'll wake him up now."</p><p></p><p>A long, thin needle appeared in Su Lingxiu's hand. She pricked Hong Ting's head with it, and soon after, Hong Ting opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>He was a bit confused at first, then jumped up excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The listlessness was gone. The spirited fighting intent of a Hundred Battles Hall warrior reappeared, and Hong Ting's eyes filled with tears of joy.</p><p></p><p>He had nearly been ruined! "Thank you for saving my life, miss!" He bowed respectfully to Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>"It was nothing," Su Lingxiu waved her hand dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"It may be nothing to you, miss, but for Hong Ting, it's</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Miss, if you have any requests, Hong Ting will not hesitate to go through fire and water for you in this lifetime!" Hong Ting said gratefully with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"This is the consultation fee," Luo Zhan took out a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I still have things to attend to." </p><p></p><p>After Yue'er accepted the fee, Su Lingxiu waved her hand and hurriedly returned to the Great Yue Cavern.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan and Hong Ting originally wanted to wander around the Qinghua Realm to see what changes were happening there.</p><p></p><p>However, the Qinghua Emperor personally entertained them and didn't allow them to go anywhere else. In the end, he directly sent the two of them to leave through the realm gate.</p><p></p><p>Luo Zhan was helpless about this, but understood in his heart that the Qinghua Realm was likely planning something.</p><p></p><p>After seeing off Luo Zhan and Hong Ting, the Qinghua Emperor and other Immortal Venerable Lords frantically threw themselves into the construction of the Qinghua Sect, preparing to set up the Grand Qinghua Formation.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by. As the Grand Qinghua Formation was continuously improved, people in the Qinghua Realm successively broke through to the Immortal realm with the aid of pills.</p><p></p><p>The Qinghua Emperor and the other two made further progress in their strength, and finally cultivated a divine ability recently.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm became increasingly chaotic, with one realm after another erupting into turmoil. Two realms even engaged in a great war against each other.</p><p></p><p>The unrest in the Nine Mountains Realm continued, but did not spread to the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>The fame of Xu Yan and Meng Chong gradually spread throughout the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's retaliation against the Heavenly Fiends and Earth Shadows meant that wherever he went, he destroyed one Heavenly Fiend and Earth Shadow stronghold after another, killing many of their members hidden in other forces, thus offending a large number of factions.</p><p></p><p>For these forces, Xu Yan's actions were a provocation. Regardless of whether they believed the killed individuals were Earth Shadow members, even if they did believe their identities, those people should have been handed over to their forces to deal with, rather than Xu Yan directly killing them.</p><p></p><p>This was equivalent to disregarding these major forces. It was precisely because of this that Xu Yan often faced encirclements and assassination attempts from numerous factions.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had offended the Myriad Treasures Alliance and was already being hunted throughout the Divine Realm by them. Since they were already enemies, there was no need to be polite anymore.</p><p></p><p>So Meng Chong directly plundered Myriad Treasures Alliance branches. This naturally further provoked the anger of the Myriad Treasures Alliance, who dispatched Immortal Venerable Lords to hunt down Meng Chong everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was also being hunted by the Tai Kun Jiang Clan and Cloud Top Sect. However, Jiang Buping kept a relatively low profile, so for the time being, his reputation was not as resounding as Xu Yan and Meng Chong's.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to the peak of the Divine Appearance realm, just one step away from the Void Breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has killed an Immortal Venerable Lord. Your martial arts experience has increased," read the feedback from the Golden Book of the Great Dao.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this feedback, Li Xuan was no longer moved. By now, Xu Yan had the ability to kill ordinary Immortal Venerable Lords on his own, and the Golden Book's feedback was only martial arts experience.</p><p></p><p>"My realm and strength are far superior to my disciple's, so the feedback has decreased," Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu had also reached the great accomplishment stage of the Divine Appearance realm, and Fang Hao's realm was similar.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's strength was also comparable.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to make a trip to the Great Wilderness," Li Xuan smiled.</p><p></p><p>The Extreme Soul Body sat leisurely in a chair, while Li Xuan had already arrived in the Great Wilderness, outside the royal palace of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>His gaze penetrated through obstacles to look at that small stone house.</p><p></p><p>A purple-robed youth was sitting inside the small stone house, scratching his ears and cheeks with an impatient look, his hair all messed up.</p><p></p><p>"Where is he? Why hasn't he come yet? Could it be that he really just came to chat idly with me?" The purple-robed youth was very frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how many ages had passed, and finally a powerful expert came, someone he could talk to. But after coming once, he never came again? As for the Wu Emperor and others, in his eyes they were all insects, with nothing worth talking about and unable to relieve his boredom.</p><p></p><p>"This person is really something, as long as there's no malice, I'm still willing to chat with him about some things." The purple-robed youth was extremely dejected.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to go back to sleep, suddenly a figure stepped into the small stone house.</p><p></p><p>"You finally came!" The purple-robed youth said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he spoke, he suddenly realized that he seemed to have shown too much happiness, so he composed himself and his expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>"What are you here for again?" He acted as if he didn't want to see anyone.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled inwardly and turned around, pretending to leave. "Then should I go?"</p><p></p><p>"No, no, since you're already here, sit down and let's chat," the purple-robed youth hurriedly said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then, let's chat," Li Xuan said, appearing somewhat reluctant.</p><p></p><p>After sitting down, he brewed a pot of tea.</p><p></p><p>This was a pot of truly coarse tea. He poured a cup for the purple-robed youth and said, "Come, have some tea."</p><p></p><p>"Why do you like drinking this kind of..." The purple-robed youth had a bitter expression. He wanted to say "garbage", but fearing that it would upset the other party and make him leave, he could only take up the cup glumly and down it in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>As the tea entered his mouth, his whole face scrunched up in bitterness.</p><p></p><p>"After all, he's young. Both his mental state and cultivation are too poor," Li Xuan shook his head and sighed. He took a light sip, and although he also found it unpalatable, his face showed an expression of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth sighed, "You really might have a very high realm. You can even savor something so undrinkable with such relish."</p><p></p><p>"This is the Dao. As I said, what I'm savoring is not tea, but invincibility, loneliness, the Dao..." Li Xuan rambled on mystically.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, what do you think of this world?" Li Xuan smiled and opened the topic.</p><p></p><p>"It's very good, why?" The purple-robed youth asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>"This world, in fact, is too weak, too fragile. Don't you feel that? Moreover, this world is also lacking some things. In my view, it's incomplete," Li Xuan commented on the world.</p><p></p><p>"How could it possibly be weak? This world is the strongest world," the purple-robed youth said defiantly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan laughed inwardly. From the purple-robed youth's words, there was more than just this one world, and the Taicang World was the strongest.</p><p></p><p>"As for what you said about lacking some things, maybe that's indeed the case," the purple-robed youth suddenly became somewhat dejected, thinking of something unknown.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? You, such a young lad, can also know what this world is lacking?" Li Xuan asked, feigning surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I am..." The purple-robed youth suddenly stopped talking and changed the subject, "Actually, I'm very strong too, so of course I know."</p><p></p><p>"No, no, no, you don't know. What you know is actually just the surface. What I'm talking about lacking is not the same thing as what you're thinking of," Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, there's no one who knows better than me what this world is lacking," the purple-robed youth said defiantly.</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak. You haven't been able to penetrate the essence of the world, nor do you understand the development of the world, let alone know how to make the world continuously stronger..." Li Xuan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, even if I told you, you wouldn't understand."</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed youth glared, saying defiantly, "You may be very powerful, but when it comes to this world, you definitely don't understand it as well as I do. I am..."</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

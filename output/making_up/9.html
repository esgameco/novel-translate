        <h1>Chapter 9</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 9 - Cannot Mention Having a Master to Anyone</p><p></p><p>"Hmm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded, feeling the need to give his disciple a wake-up call. How could he have forgotten to cook?</p><p></p><p>His mind was completely absorbed in cultivation, which wouldn't do.</p><p></p><p>"Balancing work and rest, do not over-cultivate, do you understand?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said sternly.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan felt ashamed. "Yes, Master, your disciple will remember this well!"</p><p></p><p>He was deeply moved: "Master is worried that I will blindly push myself to the point of harming my body. That's right, although persistence is important, I must progress step-by-step. I've just begun bone refinement, if I stubbornly push myself, I'm likely to run into problems!"</p><p></p><p>"You must understand that there is a proper way to persist. Alternating between tension and relaxation, balancing work and rest, you need to appropriately calm your mind in order to cultivate more efficiently and gain more insights!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan patiently instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple understands, I will not make this mistake again!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, blindly pushing too hard can lead to problems. You need to appropriately relax your mind, otherwise it will be like a taut string - if it's stretched too tight for too long, it will snap!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly gained this insight.</p><p></p><p>"Go on then!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, letting Xu Yan go cook.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple does listen well, but alas, I'm not truly a high-level cultivator, the cultivation method I taught him was just made up. Persistence won't actually help him."</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, but since he had already deceived him, he could only continue to mislead him.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After entering bone refinement, every time Xu Yan's qi and blood further permeated his bones, beginning the initial stage of refining his bones, he would feel a sensation of sand grinding against his bones.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan did not continue to stubbornly push himself. Whenever he was about to reach his limit, he would stop the cultivation and go do other things, allowing his mind to relax.</p><p></p><p>Five days later.</p><p></p><p>In the midst of his cultivation, Xu Yan suddenly felt his qi and blood surge, his entire skeletal structure trembling. When the qi and blood seeped into his bones, he felt a smooth sensation.</p><p></p><p>His entire being felt strengthened, his qi and blood also having risen.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally entered the initial stage of bone refinement."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was exhilarated. After five days of arduous cultivation, he had completed the first phase of bone refinement.</p><p></p><p>The subsequent bone refinement would be much smoother, without the painful sensations of ants biting or sand grinding.</p><p></p><p>Only when he reached the initial stage of refining bones as strong as copper would he experience painful sensations again.</p><p></p><p>"I'm now in the initial stage of refining bones as strong as iron. Since I've entered this stage, the tempering from now until refining bones as strong as copper will be easier."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly encouraged. As long as the tempering no longer involved excruciating pain, he could persist for longer and spend more time cultivating.</p><p></p><p>"I've been out for almost a month now, and with my current strength from bone refinement, I would not fear being surrounded by hundreds of people with just my bare hands."</p><p></p><p>"It's time for me to go back. The gifts for my master's acceptance of me as his disciple, I ended up using them all for my cultivation. I should buy some rare medicinal ingredients and prepare another gift for my master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that although his master did not care about the gifts, as his disciple, he could not neglect the proper etiquette of honoring his teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Given my master's realm, rare treasures would be nothing special to him. What kind of gift should I prepare then?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he slapped his forehead: "How could I be so stupid? Master doesn't care about rare treasures at all. I just need to put my sincerity into it. Things like gold and jade to decorate his residence, Master should appreciate those."</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, Xu Yan felt much more at ease.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go catch a wild rabbit outside, and catch a fish from the stream, then prepare a sumptuous meal for my master before leaving."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan finished his cultivation and left the village to prepare the ingredients.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the bountiful dining table, Li Xuan had a satisfied expression on his face. This disciple is not bad!</p><p></p><p>The dishes have become more and more delicious, and the variety of dishes has also increased.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have been out for almost a month now, and I would like to go home for a visit."</p><p></p><p>After the meal, Xu Yan spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart sank: "If this kid goes back and talks about becoming my disciple, won't I be exposed? His brain doesn't seem to work very well, and his parents and family members can't all be lacking in intelligence, can they?"</p><p></p><p>But if he didn't allow Xu Yan to go home, it would be hard to explain, and it might even arouse Xu Yan's suspicion.</p><p></p><p>After a brief pause, Li Xuan spoke: "It's good for you to go back for a visit, but I must remind you that before you formally enter the door of cultivation, you must not reveal it to anyone, including your parents. Do you understand?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will never mention anything related to cultivation to anyone else!" Xu Yan solemnly promised.</p><p></p><p>"I prefer to be low-key and dislike being ostentatious. Although I have accepted you as my disciple, before you formally enter the door, you cannot mention me as your master. I hope you can understand this."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke with a serious expression.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will never mention you in the slightest before I formally enter the door!" Xu Yan respectfully assured.</p><p></p><p>"If I have not allowed you to formally enter the door, it means we are not destined. I have made an exception to accept you as my disciple, but if you fail to enter the door, it will tarnish my reputation. As a disciple, you should prioritize protecting your master's reputation!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt a bit ashamed in his heart. His talent was still a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>If he failed to enter the door, it would diminish his master's prestige. As a disciple, he should prioritize his master's honor and reputation!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's intention was to avoid exposing himself prematurely, so he instructed Xu Yan not to mention him or anything related to cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He did not know that Xu Yan had engaged in self-imagination.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, I trust you. You should go back soon, and be careful on the way."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression softened, and he reminded again, "On the way, you need to pass through the thirty-mile Evil Aura Forest, where there are fierce tigers and ferocious beasts. You must be extra careful not to get hurt."</p><p></p><p>The Evil Aura Forest was too dangerous, and Xu Yan was alone. If he encountered fierce tigers and beasts, he might not survive.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan could only remind him, and whether Xu Yan could pass through safely would depend on his luck.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knelt down with a thud and respectfully kowtowed three times, saying, "Master, your disciple will return in six or seven days at the shortest, or eleven or twelve days at the longest, to serve you!"</p><p></p><p>"You have a good heart!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan's reverence, respect, and filial piety, Li Xuan felt a bit moved.</p><p></p><p>"How did I end up developing some genuine feelings while deceiving him? Sigh, it seems I'm just not a qualified liar. All of this is forced upon me!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt helpless.</p><p></p><p>He really didn't want to deceive anyone, but it was all Xu Yan's fault for being so simple-minded and eager to be deceived, and the amount of the initiation gift was also a bit too much!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan left.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the hillside at the village entrance, Li Xuan watched Xu Yan's retreating figure, his expression somewhat complex.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he can pass through the Evil Aura Forest safely, this foolish kid... Sigh!"</p><p></p><p>Letting out a sigh, Li Xuan returned to his residence after Xu Yan's figure disappeared from sight.</p><p></p><p>Lying in the chair under the big tree, he suddenly felt a sense of... loneliness!</p><p></p><p>"Damn it!"</p><p></p><p>"I've gotten used to having a disciple to serve me, and now I'm alone again. How can I feel so uncomfortable?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan slapped his face, unable to resist cursing.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 152</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu dug while saying, "Be careful when digging for spiritual herbs, don't damage them, or the medicinal power will be lost. If left for a long time, the medicinal power will diminish greatly."</p><p></p><p>He was a spiritual herb explorer, naturally very familiar with all kinds of spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>He continued to explain to Xu Yan and the others, "For grass-type spiritual herbs, they are not that delicate. As long as you dig them out without too much damage, the medicinal power won't be lost. For fruit-type spiritual herbs, you must especially pay attention to leaving the fruit stem intact. For things like the Dilunar Bamboo Shoot that grow underground, be careful when digging to avoid damage, but it's not a big problem.</p><p></p><p>"Spiritual herbs that grow underground are usually protected by a layer of skin.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, this is the method for harvesting spiritual herbs. If you want to preserve them for a long time without losing medicinal power, then more complex methods are required.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianbao Pavilion is the best at preserving spiritual herbs, so in general, the major powers will deposit the spiritual herbs they harvest with the Tianbao Pavilion for safekeeping, or seal the herbs before taking them back."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Shushu listened as they dug up the spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianbao Pavilion is truly formidable," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>Having spiritual token access to the inner domain and the ability to preserve and seal spiritual herbs, it was clear that no major power dared to offend the Tianbao Pavilion. Yet the Tianbao Pavilion maintained its principle of not participating in inner domain conflicts, which was one of the reasons the major powers trusted them.</p><p></p><p>"The Tianbao Pavilion is naturally formidable, no one knows the full extent of their foundations. Although the Seven Star Academy is said to have deep foundations, I feel the Tianbao Pavilion may surpass them," Meng Shushu sighed.</p><p></p><p>"However, powers like the Seven Star Academy and the Swordå°Š Cliff also have their own methods of storing and sealing spiritual herbs. They still deposit some with the Tianbao Pavilion, in case they need herbs while outside, they can just get them from the Tianbao Pavilion. It's said these major powers have some secret agreements with the Tianbao Pavilion, receiving generous cooperative treatment."</p><p></p><p>As an inner domain native, Meng Shushu was acutely aware of the Tianbao Pavilion's strength.</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the methods for storing and sealing spiritual herbs, cousin?" Meng Chong asked while continuing to dig.</p><p></p><p>"My family has passed down the knowledge of spiritual herb exploration, so of course I know how to preserve and seal spiritual herbs. But it's quite troublesome, and the materials needed to seal herbs are even more complex to make. However, you can buy them from the Tianbao Pavilion, it just costs money," Meng Shushu replied with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>After a while, all the spiritual herbs in the field had been harvested, mostly grade 8, with only a few grade 7. A total of 23 different herbs.</p><p></p><p>"There are so many herbs, it's not convenient to carry them. If only I had a storage bag," Xu Yan said, looking at the pile worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Shushu, as a spiritual herb explorer, you must get a storage bag to carry large amounts of herbs. You have to get one," Xu Yan said, patting Meng Shushu's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"I'll try my best," Meng Shushu said helplessly, realizing he was trapped by these two brothers.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Meng Chong noticed something. "Wait, there are no grade 6 herbs, let alone grade 5 here."</p><p></p><p>"There's another key," Meng Shushu said, taking out another key. "The higher grade herbs are each planted in their own field."</p><p></p><p>They went to the hole and Meng Shushu inserted the key, opening a hidden door. Behind it, a beam of light shone down, revealing a strange plant.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of herb is this?" Xu Yan asked in amazement.</p><p></p><p>Upon closer inspection, they saw the plant had lush green leaves, and from the leaves hung a single glistening droplet, shining brilliantly in the light.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu circled the plant excitedly. "This is... this is the Heavenly Dew Marrow! I've only read about it in texts, leaves green with a single dew drop hanging..."</p><p></p><p>"This is a treasure, a true treasure! A grade 5 spiritual herb!" Meng Shushu exclaimed, gently caressing the leaves.</p><p></p><p>"Tell us about the Heavenly Dew Marrow," Xu Yan prompted.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu took a deep breath to calm himself. "The Heavenly Dew Marrow is a rare and special herb. Its grade is not fixed - the longer it grows, the higher its grade can become, rumored to even reach grade 1 one day. To judge its grade, you look at how many dew drops it has hanging. Less than 9 is grade 6, 9 to 18 is grade 5. This one has exactly 9 drops, so it's a lower grade 5 herb."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong understood. Even a lower grade 5 herb was an incredibly precious treasure in the inner domain. </p><p></p><p>"It's said the Heavenly Dew Marrow can enhance a cultivator's willpower and raise their comprehension and talent. Each time one appears, it will spark a fierce battle among the great masters to obtain it. Among grade 5 herbs, it is exceptionally rare and valuable," Meng Shushu explained further, his excitement palpable.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was amazed at the herb's miraculous properties. Meng Chong rubbed his hands, realizing they had found a true treasure. If they could refine this into a dan pill, the effects would be unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Inside the inner realm, this kind of spiritual medicine is directly consumed, and as for the refining process, it is just a matter of combining it with other spiritual medicines and then boiling them into medicinal pills, nothing more.</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan and Meng Chong's view, this is an act of wanton waste.</p><p></p><p>As for something like the Heavenly Dripping Marrow, inner realm cultivators absolutely will not combine it with any other spiritual medicines to refine it into medicinal pills, fearing that it would damage the efficacy of the Heavenly Dripping Marrow, they will definitely consume it directly.</p><p></p><p>This would be even more wanton waste! Refining it into elixirs is the proper usage!" This Heavenly Dripping Marrow, if taken to the Celestial Treasure Pavilion, should be able to exchange for a storage bag," Meng Shu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"No exchange!" Xu Yan and Meng Chong said in unison.</p><p></p><p>A storage bag can be bought, after all, there are some in the Celestial Treasure Pavilion, but the Heavenly Dripping Marrow is a rare spiritual medicine that is hard to come by.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the matter of the storage bag, let Meng Shu figure it out himself, this Heavenly Dripping Marrow is absolutely not to be exchanged.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu smiled awkwardly and said, "Then how about we all eat it together to see if it can truly enhance our talents?"</p><p></p><p>"No, directly eating it? Are you a cow? Of course it should be refined into an elixir," Xu Yan decisively rejected the idea.</p><p></p><p>"Elixir?" Meng Shu blinked, he had never heard of it before.</p><p></p><p>He then thought of the miraculous healing medicine that Meng Chong had given him, could that be a type of elixir?</p><p></p><p>"My junior, quickly dig out the Heavenly Dripping Marrow and seal it properly, don't let even a bit of its medicinal power be lost. Once the elixir is successfully refined, I'll give you one," Meng Chong spoke up.</p><p></p><p>This treasure trove also has Meng Shu's contribution, and in the future he will be considered one of us, responsible for finding spiritual medicines, so he can't just be used without getting any benefits.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, no problem!" Meng Shu didn't ask any more about the elixir.</p><p></p><p>This is obviously a secret matter, but since he can get one for himself, it's not a complete loss, and it should be more effective than directly consuming the Heavenly Dripping Marrow, right?</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu began to dig out the Heavenly Dripping Marrow. Since it is a Grade 5 spiritual medicine, it is too precious, so Xu Yan and Meng Chong, not being familiar with the digging process, did not dare to lend a hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, they finally looked around and discovered that aside from the Heavenly Dripping Marrow, there were several other medicinal fields, each with a spiritual medicine growing on it.</p><p></p><p>"Grade 6 spiritual medicines?" Xu Yan and Meng Chong's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>Grade 6 spiritual medicines are already the highest grade openly acknowledged in the inner realm, they are extremely rare and expensive. Yet here there were several of them.</p><p></p><p>The two of them did not dare to collect them, leaving it all to Meng Shu to handle.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dripping Marrow was dug out, and Meng Shu took out a thin membrane to carefully seal it using his inner qi.</p><p></p><p>After finishing, he let out a sigh of relief. "Fortunately, I still have the sealing talismans I carry with me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu put away the remaining sealing talismans and began to dig up the other spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>"These are all Grade 6 spiritual medicines, the top two are superior quality, the rest are medium quality," Meng Shu explained.</p><p></p><p>After digging out the Grade 6 spiritual medicines and sealing them with the talismans, he found that he didn't have enough, so two of them remained unsealed.</p><p></p><p>"Be extra careful with these two, don't let them get damaged. When we get to the city, we'll buy some sealing talismans from the Celestial Treasure Pavilion to seal them properly," Meng Shu said as he carefully wrapped the two Grade 6 spiritual medicines in a piece of cloth torn from his clothes, handing them to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"No problem." Meng Chong excitedly and carefully accepted them.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Dripping Marrow would be safer in Xu Yan's care, since the Grand Master had arrived, no one could snatch it away.</p><p></p><p>There were so many spiritual medicines, and they didn't have a storage bag, Meng Shu was about to take off his clothes to wrap them up when he saw Xu Yan take out a large bag.</p><p></p><p>"Good thing I was prepared in advance, finally it's useful," Xu Yan happily placed the spiritual medicines one by one into the bag.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu was dumbfounded, could Xu Yan foresee the future? Carrying a large bag on him in advance? Meng Chong had a regretful expression, saying, "Pity, my bag was dropped when the Grand Master was chasing me!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu: ...</p><p></p><p>They really are sworn brothers, both carrying large bags, huh? Xu Yan was delighted to have finally fulfilled his promise to his junior sister.</p><p></p><p>He still had quite a few spiritual medicines stored in the Celestial Treasure Pavilion, and he also had a good amount of spirit stones, so he should be able to gather all the spiritual medicines on his junior sister's list.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, take the spiritual medicines," Xu Yan handed the bag full of spiritual medicines to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's sturdy and burly figure was more suitable for carrying the large bag, while the Heavenly Dripping Marrow and the sealed Grade 6 spiritual medicines were wrapped up and carried by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go." </p><p></p><p>All the spiritual medicines in the medicinal field had been collected, there was nothing else left, it was time to leave.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after killing the black-robed Grand Master, if other powerful experts detected it and came after them, it would be troublesome.</p><p></p><p>After all, in their current state, it was not suitable for a major battle, as it could easily damage the spiritual medicines.</p><p></p><p>Upon leaving the medicinal field, Xu Yan remained vigilant, but did not detect any enemies, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Elder brother, should we head back now?" Meng Chong's face was filled with excitement.</p><p></p><p>Carrying such a large bag of spiritual medicines, it was not suitable to continue wandering in the inner realm, they should return to the Borderlands, and his junior sister must be anxiously waiting. Moreover, the Grade 6 spiritual medicines, especially the Heavenly Dripping Marrow, should not be left in the Celestial Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Although the Celestial Treasure Pavilion had an excellent reputation, as their master had said, there were things they would not give up their principles for the sake of profit.</p><p></p><p>No one could be certain that the Heavenly Dripping Marrow would not tempt them to violate their principles.</p><p></p><p>"These spiritual medicines all need to be sealed, and it's about time we head back. I still need to retrieve the ones I've stored, as well as purchase the ones on the list from Saba Island and elsewhere," Xu Yan pondered for a moment, it was indeed time to return.</p><p></p><p>"After the spiritual medicines are sealed, you can go back first. I'll retrieve the stored ones and purchase the ones on the list, then bid farewell to Senior Xie before returning," Xu Yan said.</p><p></p><p>They had gained quite a harvest on this trip to the inner realm, it was time to return and focus on cultivating.</p><p></p><p>Next time they came to the inner realm, they would be able to stroll around freely.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!" Meng Chong nodded, his face turning grim as he said, "Next time I come, I'll definitely beat up a few Grand Masters, so I can vent this grievance of being chased!"</p><p></p><p>With so many spiritual medicines, his junior sister should be able to refine many elixirs. With the aid of the elixirs, his cultivation of the Great Sun Golden Body would surely skyrocket.</p><p></p><p>It wouldn't take long for him to break through. Once he reached the Nascent Soul realm or even Nascent Soul Perfection, he would come back to the inner realm and directly raid the lair of those black-robed people, crushing the Grand Masters!</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, next time you can go to the Seven Star Academy, pass through the Nine Layers of the Martial Arena, and take a look at the martial arts classics in the Depository, it will be beneficial," Xu Yan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, elder brother," Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shu had been silent the entire time. This mysterious pair of sworn brothers, with their terrifying strength, Meng Chong was already planning how to crush the Grand Masters.</p><p></p><p>They were truly formidable!</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 124 - Masters of the Inner Realm Everywhere?</p><p></p><p>The manager of the Tianbaoge brought a thousand spirit tickets and a bag of spirit herbs, containing twenty-five complete seventh-grade spirit herbs.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily accepted the spirit tickets and held the bag of spirit herbs in his hand, but he was a bit troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Should I return to the Borderlands now? I just left not long ago, but carrying these spirit herbs around is a bit inconvenient!"</p><p></p><p>The Tianbaoge manager noticed his dilemma and said, "Young master, if you need to temporarily store the spirit herbs, I can issue you a free storage policy for three months. After that, the monthly storage fee will be one hundred spirit crystals."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Xu Yan was interested and asked, "Can I store them at any Tianbaoge location?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, our Tianbaoge storage policies are universal, you can store them anywhere. But the free storage is only for three months, after that you'll need to pay the storage fee."</p><p></p><p>The manager smiled as he spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, give me a storage policy then," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A monthly storage fee of one hundred spirit crystals, equivalent to a blue spirit fruit. This Tianbaoge is really profiting, only those who can afford their storage service are not ordinary cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself in amazement.</p><p></p><p>"Manager, issue me an annual storage policy, I'll cover the fees," Du Yuying spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you so much!" Xu Yan was overjoyed, this young lady was so generous, it was worth escorting her.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying smiled sweetly, "Young master, if you like it, that's all that matters."</p><p></p><p>The manager looked at Xu Yan with some surprise, it seems this young miss from the Du Clan has taken a liking to this young man.</p><p></p><p>He issued a one-year free storage policy and handed it to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan happily accepted it and prepared to leave. He didn't plan to store the spirit herbs here, after all, this was Du Yuying's territory, and it was too far from the Borderlands.</p><p></p><p>"Oh right, manager, the spirit herbs won't get lost, right?"</p><p></p><p>The Tianbaoge manager's face darkened. What kind of young man is this? Who in the Inner Realm doesn't know the reputation of the Tianbaoge?</p><p></p><p>"Young master, rest assured. If the spirit herbs are lost, the Tianbaoge will compensate you three times. If they are damaged, we will compensate you one time."</p><p></p><p>"Alright, then I can rest easy," Xu Yan said with relief.</p><p></p><p>"It would be great if the stored spirit herbs got lost, then I can get three times the compensation," he muttered to himself as he turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying watched him leave, a hint of a smile in her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Tell my father that I've returned. Have someone come pick me up from the Tianbaoge, and prepare a generous gift, I have something useful."</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying stood up and said.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, I'll let the master know in that way," Yan Kuan replied solemnly.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>The eldest disciple has gone to the Inner Realm, the second disciple has already comprehended the Great Sun Golden Body Technique, and the third disciple is about to complete the Golden Bone, not far from entering the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt much more relaxed.</p><p></p><p>He began to focus some of his energy on cultivating techniques beyond the Penetrating Profound Realm, pondering how to construct realms above the Penetrating Profound and how to cultivate them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was in the midst of breaking through the Innate Realm, and Li Xuan was also quietly observing, anticipating Meng Chong's breakthrough and his subsequent transformation.</p><p></p><p>On the hillside, Meng Chong was immersed in his breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>The essence of the Great Sun Golden Body Technique lies in opening the Golden Body Acupoints, and the prerequisite for opening the acupoints is to penetrate the Heaven-Earth Bridge and open the Dantian Sea of Qi as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"My senior brother once said that during the breakthrough, he integrated sword intent into himself, and had a transformation, becoming stronger. Then I can integrate the knife intent into myself.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Knife Nurturing Art is not to nurture the knife in one's hand, but to nurture it within oneself. Then I can nurture the knife in one of my Golden Body Acupoints, and when I need to use it, I can fuse the acupoint's knife into the knife in my hand."</p><p></p><p>A flash of insight struck Meng Chong's mind, and he had found the way to nurture the knife.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Heaven-Earth Bridge was penetrated, the heavenly and earthly spiritual qi began to guide into his body, and the tyrannical knife intent was also ignited within, fusing into his bones, grinding the Heaven-Earth Bridge.</p><p></p><p>Breakthrough requires time, it cannot be accomplished in a single day.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong cultivates the path of the physical body, practicing the Great Sun Golden Body, needing to open the Golden Body Acupoints and activate the power of the physical body, so his breakthrough time will be longer than Xu Yan's.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu silently observed, although she had not yet entered the dao, it did not prevent her from observing the breakthrough to the Innate Realm, accumulating some experience for her own future breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's breakthrough was smooth sailing, there would be no accidents, the only uncertainty was whether there would be any unexpected surprises.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not pay too much attention. That day, he took out the ancient leather book and continued his research. With the research in recent times, he felt that he had some enlightenment, but he couldn't quite put it into words.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan slapped a Sect Master to death, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a golden light appeared.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled, "How could Xu Yan, who just entered the Inner Realm, already clash with a Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>He just entered the Inner Realm, and he's already encountered a Sect Master? What did Xu Yan do to offend the Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>However, the Sect Master was not strong enough.</p><p></p><p>Slapped to death by a single palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan heaved a sigh of relief, "Xu Yan has already reached the late Innate Realm, apart from lacking some combat experience, he can easily defeat a Sect Master in strength.</p><p></p><p>"As long as he doesn't encounter a Great Sect Master, Xu Yan won't be in danger. Even if he encounters a Great Sect Master, with Xu Yan's Heaven Lightning Flash speed, he can still escape."</p><p></p><p>However, the gap between Sect Masters is not small, and the Great Sect Masters are even more formidable.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm Great Sect Masters are still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>That black-robed person, although also a Great Sect Master, was clearly not at the peak Great Sect Master realm, much less a pinnacle Great Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>The combat experience has increased again, Li Xuan was excited, "I don't even need to fight, this combat experience can be increased just by lying down, how wonderful!"</p><p></p><p>So, the arduous cultivation can be skipped, just let the disciples go and struggle.</p><p></p><p>As the master, he can just lie down and become invincible.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan slapped a Sect Master to death, your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was dumbfounded, "Another Sect Master?"</p><p></p><p>Sect Masters are not at the top of the Inner Realm's power hierarchy, why has Xu Yan, upon entering the Inner Realm, slapped two Sect Masters to death in a short period of time?</p><p></p><p>"Did my disciple provoke the Sect Masters, or did the Sect Masters provoke my disciple?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into contemplation, "My disciple Xu Yan is simple and kind-hearted, it must be that the Sect Masters provoked him, so he slapped them to death, which is fine!"</p><p></p><p>Slapping only two Sect Masters to death, in such a vast Inner Realm with numerous sects and powers, the number of Sect Masters is still quite large.</p><p></p><p>However, what surprised Li Xuan was:</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan slapped a Sect Master to death, your combat experience has increased..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, "Are Sect Masters really walking all over the Inner Realm? Or did Xu Yan stir up a hornet's nest of Sect Masters?"</p><p></p><p>He was shocked, could it be that he has provoked a Great Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>"Is the Inner Realm really that dangerous? Are Sect Masters as common as cabbage?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but suspect that Sect Masters might be ubiquitous in the Inner Realm, not belonging to the top echelon of power.</p><p></p><p>"It's been a few days, and Xu Yan hasn't slapped any more Sect Masters to death, it seems Sect Masters are not that many after all."</p><p></p><p>A few days have passed, and he hasn't slapped any more Sect Masters to death.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuansheng heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>However, his relief didn't last long.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan, in his battle with a peak sect master, has gained a profound understanding of the true essence of the Dragon's Roar technique. Your Dragon's Roar technique has reached completion!"</p><p></p><p>Here it comes again.</p><p></p><p>And this time, it's a peak sect master. But surprisingly, Xu Yan has gained some insight.</p><p></p><p>The true essence of the Dragon's Roar!</p><p></p><p>"As expected, combat is the best way to unleash one's innate talents. Xu Yan has gained an understanding of the Dragon's Roar technique, and the power of the Descending Dragon Palm has grown even stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Sending Xu Yan to the Inner Realm to temper himself was the right choice.</p><p></p><p>It hasn't been long, yet he has already reaped the rewards.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has killed a peak sect master, and your combat experience has increased."</p><p></p><p>The Godly Feedback came again.</p><p></p><p>A peak sect master has been killed.</p><p></p><p>"Excellent, my disciple Xu Yan can now sweep through the Sect Master realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Even a peak sect master, though on the weaker side, has been killed. This means that Xu Yan's current strength is already unrivaled within the Sect Master realm.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan reaches the pinnacle of the Innate Realm, he will be able to contend with Great Sect Masters."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Once Xu Yan's Innate Realm is perfected, someone like the Black-Robed Man would no longer be a match for him.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he had a premonition that Xu Yan's strength would continue to grow through battles.</p><p></p><p>When his Innate Realm is complete, he may not even fear peak Great Sect Masters. Even if he cannot defeat them, he would not be in danger.</p><p></p><p>The power to cross a major realm boundary through battle!</p><p></p><p>On this day, a powerful aura surged up from the hillside outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through.</p><p></p><p>A towering, golden figure stood proudly on the hillside, exuding a formidable presence that swept across the area.</p><p></p><p>Enveloped in golden light, he radiated an aura akin to the brilliance of the sun, with a sense of immortality.</p><p></p><p>The Golden Sun Body!</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was experiencing the changes within himself. He had opened three golden apertures and entered the realm of the Golden Sun Body, his strength skyrocketing, his physical body comparable to a precious weapon.</p><p></p><p>Standing still, even a cultivator at the peak of the Qi Realm wielding a treasured weapon would be unable to harm him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>This was the power of the Golden Sun Body!</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, Meng Chong exuded an overwhelming aura.</p><p></p><p>"After my breakthrough, the Dao of the Sword has been tempered throughout my body, and my Golden Diamond Bone seems to have undergone a transformation!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and unleashed a punch, the wind and thunder roaring, the fist strike unparalleled in its domineering power, with thunderous gales enveloping the lightning, penetrating everything and destroying all in its path.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The entire hillside trembled.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!" Stone Two was shocked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's strength after his breakthrough was overwhelming. Even without approaching, his presence alone made him feel suffocated.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Cat lying beside him stared at Meng Chong's golden, formidable figure, its aura far more fierce than the beast's own.</p><p></p><p>Its claws scratched the ground, as if deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was utterly amazed. Even at the Innate Realm, he was this powerful. If he reached the Profound Realm, how terrifying would he be?</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong gave her the impression that a single punch could easily kill a Sect Master cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Sect Master cultivators, even the weakest, were still formidable presences in the Inner Realm, dominating small cities and looking down upon the world. Yet, in Meng Chong's hands, they seemed incapable of withstanding a single punch.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong suppressed his aura, the golden light fading, and his overwhelming presence began to recede. Though he still appeared to be a formidable bald youth, the previous domineering and fierce aura had diminished.</p><p></p><p>"My aura was still too overt. I need to suppress it further, or else when I enter the Inner Realm, everyone will think I'm just a reckless brute!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The golden light emerged again, and the Godly Feedback for his breakthrough arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong, by cultivating the technique you created, has successfully broken through and cultivated the Golden Sun Body. Your Innate Realm Golden Sun Body has reached completion, a hundredfold of its peers!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt his physical body instantly transform, and the golden apertures in his Innate Realm had reached completion.</p><p></p><p>"Relying solely on my physical body, even without using any martial arts, I can easily defeat Great Sect Masters with a single punch. Even if dozens of Great Sect Masters gang up on me, they won't be able to break through my defenses.</p><p></p><p>"I can easily take them down one by one, and it shouldn't consume too much of my energy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart was filled with exhilaration, the confidence brought by his increased strength soaring.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has transformed into the Golden Diamond Bone, and you have obtained the Majestic Spiritual Body."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Body underwent another transformation, imbued with an overwhelming and domineering aura, further enhancing his physical prowess.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong has also transformed, the Golden Diamond Bone, a type of Spiritual Bone."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>He wondered if Suli Xiu's breakthrough would also result in a transformation. If so, with continued accumulation, what powerful Spiritual Body could he obtain?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he had some ideas. "I have the orthodox martial arts, the physical martial arts, and the alchemy martial arts. What new martial arts can I create?"</p><p></p><p>If he could develop a new martial arts system and take on a new disciple, once the disciple's cultivation reached a high level, the feedback he could receive would be even more bountiful, leading to continuous enhancements through accumulation.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan currently had no clear direction for a new martial arts system.</p><p></p><p>"Weapon Forging Martial Arts? Feels a bit lacking in power, and I don't have a clear theory yet. Just forging weapons alone is not comprehensive enough."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll focus on developing the cultivation theories beyond the Profound Realm first."</p><p></p><p>Creating a new martial arts system would have to wait for now, until he had some inspiration.</p><p></p><p>After all, finding a prodigy disciple was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>After his breakthrough, Meng Chong was stabilizing and refining his realm.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Cat approached him, staring at him with eager eyes, its tail sweeping the ground, lost in thought.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and tapped the cat with his bamboo staff, once again opening its apertures and repeating the Great Demon Techniques.</p><p></p><p>Continuously deepening the cat's memories, perhaps one day it would truly comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>The failed spirit pills that Suli Xiu had concocted were all fed to the cat.</p><p></p><p>After eating the spirit pills, the cat no longer needed to consume other food, as it was no longer affected by hunger, showing that the failed pills still contained significant medicinal power.</p><p></p><p>"My second disciple is also about to enter the Inner Realm. I hope he doesn't run into any Sect Masters again, like what happened with Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled wryly. Xu Yan had entered the Inner Realm and consecutively killed several Sect Masters, which was likely an accident. Surely Meng Chong wouldn't go and provoke a nest of Sect Masters as well, right?</p><p></p><p>Treating Sect Masters as if they were everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was startled. Was this feedback from Meng Chong or Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>No, could it be that he has killed another Sect Master?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has slapped a Sect Master cultivator to death, consecutively killing four Sect Masters. Your combat experience has greatly increased."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>"Was he ambushed? Why do the Sect Masters in the Inner Realm feel so weak, like mosquitoes that can be slapped to death with a single palm..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep contemplation, wondering just what Xu Yan had done to provoke so many Sect Master cultivators.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

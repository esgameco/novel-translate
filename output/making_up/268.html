        <h1>Chapter 268</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu leaned against the maid's embrace, appearing weak and frail. Occasional flushes of sickness colored her pale face, and she patted Zheng Huang's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"What's the deal with this battle of geniuses? I was playing in Luozhou when I heard about this, so I came to join the fun."</p><p></p><p>"It's like this..." </p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang hurriedly recounted the entire sequence of events - Xu Yan's sudden rise, the destruction of the Dai family, the takeover of the Jade Spirit Sect, and the mysterious appearance of the reclusive cultivator faction.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Cui, do you intend to intervene and suppress the reclusive cultivators?"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang asked in the end.</p><p></p><p>"This Xu Yan is rather interesting. As for the reclusive cultivator faction, they won't amount to much - just give the Jade Spirit Sect, those worthless dregs, a little squeeze. </p><p></p><p>"I've always felt that sects like the Jade Spirit Sect, those waste spiritual sects, shouldn't even be called spiritual sects.</p><p></p><p>"Anyway, the rules of the Spiritual Realm have already been set, and there's no point in changing them now. I don't have the time or mood for that.</p><p></p><p>"That kid Lu Xinting does have some ability. Let's see if he gets killed this time - if he does, Qiming Sect will be in for a treat."</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu had a carefree, entertained expression.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Zheng Huang also breathed a sigh of relief. The Zheng Kingdom had always maintained a stance of non-interference in martial arts conflicts, no matter how intense the battles were, they would not get involved.</p><p></p><p>They would only act on the orders of the Supreme Spiritual Sect. And the Supreme Spiritual Sect would not issue any orders for the Zheng Kingdom to participate in the conflicts.</p><p></p><p>What Zheng Huang feared the most was Cui Huayu - this unpredictable person. If she suddenly had a brainwave and ordered the Zheng Kingdom to act, that would be quite troublesome.</p><p></p><p>The Zheng Kingdom dared not disobey, after all, it was an order from the Supreme Spiritual Sect.</p><p></p><p>"Old Zheng, how do you think Xu Yan's chances are?" Cui Huayu asked.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang was puzzled, not knowing whether Cui Huayu hoped for Xu Yan to win or lose.</p><p></p><p>"In this old servant's judgment, Xu Yan's strength is also not bad, it's about even."</p><p></p><p>He pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"A bit low." </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu stroked her chin and turned to look at a maid beside her. "Where's the sword? Bring it out."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, young master!" </p><p></p><p>The maid took out a sword from a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu tossed the sword to Zheng Huang, saying, "This is a high-grade spiritual weapon. As a mere reclusive cultivator, Xu Yan may not have a good sword, and will be at a disadvantage against Lu Xinting.</p><p></p><p>"You send this sword to him, let him do his best to kill Lu Xinting."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang was dumbfounded. No, Cui Huayu was a true disciple of the Supreme Spiritual Sect, one of the true disciples of the Imperial Spiritual Sect. She should be standing on Lu Xinting's side, as he was part of the spiritual sect faction.</p><p></p><p>How come she was supporting the reclusive cultivator Xu Yan instead? This person's actions were truly unfathomable!</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, this servant will definitely have someone send the sword over!" </p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang hurriedly agreed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm!" </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu nodded, a smile appearing on her face. "The Spiritual Realm isn't lively enough. If Lu Xinting gets killed by a reclusive cultivator, it should become more lively, right? Hehe, I just love joining in the fun!"</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu had an expectant expression.</p><p></p><p>"Young Miss Cui, if there's nothing else, this servant will go make arrangements to send the sword to Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang was anxious to leave, so he asked.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go." </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu waved her hand.</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang felt as if a great burden had been lifted. He hurriedly bowed and left, immediately instructing his son to go attend to Cui Huayu well. His son's face turned green.</p><p></p><p>Attending to that Young Miss Cui, if one wasn't careful, one's life could be in danger!</p><p></p><p>"Remember, serve her well, and if you gain Cui Huayu's favor, you should know what benefits that will bring. The risk is great, but the rewards are also great!"</p><p></p><p>Zheng Huang said sternly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, father!" </p><p></p><p>Gritting his teeth, the son entered the father's chambers to attend to Cui Huayu.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside, the battle of geniuses was causing a huge commotion, and countless martial artists were preparing to witness the fight. Influenced by preconceptions, most people firmly believed that Lu Xinting would win, and Xu Yan would lose. But in a secluded manor outside the Zheng Kingdom's capital, there was no sense of tension at all.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was, as usual, immersed in comprehending the Dao of martial arts and cultivating. Su Lingxiu was refining dan. Meng Chong and Fang Hao were discussing the forging of a precious sword.</p><p></p><p>Regarding the battle of geniuses, no one was paying it much mind - Lu Xinting was already a dead man.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, forging a sword that can grow in size is something you know I need. If the sword doesn't change with my Six Zhang Golden Body, I'll have no weapon to use."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Second Brother, I understand your requirement. Changing the size is easy, but for you, that's obviously not enough. </p><p></p><p>"Let me ponder how to forge an even stronger sword, not just one that can simply change size."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to you, Junior Brother."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded. A sword that only changes size has little use.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow is the day of the decisive battle. Big Brother, how many swords do you think it will take to kill Lu Xinting?"</p><p></p><p>That night, the four of them gathered together. Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"I haven't seen him, so I don't know." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Lu Xinting was only at the peak of the Great Celestial Realm, one realm higher than Xu Yan. He was also a renowned genius of the Spiritual Realm, a true disciple of Qiming Sect. His strength was certainly formidable. Xu Yan was confident he could defeat him, but as for how many swords it would take, he couldn't make a judgment, as he hadn't seen Lu Xinting yet.</p><p></p><p>If Lu Xinting was a Forged Celestial, this battle might be more intense. But a mere Great Celestial, no matter how renowned a genius of the Spiritual Realm and a top spiritual sect disciple, was nothing in Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder how many Forged Celestials the sects and great families of Yuzhou have, all eyeing this opportunity hungrily?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Small matter, even if they're Forged Celestial initial stage, with the two of us working together, we can kill three or four of them." </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said unconcernedly.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, killing ordinary Forged Celestial initial stage cultivators was no longer a challenge.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next day, the battle of geniuses was to take place.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan's group was about to set out, Yu Gao and Wen Yong hurriedly arrived.</p><p></p><p>"What happened?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao frowned, seeing their anxious expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Zheng Huang had someone find our base and entrusted us to deliver an item to Brother Xu." </p><p></p><p>Wen Yong said gravely.</p><p></p><p>It was not surprising that Zheng Huang knew the location of the Myriad Ages Alliance's base in the Zheng Kingdom's capital. But that they had entrusted something to be delivered to Xu Yan was unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Could it be that the Zheng Kingdom's royal house wanted to get involved in this battle of geniuses?</p><p></p><p>"What item?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked, puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao took out a box and opened it, revealing a sword inside.</p><p></p><p>He had a strange expression as he said, "Zheng Huang had someone pass on a message, saying a certain esteemed person is sending this sword to Young Master Xu... and that he should use it to kill Lu Xinting!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's group was stunned. What did this mean? Kill Lu Xinting? Was this to make up for Xu Yan's potential weapon disadvantage by intentionally sending him a sword to assist him?</p><p></p><p>"Does Zheng Huang have a grudge against Lu Xinting? Or is it against Qiming Sect?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Does Zong have a grudge?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was greatly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"He is the 'esteemed person' mentioned by Zheng the Emperor, but he didn't specify the identity of this esteemed person..."</p><p></p><p>Yu Gao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"This 'esteemed person' may just be an excuse, and it's actually Zheng the Emperor himself?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao speculated.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and the sword in the box flew out.</p><p></p><p>"A top-grade spiritual treasure, he really spares no expense." </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was even more surprised when he saw it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at it, then threw the sword back into the box, saying, "Send it back, I don't need his spiritual treasure. Lu Xinting challenged me, he's seeking his own death, and I will oblige him."</p><p></p><p>"If we take this spiritual treasure, wouldn't that make us indebted to him?" </p><p></p><p>"Good!" </p><p></p><p>Yu Gao nodded and closed the box.</p><p></p><p>Just then, Shen Haizhou also arrived.</p><p></p><p>Of course, he wouldn't appear together with Xu Yan and the others, as he couldn't let anyone know about his collusion with Xu Yan and the others, or else he would be in trouble.</p><p></p><p>"Shen brother, you've come at the right time. Does Zheng the Emperor or the Crimson Abyss Sect have a grudge against someone?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>As a member of a prominent spiritual cultivator family, Shen Haizhou would naturally be more informed about the affairs of the spiritual cultivator world.</p><p></p><p>"What makes you say that?" </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pointed to the box in Yu Gao's hand and briefly explained the situation.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Shen Haizhou's expression changed abruptly.</p><p></p><p>"The 'esteemed person'? This means... a member of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect has descended upon Yuzhou!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you so certain it's a member of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked puzzledly.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou took a deep breath and said, "The Zheng Kingdom holds a special position, it is directly under the rule of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect and only answers to them. The only one who can be called an 'esteemed person' by the Zheng Emperor must be a member of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and the others suddenly understood.</p><p></p><p>"I see, but why would a member of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect send me a sword and ask me to kill Lu Xinting?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was even more puzzled.</p><p></p><p>If the Transcendent Spiritual Sect had a grudge against the Crimson Abyss Sect or Lu Xinting, they could just act directly. Why would they have to use someone else's hand?</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was also puzzled. The Transcendent Spiritual Sect was supreme and the true ruler of the Spiritual Realm. Compared to them, even the top-tier Crimson Abyss Sect was nothing.</p><p></p><p>"I don't understand either, but I can confirm that a member of the Transcendent Spiritual Sect has indeed appeared." </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said gravely.</p><p></p><p>"Forget about this, let's just send the sword back."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>No matter how powerful the Transcendent Spiritual Sect was, compared to his master, they were nothing. He was the strongest in terms of background.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou revealed all the intelligence he had gathered to Xu Yan and the others, including the spiritual cultivator families' plan to ambush Meng Chong and the others. After passing on the information, Shen Haizhou hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, ambush me?" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, the battle of the geniuses is about to begin!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>This battle would mark the beginning of Xu Yan's rise to fame in the Spiritual Realm.</p>

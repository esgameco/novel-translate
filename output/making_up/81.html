        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I will definitely comprehend it and will not disappoint you!" </p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly bowed and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"I believe in you!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded his head, his figure soaring into the air and disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath, looking at the remnants left behind from his master's display of the Wind and Thunder Vajra Fist. He closed his eyes, the scene of his master wielding the Wind and Thunder Vajra Fist emerging in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The ferocity and swiftness were like the might of thunderous power. </p><p></p><p>It was like a raging wind, penetrating everywhere without a gap.</p><p></p><p>His heart was shaken with an indescribable shock. Such a terrifying might was actually unleashed by one who had attained mastery of the Qi and Blood Realm?</p><p></p><p>"The Dao that my master has passed down is the Dao of the Fist, not merely the techniques of the fist!</p><p></p><p>"What I need to comprehend is the swiftness and thunderous might, the formless and all-pervasive nature like the wind, not the specific techniques my master used in his fist strikes!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong constantly reminded himself, trying to focus on the wind and thunder-like power rather than the techniques his master had displayed.</p><p></p><p>After passing down the Wind and Thunder Vajra Fist to Meng Chong, Li Xuan felt relieved, occasionally still guiding Shi Er's cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for whether Meng Chong could comprehend it, he believed there shouldn't be any problem.</p><p></p><p>However, how long it would take for him to fully comprehend it was impossible to estimate, but it likely wouldn't be too long.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spent every day in the mountains and forests, contemplating the Wind and Thunder Vajra Fist, the thunderous might his master had displayed constantly echoing in his mind.</p><p></p><p>He gradually imprinted this power into his mind, meticulously contemplating it.</p><p></p><p>From then on, Meng Chong left early and returned late every day, constantly practicing the fist in the mountains, deepening the impression of the wind and thunder power his master had demonstrated.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he was waiting for Xu Yan to break through to the Xian Tian Realm. Once Xu Yan did so, he could then pass down the cultivation methods above the Xian Tian Realm.</p><p></p><p>The path of the martial dao still needed to be pioneered by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>As for Meng Chong's subsequent cultivation, after the Golden Bell Covering, Li Xuan had already prepared how he should cultivate and what kind of cultivation methods to practice.</p><p></p><p>The physical martial dao was also gradually being perfected.</p><p></p><p>However, the cultivation methods for the physical martial dao at the Xian Tian Realm would only be passed down to Meng Chong after he had comprehended the Wind and Thunder Vajra Fist, lest he be distracted and unable to focus, which would hinder his comprehension.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the boundless great mountains.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince of Qi, under the protection of many experts, continued to explore the depths of the great mountains, constantly advancing deeper.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the sage?" </p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince had a longing expression.</p><p></p><p>The struggle for the imperial throne, the position of Crown Prince that was almost within his grasp, had slipped away!</p><p></p><p>The reason was Xu Yan, the powerful martial dao expert, forcing the Emperor to back down, the Qi royal clan having no choice but to submit! Guo Rongshan, though seemingly insignificant, in reality no one in Qi dared to defy him, even the Emperor himself was the same! Up until now, Guo Rongshan had not done anything outrageous, merely being constrained by his reputation and unwilling to tarnish the name of the sage.</p><p></p><p>It was also related to his elevated vision, no longer focusing on the mundane imperial power.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince felt that his search for the sage was not only for himself, but for the entire Qi Kingdom, for the Qi royal clan.</p><p></p><p>"Who was it that originally suggested starting with the son-in-law of Guo Rongshan?" </p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince gritted his teeth in resentment.</p><p></p><p>If they hadn't gone to ransack Xu Yan's home back then, this whole mess wouldn't have happened.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, we have already advanced over 500 li into the boundless great mountains. Shall we continue deeper?" </p><p></p><p>The attending eunuch expressed his concern.</p><p></p><p>The son of the Minister of War had apparently encountered disaster after advancing over 500 li into a different mountain range, not this one.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince looked around, now either having to explore left or right, or continue deeper, but going deeper would be dangerous.</p><p></p><p>He looked at the group, all of them were experts, including dozens of elite palace guards.</p><p></p><p>This team's combat power far surpassed the group the Minister's son had led. Even if they encountered danger, they wouldn't be completely defenseless.</p><p></p><p>Even if they had no ability to resist, with so many people, the monster probably wouldn't be able to drain them all before being full.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince steeled his resolve and said, "Continue forward in our exploration!</p><p></p><p>Seeking fortune in peril, the martial dao is also found in danger!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Your Highness!"</p><p></p><p>The eunuch attendant nodded and passed down the order.</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he was thinking, "I wonder if the martial dao can make one's roots grow back? Or, without the roots, will it affect cultivation?"</p><p></p><p>Although he had a physical deficiency, he still had a heart yearning for the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince's group of over 300 people, equipped with the finest gear, encountered no real danger as they advanced. Ferocious beasts fled at their approach, and they easily slew any venomous snakes that appeared, the guards' leather armor and snake-repelling ointments keeping them safe.</p><p></p><p>"Where is the sage?" </p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince became somewhat dejected.</p><p></p><p>In the depths of the boundless great mountains, two figures were leisurely strolling, their feet not touching the ground as they moved through the forests.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a roar echoed out, and a spotted giant tiger leapt out.</p><p></p><p>The one walking in front was a young man in his twenties, who glanced at the spotted tiger and smiled, "This is a Crimson-Eyed Tiger?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man behind him nodded, "Yes, young master!"</p><p></p><p>The spotted giant tiger, about to unleash its might, was cowed by the young man's glance, lying obediently on the ground like a docile large cat.</p><p></p><p>The young man chuckled, looking towards the outside of the boundless great mountains.</p><p></p><p>"So Blood Heartless really dared to flee, actually going to the remote borderlands, does he think no one would come to the borderlands to kill him?"</p><p></p><p>The middle-aged man cautiously said, "Young master, do not be careless. Blood Heartless is a sect master of the Demonic Cult, cultivating the rumored Blood Demon Classic that absorbs the essence blood of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Although the borderlands lack spiritual energy and are unsuitable for cultivation, there are still people living there. Given Blood Heartless' ruthlessness, he will surely commit massacres and blood sacrifices."</p><p></p><p>"His strength has likely recovered, or even increased somewhat."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng proudly declared, "Hu Shan, you are also a sect master. Even if Blood Heartless is stronger, with the two of us joining forces, we can certainly slay him!</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, I, Xie Lingfeng alone, am more than enough to kill him. Sect master martial artists are not something I haven't killed before!"</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan thought about it and felt there was truth to his words. The young master was one of the youngest and most renowned geniuses of the martial dao in the Inner Realm, his strength far exceeding ordinary martial artists.</p><p></p><p>And he himself was also a sect master.</p><p></p><p>Even if the young master alone couldn't kill Blood Heartless, with the two of them, Blood Heartless would undoubtedly die.</p><p></p><p>"Hu Shan, the reason I must go to the borderlands to slay Blood Heartless is precisely because there are people living there. Otherwise, the borderlands will become a living hell!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's expression became cold and grave as he said, "Blood Heartless has been in the borderlands for some time now, and he has likely already committed many atrocities."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded. Without any powerful experts in the borderlands, even an entire army would be nothing more than cannon fodder to Blood Heartless.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, hurry to the borderlands!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said, soaring into the air and flying out of the boundless great mountains.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, look, there are people over there!"</p><p></p><p>Half an hour later, Hu Shan suddenly pointed to the left front and said.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked over, and there were...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A team of over 300 people formed a circle, vigilantly guarding the surroundings and sheltering the young people inside. The team looked rather disheveled.</p><p></p><p>The people being protected in the center were obviously of distinguished status.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed, "It seems that Xue Wuxin has already committed heinous crimes. These people have been forced to flee into the endless mountains. Given their strength, even with bows and arrows, if they continue to venture deeper, they may encounter ferocious beasts like the Crimson-Eyed Tiger and the Fire-Maned Wolf, and the entire army could be wiped out."</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was clear at a glance that this group of people had come to the mountains to seek refuge. Combining this with Xue Wuxin's flight to the remote border region, it was not difficult to guess that these people had fled here because Xue Wuxin had committed massacres in the border areas.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go down and ask them!" </p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng flew towards the Crown Prince and the others.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince's group had explored and reached this place, and everyone was exhausted and began to rest in place. "Where is the great master? Where did that Xu Yan fellow encounter the great master?"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was starting to lose his determination.</p><p></p><p>Accustomed to a life of luxury, he had never experienced such hardship.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, look, the great master!"</p><p></p><p>The attending eunuch suddenly exclaimed excitedly.</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince perked up, looked up, and indeed saw two figures flying down from the sky. </p><p></p><p>They landed in front of them in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The great master!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Crown Prince became excited, his face flushed, and his fatigue vanished.</p><p></p><p>He abruptly jumped up, but then felt it was improper, and just as he was standing up, he knelt down with a thud.</p><p></p><p>"Crown Prince of the Qi Kingdom, pays respects to the great master!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince knelt down, and the rest of the guards all knelt down, greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>"Pay respects to the great master!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed inwardly, the sins that Xue Wuxin had committed, forcing the mighty Crown Prince of a kingdom to come to this endless mountain to seek the great master to resolve the great calamity of the country.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, great master!" </p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince excitedly stood up.</p><p></p><p>He secretly glanced at Xie Lingfeng and the other, although Xie Lingfeng looked a little younger than him, he absolutely would not think that Xie Lingfeng was younger than him. This was the great master, with the art of preserving one's appearance and eternal youth.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng spoke in a deep voice, "Has your Qi Kingdom encountered a mishap, a great calamity?"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was startled, how did the great master know? But yes, ever since Xu Yan came, the Qi Kingdom had undergone great changes. As for a great calamity? It was possible, who knows when Guo Rongshan would suddenly have an idea and rebel.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, the great master is truly prescient!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince nodded vigorously.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thought to himself, so Xue Wuxin has already begun to slaughter and sacrifice, devouring spiritual energy to strengthen himself. If he had not come, the tragedy in the border regions would have been unimaginable! Thinking of this, he frowned angrily and said, "How outrageous! Tell me, how many people have died?"</p><p></p><p>How many people have died? The Crown Prince was momentarily confused. He really didn't know the specific number, but he had heard that Xu Yan had swept away the elite Shenwei Army of 10,000 men, a fact known to all the ministers in the capital.</p><p></p><p>As for how many of the Shenwei Army had died, he did not know.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know the exact number, but I've heard that he has swept away our Qi Kingdom's elite Shenwei Army of 10,000 men!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince answered honestly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's killing intent grew even stronger. He had already slaughtered 10,000 people? And these were the elite Shenwei Army of the Qi Kingdom. Before this, he must have already killed countless others, and even the sacrifice of an entire city might have already occurred, forcing the Qi Kingdom to dispatch its elite troops for suppression.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, where is he now?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Probably in the East River Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was not entirely certain.</p><p></p><p>However, judging from the great master's demeanor, it seemed that he had some grievances with Xu Yan or Xu Yan's master. Having grievances was good, as he would not be allied with Xu Yan then.</p><p></p><p>"Great master, please protect our Qi Kingdom's royal house. Our Qi Kingdom is willing to appoint you as the Protector National Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince bowed and paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to be the Protector National Master. I will resolve the calamity of your Qi Kingdom myself."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng thought for a moment and said, "You follow me back to the Qi Kingdom, and I will find his trail and deal with him!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, great master!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was a little disappointed.</p><p></p><p>However, as long as the great master went to the capital of the Qi Kingdom, there would still be a chance.</p><p></p><p>"Great master, please follow me back to the capital, and we will soon know his whereabouts."</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince ordered, and they immediately set out to return to the capital of the Qi Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng saw that this group of people was moving too slowly. By the time they returned to the capital of the Qi Kingdom, Xue Wuxin might have already killed even more people.</p><p></p><p>Lest the night be long and the dream many, Xie Lingfeng directly reached out and grabbed the Crown Prince's shoulder, saying, "You just point the direction, and I'll take you there."</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was a bit confused, and chuckled awkwardly, "That... great master, I don't know the direction!"</p><p></p><p>"But my attendant knows the direction!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince hastily pointed to his attending eunuch.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go together."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>Hu Shan raised his hand and grabbed the attending eunuch, flying up into the sky with Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"They're flying up into the sky!"</p><p></p><p>The Crown Prince was greatly excited, and when he looked down, he shuddered.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't even fly yet, but the great master's abilities were far superior to Xu Yan's. This meant the glory of the Guo Rongshan family was over.</p><p></p><p>His father the King was old and should abdicate.</p><p></p><p>What an useless old man, only venting his anger on his own son! The Crown Prince thought bitterly.</p><p></p><p>"Lead the way."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng looked at the attending eunuch.</p><p></p><p>"It's over there! The capital is that way!"</p><p></p><p>The excited eunuch's voice trembled slightly as he pointed towards the direction of the Qi Kingdom's capital.</p><p></p><p>He really wanted to ask the great master if the severed root could regrow and cultivate martial arts again, but he didn't dare to ask.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's inner qi surged, protecting the Crown Prince as he flew towards the direction of the Qi Kingdom's capital. </p><p></p><p>Hu Shan, holding the attending eunuch, followed closely behind.</p><p></p><p>The Qi Kingdom's capital was still prosperous.</p><p></p><p>The ministers had no heart to attend court, and the common people also didn't care, as long as the lord didn't come to disturb their lives, whether they attended court or not was irrelevant to them.</p><p></p><p>It was the Qi King who was truly a sage of great virtue. Since the Qi King took charge of state affairs and assisted the Emperor, the burdensome taxes and levies had decreased, and the people's lives had improved.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial palace, the Qi Emperor was entertaining Guo Rongshan, addressing him as "Brother Guo" affectionately, while the one attending to them was his favorite concubine, Yun Fei.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan felt very uncomfortable.</p><p></p><p>Last time, this old Emperor even had the idea of giving Yun Fei to him, which frightened him into hastily refusing.</p><p></p><p>Now, having Yun Fei attend to him, what did that mean?</p><p></p><p>"Brother Guo, I see you're getting stronger and more vigorous. How about I..."</p><p></p><p>The Qi Emperor chuckled.</p><p></p><p>He was inwardly resentful, becoming an Emperor like this, surely the first of its kind in history? Where was the great master, why hadn't he been found yet!</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, your servant is terrified, my wife is like a tigress, I dare not think of it!" </p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan hurriedly declined.</p><p></p><p>This old Emperor, had he developed some strange habits? Could it be that he wanted to give him a concubine again?</p><p></p><p>"Father, the great master has arrived, your son has found the great master!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an excited voice came from the sky.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Before the mountain gate of the Thousand Martial Hall, the battle of the geniuses was about to begin again, and the martial artists were greatly excited, ready to witness history once more.</p><p></p><p>"I thought the Blood Demon was arrogant and presumptuous enough in the past, but fortunately I'm still alive today to know that there are people beyond people. Xu Yan is even more reckless than the Blood Demon," an elder sighed and lamented.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was the first one to block the gate of the Transcendent Spirit Sect and issue a challenge.</p><p></p><p>"This is so exciting!" </p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu leaned out of the palace gate, holding a handful of spirit beans, tossing them into her mouth one by one, watching the impending battle with excitement.</p><p></p><p>On the arena, Xu Yan soared into the air, and the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall did the same, for if they fought on the arena, it would collapse in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the collapse of the arena did not concern the geniuses of the Thousand Martial Hall, but the arena was too close to the gate of the Thousand Martial Hall, and the aftershock of the battle would affect the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he followed Xu Yan and took the fight to the air.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, a mere wandering cultivator, dares to challenge the supreme sect of the Thousand Martial Hall. Who gave you the courage? Today you shall die!"</p><p></p><p>The genius' aura surged, his saber light flashing, his strength far exceeding that of the previous five geniuses.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the genius from the Hundred Saber Gate, one of the Seven Sects?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, it's him. I didn't expect his strength to have grown so much."</p><p></p><p>Among the martial artists, many recognized the genius who had taken action, from the Hundred Saber Gate, one of the Seven Sects, and was already renowned in the Thousand Martial State.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master and the elders of the Hundred Saber Gate watched their genius with grave expressions. If he could kill Xu Yan, the status of the Hundred Saber Gate would rise greatly.</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Three Kingdoms, the Seven Sects, and the Eight Aristocratic Families had all entered the Thousand Martial Hall to receive a half-month of strength enhancement and the cultivation of powerful secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, their strength had undergone such a huge leap, the profundity and methods of the Transcendent Spirit Sect were truly inconceivable. To be able to dominate the Spiritual Realm for countless years, the foundation of the Transcendent Spirit Sect was beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was calm. The opponent's strength had indeed increased greatly, but he was no longer at the Divine Will Realm, but had broken through to the Divine Origin Realm. Although he had just broken through, his strength was already far beyond what it was half a month ago.</p><p></p><p>He raised his right hand, the middle and index fingers together, and drew a sword in the air. A divine sword appeared.</p><p></p><p>"Presumptuous!" The Hundred Saber Gate genius was furious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan actually treated him with such disdain, not even bothering to draw his sword. He roared and unleashed a powerful slash.</p><p></p><p>Although he was angered by Xu Yan's disdain and arrogance, his first strike was his strongest attack, a torrential onslaught of saber light.</p><p></p><p>"Trifling tricks!" Xu Yan sneered, his two fingers lightly tapping, and the divine sword he had summoned instantly pierced through the Hundred Saber Gate genius' attack, shattering it.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Saber Gate genius staggered back, his expression one of disbelief. Xu Yan reached out and grasped the divine sword, the sword intent already permeating the surroundings, unnoticed by the Hundred Saber Gate genius.</p><p></p><p>"It seems Xu Yan has grown stronger again!"</p><p></p><p>"Was he cultivating to enhance his strength in just half a month?"</p><p></p><p>The watching martial artists who had witnessed the previous battle were all amazed.</p><p></p><p>In just half a month, Xu Yan had grown stronger again.</p><p></p><p>"Have you noticed, Xu Yan's cultivation seems a bit different? His martial dao energy is rather unusual."</p><p></p><p>"I've noticed it too, it's quite different from the martial dao energy I'm familiar with, almost... divine?"</p><p></p><p>"Who knows what realm Xu Yan is in? It doesn't seem to be the Refined Spirit Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>Many martial artists were puzzled by Xu Yan's martial dao energy, as if it was not of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"There's nothing strange about it. Xu Yan is so strong, the martial dao technique he cultivates must be extraordinary. That is likely the source of his strength."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, his martial dao technique must be of an extremely high level, that's why he dares to confront the geniuses of the Transcendent Spirit Sect."</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists were not surprised, believing that Xu Yan's exceptional martial dao technique was the reason for his strength.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Myriad Star Martial Institute had cultivators who claimed to be researching unique martial dao techniques. Could it be that the technique Xu Yan cultivates is one they developed?"</p><p></p><p>"That's a possibility!"</p><p></p><p>Some martial artists who had experienced the Myriad Star Martial Institute era were also astonished.</p><p></p><p>On the Thousand Martial Hall gate, the Thousand Martial Hall Master and the others had gloomy expressions.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has grown stronger again, and his martial dao technique..."</p><p></p><p>With their insight, they could clearly see that Xu Yan's martial dao energy was extraordinary, and they could not accurately determine his realm, whether it was truly the Refined Spirit Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the powerful experts of the Thousand Martial Hall also believed that the unique martial dao technique Xu Yan cultivated was likely developed by Wu Tiannan and the other former Myriad Star Martial Institute cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"You are strong, but that's all!" The Hundred Saber Gate genius' expression turned cold. Xu Yan had easily shattered his attack, making him realize that no matter how he struck, he was no match for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The only option left was to unleash the Burn Life Killing Intent! But once he used the Burn Life Killing Intent, he would also die. </p><p></p><p>There was no choice left now, he had to go all out.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The Hundred Saber Gate genius struck again, this attack even more ferocious, a hundred saber strikes combined into one, a hundred strikes merged into a single slash. This was his ultimate killing technique.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Hundred Saber Gate's ultimate technique?"</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The watching martial artists were full of admiration.</p><p></p><p>In the air above the arena, the layers of saber light converged in an instant, forming a single slash that seemed to split the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"He's going to use the Burn Life Killing Intent!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall Master and the others all tensed up.</p><p></p><p>Would the Burn Life Killing Intent be able to kill Xu Yan? Or at least severely injure him?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan unleashed a sword strike, mountains and rivers appearing, the sword light layering, as if it could dissolve all attacks within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>A seemingly simple sword strike, yet it contained boundless killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"Now!" The Hundred Saber Gate genius' expression hardened, and suddenly a blood-colored aura surged from within him.</p><p></p><p>Terrifying killing intent descended, crossing the distance in an instant, appearing before Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>This killing intent carried a sense of taboo.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Saber Gate genius who had unleashed the Burn Life Killing Intent seemed to have lost his soul, his life force diminished by 99%, his physical body even sunken in.</p><p></p><p>But he had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>How would Xu Yan defend against this strike?</p><p></p><p>Once the Burn Life Killing Intent was unleashed, all the martial artists were horrified. What a terrifying secret technique!</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Technique?</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji's expression darkened as the great spear instantly appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>However, even if he wanted to rush in to save him, it was already too late! This strike was too fast and too powerful. No one had expected that the genius of the Hundred Blade Gate could unleash such a terrifying attack.</p><p></p><p>This attack exceeded the level of his own cultivation! "Shameless!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji was shocked and furious in his heart. This secret technique must have been cultivated with the help of the strongest experts of the Thousand Sword Hall.</p><p></p><p>So this is the profundity and means of the Transcendent Spirit Sect? Although it is shameless, there is no restriction on one side burning their own self to launch an attack in the rules of the genius confrontation!</p><p></p><p>As for questioning whether it was cultivated with the help of the strongest experts, first, there is no evidence, and the Thousand Sword Hall will certainly not admit to it; second, it is also not restricted by the rules of the genius confrontation.</p><p></p><p>When the rules of the genius confrontation were formulated, no one had expected such techniques! No one had expected that the genius of the Hundred Blade Gate could unleash such terrifying killing intent, just like Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the genius of the Hundred Blade Gate is just like this.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to kill the opponent with a sword, but suddenly, a murderous aura descended.</p><p></p><p>The blood-colored sword beam seemed to carry a forbidden aura.</p><p></p><p>This was an attack unleashed by burning one's spiritual soul and life.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, it burned everything and turned it into an attack. Such a secret technique could not have been cultivated by the genius of the Hundred Blade Gate alone.</p><p></p><p>Even if he had cultivated such a secret technique, he would not be able to instantly burn his spiritual soul and vitality into an attack! His realm does not allow it! Moreover, when actively burning one's spiritual soul and vitality, there will be some constraints.</p><p></p><p>It must have been the help of the strongest experts who assisted him in cultivating it and prepared it in advance, so he could unleash it in an instant! The killing intent came too suddenly, and the blood-colored sword beam had already approached, and the crisis descended instantly.</p><p></p><p>Although the killing intent came suddenly, Xu Yan was not at the Divine Consciousness Realm, but the Divine Element Realm, and his martial arts experience was also extremely rich.</p><p></p><p>His ability to respond to crises was not weak at all.</p><p></p><p>Although this was the first time he faced such a sudden crisis, he did not panic at all, nor did he lose his composure.</p><p></p><p>In a flash, Xu Yan disappeared from the original spot, and his figure changed positions. Spatial Shift!</p><p></p><p>However, his expression changed slightly.</p><p></p><p>That blood-colored sword beam did not strike elsewhere because he evaded it, but instead struck towards him again! "Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan snorted. This blood-colored sword beam, having burned the opponent's spiritual soul, was now locked onto him, and no matter how he evaded, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>He could only use his powerful cultivation to dispel this attack! In a flash, the blood-colored sword beam approached, and Xu Yan did not evade. He pointed with his middle and index fingers, and as the Divine Element circulated, the sword light illuminated the heavens and earth, exuding a vast and mighty aura.</p><p></p><p>Ding! The martial artists heard a sword cry, and they saw Xu Yan thrust out a sword, which seemed to appear out of thin air like a thunderbolt, like the sword of divine retribution.</p><p></p><p>Thunder Sword! Poof! The thunderous sword like divine retribution collided with the blood-colored sword beam, and a muffled sound rang out.</p><p></p><p>In the sky, the thunderbolt exploded, and the blood-colored light, like a blood-colored firework, burst in the sky and was swept away by the thunderbolt, dissipating completely.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The aftershock of the battle swept down, and under the aftershock, the body of the genius of the Hundred Blade Gate, who had unleashed the Burning Life Killing Intent, disintegrated and turned to ashes.</p><p></p><p>Silence! Such a terrifying attack did not even severely injure Xu Yan, but was easily blocked.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan held the sword in his hand, his gaze sharp, looking towards the gate of the Thousand Sword Hall.</p><p></p><p>They say the Thousand Sword Hall is the most shameless, and this time they have truly witnessed it.</p><p></p><p>"Petty tricks, such a secret technique, even if you exhaust your spiritual soul and life, it is nothing!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's mocking voice spread.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Sword Hall Master and the elders had a terrifying gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>The genius of the Hundred Blade Gate suddenly unleashed the Burning Life Killing Intent, but not only did it fail to kill Xu Yan, it couldn't even severely injure him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's strength had once again exceeded their expectations!</p><p></p><p>If this person does not die, they will be uneasy in their hearts! It's as if they see the shadow of the Blood Demon from the past, and it was because of underestimation and carelessness that the disaster of the Blood Demon occurred!</p><p></p><p>"Unbelievable, unbelievable!" Cui Huayu wiped the sweat from his forehead, looking at the young man standing with the sword, towering over everything. He was amazed.</p><p></p><p>This spiritual domain has produced a monster, and it is even more terrifying than the Blood Demon from the past!</p><p></p><p>"The Burning Life Killing Intent, the guys from the Thousand Sword Hall even prepared this, but they didn't expect Xu Yan to block it, how terrifying!" As one of the true inheritors of the Spiritual Sovereign Manor, Cui Huayu naturally knew of these techniques of the Thousand Sword Hall.</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong stood on the big tree, and just now she thought Xu Yan was doomed.</p><p></p><p>But not only did he block it, he was completely unharmed!</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan blocked it, he was prepared, next time they probably won't be able to hurt him."</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The other geniuses, whose strength was about the same as the one from the Hundred Blade Gate, unleashed the Burning Life Killing Intent, and the power was not much different. Since Xu Yan could block the Burning Life Killing Intent of the Hundred Blade Gate genius, he could naturally block the others as well.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Sword Hall Master took a deep breath. "So what? Try Xu Yan's strength, try his countermeasures."</p><p></p><p>The geniuses of the Three Kingdoms, Seven Sects, and Eight Families were just the vanguard, to explore Xu Yan's countermeasures, and when the true geniuses of the Thousand Sword Hall came out, they could attack with targeted strategies.</p><p></p><p>"What if Xu Yan doesn't continue the challenge?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh, then we'll challenge him instead! I don't believe he can suppress everyone!"</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Sword Hall Master said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Even if it's a war of attrition, they have to keep Xu Yan here, otherwise, where would the face of the Thousand Sword Hall be?</p><p></p><p>"You Thousand Sword Hall trash, I want to see how much life you have to burn."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered coldly, pointing the long sword and said proudly, "Come, just like last time, five of you attack me at the same time, I will challenge you five alone!"</p><p></p><p>At these words, all the martial artists were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The previous attack was already terrifying, but Xu Yan actually didn't fear the five of them unleashing it together? Could it be that he was so confident that he could block the attacks of five people?</p><p></p><p>"That's a bit arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>Ya Rong murmured softly.</p><p></p><p>"Young people, they are just impulsive!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Ji shook his head and sighed.</p><p></p><p>Cui Huayu was so excited that he kept stuffing spirit beans into his mouth, chewing them with a crisp sound, his flushed face turning red, and he muttered in a muffled voice, "Unbelievable, unbelievable, so exciting!"</p><p></p><p>"Grant his wish, I want to see where Xu Yan gets the guts to be so arrogant!"</p><p></p><p>The Saber Elder said angrily.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the five who were about to fight, he ordered, "Go all out, unleash the Burning Life Killing Intent together!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Elder!"</p><p></p><p>The geniuses from the Seven Sects and Eight Families shuddered, their faces filled with a willingness to die as they nodded.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Five figures soared into the air, directly surrounding Xu Yan, their aura surging, their killing intent fierce.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists stared intently, their hearts tightening. The five geniuses had surrounded Xu Yan in the middle, and in an instant, they unleashed the terrifying killing intent. Xu Yan had nowhere to hide! (Chapter end)</p>

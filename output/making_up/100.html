            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 100 The Dao of Elixir, Endless Transformations</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan finished explaining the basic theories of elixir refinement, he looked at Su Lingxiu and asked, "Do you remember it all?"</p><p></p><p>If she couldn't remember, this girl's talent would be a bit lacking.</p><p></p><p>Both Xu Yan and Meng Chong had been able to remember it all in one go.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've remembered it all. I even came up with an elixir formula. Do you think it will work?" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was taken aback. She had already come up with an elixir formula so quickly? </p><p></p><p>Her talent is indeed remarkable!</p><p></p><p>He had not misjudged her, nor made a mistake in accepting her as his disciple.</p><p></p><p>His expression remained calm as he nodded and said, "Oh? What elixir formula is it?"</p><p></p><p>"Master, you said that in cultivation, one must first attune to the qi and blood, refine the skin, bones, and organs. So I thought of combining mountain ginseng, nine-leaf primordial fungus, tiger's blood... into an elixir. It should have great nourishing effects and can be quickly assimilated for cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu explained the elixir formula she had pondered over.</p><p></p><p>"The fact that you could come up with an elixir formula shows that you are well-versed in various medicinal ingredients..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was delighted inwardly. Her master had approved of her elixir formula?</p><p></p><p>But Li Xuan continued, "You do have talent, which is why I accepted you as my disciple. However, how did you come up with this elixir formula?</p><p></p><p>"Do you know the principles of using medicinal ingredients - the monarch, minister, assistant, and guide?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu tugged at her clothes and said, "No, I don't know. Please enlighten me, Master."</p><p></p><p>"The monarch treats the main illness, the minister assists the monarch, the assistant responds to the minister... One monarch, two ministers, a small formula; two monarchs, three ministers, five assistants, a medium formula..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan explained the principles of the monarch, minister, assistant, and guide in using medicinal ingredients, then said, "You need to comprehend from this - which herb should be the monarch, which should be the minister... The Dao of elixir has endless transformations.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, illnesses have no fixed forms, doctors have no fixed prescriptions, medicines have no fixed properties. Advancing or retreating depends on the circumstances; the divine and ingenious lies in the person, the monarch, minister, assistant, and guide lie in their application..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was greatly shocked. In that moment, it was as if a window to a new world had opened up before her.</p><p></p><p>She had a vague understanding.</p><p></p><p>Various precious and spiritual herbs flashed through her mind - what characteristics each one had, what they were focused on...one by one they emerged in her mind.</p><p></p><p>"Monarch, minister, assistant, and guide? The Dao of elixir has endless transformations..."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu vaguely felt that she had grasped something. As long as she spent time organizing it, she would definitely be able to come up with a qualified elixir formula.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at her. This girl's comprehension was not bad. This series of elixir theories and the principles of using medicinal ingredients as monarch, minister, assistant, and guide seemed to have given her great inspiration.</p><p></p><p>She might have gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>So he stopped explaining further, letting Su Lingxiu digest it.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand a bit. I will carefully ponder over it."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, next, I will teach you how to refine elixirs."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and continued, "In elixir refinement, use qi and blood as the crucible, use qi and blood as the elixir fire, use the heart as the sensory, understand the transformations of the elixir, know the success or failure of the elixir... Use true qi as the elixir fire, refine and remove the impurities, take the essence..."</p><p></p><p>How to refine elixirs?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan directly explained the refinement using qi and blood, as well as refinement using true qi. In the qi and blood realm, use qi and blood as the elixir fire to refine the elixirs; in the xian-tian realm, use true qi as the elixir fire to refine the elixirs... and so on.</p><p></p><p>As for the elixir furnace, he didn't know if she could refine one, so he didn't emphasize it.</p><p></p><p>"Since you have not entered the qi and blood realm, you naturally cannot use qi and blood as the elixir fire to refine elixirs. You can try using an elixir furnace. Of course, if you have a good elixir furnace to assist in elixir refinement, it would naturally be easier.</p><p></p><p>"All of this depends on how you comprehend the Dao of elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>"To use an elixir furnace to assist in elixir refinement, you need to figure out how to make the elixir furnace yourself. Elixir furnaces have their own principles - ordinary steel furnaces are not suitable for elixir refinement."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reminded Su Lingxiu that besides manual elixir refinement, she could also use an elixir furnace to assist. As for how to get the elixir furnace, that would depend entirely on Su Lingxiu's own abilities.</p><p></p><p>After all, he didn't have an elixir furnace, nor could he refine elixirs. He was just making it up.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded, indicating that she understood.</p><p></p><p>Next would be the core of the Dao of Elixir Medicine - how to cultivate it.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Dao of Elixir Medicine, while also refining the skin, bones, and organs, is about attuning to the vital energy of all things, using the spiritual energy of all things to nourish oneself, and ignite the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>"The qi and blood of a cultivator of the Dao of Elixir Medicine is ever-flowing and vibrant. This is the way of medicine, to heal and save people; but it can also be as fierce as fire, this is the way of elixirs, to extract the essence and refine elixirs.</p><p></p><p>"Medicine is wood, elixirs are fire. Wood can give birth to fire, and fire can refine metal, metal can give birth to water, and water then gives birth to wood..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan then passed on the cultivation methods of the Dao of Elixir Medicine to Su Lingxiu, and along the way, also taught her about yin-yang, the five elements, the extraordinary meridians, the body's acupoints, and so on.</p><p></p><p>The cultivated qi and blood, as well as true qi, of a cultivator of the Dao of Elixir Medicine naturally have their own unique characteristics.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, it would not be much different from orthodox martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he also explained things like acupuncture - golden needle transference, golden needle expulsion of toxins, golden needle resurrection, and other mysterious needle techniques.</p><p></p><p>He had thoroughly explained the entire Dao of Elixir Medicine that he had compiled. As for whether Su Lingxiu could comprehend anything from this vast, complex, and sometimes not entirely coherent theory, Li Xuan could not guarantee. It all depended on Su Lingxiu's own talent.</p><p></p><p>If she succeeded, he would have opened up another martial arts system. And gained another precious disciple.</p><p></p><p>This girl was beautiful, lively and cheerful, and kind-hearted, fond of punishing evil people. If she could successfully comprehend it, Li Xuan felt that the troubles behind her would not be a big deal.</p><p></p><p>If she failed to comprehend it...</p><p></p><p>It would mean they were not destined as master and disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Remember, what I've passed on to you is the Dao, not just ordinary techniques. The Dao requires comprehension, to truly grasp the true meaning..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan emphasized again that what he had passed on was the Dao, which required comprehension, not just cultivating according to martial arts methods. Without true comprehension and perfection, it could not be cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu nodded her little head.</p><p></p><p>She was greatly shocked in her heart. There was such a powerful and mysterious martial art in the world.</p><p></p><p>If she could comprehend it, how powerful would she become?</p><p></p><p>The wondrous and profound mysteries of elixirs, if she could refine them, would she still have to worry about slow cultivation?</p><p></p><p>One elixir pill could save her from ten or eight days, or even a month or a year of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"I must first figure out the elixir formula!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu thought to herself excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. He believed in Su Lingxiu's talent. After imparting these theories to her, it would not be difficult for her to ponder out the elixir formulas and elixirs.</p><p></p><p>However, the Dao of Elixir Medicine was not just about elixir formulas, medication, and medical techniques, but the cultivation of the martial art.</p><p></p><p>For Su Lingxiu, the most difficult part would be comprehending the cultivation methods of the Dao of Elixir Medicine, how to cultivate the unique qi and blood of this martial art.</p><p></p><p>And the entry point would be the most difficult.</p><p></p><p>As long as she successfully entered it, and comprehended the cultivation methods, the later xian-tian realm or even higher realms would be relatively easier to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>After all, she would have a foundation, a theoretical basis.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought of his precious senior disciple Xu Yan, who cultivated orthodox martial arts, pure martial arts. Precisely because the martial arts were so pure, Xu Yan's understanding of the martial dao was so profound.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The comprehension and enlightenment of the Dao is extremely profound.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan is the pioneer of the martial Dao, and the foundation and basis of this great martial Dao undertaking are all on Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation method of the Elixir Dao and the Martial Dao, although different from the orthodox Martial Dao, is still relatively close to the orthodox Martial Dao, so can Xu Yan assist Su Ling Xiu in comprehending the cultivation method?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>In terms of insight and imagination, perhaps no one can match Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan spoke again: "As for the cultivation method of the Martial Dao, how to refine the skin, bones, and organs, how to cultivate the Elixir Dao's qi and blood, when your senior brother returns, you can ask your senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu's eyes lit up as she said, "What kind of strength does my senior brother have?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly replied, "Xian Tian realm, an ordinary inner domain master can be killed with a casual move!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was extremely excited in her heart. Her master is mysterious and powerful, her senior brother is also so strong, and her second senior brother as well. As long as she can successfully comprehend the cultivation method, she will smoothly enter the path.</p><p></p><p>With such a powerful backing, does she need to worry about burying people?</p><p></p><p>No need!</p><p></p><p>"Master, master, when will my senior brother come back?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu asked eagerly.</p><p></p><p>She wants to comprehend the cultivation method as soon as possible and start cultivating smoothly. She feels that the cultivation method her master taught is too profound, and she can't find the direction of comprehension for the time being.</p><p></p><p>As for the Elixir Dao, she has already gained some insights.</p><p></p><p>She just needs to sort it out, and she can come up with some Elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>Then find an Elixir furnace and try how to refine them, but the true Elixir refinement requires entering the Martial Dao, cultivating the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>So if she cannot comprehend the Martial Dao cultivation method, even if she understands the Elixir Dao and comes up with Elixir formulas, she is just an ordinary Elixir Doctor girl.</p><p></p><p>She cannot be called an Elixir Martial Artist at all!</p><p></p><p>"Your senior brother will be back in a few days, you can continue to comprehend by yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said as he stood up and left.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu picked up the iron shovel and followed him excitedly, saying, "Master, I already have some ideas for Elixir formulas. After going back, I will sort them out and should be able to come up with some Elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>"It's just that I don't have an Elixir furnace, how do I refine the Elixir?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan walked leisurely with his hands behind his back and said, "The master can only guide you, the cultivation is up to the individual."</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll figure it out myself."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu became a little downcast.</p><p></p><p>When passing by Meng Chong's cultivation place, Su Ling Xiu curiously asked, "Master, what is my second senior brother doing?"</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating, tempering the sword, comprehending the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan replied indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering the sword?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Tempering the sword with the heart, tempering the sword with the will... You don't understand, this is not your talent."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at her.</p><p></p><p>His gaze fell on the iron shovel in her hand, how could such a good girl like to play with an iron shovel?</p><p></p><p>"What are you doing with the iron shovel?"</p><p></p><p>"Burying people!"</p><p></p><p>"...How many people have you buried?"</p><p></p><p>"Not a hundred, but maybe dozens."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Then she added, "Master, I also have a small medicine hoe for digging medicinal materials, but it was lost, and only this iron shovel is left."</p><p></p><p>After returning to the small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat down on a chair, and Su Ling Xiu immediately went into her own room.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Aunt, go buy me a lot of paper and pens!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, Miss."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Aunt nodded and went out to find Shi Er and asked him to go buy the paper and pens.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er didn't want to agree at first, as he is the servant of the master, why should he listen to her?</p><p></p><p>But then he thought that Su Ling Xiu is now the disciple of the master, and it is she who needs the paper and pens, so he can only agree.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, how is it going?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying hurriedly asked when she returned to the room.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Aunt, my master is so powerful, the Elixir Dao and the Martial Dao are so strong and amazing, I want to refine Elixirs!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was completely puzzled, refine Elixirs? What is that?</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Aunt, go find me an Elixir furnace, let me think about what an Elixir furnace should look like..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Master said the Elixir furnace cannot be an ordinary steel furnace, it must be made of the materials for forging treasures..."</p><p></p><p>In the inner domain, those who can use true treasures are mostly masters.</p><p></p><p>Even a First-Grade martial artist who owns a treasure is not many.</p><p></p><p>"But where can we find treasures in the Borderland?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was a little troubled.</p><p></p><p>"Miss, what Elixir furnace? I'll go to the Wu Kingdom Palace or the Qi Kingdom Palace to find one for you?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying thought for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er brought back the paper and pens and handed them to Zhou Ying, then continued to ponder how to break through the bottleneck and enter the Qi and Blood Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu picked up the pen and started drawing on the paper, based on the vague outline of the Elixir furnace that appeared in her mind.</p><p></p><p>The Elixir furnace is not large, with pores to expel impurities, and a cover that can be closed...</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Aunt, the Elixir furnace is roughly like this, but it needs to be made of treasure materials..."</p><p></p><p>She handed the Elixir furnace drawing to Zhou Ying, feeling troubled again.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying took the drawing, although she didn't understand what an Elixir furnace was, she knew it was important to the Miss.</p><p></p><p>She solemnly said, "Miss, don't worry, although the Borderland cannot cultivate, there are still some materials, I should be able to find them."</p><p></p><p>"I hope so."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu nodded and said, "Zhou Aunt, you try your best to find them, and tell the Heavenly Mother Sect to let Kou Ruo Zhi go find them."</p><p></p><p>"I understand, but Miss, if I leave..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying hesitated.</p><p></p><p>"Zhou Aunt, it's fine, my master is so strong, and I also have senior brother and second senior brother..."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was not worried at all.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll go now."</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu nodded.</p><p></p><p>After Zhou Ying left, Su Ling Xiu buried herself in writing down her insights on Elixirs.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, she listed various precious medicines and spiritual medicines, noting the characteristics and effects of each medicine.</p><p></p><p>This sorting took almost half a day.</p><p></p><p>Usually, Zhou Ying would call her to eat at the right time, but after Zhou Ying left, Su Ling Xiu only realized she was hungry when her stomach growled.</p><p></p><p>She looked out the window and saw that it was already dusk.</p><p></p><p>She walked out of the room and found her master sitting in a chair, reading an ancient book, with the air of a reclusive immortal.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm hungry!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu grabbed Li Xuan's arm and blinked her eyes.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put down the ancient leather book and said, "Shi Er, from today on, you are responsible for cooking meals for Ling Xiu."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was very excited.</p><p></p><p>After dinner, Su Ling Xiu continued to sort out various precious medicines in her room, preparing the foundation for creating Elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently appeared outside the window, looking in, and couldn't help but nod. Su Ling Xiu's talent in the Elixir Dao is truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>She has already gained some insights and is sorting out her thoughts. He believes that soon, she will have some Elixir formulas.</p><p></p><p>"I hope she can smoothly comprehend the cultivation method."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

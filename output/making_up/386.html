        <h1>Chapter 386</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>In a corner of Thousand-Fold Mountain, there was a celestial cave. It was dim and gloomy, and not very large. Among the powerful beings stationed there, there were only two True King Celestial Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Not many martial artists entered this celestial cave, only about a dozen or so each day, and most of the time they were martial artists below the Condensed Law Celestial Venerable level.</p><p></p><p>This celestial cave had almost become a place for disciples of some small factions within Thousand-Fold Mountain to gain experience.</p><p></p><p>The reason why True King Celestial Venerables were stationed here was that a demonic witch comparable to a True King Celestial Venerable had once appeared in this celestial cave, causing a massacre that nearly wiped out a small faction.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, True King Celestial Venerables were arranged to take turns guarding it.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A wolf-like howl came from the celestial cave, along with faint sounds of fighting. This time, the martial artists who entered the cave were three Condensed Law Celestial Venerables leading a team, with more than a dozen young cultivators at the Refined Spirit realm entering to gain experience.</p><p></p><p>The demonic witches in this celestial cave were called Wolf Witches because they had wolf-like faces.</p><p></p><p>The powerful Wolf Witches were only at the Condensed Law Celestial Venerable level, with most being at the Refined Spirit realm, or even the Lesser Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Due to its proximity to the Qinghua Realm, news of the prodigies from Qinghua Realm naturally spread to the Nine Mountains Realm. The names of Sword Immortal Xu Yan and Celestial Immortal Meng Chong had of course also reached the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>For the prodigies of the Nine Mountains Realm, they maintained a skeptical attitude towards these rumors.</p><p></p><p>How could such freakish talents emerge from the Qinghua Realm? It must be exaggerated to save face for the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>After all, they had just recently faced a crisis and asked for help.</p><p></p><p>Although they believed there was some exaggeration about the Qinghua Realm, they also thought that Xu Yan and Meng Chong must indeed be outstanding prodigies, just that their reputations were blown out of proportion.</p><p></p><p>To dare call themselves Sword Immortal and Celestial Immortal!</p><p></p><p>Inside the celestial cave, a group of young men were surrounding and attacking a wolf-faced burly man. The battle was fierce, while two Condensed Law Celestial Venerables were keeping watch nearby.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The wolf-faced burly man wielded a wolf-tooth club, swinging it with tremendous force. He was not afraid of being surrounded at all. Even though his body was covered in wounds, his eyes were still extremely fierce.</p><p></p><p>"This Wolf Witch has such a strong physical body. I heard there's some kind of body cultivation martial artist from the Qinghua Realm, I wonder how they would compare to this Wolf Witch," one of the Condensed Law Celestial Venerables exclaimed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>"What body cultivation? It's just focusing on physical cultivation, yet they made up a term called body cultivation," the other Condensed Law Celestial Venerable said dismissively.</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense."</p><p></p><p>"But that prodigy called Sword Immortal Xu Yan probably does have extraordinary talent. Even if there's exaggeration, there must be some outstanding qualities for such praise."</p><p></p><p>"That's for sure. But I heard that young man Xu Yan has a marvelous palm technique, seems to be called True Dragon Palm? One palm strike produces a true dragon, I wonder how he cultivated that."</p><p></p><p>"What True Dragon Palm, I heard it's called Subduing Dragon Palm. If the legendary true dragons knew of this palm name, they'd probably be furious and want to slap him to death!"</p><p></p><p>"He's really arrogant, daring to call it Subduing Dragon Palm."</p><p></p><p>The two Condensed Law Celestial Venerables chatted idly, discussing some news from the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, under the siege, no matter how fierce the Wolf Witch was, he was about to collapse.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, one of the Wolf Witch's legs was severely injured, causing him to fall to the ground. The attacks came in an instant, killing him.</p><p></p><p>"Elder, we killed the Wolf Witch!" A young man excitedly picked up the Wolf Witch's wolf-tooth club weapon.</p><p></p><p>"Very good. With this experience, you won't lose your composure when fighting in celestial caves in the future," one of the Condensed Law Celestial Venerables nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go back. There shouldn't be any more demonic witches coming into this celestial cave," the other Condensed Law Celestial Venerable waved his hand and said.</p><p></p><p>Just as they were about to lead the disciples out of the celestial cave after gaining experience, suddenly, a faint pink light spread over.</p><p></p><p>"What's this?" The two Condensed Law Celestial Venerables were startled and looked back. They saw a graceful figure descending from the depths of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>Covered in a light gauze, with a bewitchingly beautiful face, she reclined on a couch, incomparably alluring.</p><p></p><p>As this graceful figure descended, those disciples who were gaining experience stared with wide eyes, completely captivated by her beauty.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!" One of the Condensed Law Celestial Venerables was alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to wake up the disciples, he saw the woman on the couch reach out a hand to grab him.</p><p></p><p>Although separated by a great distance, that hand seemed able to extend infinitely, directly grabbing his neck and pulling him onto the couch.</p><p></p><p>The other Condensed Law Celestial Venerable was about to call for help, but before he could open his mouth, his neck tightened and he was grabbed by a hand.</p><p></p><p>"Come here, all of you!" The woman on the couch beckoned with her finger, and all the young disciples ran over frantically. But as soon as they reached the edge of the couch, their eyes lost their light.</p><p></p><p>One could see soul after soul being sucked into the woman's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Then, these martial artists' eyes lit up again, as if they had returned to normal. But if one looked closely, one would find that their souls were no longer their original souls.</p><p></p><p>The two Condensed Law Celestial Venerables who couldn't move were now filled with fear.</p><p></p><p>What kind of demonic witch was this? She actually fed on souls, she must be an extremely terrifying existence. But why would such a terrifying being descend into this small celestial cave?</p><p></p><p>The woman smiled seductively, looking at the two Condensed Law Celestial Venerables, and asked languidly, "You were just saying someone can strike out a palm and produce a true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" The Condensed Law Celestial Venerable nodded stiffly.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>"It's said to be a golden giant dragon, moving with wind and thunder, described as very mysterious..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you know what that person looks like?"</p><p></p><p>"It's said he's exceptionally handsome, calls himself Sword Immortal Xu Yan, but I've never seen him..."</p><p></p><p>After listening, the woman's eyes flashed with a cold light, and she murmured, "Is it your disciple? He actually came to the Divine Realm. Let's see how capable your disciple is, and how you'll come to save your disciple!"</p><p></p><p>Lying languidly on the couch, she opened her rosy little mouth and gently sucked in the souls of the two Condensed Law Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Squinting her bright eyes, she looked at this dim celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>"How to lure him in here? Celestial treasures? We can try that."</p><p></p><p>She muttered to herself.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, one of the Condensed Law Celestial Venerables turned and left. Soon after, a True King Celestial Venerable followed behind him.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Venerable who had just entered was startled. His aura instantly erupted, about to strike forcefully to kill this bewitching woman before him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't be so agitated." A seductive and gentle voice sounded, and then a soft, smooth body appeared in his arms. At this moment, his heart and liver were trembling.</p><p></p><p>"I'm just lonely, so I wanted to play with you. Don't you want to?"</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Venerable's expression became dazed. He felt his hot blood divide into two streams. One rushed up to his head, instantly filling his mind with heightened emotions.</p><p></p><p>The other went down, instantly tightening his pants.</p><p></p><p>"Come on." The woman's breath was like orchids, her eyes like silk. In his daze, the True King Celestial Venerable was already lost.</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>His arms embraced the woman, his whole body in a state of excitement.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe... I'll make you happy, you just need to be obedient, understand?"</p><p></p><p>"I will, I will, I'll be obedient."</p><p></p><p>Pink petals swirled around. The woman lay languidly on the bed, while at her feet, the True King Celestial Lord crouched like a dog trying to please its master.</p><p></p><p>"Go take care of things, don't forget. Make sure to lure the person here. Oh, and bring your brother in too."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!"</p><p></p><p>The True King Celestial Lord left.</p><p></p><p>Soon after, another True King Celestial Lord entered and quickly fell under her spell, becoming a loyal dog.</p><p></p><p>"I should decorate this celestial cave, make it prettier. Bring in some things too, that will make it more attractive."</p><p></p><p>The woman murmured.</p><p></p><p>Two Condensed Law Celestial Lords led disciples to start decorating the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm truly has many mountains and dense forests, with abundant spiritual herbs and divine herbs!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, walking among the mountains and forests, couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Spiritual herbs could be seen everywhere. Each herb here would be extremely rare in the inner realms or even the spirit realms. </p><p></p><p>Along this journey, he had seen no less than a thousand stalks of divine-grade spiritual herbs.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm is more suitable for junior sister. Here there's no worry about lacking alchemy materials," Xu Yan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"The Witch Demon Celestial Cave is in Thousand-Layered Mountain, quite far from here. On the way there, we'll pass by several celestial caves. We might as well enter and see how they differ from the celestial caves of the Qinghua Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's destination was the Witch Demon Celestial Cave in Thousand-Layered Mountain, but it was quite distant from his current location. Along the way he would pass several celestial caves, including one guarded by a Blood Child.</p><p></p><p>It was a good opportunity to enter and gain some experience, increasing his foundation.</p><p></p><p>As long as one was a divine realm martial artist, they could enter celestial caves to battle. There was no rule against outsiders entering, which made things convenient for Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Mount Dagai, one of the nine mountains of the Nine Mountains Realm, was the territory controlled by the Wan family, the number one clan of the Nine Mountains Realm. Within the entire Mount Dagai region, there were over a hundred large and small forces, all existing under the patronage of the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>The Snake Peak Celestial Cave was the third-ranked celestial cave of Mount Dagai. Inside was a Blood Child who would launch attacks at intervals, attempting to break out of the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Celestial Lord stationed here was an elder of the Wan family, who had clashed with that Blood Child dozens of times, neither able to defeat the other.</p><p></p><p>The weakest martial artists entering Snake Peak Celestial Cave had to be at least Condensed Law Celestial Lords. They battled against hordes of blood slaves and blood disciples, not only to eliminate the constantly growing number of blood slaves, but also for the treasures within Snake Peak Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>Inside Snake Peak Celestial Cave, there was a most precious treasure called the Blood Heart Fruit. It could nourish the soul, purify consciousness, aid in comprehending techniques, and assist in cultivating extremely violent and powerful but easily out-of-control killing techniques.</p><p></p><p>With the aid of Blood Heart Fruit, violent and easily out-of-control killing techniques could become gentler, allowing successful cultivation while avoiding situations where loss of control could harm oneself.</p><p></p><p>Due to the scarcity of Blood Heart Fruit and the difficulty in obtaining it, as it mostly grew in the core areas of the netherworld prison, Blood Heart Fruit was extremely valuable.</p><p></p><p>At intervals, the Wan family elder would actively challenge that Blood Child, engaging in great battles to create opportunities to obtain Blood Heart Fruit.</p><p></p><p>The last great battle had just ended, but this time no Blood Heart Fruit was obtained. The Wan family was now preparing to launch an attack against the netherworld enemies of Snake Peak Celestial Cave.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was naturally for Blood Heart Fruit, for the Wan family prodigy Wan Tianlin!</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Wan family had issued high-value bounties with generous rewards, causing many True King Celestial Lords to become restless, wanting to take a chance.</p><p></p><p>"Blood Heart Fruit? It can nourish the soul, purify consciousness, and aid in comprehending techniques?"</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan learned about the Blood Heart Fruit, his eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He didn't care about nourishing the soul, but he was interested in its aid for comprehending techniques. To some extent, would comprehension be temporarily enhanced after consuming Blood Heart Fruit?</p><p></p><p>"What a good thing! I wonder if it can help me understand Heaven and Earth realm martial techniques?"</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth realm was too profound. Despite cultivating in the Qinghua Realm for so long, he only had some vague insights, still far from truly comprehending the techniques.</p><p></p><p>With the miraculous effects of Blood Heart Fruit, perhaps it could help him take another step towards comprehending Heaven and Earth realm martial techniques.</p><p></p><p>"I already have some insights into the Minor Heavenly Eye, but I'm still missing that last bit. Even if Blood Heart Fruit doesn't have much effect on comprehending the Heaven and Earth realm, it should be useful for comprehending the Minor Heavenly Eye."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>If as expected, Blood Heart Fruit could temporarily enhance comprehension after consumption, that short period of enhanced comprehension would be enough for him to fully comprehend the divine ability of the Minor Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>Over these past few years, Xu Yan had been constantly attempting to cultivate it and had gained considerable insights. He was just one step away. With the aid of Blood Heart Fruit, he could greatly shorten the time needed to successfully cultivate the Minor Heavenly Eye.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan greatly valued the wonders of the Minor Heavenly Eye. With it, all illusions and falsehoods could be seen through.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the Minor Heavenly Eye also had powerful offensive capabilities.</p><p></p><p>In battle, it could even predict enemy attacks and perceive the enemy's weaknesses - a divine ability with endless uses.</p><p></p><p>"The Minor Heavenly Eye is already so wondrous, it's hard to imagine how inconceivable the Heavenly Eye must be."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan made his decision - go to Snake Peak Celestial Cave and search for Blood Heart Fruit!</p><p></p><p>Martial artists entered Snake Peak Celestial Cave daily, firstly to obtain netherworld blood pearls for cultivation and search for treasures in the celestial cave; secondly to reduce the growth in numbers of blood slaves, maintaining a certain balance.</p><p></p><p>"Is Blood Heart Fruit only found in the core areas?"</p><p></p><p>"Not necessarily. It may grow in other areas too, but it's too rare and hard to find. And it may have already been picked by others."</p><p></p><p>"What a pity. If I could pick one and offer it to Young Master Tianlin, I'd surely receive a great reward."</p><p></p><p>"Heh, I don't care about rewards. If I could get a Blood Heart Fruit, I'd use it to exchange for a chance to follow Young Master Tianlin."</p><p></p><p>"You're right, how can any reward compare to following Young Master Tianlin? He's the top prodigy of the Wan family, rumored to have the potential to become an Immortal Celestial Lord."</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand. Young Master Tianlin wants Blood Heart Fruit to comprehend a technique. Once he succeeds, he'll definitely become an Immortal Celestial Lord in the future!"</p><p></p><p>Outside Snake Peak Celestial Cave, a group of martial artists chatted idly, all about Blood Heart Fruit and the Wan family prodigy Wan Tianlin.</p><p></p><p>"Even the Wan family prodigy values Blood Heart Fruit so highly, wanting to use it to aid in cultivating a technique. It seems this Blood Heart Fruit truly has miraculous effects. If used in alchemy, could it produce pills with even more miraculous effects for enhancing comprehension?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself, but even if he obtained Blood Heart Fruit, he had no intention of returning to the Qinghua Realm to give it to Su Lingxiu for alchemy. That would take too much time.</p><p></p><p>If there was any Blood Heart Fruit left over, he could give it to Su Lingxiu the next time they met.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

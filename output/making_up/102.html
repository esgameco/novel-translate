            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 102 - The Arrival of the Great Master</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu had grasped the initial form of the Elixir Cultivation Classic, and she had also largely comprehended the cultivation method. She only needed to enter the initial stage of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed in his heart, as the Elixir Cultivation Martial Dao was now stable.</p><p></p><p>"I was right about this little girl, her natural talent is not bad."</p><p></p><p>Delighted in his heart, he was about to give some guidance to Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>However, he found that Shi Er was not in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at the small courtyard, which was the Xu family's residence in Yunshan County. The area was not very large.</p><p></p><p>"My disciples are all cultivating outside the city. If there are any major disturbances, it might interfere with the neighbors. As for Lingxiu, if she starts refining elixirs, there might be the risk of furnace explosions or causing a commotion.</p><p></p><p>"Therefore, we should move to the outskirts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Living in the county city was convenient for buying and selling things, but he basically only occasionally satisfied his appetite.</p><p></p><p>His needs were not many.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong spent most of their time cultivating outside the city.</p><p></p><p>Even if they needed to buy something, it was Shi Er who was responsible for it, so it only added a bit of trouble for Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er is almost a Warrior now, a trip back and forth won't take too long, so let's just move to the outskirts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan made up his mind, and just as Shi Er returned, he asked him to go find Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what are your instructions?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"This courtyard is too small, and you all need to cultivate. It's not suitable in the county city. In the future, your shijie will be refining elixirs, and there might be some disturbances. Go find a place in the outskirts, and build a manor there."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought it made sense.</p><p></p><p>The second disciple, in order to cultivate and nurture his saber, had not returned for several days.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, go find some people to help build the manor."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan turned and called Shi Er.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Young Master Xu."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Just a simple manor will do."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan added.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan responded.</p><p></p><p>Selecting the site and constructing the new residence would take time, but since it was just a simple construction, it wouldn't take too long.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Lingxiu continued to perfect the Elixir Cultivation Classic while also beginning her cultivation.</p><p></p><p>First, she started refining her skin!</p><p></p><p>She was already a Seventh-Grade Warrior, so the skin refinement process went very smoothly, and the progress was quite fast.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan observed the changes in his third disciple. As her skin refinement progressed, her skin became even more delicate and tender, like beautiful jade, and it also had an indestructible feeling.</p><p></p><p>"Strange, how can this girl's skin refinement be so fast?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be related to her being a Seventh-Grade Warrior?"</p><p></p><p>The martial dao of the Inner Realm was different from his own martial dao. For someone at a low level like Lingxiu, it was relatively easy to switch to cultivate the martial dao, as long as she could sense the qi and blood.</p><p></p><p>For someone like Zhou Ying, who had already reached the Fourth Grade, the difficulty in switching cultivation would be much greater, and even being able to sense the qi and blood would be a problem.</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu's skin refinement speed was quite surprising to Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the faster his disciples cultivated, the happier he would be.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, the construction of the manor in the outskirts was completed.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan directly moved to the new manor in the outskirts, and Shi Er would naturally move the books and other things to the new residence.</p><p></p><p>After arriving at the new manor, Lingxiu was excited. Seeing the simple and spacious courtyard, she even started planting flowers.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, the courtyard was filled with many flowers.</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu cultivated in the courtyard, and the completion of her skin refinement was not far away.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had also returned, sitting on the roof, continuing to nurture his saber.</p><p></p><p>"How is this third disciple so fast in her cultivation? She has already started refining her bones."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu had actually started refining her bones, and the speed was also extremely fast.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the Elixir Cultivation Martial Dao cultivation method is highly compatible with her natural talent, so her cultivation is this fast?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, tell Kou Ruozhi to mobilize the Heavenly Mother Sect and get me these medicinal materials."</p><p></p><p>That day, Lingxiu handed Shi Er a list of medicinal materials.</p><p></p><p>"Okay."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er took the list and looked at it. They were all precious medicinal herbs, as well as tiger bones, deer antlers, and other great tonics.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Heavenly Mother Sect was still quite strong, and it was spread across Qi and Wu States. The precious medicinal herbs that Lingxiu needed were soon delivered in the first batch.</p><p></p><p>With the arrival of the medicinal materials, Lingxiu was troubled.</p><p></p><p>She had not yet entered the martial dao, so she could not refine elixirs using her qi and blood. And she had not yet found a refining furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Where has Aunt Zhou gone? It's been so long, even if she couldn't find a refining furnace, she should have come back by now."</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu frowned.</p><p></p><p>She was not worried about Zhou Ying's safety, after all, she was a Fourth-Grade cultivator. In this desolate area, apart from her own master, elder brother, and second brother, no one could be Zhou Ying's opponent.</p><p></p><p>"If I can't use qi and blood as the elixir fire, I'll have to rely on external objects."</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu pondered. Charcoal and the like should not work.</p><p></p><p>"I remember the Heavenly Mother Sect has a kind of divine fire stone. When ignited, the flame is vigorous and almost smokeless, and the temperature is relatively easy to control.</p><p></p><p>"It should be suitable for elixir refinement."</p><p></p><p>So Lingxiu instructed Shi Er to bring a bag of divine fire stones.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er was a bit hesitant: "Heavenly Mother, the divine fire stones are not abundant, and they are difficult to extract. They are all stored in the Ancestral Hall of the Heavenly Mother Sect, so it's not easy to get them."</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu raised her eyebrows, picked up an iron shovel beside her, and angrily said, "I am the Heavenly Mother. Since the divine fire stones are used for worshipping the Heavenly Mother, if I want to use them, you must bring them to me.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever dares to oppose, I'll bury them!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er helplessly said, "Heavenly Mother, this requires the permission of the Protector and the Military Strategist. I don't have that authority yet, and not many people know the location of the Ancestral Hall."</p><p></p><p>"Then pass the message to Kou Ruozhi, tell him to bring the divine fire stones to this Heavenly Mother, or else I'll bury him!"</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu snorted coldly.</p><p></p><p>"I will pass the message to the Military Strategist, but he..."</p><p></p><p>Shi Er nodded, but before he could finish, Lingxiu sneered and said, "Kou Ruozhi and the others, if they don't want to be buried by this Heavenly Mother, they better bring the divine fire stones.</p><p></p><p>"It's outrageous, when they agreed to be the Heavenly Mother's, they said everything would belong to me. Dare they go back on their word!"</p><p></p><p>Shi Er thought about it, unless Kou Ruozhi and the others really wanted to die, they wouldn't dare to offend the Heavenly Mother over the divine fire stones.</p><p></p><p>After all, although the Heavenly Mother was young, she was ruthless when it came to burying people.</p><p></p><p>The divine fire stones were delivered in a few days.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was curious, wondering what this divine fire stone was, with such a grand name.</p><p></p><p>He picked up one and looked at it. It was black and shiny, a bit like coal. But it was slightly different from coal, seeming to be some kind of sediment.</p><p></p><p>Igniting a piece of the divine fire stone, a faint red flame burned, smokeless and odorless, and it burned for a quite long time.</p><p></p><p>"Master, do you think this is suitable for elixir refinement?"</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu looked at him excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"It's not bad!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. This divine fire stone was indeed a good fuel for elixir refinement.</p><p></p><p>Now, the only thing missing was a refining furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Shi Er, tell Kou Ruozhi to extract more divine fire stones. This Heavenly Mother has a great use for them, and if they do a good job, there will be a reward."</p><p></p><p>Lingxiu instructed.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"I've already told the military strategist, and he said he will try his best to extract more of it," said Shi Er with a nod.</p><p></p><p>The divine fire stone was something controlled by the Heavenly Mother Sect, and could only be extracted from a certain location. Even the Qi Kingdom and Wu Kingdom did not have it.</p><p></p><p>"Why hasn't Aunt Zhou come back yet?"</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was eager to try refining the elixir, but without a furnace, she could only wait.</p><p></p><p>"Something seems off. Her cultivation speed is so fast, how did she already complete the tempering of the iron bone and start on the tempering of the copper bone?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the cultivating Su Ling Xiu, secretly puzzled.</p><p></p><p>This cultivation speed was a bit too fast.</p><p></p><p>"Could this girl's talent be so monstrous?"</p><p></p><p>"Well, she was only 11 or 12 when she fled to the remote border region, right? At that time, she was already a 7th-rank martial artist, so her talent was indeed extraordinary. And the alchemy and martial dao are well-suited to her talent, so her fast cultivation is understandable."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"At this rate, in less than half a year, she'll be able to enter the martial dao, and the long-life bone can also be successfully tempered. </p><p></p><p>"With my jade bone, golden diamond glass bone, and long-life bone, what kind of spiritual bone will I transform into?"</p><p></p><p>He was now a pre-celestial spiritual bone, combined with the Dragon Ascending Mountain and River Spiritual Body. If he were to also obtain the long-life bone, what kind of spiritual bone would he transform into?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying finally returned. </p><p></p><p>She had brought back an elixir furnace for Su Ling Xiu, and it was forged with the materials used to forge treasured weapons.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, where did you find someone to forge this elixir furnace?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying looked at Su Ling Xiu affectionately and said, "Miss, I went to the inner domain and found a person from the Demon Sect to forge it. After it was forged, I cleaned it up thoroughly."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was stunned, her eyes slightly reddening as she looked at Aunt Zhou.</p><p></p><p>"Aunt Zhou, you didn't need to take such a risk. What if someone found out..."</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying shook her head. "Miss, I know this elixir furnace is important to you. I disguised myself and went to the inner domain specifically to find that Demon Sect person. I watched him forge it the entire time and cleaned it up thoroughly, so no one will discover it."</p><p></p><p>She wasn't so heartless as to kill the forger after he finished the furnace. But she couldn't risk exposing her whereabouts, so she had no choice but to find someone from the Demon Sect.</p><p></p><p>That Demon Sect martial artist deserved to die anyway, so she could dispose of him cleanly without leaving any traces.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu let out a sigh of relief upon hearing this.</p><p></p><p>Joyfully, she said, "Aunt Zhou, once I refine the elixir, you can cultivate it too. Then we can go back and bury all those people!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll dig the graves in advance!" </p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying ruffled Su Ling Xiu's hair.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan sighed. Trouble has arrived.</p><p></p><p>Lifting his head to look at the sky, a figure suddenly appeared above the manor, coldly gazing down at Su Ling Xiu and Zhou Ying.</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was shrouded in a black robe, only revealing a pair of eyes.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Master!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. The troubles behind his third disciple were not simple at all - the Grand Master had come in person.</p><p></p><p>Though Zhou Ying was disguised, her burly build could still be recognized by those with keen eyes.</p><p></p><p>But Su Ling Xiu was now his disciple, and she had already comprehended the alchemy and martial dao. He had obtained the Alchemy Dao Tome, so whoever dared to harm his third disciple would be obstructing his grand martial dao ambitions.</p><p></p><p>All who obstruct his martial dao ambitions are his enemies, and must be eliminated!</p><p></p><p>What does the Grand Master matter?</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu, holding the elixir furnace, was excitedly and joyfully preparing to start refining, when suddenly, with a boom, the roof of Xu Yan's residence exploded and flew apart.</p><p></p><p>"Who is it?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan rose into the air, looking at the black-robed figure with an extremely grave expression, sensing a powerful crisis from them.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong also stood up from the rooftop.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu looked up and her pretty face immediately paled.</p><p></p><p>"How could this be?"</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying was horrified.</p><p></p><p>"A Grand Master martial artist?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure looked at Xu Yan, his hoarse voice tinged with doubt.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the one sheltering that girl? If not, then get lost. I've come only for her."</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Master's aura instantly erupted. The overwhelming pressure, like the might of heaven and earth, blanketed the entire manor.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er almost knelt down. It was too terrifying!</p><p></p><p>Zhou Ying stood in front of Su Ling Xiu, her body trembling, bitterly regretting, "Miss, it was my carelessness. I shouldn't have taken the risk to go to the inner domain!"</p><p></p><p>"It's not your fault, Aunt Zhou!" </p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu gritted her teeth, glancing at the teacher sitting calmly in the chair.</p><p></p><p>She felt a little reassured.</p><p></p><p>"Teacher, you won't just leave me, right?"</p><p></p><p>She was a bit uncertain, after all, she hadn't formally entered the dao yet, so she couldn't be considered a full disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Grand Master?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes were filled with fighting spirit, utterly fearless. He coldly smiled and said, "Whoever you are, you won't be taking anyone away today!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A golden dragon coiled around his body, the might of the dragon surging.</p><p></p><p>With a clang, his sword was drawn.</p><p></p><p>The sword intent of the mountains and rivers spread through the air above the manor.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure's eyes narrowed, a cold light flashing, as he coldly said, "What kind of cultivation method is this? Why is it so special?"</p><p></p><p>He sensed a unique power, something he had never heard of before, yet it was extremely powerful. And this young man was already at the Grand Master realm, his talent truly monstrous.</p><p></p><p>"If this young man is a Grand Master, I fear I may not be his match!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"This young man cannot be left alive!"</p><p></p><p>He must kill him! </p><p></p><p>Otherwise, even if he captured Su Ling Xiu, with this young man's monstrous talent, he would surely grow into a Grand Master in the future, and then how could he possibly contend with him?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Grand Master's might erupted, his aura seeming to disturb the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This is the remote border region, unable to sense the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, which does limit my full strength a bit. But to deal with a mere Grand Master, it's still effortless!"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed figure raised his hand, and a force like a gale burst forth from his palm.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, even though your talent is monstrous, you are still only a Grand Master. I am a Grand Master realm expert, my strength ten times that of a Grand Master. Since you insist on seeking death, I shall oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A terrifying palm print descended, covering Xu Yan within.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's brow furrowed. A Grand Master's strength was ten times that of a Grand Master martial artist?</p><p></p><p>In that case, for a Grand Master to fight against a Grand Master, it would be almost impossible.</p><p></p><p>However, he was a pre-celestial realm cultivator, a hundred times stronger than his peers. Defeating a Grand Master would be no problem at all.</p><p></p><p>That's why he didn't intervene for now. It was good for Xu Yan to learn that the martial dao of the inner domain was not to be underestimated, and that he was still too weak, not to be arrogant and careless when he went to the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

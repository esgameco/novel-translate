        <h1>Chapter 199</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Destruction Alliance was established, and the top martial artists from all over the world gathered, with the direct target being Canglan Island, the legendary Martial Dao Celestial.</p><p></p><p>The entire inner domain martial arts world, all the major forces, were paying attention to Canglan Island's response.</p><p></p><p>However, Canglan Island remained silent.</p><p></p><p>As if it was disdainful of the Heavenly Destruction Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good, truly a Martial Dao Celestial, let's see how he will look down on us from above!"</p><p></p><p>Within the Heavenly Destruction Alliance, the powerful grand masters were filled with indignation, as if they had been insulted.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, let's destroy Canglan Island!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful members of the Heavenly Destruction Alliance, led by the Half-Step Celestial experts like the Demon Child, the Former Empress of the Great Yue Kingdom, and the Blue-Faced Man, rushed towards Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the inner domain, from the grand masters to the ninth-grade martial artists, all were shocked and focused on the battle of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the legend of the Martial Dao Celestial and the name of Canglan Island had even reached the ears of the ninth-grade martial artists in the remote regions.</p><p></p><p>The most discussed topics in the entire inner domain were the Gate of the Spirit Realm, the legend of the Martial Dao Celestial, and the Heavenly Destruction Alliance's attempt to attack the Martial Dao Celestial on Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>It was hailed as the greatest event in the history of the inner domain martial arts in thousands of years.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan and Meng Chong were unaware of the turbulent situation in the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>In the northern wilderness, the icy wind howled, and large snowflakes fell from the sky. A burly figure was walking on the snow-covered ground.</p><p></p><p>"Can you stop clinging to me?" Meng Chong said with a gloomy expression.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was curled up on him, like a small cat.</p><p></p><p>"I'm cold!" Zi Yun mumbled.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong really wanted to grab her and give her a beating, but considering the storage bag, he restrained himself for now.</p><p></p><p>"Are we almost there?" Meng Chong continued walking.</p><p></p><p>The icy wind blew against him, but Meng Chong did not feel the slightest chill. Instead, he had a realization - a golden body acupoint was circulating, and the cold energy from the heavens and earth was converging.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Great Sun Golden Body was about to reach its limit.</p><p></p><p>Once it reached the limit, it would be time for the breakthrough to the Profound Enlightenment realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's just ahead, between those two mountains, there's a huge gorge, that's our destination," Zi Yun pointed ahead.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked up, and the towering peaks seemed to be the boundary of the heavens and earth. There was a rumor that the Northern Mountains were the border of the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>Finally, they arrived at Zi Yun's destination, the gorge between the two high peaks. As soon as Meng Chong stepped into the gorge, his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?"</p><p></p><p>The scene in the gorge seemed to be a battlefield, with traces of a fierce battle by powerful experts, which the white snow could not completely cover.</p><p></p><p>From the remnants of the battle, Meng Chong was shocked to find that the martial artists who fought here were of unimaginable strength, far beyond his current abilities. Even his senior brother Xu Yan, after breaking through to the Profound Enlightenment realm, would not be able to match them.</p><p></p><p>"This is the Demon-Hunting Battlefield. The deeper you go, the more bone-chilling the cold, and there are also some dangers, be careful," Zi Yun said with an excited yet serious expression.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took a deep breath and entered the gorge. The cold became more intense, and it felt as if it could penetrate his body and freeze his blood.</p><p></p><p>Ahead, there was a large pit, and a spiritual herb was growing on it.</p><p></p><p>A fifth-grade spiritual herb!</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun climbed down from Meng Chong, her body faintly glowing with a purple light, and carefully dug out the spiritual herb, storing it in the storage bag.</p><p></p><p>As they continued forward, Zi Yun clung closely to Meng Chong, her expression slightly tense.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a gust of wind blew.</p><p></p><p>The snow was swept up, forming a giant hand that came crashing down.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Zi Yun warned anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned. This strike was not from a living enemy, but a remnant of the previous powerful experts who had fought here, left behind in an unknown way.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Meng Chong punched out, and the fierce wind and thunder instantly destroyed the hand.</p><p></p><p>As the giant hand crumbled and disappeared, Meng Chong's expression changed. He felt a faint fluctuation, which was familiar - it seemed to be the remnant of a soul or resentment.</p><p></p><p>He remembered his previous battle with Elder Wu, where he had to kill him in a life-and-death crisis, and there was a similar faint fluctuation on the insect.</p><p></p><p>Although the fluctuation of this hand was much weaker than the insect, it seemed to have a tinge of resentment.</p><p></p><p>"What is this place?" Meng Chong asked Zi Yun with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>He was no longer the ignorant martial arts novice he once was. After witnessing the Half-Step Celestial, he understood that Elder Wu had been possessed by a Celestial's remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Back then, he had killed a crippled Celestial!</p><p></p><p>"The Demon-Hunting Battlefield!" Zi Yun said with a sigh of relief after Meng Chong destroyed the hand.</p><p></p><p>She had been stopped here before, injured by a similar strike.</p><p></p><p>"It is said that the Demon Lord of the past came from the Gate of the Spirit Realm, and other powerful experts also came here to hunt the Demon Lord..."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun leaned on Meng Chong and began to recount the legends of the Demon-Hunting Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the middle of the surrounding mountains, there was a small hill. Xu Yan and Du Yuying walked over.</p><p></p><p>"The entrance to the Celestial's Tomb is there," Du Yuying pointed excitedly at the small hill.</p><p></p><p>A gentle breeze seemed to be constantly blowing around Xu Yan and Du Yuying. Xu Yan's face showed a curious expression - just how powerful was the true Martial Dao Celestial?</p><p></p><p>The two approached the small hill. With a wave of Xu Yan's hand, the layers of soil on the hill gradually peeled off, until the hill had shrunk by a third, revealing a stone house.</p><p></p><p>The stone door was tightly closed, with intricate cloud-like patterns carved on the thick stone.</p><p></p><p>"This is it!" Du Yuying looked at the patterns on the stone door, overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>In her excitement, she couldn't help but cough, and when she coughed, she couldn't resist leaning on Xu Yan...</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglan Island, the voices were boiling, the aura like a raging storm, the wind and clouds dispersing, leaving only a heavy presence that pressed down like a massive mountain.</p><p></p><p>"How scary!" Stone Er held his serrated knife, swallowing a mouthful of saliva.</p><p></p><p>"Useless!" Zhou Ying gritted her teeth, gripping her long sword, glaring disdainfully at Stone Er.</p><p></p><p>Stone Er: ...</p><p></p><p>The red cat, originally napping in the spiritual fruit grove, was directly awakened by the commotion. It curled up its tail, quickly digging a hole in the ground and burying itself, only leaving its eyes exposed.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu clutched her clothes, her face slightly pale, looking at the dense crowd of martial artists outside Canglan Island, all of whom were peak grand masters.</p><p></p><p>And behind the crowd were also all grand master experts.</p><p></p><p>Although not all the grand masters above the inner domain had come, at least seven or eight out of ten had gathered.</p><p></p><p>Such a terrifying lineup, even if the true Martial Dao Celestial was present, they might not be able to withstand the siege. Even if they did not die, they would at least be severely injured.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fleeing in panic, even sustaining serious injuries.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, the master was far superior to the Martial Dao Celestials, which was nothing to the master.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu anxiously said, "Master, you don't need to fight on the same level as them, just directly suppress them with your extraordinary realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan inwardly mocked, "I wish I could, but I'm only at the Penetrating Realm!"</p><p></p><p>He casually said, "I never use my realm to bully others, and I no longer have any opponents, so I'll take this opportunity to move around and reminisce about my invincible past."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu pursed her lips, realizing that the master had been invincible for too long and had no more opponents, so he was feeling lonely and just wanted to move around and find some enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>"Just how high is the master's realm? Big Brother said the master is almost at the Dao Realm."</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu thought to herself.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the awe-struck expressions of the crowd, feeling extremely satisfied. He stood up, twisting his waist and swinging his arms, as if warming up for a battle.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu grew excited, eager to witness the master's invincible form.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er and the others were also greatly excited, no longer worried about the safety of Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Mochild and the others, led by a group of peak Grand Masters, had their auras connected and their momentum blending, as if merging with the heavens and earth. At this moment, they were filled with utmost confidence.</p><p></p><p>Even Martial Dao Celestials could be defeated! Just then, over twenty figures flew over, each with a haughty expression and a sword hanging at their waist. The leader, a tall man with a stern face and piercing eyes, was like a sharp sword incarnate! The Assault Heaven Alliance's experts all tensed up at the sight - the Sword Immortal Cliff's Sword Master, Xie Tianheng!</p><p></p><p>"Sword Master Xie has also come, this is perfect, we can fight the Celestials side by side!" said a deputy hall master from the Seven Star Academy, smiling.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng glanced over, his mouth curling into a disdainful expression. "Trash! Who wants to fight the Celestials with you, a bunch of cowards relying on numbers?"</p><p></p><p>"I, Xie Tianheng, am ashamed to be associated with you!"</p><p></p><p>The Seven Star Academy's deputy hall master was stunned, then his face turned green with anger. Who was Xie Tianheng calling trash? The other experts were also puzzled, did Xie Tianheng and the deputy hall master have some past grievance?</p><p></p><p>"Xie Tianheng, what do you mean?" the deputy hall master gritted his teeth, his aura surging.</p><p></p><p>"Right now, we are here to assault the Celestials, we cannot lose our composure," Mochild said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>As the aura fluctuated, the deputy hall master's expression changed, and he suppressed his aura, glaring at Xie Tianheng hatefully.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Master Xie, your feud with him can wait, for now, we must assault the Celestials together!"</p><p></p><p>Mochild looked at Xie Tianheng and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"You old trash, you're not qualified to speak to me. Who wants to be associated with you?" Xie Tianheng sneered disdainfully.</p><p></p><p>Mochild was taken aback, "Sword Master Xie, who are you calling old trash?"</p><p></p><p>Mochild's expression darkened. When the name Mochild struck fear in the Inner Realm, Xie Tianheng was nothing but a drop of liquid, yet he dared to look down on him?! Xie Tianheng sneered contemptuously, pointing and saying, "I'm calling you an old trash, and all of you are trash!"</p><p></p><p>Silence fell, the Assault Heaven Alliance's experts all stared at Xie Tianheng, their anger surging. The fury originally meant for Canglan Island was about to be unleashed towards the Sword Immortal Cliff.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Immortal Cliff's experts' faces turned green, their Sword Master had gone completely mad. Even if they were no match for him, the Assault Heaven Alliance had many powerful experts!</p><p></p><p>Sensing the Assault Heaven Alliance's surging aura, the Sword Immortal Cliff's elders hurriedly sent a message to Mochild and the others: "Don't be rash, our Sword Master just came out of seclusion and may have some issues, please calm down! The overall situation is what's important, don't lose your reason because of our Sword Master's arrogance!"</p><p></p><p>Mochild and the other experts took a deep breath, ignoring Xie Tianheng, as the assault on the Celestials was the priority.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, Li Xuan had a strange expression as he looked at Xie Lingfeng: "Has your father always been this arrogant?"</p><p></p><p>He even had a bit of admiration for Xie Tianheng. Openly calling everyone "trash" in front of a group of experts was similar to that famous line, "All of you here are trash," but with a different twist.</p><p></p><p>The difference was that Xie Tianheng clearly did not have the power to crush the group.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng had an embarrassed look. "Forgive me, Senior, my father has gone mad after coming out of seclusion."</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to say more, a person from the Assault Heaven Alliance stepped forward and coldly said, "Where are the Celestials? Hand them over, or we will assault the Celestials today!"</p><p></p><p>"Noisy!" Li Xuan waved his hand, and the cultivator exploded, turning to ash.</p><p></p><p>He stood in the air, his hands behind his back, looking indifferently at the Assault Heaven Alliance's experts.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you are Martial Dao Celestials, can you really contend against my Inner Realm's might?" a purple-robed, blue-faced man said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Celestials? What insignificant insects?" Li Xuan sneered disdainfully. "I will suppress all of you lowly scum with my Penetrating Realm, the third realm of the Martial Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Arrogant!" Mochild coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>He had heard of the Vast Wilderness Martial Dao, and the Penetrating Realm was theoretically equivalent to the Grand Master Realm. For this person to claim he could suppress the Assault Heaven Alliance with the same realm, this was clearly an attempt to deceive them.</p><p></p><p>"We can also assault the Martial Dao Celestials. Since you have lowered your cultivation to fight on the same level, this kind of deceptive claim is unnecessary. Today, we have come to assault the Celestials, and you will die!"</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous sound, Mochild's hair stood on end, and a bloody saber appeared in his hand. Layers of blood-colored light surged from his body, emanating a chilling aura that stirred the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, like a towering tidal wave.</p><p></p><p>The purple-robed blue-faced and red-robed blue-faced men beside Mochild had a change in their expressions, and the other half-step Celestials also had grave expressions.</p><p></p><p>Mochild, the notorious existence, was once the core disciple of the Demon Monarch! His strength was the greatest among all present.</p><p></p><p>"Assault the Celestials, a reputation that has been passed down in Martial Dao history, will be established today!"</p><p></p><p>"The gate of the Spirit Realm cannot be monopolized!" the purple-robed blue-faced man shouted.</p><p></p><p>The half-step Celestial experts' auras surged, and the peak Grand Masters also readied themselves. The auras of the various experts intertwined, forming a towering momentum that could be seen with the naked eye, like crashing waves. The waters of the Canglan River immediately stopped flowing.</p><p></p><p>The water flow could no longer continue downstream, and a massive water wall rose upstream, growing higher and thicker, as if it would collapse into a giant tidal wave at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Even the arrogant Xie Tianheng had a grave expression, leading the Sword Immortal Cliff's experts in retreating.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, everyone held their breath, nervously watching the terrifying pressure and the lone figure standing on the Canglan River.</p><p></p><p>Suling Xiu tightly gripped the hem of her clothes, her face full of anxiety. Although she knew the master was extremely powerful and faced no danger, she couldn't help but feel anxious.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

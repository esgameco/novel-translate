        <h1>Chapter 288</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Luozhou, the great battle has subsided, but the turmoil has not settled.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance suffered heavy losses and is in the process of reorganizing. With the powerful figure of Chang Daniu leading them, some scattered cultivators have also joined the Luozhou Alliance.</p><p></p><p>However, the Luozhou Alliance conducted strict assessments of the scattered cultivators who joined, to avoid any incidents of betrayal.</p><p></p><p>Most of those recruited into the alliance were those who harbored deep resentment towards the spiritual aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Just as the Luozhou Alliance was regaining its footing, it suffered another blow.</p><p></p><p>The genius of the Sword Pavilion, Yu Changfeng, single-handedly slaughtered the geniuses of the Luozhou Alliance. Not only that, Yu Changfeng also swept away the scattered cultivators under the age of thirty in Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>In a short period of time, dozens of scattered cultivators were killed by him.</p><p></p><p>And without exception, these slain scattered cultivators all possessed decent talents.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance was completely helpless.</p><p></p><p>As a result, the morale of the Luozhou Alliance suffered a major setback, and the backbones of the scattered cultivators that had just straightened up seemed to bend down again.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, how can the scattered cultivators contend with the spiritual aristocratic families?"</p><p></p><p>"The geniuses we see are just trash in the eyes of the spiritual aristocratic families."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just be an honest ox and horse, don't offend the spiritual aristocratic families."</p><p></p><p>"The Wanshi Alliance may seem powerful, but it's not much. The spiritual aristocratic families haven't even exerted their full strength yet."</p><p></p><p>Despondent, even self-mocking and contemptuous remarks spread among the scattered cultivators of Luozhou.</p><p></p><p>At the headquarters of the Luozhou Alliance.</p><p></p><p>Now that the Wanshi Alliance has revealed itself, there is no need to hide its location anymore, so the headquarters of the Luozhou Alliance is already known to the cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"I am Yu Changfeng of the Sword Pavilion, here to meet the geniuses of the Luozhou Wanshi Alliance. Which genius will come out to fight me?"</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng's voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>The gathered scattered cultivators, including many cultivators from the spiritual aristocratic families, were all waiting for the Luozhou Alliance's response.</p><p></p><p>However, within the Luozhou Alliance, Chang Daniu's face turned grim.</p><p></p><p>The new Luozhou Alliance leader also had an extremely unsightly expression, as the Luozhou Alliance could not find a genius to fight back!</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng, in the initial stage of Refining the Spirit Celestial, was extremely powerful.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention the geniuses of the Luozhou Alliance, even among the elders present, only a few could defeat Yu Changfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chang, let's seek aid from the main alliance, send someone to Luozhou to fight, since the Sword Pavilion is not part of the Luozhou spiritual aristocratic families, we should be able to get a genius from the main alliance to fight him."</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance leader said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu murmured, "The main alliance can't spare anyone either, you must know that they are facing the Qianwu Hall, the Leiyun Mountain Villa, and the Yuling Manor."</p><p></p><p>He was also very angry, but helpless.</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance was ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>"Then are we just going to let Yu Changfeng ride roughshod over us?"</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance gritted their teeth and said.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go kill him!"</p><p></p><p>An elder angrily stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Sit down!"</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu's gaze narrowed as he said, "The rules of the genius showdown must be observed, our Wanshi Alliance absolutely cannot violate them, otherwise the spiritual aristocratic families will have an excuse."</p><p></p><p>"As long as the spiritual aristocratic families do not break the rules of the genius showdown, our Wanshi Alliance must not break them either!"</p><p></p><p>The elder could only sit down in frustration.</p><p></p><p>"What, does the Luozhou Alliance have no geniuses today? Then I'll come back and take a look tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng's mocking voice came.</p><p></p><p>"Chang Daniu, your Luozhou Alliance doesn't even have anyone to fight, then just hide like a turtle, stay in this small piece of land, and we of the spiritual aristocratic families won't bother you."</p><p></p><p>Another mocking voice came, from the powerful figure of the Leiyun Mountain Villa.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, just cower here, you all look so pitiful, we of the spiritual aristocratic families will be generous and not bother you."</p><p></p><p>Many cultivators of the spiritual aristocratic families began to mock.</p><p></p><p>Among the gathered scattered cultivators, many were resentful, and some even revealed that their choice to rely on the spiritual aristocratic families was the wise one, as they would never be wrong.</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu's face was grim.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Yu Changfeng came again.</p><p></p><p>Another round of cold mockery, the Luozhou Alliance members were resentful but helpless.</p><p></p><p>As a result, in the following days, Yu Changfeng came every day, issuing various challenges and cold mockery, even challenging the Luozhou Alliance's Refining the Spirit Celestial cultivators.</p><p></p><p>A Luozhou Alliance Refining the Spirit Celestial cultivator angrily accepted the challenge, only to be slain on the spot.</p><p></p><p>"The trash of the Wanshi Alliance, I'm here again, still no one to fight? Your main alliance won't come to aid? Can't they send the so-called geniuses to fight?"</p><p></p><p>"The scattered cultivators are lowly, although it's unpleasant to hear, but it's the truth. Is it so hard for you to recognize yourselves? Who gave you the audacity and courage to rise up? Why are you all silent? Come on, someone fight me."</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, since you have no geniuses, I, Yu Changfeng, will lower myself again and challenge your Refining the Spirit Celestial cultivators."</p><p></p><p>"If I lose, you can cut off my head and kick it around. Come on, someone fight, why are you all cowards?"</p><p></p><p>"What trash!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng's words were extremely malicious.</p><p></p><p>The gathered scattered cultivators were almost numb, they couldn't even get angry anymore.</p><p></p><p>The successive blows seemed to prove that the scattered cultivators were indeed lowly, and daring to rise up was utterly ridiculous!</p><p></p><p>"Outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu roared furiously.</p><p></p><p>He picked up two giant hammers and charged out, followed hastily by the other powerful members of the Luozhou Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"Little brat, I'll destroy you today!"</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu roared as he raised the hammers.</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng was not afraid at all, instead he revealed a smile, finally managing to enrage him, his mission was about to be accomplished.</p><p></p><p>"Come on, come on, old trash, I'll defeat you with just a blink of an eye!"</p><p></p><p>Yu Changfeng even stretched his head forward, showing the utmost contempt.</p><p></p><p>Behind Yu Changfeng, the Sword Pavilion Master and two elders had smiles on their faces.</p><p></p><p>In front of the three of them was a burly man with a beard, holding two giant hammers, the powerful figure of the Leiyun Mountain Villa.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Chang Daniu's rage, he revealed a smile.</p><p></p><p>"The subordinate sects of the Qianwu Hall are as shameless and despicable as the Qianwu Hall itself, only they can spew such malicious words."</p><p></p><p>"But that's the only way to enrage Chang Daniu, as long as he strikes..."</p><p></p><p>"Let's see how the Wanshi Alliance responds, this will be their first violation of the rules of the genius showdown."</p><p></p><p>Fan Kaishan had already prepared to intervene and rescue Yu Changfeng from Chang Daniu's hands.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Yu Changfeng still stretching his head forward, despising Chang Daniu, he revealed a smile. Not only the hot-tempered Chang Daniu, even he himself would be hard-pressed to resist the urge to rage at this sight.</p><p></p><p>Sure enough, Chang Daniu was about to strike.</p><p></p><p>"It infuriates me!"</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu almost exploded on the spot, that brat from the Sword Pavilion was so infuriating!</p><p></p><p>"It's not allowed, it's not allowed!"</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance leader's face turned green, this was clearly a deliberate attempt to provoke Uncle Chang.</p><p></p><p>"Uncle Chang, don't be rash, you can't strike!"</p><p></p><p>The Luozhou Alliance leader hurriedly hugged Chang Daniu.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, you can't strike!"</p><p></p><p>The other Refining the Spirit Celestial cultivators of the Luozhou Alliance were also covered in cold sweat, pleading.</p><p></p><p>Chang Daniu calmed down slightly, but Yu Changfeng would not let him cool off.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The expression on his face was filled with disdain. "Lowly wandering cultivator, a coward who can endure so much. Go find a turtle shell to live in."</p><p></p><p>The previously calmed Changdaniu's eyes suddenly turned blood-red, his murderous aura surging. </p><p></p><p>His powerful energy burst forth with a thunderous sound, knocking the Luozhou Alliance Master and the others away. "Don't get in my way, I will destroy this brat today!"</p><p></p><p>Fankashan's eyes held a smile, and his grip on the mace tightened slightly as he stepped forward, prepared to intervene and stop Changdaniu.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuchangfeng, he was also extremely nervous. Although he had Fankashan's backing, he was still facing an Exalted expert. If Fankashan's intervention was even slightly delayed, he would be doomed without a doubt!</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists all grew tense, quietly retreating. Another battle between Exalted experts was about to erupt! It was clear to anyone with eyes that the Lingzong faction was deliberately provoking Changdaniu.</p><p></p><p>Just as the tension was at its peak, with Changdaniu raising his mace, a figure suddenly descended and landed in front of Yuchangfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Are you Swordsect's Yuchangfeng? I've finally found you!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was a young man, carrying a long sword and with a handsome appearance.</p><p></p><p>This interruption caused the enraged Changdaniu to calm down slightly, his gaze narrowing as he looked at Fankashan, gritting his teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Yuchangfeng's expression turned cold.</p><p></p><p>Fankashan and the Swordsect Sect Master's group also had gloomy expressions. If this person had not suddenly appeared, their plan would have succeeded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't care about what was happening here. After arriving in Luozhou and inquiring, he had finally found Yuchangfeng's whereabouts, so he had hurried here.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the gathering of the Martial Prodigies of the Lingdom, and time was of the essence for him.</p><p></p><p>"I am Sword Saint Xu Yan, and I have come to challenge the Lingzong Prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke calmly.</p><p></p><p>Sword Saint Xu Yan?! The Swordsect Sect Master's gaze sharpened as he looked at Xu Yan with surprise.</p><p></p><p>Huang Liang had gone to Yuzhou for Xu Yan's sword dao, and ended up dying! Now, he had actually come forward himself! "Sword Saint? Haha, do you really think you're qualified?"</p><p></p><p>Yuchangfeng was stunned for a moment, then let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>"Are you the Wanshi Alliance Prodigy?"</p><p></p><p>He drew his sword, the sword qi swirling around him, exuding a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>"No!" Xu Yan shook his head, still holding the long sword. "Draw your sword!"</p><p></p><p>Yuchangfeng and the others were taken aback. Xu Yan was not the Wanshi Alliance Prodigy?</p><p></p><p>"The rumor is that you transformed the mountain into a sword and slew Luo Xingtian?"</p><p></p><p>"Transforming the mountain into a sword, such an absurd rumor, do you actually believe it?"</p><p></p><p>"Although Xu Yan killed Luo Xingtian, how can Luo Xingtian be compared to Yuchangfeng? Xu Yan will definitely die this time!"</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists began to discuss animatedly.</p><p></p><p>As for Changdaniu, he heaved a sigh of relief. He hoped Xu Yan would win, even if the latter was not the Wanshi Alliance Prodigy, but a mere wandering cultivator. </p><p></p><p>He snorted coldly, looking at Fankashan. Once Xu Yan won, regardless of whether it was the Swordsect Sect Master or Fankashan who intervened, he could make his move. And by violating the rules of the Prodigy Confrontation, the Swordsect and the Thundercloud Mountain Sect would have to pay a price.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan paid no attention to the discussions, thinking to himself that when he reached the peak of the Lingdom and broke through the gates of the Thousand Martial Halls, all these discussions would turn into praises.</p><p></p><p>"Draw your sword, I'm in a hurry."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Good, then let this ignorant wandering cultivator witness the true essence of the Sword Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Yuchangfeng sneered coldly.</p><p></p><p>The Swordsect Sect Master and the two Elders stared intently at Xu Yan, wanting to see if he truly possessed the legendary sword techniques of transforming wood into swords and mountains into swords.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Yuchangfeng drew his sword.</p><p></p><p>Although he seemed to look down on Xu Yan, his first strike was with full force, without the slightest bit of carelessness.</p><p></p><p>The sword light flashed, the sword qi was extremely fierce, and in an instant, it had already attacked Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Lowly wandering cultivator, this sword will shred you to pieces!"</p><p></p><p>Yuchangfeng said with a murderous aura.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood still, unmoved even as the sword light approached him and the sword qi enveloped him.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful!" Changdaniu couldn't help but call out.</p><p></p><p>He was inwardly disappointed. How could he not even withstand a single strike?</p><p></p><p>The surrounding martial artists shook their heads, and some even had a mocking expression. With such strength, he still dared to call himself the Sword Saint? Luo Xingtian actually died at his hands, he was truly useless.</p><p></p><p>Shing! The sword qi descended, but Xu Yan stepped into the sword qi, allowing it to pass through him without the slightest harm.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!" Yuchangfeng's expression changed, and he roared angrily. The sword light surged, the murderous aura instantly intensifying, even causing sword flowers to bloom, each petal containing powerful sword intent.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he unleashed the Swordsect's ultimate sword technique.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan still held the long sword, and all the sword qi and sword light seemed to be absorbed into the formless rivers and mountains, and even when they approached Xu Yan, they seemed to submit, no longer possessing any killing intent.</p><p></p><p>"The Lingdom's Sword Dao is nothing special. A mere Refining Spirit Celestial Initial stage, what qualifications do you have to challenge me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>The sword qi entered his body, the sword light entered his body, but instead of being directly absorbed, they were first cleansed by the sword intent of the rivers and mountains before being absorbed into his body.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the midst of the battle, the foundation was already accumulating.</p><p></p><p>The foundation of the Sword Dao! Directly absorbing Yuchangfeng's sword qi and sword light into his body was like absorbing Yuchangfeng's cultivated sword dao into his own.</p><p></p><p>The Swordsect Sect Master's expression was horrified. What kind of technique was this? Directly ignoring the sword attacks, how was he able to do it? Fankashan's expression also tightened, among the wandering cultivators, there was actually such an unbelievable prodigy? Changdaniu let out a sigh of relief, then was secretly shocked. What was going on with Xu Yan, why couldn't the sword qi harm him at all? He didn't even see any signs of resistance.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible, it's an illusion, it's an illusion!" Yuchangfeng roared, his expression extremely ferocious.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan spoke calmly, "You should use your secret technique now, or you won't have a chance."</p><p></p><p>Squeeze every last bit of value from Yuchangfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Good! Good! Good! Lowly wandering cultivator, let me show you the Lingzong secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>Yuchangfeng took a deep breath, his gaze turning icy cold.</p><p></p><p>He could not accept losing to a wandering cultivator! After looking down on and insulting the wandering cultivators, to be trampled on by one in the end? He could not accept this result!</p><p></p><p>He would rather die than accept it! Poof! His blood sprayed out, and the sword in his hand turned blood-red, a crimson sword light surging out from his body.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Yuchangfeng unleashed the strongest sword strike of his life! His body moved with the sword, charging towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Poof! At a certain moment, he seemed to have fallen into a vast river and mountain, and his fierce sword strike became gentle, continuously dissolving and merging into the river and mountain.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of sword dao is this?"</p><p></p><p>He was greatly shocked in his heart, his divine soul shaking, almost on the verge of madness.</p><p></p><p>The gentle breeze of the river and mountain, he felt as if his body was dissolving.</p><p></p><p>No! It was his divine soul that was dissolving, his physical body continuously cracking and fragmenting.</p><p></p><p>As his consciousness faded away, Yuchangfeng still saw Xu Yan standing there, holding the long sword without moving an inch.

        <h1>Chapter 543</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The two sides drew closer and closer. Canghai Turtle's heart was in his throat, his expression solemn as he stared intently at Blood Madness. Even if it meant getting injured, he was prepared to block Blood Madness if necessary.</p><p></p><p>A Small World Master was not so easily killed. </p><p></p><p>Moreover, how could Blood Madness not have some powerful trump cards to use in a life-or-death crisis?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan never underestimated his enemies, let alone Blood Madness who was a Small World Master. But Canghai Turtle had extremely strong defense and was also at the level of a Small World Master in strength. At the critical moment, it would be enough to just restrain Blood Madness.</p><p></p><p>As long as Blood Madness was restrained for an instant, it would be the best opportunity to kill him.</p><p></p><p>As for Blood Madness facing a life-or-death crisis and using powerful secret techniques, Xu Yan had anticipated this as well. He had the Primordial Turtle Shell ready.</p><p></p><p>It could substitute for Canghai Turtle. With the Primordial Turtle Shell plus his Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword, it would be enough to block Blood Madness's attack!</p><p></p><p>Besides the Primordial Turtle Shell, Fang Hao was also prepared. In an instant, he set up eighteen layers of defensive formations. Moreover, the formations used the Burning Cloud Finger Bone as the core. Burning Cloud was a World Master, so using his finger bone as the formation core could enhance and suppress Blood Madness's attacks.</p><p></p><p>With so many layers of defense, even if Blood Madness used powerful secret techniques, he would not be able to harm the four brothers.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness was a Small World Master and had the confidence to back it up. He had underestimated the killing power of Xu Yan's group of four, so naturally he would face a life-or-death crisis.</p><p></p><p>A cold smile played at the corners of Blood Madness's mouth, his eyes flashing with murderous intent. In his sleeve, a tiny crimson blade no more than three inches long was already gripped in his palm.</p><p></p><p>He was waiting for the opportunity. When Canghai Turtle's defense showed the slightest opening, that would be the moment to deliver a fatal blow to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Young and impetuous, thinking too highly of yourselves, underestimating a Small World Master too much. You think you're invincible with Canghai Turtle's protection? With your strength, even if I don't defend, I'd only be slightly injured at most. It's worth taking a small injury to kill you four."</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness thought coldly to himself.</p><p></p><p>Having been through countless battles, he had been injured more times than he could count. It was nothing more than getting injured again, he would recover quickly. But it was worth taking a small injury to kill Xu Yan's group of four.</p><p></p><p>After all, the geniuses of the Taicang World were worth paying this price for!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle's enormous body began to shrink. Azure light rippled out, colliding with Blood Madness's blood waves. The blood waves began to recede, seemingly unable to withstand Canghai Turtle's impact.</p><p></p><p>But both sides knew that the moment to determine victory or defeat, life or death, was about to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Sword light emanating a divine aura slowly rose up, hovering not far in front of Xu Yan. The sword tip pointed at Blood Madness, about to launch an attack.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao exhaled, and the divine artifacts scattered across the battlefield gradually emerged. The grand formation of this unmelting domain was ready to be unleashed. The Qimen formations, defensive formations, and killing formations could be activated at any time.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's body swelled up a few more times, and a great sun gradually rose up behind his head.</p><p></p><p>The extreme killing intent emanating from the soul weapon in Jiang Buping's hand gradually disappeared, as if it had completely condensed onto the weapon. Moreover, the soul weapon began to become somewhat illusory.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Finally, the two sides drew close.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle suddenly opened his mouth and spat out a beam of azure light, instantly attacking towards Blood Madness. And at this moment, a weak point appeared in Canghai Turtle's defense.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and pointed, and the sword light suddenly slashed down.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: Heaven-Severing Sword! This sword strike was executed with his Sacred Sword Realm cultivation. The sword intent that could extinguish heaven and earth was already far beyond what it used to be.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The formations instantly descended, enveloping Blood Madness. Strange patterns seemed to appear under Fang Hao's feet, turning the battlefield into a mysterious layout.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his hand, but did not attack immediately.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness smiled coldly. The tiny blood blade in his hand shot out from within the blood waves, like a point of crimson light instantly piercing through the murky unmelting domain.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, intense blood light surged out from Blood Madness's body. His aura reached its peak at this moment. With a wave of his hand, the blood waves swirled like a vortex, instantly enveloping Canghai Turtle.</p><p></p><p>He wanted to restrain Canghai Turtle for an instant. Without Canghai Turtle's protection, killing Xu Yan's group of four would be easy! Blood Madness also transformed into a blood shadow in an instant, about to charge forward and attack.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness had long prepared this series of moves. But to his shock, that tiny blood blade was actually dodged by Xu Yan! Only an afterimage of Xu Yan remained in place.</p><p></p><p>At this very instant, boom! The formations activated. Blood Madness, who was about to charge forward and attack, suddenly felt his whole body freeze, as if bound by chains.</p><p></p><p>The ground beneath his feet seemed to surge like quicksand. He even felt that the area he was in seemed to be rotating.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this?!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Madness's expression changed. Although he could instantly break free of these restraints, this kind of technique was something he had never seen before.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, Xu Yan's sword slashed down.</p><p></p><p>Hum! As this sword slashed down, Blood Madness's scalp instantly went numb. An intense sense of crisis arose. He was shocked in his heart, "How can Xu Yan possibly threaten me?!"</p><p></p><p>He was a Small World Master. In theory, those not at the same level would find it almost impossible to harm him. Even if he stood still, those Supreme Realm martial artists would find it difficult to harm him.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Small World laws possessed by a Small World Master were not something Supreme Realm martial artists could break through.</p><p></p><p>However, this sword strike from Xu Yan could actually break through the Small World laws on his body. The intent of extermination made him feel a life-threatening crisis.</p><p></p><p>This shock was no small matter. Only now did Blood Madness realize that he had underestimated Xu Yan all along!</p><p></p><p>But although shocked, Blood Madness was not flustered. After all, he had been through countless battles and experienced many crises.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The blood blade that had missed its first strike instantly shot back, flying towards Xu Yan again. He raised his hand and patted, and a viscous blood-like energy appeared in front of him.</p><p></p><p>But at this moment, he was shocked to see that Canghai Turtle had suddenly shifted position, actually blocking behind Xu Yan, stopping the blood blade's attack.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, azure light like vast ocean waves instantly slapped towards him, restraining half of his power.</p><p></p><p>Hum! A huge golden glowing figure suddenly appeared at his side. In an instant, Meng Chong had actually reached his side, and the attack he had been preparing came smashing down.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: Heaven-Holding Earth-Destroying Strike!</p><p></p><p>This all-out attack from Meng Chong was extremely violent, as if holding up the heavens and smashing them down.</p><p></p><p>This was a powerful divine ability of physical body martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Hum! As Meng Chong attacked, Blood Madness felt a cold glint appear. A long spear suddenly appeared before his eyes!</p><p></p><p>No, not right!</p><p></p><p>This killing spear was not seen with the eyes, but sensed by the soul!</p><p></p><p>Soul attack!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, an intense sense of mortal danger filled his mind. Blood Madness realized he had been careless. He had not expected Xu Yan's group of four to be able to unleash such terrifying killing power, and even break through the Small World laws on his body!</p><p></p><p>Boom! Frenzied blood light surged out from Blood Madness's body. A series of shattering sounds rang out as Fang...</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The great formation binding Hao instantly collapsed.</p><p></p><p>Even the Qimen grand formation had a corner crumble.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's face turned slightly pale. He had already exhausted all his strength earlier using the Qimen grand formation to switch the positions of Canghai Gui and Meng Chong. Now, he could barely maintain the Qimen formation.</p><p></p><p>However, with a wave of his hand, the Qimen grand formation and the immutable power of this area instantly transformed into a restriction, falling upon the surging blood light.</p><p></p><p>The blood light paused for a split second, but in that moment lay the difference between life and death! Puff! A sharp spear pierced Blood Madness's soul, a sword slashed open his body, and a violent force shattered his physical form!</p><p></p><p>"Ah!" Blood Madness let out a miserable scream! "You deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>A violent aura blossomed within the blood light, like viscous blood transforming into a terrifying giant mouth, spitting out countless blood threads that spread in all directions, enveloping everything from all sides.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly break out, this is the Blood Prison Realm!" </p><p></p><p>Canghai Gui's expression changed. He stood up on his hind legs, his entire turtle-man form upright, and struck out with his front limbs. Azure light blasted towards the encroaching blood threads.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness's agonized screams rang out continuously. Even he couldn't withstand the intense pain coming from his soul.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Blood Madness had suffered heavy injuries. His physical body was destroyed, his soul pierced through, and his wounds kept spreading. He directly used the laws of his own small world to unleash his ultimate secret technique!</p><p></p><p>"Canghai Gui, get the hell out of here!" Blood Madness roared in anger.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could refine and devour Xu Yan and the other three, he could recover from his injuries somewhat. As for Canghai Gui, he was self-aware enough to know he couldn't hurt him! However, Blood Madness was confident that with Canghai Gui's offensive power, he wouldn't be able to break through his Blood Prison Realm. Once his Blood Prison Realm fully enveloped them, it would naturally exclude Canghai Gui!</p><p></p><p>The blood threads enveloping from all directions were like a spider's web. Unless one could break through the encircling blood threads, they would inevitably be wrapped up like a cocoon and devoured by Blood Madness. </p><p></p><p>But these blood threads were the small world laws of Blood Madness, a small world master. Breaking through them was no easy task. The Blood Prison Realm was a powerful secret technique of the Netherworld Prison small world master.</p><p></p><p>It was like a blood sea purgatory - those who entered were doomed to die.</p><p></p><p>Even experts of the same level, if they were careless and fell in, would ultimately perish as their blood essence was refined.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Gui's defense was extremely strong, so naturally he wasn't afraid. However, Blood Madness's target was never Canghai Gui to begin with, so he was full of confidence that he could refine Xu Yan and the other three, devouring their blood essence to nourish himself and recover from his injuries.</p><p></p><p>In this battle, Blood Madness admitted he had been careless, to be so heavily injured. At the same time, he was shocked at how strong Xu Yan and the others' martial arts were, far exceeding his expectations.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged as the Primordial Turtle Shell appeared, instantly forming a small world-like defense that enveloped Meng Chong, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>The four of them were all within the protection of the Primordial Turtle Shell, while Canghai Gui's body grew larger again as he said in a deep voice: "Enter my Canghai Realm, we'll wear him down to death!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness was severely injured and definitely couldn't hold on for too long. Canghai Gui was confident that with his defense, it was enough to wear Blood Madness down to death.</p><p></p><p>"Old Turtle, in a moment, infuse your power into my sword," Xu Yan said calmly as a sword appeared in his hand.</p><p></p><p>Looking at this sword, Xu Yan sighed with emotion. Since breaking through to the Heart Sword realm, he had rarely used a physical sword, always transforming objects into swords or using his own power as a sword.</p><p></p><p>Today, he was finally drawing his sword again!</p><p></p><p>Hum! The sword light rippled slightly, a sacred aura enveloping the sword, giving it a holy quality.</p><p></p><p>The rippling sword light seemed to contain an entire world of mountains and rivers in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan held the sword in his hand, its tip pointing towards that mass of blood light, towards Blood Madness who was still letting out low growls and miserable screams. He didn't use this sword to break through the Blood Prison Realm, but to slay Blood Madness! Once Blood Madness died, the Blood Prison Realm would naturally collapse!</p><p></p><p>Small world masters were not so easily slain. If other realm lords suffered such an attack, they would likely have perished already, yet Blood Madness could still unleash such an ultimate secret technique.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan and his three sworn brothers were not Tai Cang martial artists. Their cultivated martial arts were powerful, and they were Heavenly Earth realm martial artists possessing the power of heaven and earth. This meant they could use their own heavenly earth power to destroy a small world master's origin!</p><p></p><p>This was why Xu Yan was confident he could slay Blood Madness.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The sword in Xu Yan's hand seemed to contain an entire world of mountains and rivers. He patted with his left hand, and a golden dragon roared as it entered the sword. One could vaguely see a golden dragon coiling within the world inside the sword.</p><p></p><p>Above was a roaring golden dragon, below were mortals wielding swords. Thunder surged from all directions of heaven and earth, and a gentle breeze blew. This seemed not to be a sword, but an entire world.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised his fist, and a great sun surged out from his fist, directly entering the sword. In an instant, a great sun appeared in the world within the sword.</p><p></p><p>Not only that, Meng Chong also infused his domineering and peerless blade intent into the sword.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping condensed a spear in his hand, formed from his extreme soul power, and similarly infused it into the sword. The world within the sword underwent some more changes.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao waved his hand, and invisible formations, Qimen grand formations, and restrictions all entered the sword. Great power gathered in the world within the sword, as if the entire world was a strange formation.</p><p></p><p>The sword trembled, as if it might shatter at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"It's your turn, Old Turtle!" Xu Yan said, looking towards Canghai Gui.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Gui had a shocked expression. What kind of sword technique was this? Xu Yan actually wanted to gather the powers of Meng Chong, Fang Hao, Jiang Buping and himself, concentrating them all in this one sword.</p><p></p><p>How was Xu Yan able to encompass different powers without them scattering, and instead fuse and unleash them in an instant?</p><p></p><p>Looking at the sword in Xu Yan's hand, it was as if he saw a small world, as if this wasn't a sword but a world, or perhaps a world of swords.</p><p></p><p>Using a world to encompass the powers of the four directions, then transforming it into a killing strike? Canghai Gui was shocked in his heart. He looked towards the already encircling blood waves forming all around, with Blood Madness's low growls and miserable screams now containing a hint of relief.</p><p></p><p>Blood Madness was doomed to die! Canghai Gui knew that Blood Madness, this small world master, could not survive this sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Already heavily injured, how could he withstand this sword? It should be known that this sword strike also contained the power of Canghai Gui, a small world master himself, plus the powerful martial arts of Xu Yan, Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Jiang Buping. It was enough to destroy Blood Madness's origin!</p><p></p><p>Azure light, like the waves of a vast sea, surged into the sword. A great expanse of surging, billowing waves appeared in the world within the sword.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The sword trembled, even making faint cracking sounds. This sword was about to be unable to bear it.</p><p></p><p>"That's enough!" Xu Yan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Gui stopped inputting more power, his eyes fixed unblinkingly on the sword in Xu Yan's hand. At this moment, he actually felt a slight threat from this sword.</p><p></p><p>It should be known that even with his extremely powerful defense, he could feel threatened. How could the heavily injured Blood Madness possibly withstand it?</p><p></p><p>"Today, Xu Yan slays the small world master Blood Madness here!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

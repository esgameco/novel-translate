        <h1>Chapter 475</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Freedom is wonderful, and great power is wonderful."</p><p></p><p>Tianzi's face was full of envy.</p><p></p><p>"If I had even half the power of the Ancestor of the Dao, how could I be so miserable? I don't know how carefree I would be!"</p><p></p><p>Then, he became excited again.</p><p></p><p>"However, as long as I become the Heavenly Dao and operate the entire universe, then the whole universe will be my body. Although my body will be a bit bigger, I should still be able to run around everywhere, right?</p><p></p><p>"As the Heavenly Dao, it's reasonable for me to wander around everywhere, isn't it?"</p><p></p><p>The more Tianzi thought about it, the more excited he became.</p><p></p><p>These were all things the Ancestor of the Dao had said. He felt they made a lot of sense, so becoming the Heavenly Dao was his only choice.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming the Heavenly Dao could he be more comfortable. To become stronger, he wouldn't need to work hard himself - he could just let the living beings in the universe work hard for him.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the universe is the Unformed Land, endless and boundless. This universe is too small within the Unformed Land. Taicang travels through the Unformed Land, and I will bring the entire universe to travel through the Unformed Land.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, the living beings of the universe will search for treasures and cultivate throughout the Unformed Land. As they become stronger, I will become even stronger.</p><p></p><p>"Unformed Divine Palace, hmph, just you wait. I'll show you the power of this Heavenly Dao!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was full of anticipation for the future.</p><p></p><p>"Hehe, those guys can struggle all they want. Do they really think they can obtain the authority of Heaven and Earth? Have they asked me, the spirit of Heaven and Earth... no, have they asked me, the Heavenly Dao? One day, I'll let them taste the might of the Heavenly Dao. They should learn to fear the Heavenly Dao, just like they used to fear Taicang... no, even more than they feared Taicang!"</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was gleefully envisioning making those guys taste the might of the Heavenly Dao after he became the Heavenly Dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned to the Qinghua Realm in a single step.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm is really turbulent."</p><p></p><p>Back in the Divine Realm, Li Xuan couldn't help but sigh again.</p><p></p><p>"There are quite a few ambitious fellows."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Tianzi was the spirit of the Taicang universe. If he became the Heavenly Dao, he wouldn't be rejected by the fundamental essence of the universe and could succeed very smoothly. But those realm lords coveting the authority of Heaven and Earth were purely delusional.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, ever since the true dragon fell and rampaged in all directions, the powerful experts of various major forces began to gather in the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This true dragon should be an immature one with limited power. If we join forces, we should have a chance to subdue it!"</p><p></p><p>"That's right. If we use many divine artifacts and set up an ambush formation, we should be able to subdue this true dragon without much problem!"</p><p></p><p>A group of powerful experts in the Divine Realm spoke with high spirits at the Taihe Divine Palace.</p><p></p><p>"Do you all really have such confidence?" asked the Taihe Sect Master with a solemn expression.</p><p></p><p>"An immature true dragon that has lost its reason - can we not subdue it with the combined power of our Divine Realm?"</p><p></p><p>"The strength of Meng Chong and Jiang Buping is far beyond that of ordinary Immortal Venerable. If the two of them could participate..."</p><p></p><p>"No!"</p><p></p><p>As soon as someone suggested involving Meng Chong and Jiang Buping, they were immediately opposed.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts all had some tacit understanding of each other's thoughts.</p><p></p><p>A true dragon, and an immature one at that - if they could subdue it, wouldn't they be able to obtain some opportunities from it? After some discussion, the powerful experts from various major forces such as the Taihe Realm, Great Yan Realm, Taikun Realm, Taimiao Realm, Hundred Battles Hall, Ten Thousand Treasures Alliance, along with Immortal Venerables from various realms, formed the Dragon Subduing Alliance!</p><p></p><p>Time was of the essence. Various major forces mobilized some of their hidden resources. Many Immortal Venerables set out in grand fashion towards where the true dragon was rampaging, preparing to ambush it.</p><p></p><p>In the Taihe Divine Palace, the Taihe Sect Master's expression was extremely solemn.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven Killing Earth Shadowing are too bold, actually ambushing a true dragon to fall into the Divine Realm. What do they want to do? Provoke a war with the true dragons?"</p><p></p><p>"Sect Master, this matter is no small affair and is beyond what we can resolve. Let's open the Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder," said the Grand Elder of the Taihe Sect gravely.</p><p></p><p>"That was my intention, but opening the Heavenly Ladder takes some time," said the Taihe Sect Master solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"I hope they can hold back the true dragon for some days, to buy time to open the Heavenly Ladder," sighed the Grand Elder of the Taihe Sect.</p><p></p><p>The various major forces mobilizing some hidden resources and gathering Immortal Venerables from various realms to form an alliance to subdue the true dragon - this was actually pushed by the Taihe Sect behind the scenes.</p><p></p><p>The purpose was obvious - to delay the time it would take for the true dragon's rampage to reach the Taihe Realm, so they could successfully open the Heavenly Ladder.</p><p></p><p>Although the true dragon that fell into the Divine Realm was immature, it still possessed the might of the Tianhe Realm. How could it be resisted by a group of Immortal Venerables joining forces?</p><p></p><p>True dragons are born with immense might, stirring up the winds and clouds of Heaven and Earth. With surging dragon qi, they can employ powerful true dragon techniques.</p><p></p><p>"Prepare to open the Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder," said the Taihe Sect Master gravely.</p><p></p><p>This matter was already beyond what they could resolve. They could only report to the upper sects of the Dao Realm.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if the upper sect elders know about the Heaven Killing Earth Shadowing ambushing the true dragon," sighed the Taihe Sect Master inwardly. The current situation seemed to indicate that the Heaven Killing Earth Shadowing's plot had exceeded the control of the upper sect elders.</p><p></p><p>The Taihe Realm was in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts who had gathered once again set off eagerly, preparing to participate in the battle to subdue the true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Jiang Buping also arrived at the Taihe Realm. Seeing the excited expressions of the powerful experts who had come from various realms, they were both speechless for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"They don't really think they can subdue a true dragon with numerical superiority, do they?" Jiang Buping asked in confusion.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, no one had asked him and his second senior brother, two such powerful experts, to take action.</p><p></p><p>This made the situation seem somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong chuckled and said, "The news has come that it's an immature true dragon. Since it's immature and has lost its reason, it means there's a possibility of hunting it down.</p><p></p><p>"A true dragon is a great opportunity, a supreme treasure. That's why they think they can subdue the true dragon."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping suddenly understood. No wonder they didn't ask him and his second senior brother to take action - they were afraid the two of them would monopolize the hunted true dragon with their powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>Or directly take most of it.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, there's also the reason that major realms are inciting other Immortal Venerables behind the scenes," said Meng Chong, looking at a message talisman. This was secret information Zhou Qingshuang had told him.</p><p></p><p>Forces like the Great Yan Dynasty naturally knew that Immortal Venerables couldn't subdue a true dragon, but they needed to slow down the speed of the true dragon's rampage a bit.</p><p></p><p>That's why this operation came about.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth junior brother, do you think the Heaven Killing Earth Shadowing lured the true dragon to fall into the Divine Realm just to cause chaos in the Divine Realm?" Meng Chong asked pensively.</p><p></p><p>"The Heaven Killing Earth Shadowing colluding with forces outside the universe is already conclusively proven. Moreover, their goal is for Heaven and Earth to become one. The true dragon falling into the Divine Realm is just one part of it. Is the next step to bring in forces from outside the universe?" Jiang Buping was also somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go see how these people hunt the true dragon," said Meng Chong with interest.</p><p></p><p>"Second senior brother, should we take action?"</p><p></p><p>"Let's see. If possible, it wouldn't be bad to compete with the true dragon a bit. But with our current strength, we probably aren't a match for this true dragon.</p><p></p><p>"Big senior brother is about to arrive from the Bihai Realm. Let's see if big senior brother can subdue the dragon."</p><p></p><p>Just as Meng Chong and Jiang Buping were preparing to leave the Taihe Realm to watch the powerful experts from various major forces ambush the true dragon, they encountered Wu Tiannan who had come looking for them.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu, what's the matter?" Meng Chong asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"The Taihe Realm may be about to..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What major event could be happening? This token of mine suddenly had some response, as if it's a kind of summons, or obtaining some qualification to go somewhere. But I don't know if this is good fortune or disaster." A token appeared in Wu Tiannan's hand.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the token was emitting a faint glow.</p><p></p><p>"Principal Wu, where did you get this token from?" Meng Chong asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"It was given to me by a senior. He once said that when I reached the Taihe Realm, I would know the purpose of this token." Wu Tiannan explained the circumstances of his encounter with Old Xiao.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I'll accompany Principal Wu on this journey," Meng Chong nodded. </p><p></p><p>He was also very curious about this token.</p><p></p><p>So the three of them followed the token's guidance, traveling onward until they arrived at a certain place in the Taihe Sect.</p><p></p><p>It was a high platform, pale cyan in color, built from some unknown stone material. At this moment, faint ripples were appearing on the surface of the platform.</p><p></p><p>Below the platform, the Taihe Sect Master and others each held a divine artifact, inserting them into the platform. Their soul power continuously flowed through the artifacts into the platform.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The ripples on the platform grew more and more intense. Amidst the undulating ripples, it seemed as if a staircase was descending from the sky.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of Meng Chong and the other two drew the attention of the Taihe Sect Master and the others. They became alert, their hearts tightening.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Wu Tiannan asked in shock.</p><p></p><p>The summoning power from the token was coming from that faintly visible staircase.</p><p></p><p>"It's similar to a Spirit Realm divine bridge passageway," Meng Chong said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The three of them silently watched, neither interfering nor intervening. </p><p></p><p>They waited for the staircase to fully form.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong and Jiang Buping were also communicating, trying to understand what exactly this staircase was.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder? I see." Meng Chong immediately became expectant.</p><p></p><p>By now, he was nearly invincible in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder descending, was it time for him to venture into the Dao Realm?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The Dao Realm Heavenly Ladder became clearer and clearer. At its end, powerful auras were already surging, and not just one.</p><p></p><p>Evidently, the backers of these major powers like the Taihe Sect had received news of the true dragon. They were preparing to descend in their true forms from the Dao Realm via the Heavenly Ladder.</p><p></p><p>Meanwhile, in a certain place in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The true dragon's howl was bone-chillingly cold. For thousands of miles around, everything was covered in ice and snow, as if blanketed by thick frost.</p><p></p><p>But this ice and snow seemed to contain some kind of pressure.</p><p></p><p>The jade-white, flawless true dragon coiled in midair, its crimson eyes surveying the surroundings, already in a state of fury.</p><p></p><p>Pillars of light stood between heaven and earth like chains, sealing off the sky and also restraining the Jade Snow True Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Behind each chain were hundreds of Immortal Venerable Lords!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable Lords participating were far too weak, but they comprised more than half of all the Immortal Venerable Lords in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>This place had gathered at least half of the Spirit Realm's power.</p><p></p><p>If they still couldn't subdue the true dragon like this, it meant the Spirit Realm would have no more power to resist.</p><p></p><p>Ice and snow swirled around the coiled true dragon, crackling with lightning that contained immense power.</p><p></p><p>As it coiled, a presence surged through heaven and earth, seemingly condensing into dragon form. The sky howled as a vast dragon might pressed down on all living things.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Immortal Venerable Lords now felt a terrifying pressure, their minds filled with emotions of facing an immense horror.</p><p></p><p>As strong as they were, they were unable to suppress the fear in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>Clank clank clank! Under the reinforcement of the many Immortal Venerable Lords, the chains formed a great net that continuously contracted, seeking to bind the true dragon within.</p><p></p><p>As the chain net grew smaller and smaller, seemingly about to successfully restrain the true dragon, excited expressions appeared on the faces of the Immortal Venerable Lords.</p><p></p><p>In midair at a certain location, Old Xiao silently watched.</p><p></p><p>"A great calamity for the Spirit Realm. Half the Immortal Venerable Lords will die in one fell swoop. Some people are truly ruthless."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao shook his head and muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"But what does it have to do with me? Let's see how they struggle."</p><p></p><p>Old Xiao had no intention of intervening at all.</p><p></p><p>Roar! As the net of chains grew smaller and smaller, getting closer to the true dragon, at this moment the true dragon let out an extremely angry roar.</p><p></p><p>It seemed this great net had stirred up some memories.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In this instant, the true dragon's body grew larger again. A white, icy dragon aura enveloped the true dragon. The sky was suddenly covered in dark clouds, flashing with lightning.</p><p></p><p>Ice, snow and lightning flashed. A oppressive aura permeated heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if a great horror had emerged.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Immortal Venerable Lords involuntarily trembled in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>However, at this point there was no possibility of retreat, or they would certainly die.</p><p></p><p>"Give it everything you've got! Victory or defeat will be decided now!" shouted the expert from the Great Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The crowd of Immortal Venerable Lords erupted with full force.</p><p></p><p>"All - of - you - will - die!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the true dragon's eyes grew even more crimson, its aura of fury intensifying. It spat out each word one by one.</p><p></p><p>Roar! With a dragon's cry, the true dragon stretched out its claw. Icy lightning seemed to tear through the air, instantly shattering one of the chains.</p><p></p><p>Then it opened its dragon mouth.</p><p></p><p>A cold light appeared in the dragon's mouth. The spiritual energy of heaven and earth became turbulent. The dark clouds in the sky rotated like a vortex, continuously sinking lower.</p><p></p><p>Dark clouds covered the sky, lightning raged, bone-chilling cold spread. Snowflake-like lightning carrying frigid power fell from the clouds like an apocalyptic disaster.</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Immortal Venerable Lords' expressions changed drastically. Uncontrollable panic surged in their hearts. The feeling of impending doom grew stronger and stronger.</p><p></p><p>The snowflake-like lightning actually contained a terrifying cold power.</p><p></p><p>What kind of true dragon was this? How frightening were its true dragon techniques!</p><p></p><p>Among the Great Realm experts, a few silently began to retreat, then fled.</p><p></p><p>Accompanied by an enraged dragon roar, this area of heaven and earth was already covered in dark clouds. A white, frigid qi was spat from the dragon's mouth.</p><p></p><p>Dazzling light filled the sky. The battlefield was covered in ice and cold, as if heaven and earth had been frozen and shattered!</p><p></p><p>"Run!" A terrified voice cried out.</p><p></p><p>Then came even more intense shaking of heaven and earth. The true dragon roared, dark clouds rolled, lightning exploded, ice spread for hundreds of miles. Everything shattered under the dragon's might.</p><p></p><p>For hundreds of miles in all directions, all life was extinguished. Only the enraged true dragon coiled in midair.</p><p></p><p>Then it flew off to kill in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>In distant lands, some Immortal Venerable Lords who had not participated in subduing the true dragon were now trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>The might of the true dragon was terrifying beyond measure!</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm is finished!"</p><p></p><p>This true dragon had clearly lost control. Moreover, after this battle it was even more enraged, filled with fury and killing intent. If no supreme expert came to subdue this true dragon, all these Immortal Venerable Lords would be destroyed by it.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm would suffer heavy losses in this true dragon calamity, with powerful experts falling in droves.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

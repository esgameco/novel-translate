        <h1>Chapter 363</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sudden turn of events caught everyone by surprise, even Li Xuan was astonished - the divine bridge had collapsed, and a True King Celestial Venerable had been slain, falling on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Although that True King Celestial Venerable was not at peak strength, he was still a True King Celestial Venerable after all, far surpassing the previous Condensed Law Celestial Venerable in power.</p><p></p><p>In terms of strength, he was even more powerful than Mei Wu from before.</p><p></p><p>This showed that whoever struck was extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the azure sea where blood light shot into the sky and figures emerged one after another, Li Xuan thought of the small booklet left behind by Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, the Spirit Realm is the hunting ground of me, Blood Disciple 726 of the Netherworld Prison. From today onwards, the Spirit Realm is the Blood Realm. Those with decent talents and strength, if you want to live, become blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>"Those who wish to live, kneel and submit quickly!"</p><p></p><p>A cold and stern voice echoed out.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura rose up from the azure sea, a blood light illuminating the horizon. Even from a great distance, one could feel the bloodthirsty qi.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others felt heavy-hearted. The speaker was too strong!</p><p></p><p>Even from afar, that bloodthirsty qi gave them a sense of terror, like an invisible mountain pressing down on their hearts!</p><p></p><p>This person had severed the divine bridge and slain a Celestial Venerable. Their strength far surpassed Mei Wu from the Ice State Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, those blood shadows must be the blood slaves they spoke of?</p><p></p><p>Netherworld Prison Blood Disciples? Could the Heavenly Cave of the Azure Sea Abyss be called the Netherworld Prison Heavenly Cave? Where exactly did these Netherworld Prison Blood Disciples come from?</p><p></p><p>The divine bridge had collapsed, would powerful experts come from the Divine Realm to rescue them?</p><p></p><p>"The Qinghua Realm is currently preoccupied and no one can save you. The divine bridge is broken, no one can come. Your fates are all in the hands of me, Blood Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>"The useless will become blood food. Those with talent and decent strength can become my blood slaves and sacrifice the Spirit Realm with blood, only then will you have a chance to live.</p><p></p><p>"Your only path to survival is to submit to my Netherworld Prison!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726's voice rolled out, piercing into people's hearts, as if plucking at the strings of fear.</p><p></p><p>As 726's voice rang out, rolling blood light seemed to dye the azure sea crimson. The bloodthirsty qi dyed half the sky red, even the spiritual energy of heaven and earth took on a faint red tinge.</p><p></p><p>"726? Is it the 726th Blood Disciple, or ranked 726th in strength?" Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>726 was clearly this Netherworld Prison Blood Disciple's title, and could be considered their name. Whether it was ranked by strength or order was unknown.</p><p></p><p>However, Li Xuan was inclined to believe it was ranked by strength.</p><p></p><p>"What level of strength do the top ten Blood Disciples have, and what's above Blood Disciples?" Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this Netherworld Prison must have extremely powerful existences.</p><p></p><p>"The divine bridge is broken, does that mean we can't go to the Divine Realm?" Xie Tianheng said with some reluctance.</p><p></p><p>As for the blood light surging over from the azure sea, he wasn't worried at all. He was only upset about not being able to go to the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's broken, so just reconnect it." Xu Yan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Reconnect it?" Xie Tianheng's eyes lit up. "You can reconnect the divine bridge?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and looked at his master, saying, "Master can reconnect it."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng slapped his forehead, he had really been confused. Xu Yan was going to the Divine Realm, how could the senior not take action for the sake of his disciple going there?</p><p></p><p>"That Blood Disciple 726 is very arrogant and bloodthirsty. Where did these enemies come from? From the looks of it, they want to sacrifice the entire Spirit Realm with blood."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Blood Disciple 726, those blood slaves were also extremely strong. Although not as powerful as that Condensed Law Celestial Venerable, they must be at the level of Condensed Law Celestial Venerables.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Spirit Realm, apart from the few in Changqing Pavilion, no one could match them.</p><p></p><p>If Blood Disciple 726 really succeeded, the Spirit Realm would surely become a land of blood, truly as they said, from now on the Spirit Realm would be the Blood Realm! A realm for nourishing essence blood!</p><p></p><p>The Ice State Heavenly Cave had brought great calamity to Cloud State and Great Marsh State, but the disaster brought by the Netherworld Prison Blood Disciples from this Azure Sea Abyss Heavenly Cave was even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However, because powerful experts were present, the Netherworld Prison Blood Disciples were destined to fail.</p><p></p><p>"Such dense blood energy, these blood slaves are like blood storage tanks. If refined, they would become pills that greatly nourish blood and flesh!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The bloodthirsty qi rolled over, already reaching the shores of Rainbow State. The strong cultivators of the Spirit Realm felt a sense of suffocation, inexplicable fear arising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The blood light seemed to symbolize great calamity, sweeping towards Rainbow State, wanting to engulf the entire Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the azure sea, blood-red figures wielding blood-red long sabers came killing.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's expression was solemn, Xin Mengrou's brows were also furrowed. Including the Thousand Martial Palace Master and other powerful experts, they all recalled the Blood Demon Calamity from before.</p><p></p><p>The Blood God Cult disciples had also surged with bloodthirsty qi like this.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blood God Cult disciples were far inferior to these blood slaves, lacking such intense bloodthirsty qi, and their entire bodies were not dyed blood-red as if soaked in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan thought of the small booklet left by Blood Spirit Child. He was almost certain that Blood Spirit Child's strength back then would not have been weaker than these blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>It was only because he was unwilling to be controlled by others that he weakened his strength to erase his remnant soul. Even so, he still caused the Blood Demon Calamity in the Spirit Realm, sacrificing sects, clans and cities with blood.</p><p></p><p>One blood demon had caused such a huge disaster for the Spirit Realm. These blood slaves before them were not something the Spirit Realm could resist at all. Without powerful experts intervening, the Spirit Realm would surely perish, and cultivators would be sacrificed with blood!</p><p></p><p>"Blood food, wonderful blood food. Those with ambition, join my Netherworld Prison and enjoy the wonder of blood sacrifice together!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726's voice seemed to carry a bewitching tone.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go meet him!" Xu Yan said with high fighting spirit atop Changqing Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through to the Miraculous Realm, he could finally display the power of miracles.</p><p></p><p>Although Blood Disciple 726 was very strong, Xu Yan was not afraid at all. He wanted to truly challenge enemies stronger than himself.</p><p></p><p>Taking a step forward, Xu Yan instantly vanished from the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go meet these blood slaves." Meng Chong rubbed his bald head with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too!" Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>It was finally time to show their might.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go play around too." Su Lingxiu muttered.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained sitting calmly in his chair, but his gaze was fixed on Xu Yan, paying attention to his battle with Blood Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726 could even slay True Kings, their strength far exceeded what Xu Yan could handle at his current stage.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan's Yin-Yang Undying Sword Miracle was extremely powerful. As long as Blood Disciple 726 couldn't break through this miracle in one strike, they wouldn't be able to cause substantial harm to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>This was also Xu Yan's confidence in challenging stronger opponents.</p><p></p><p>Even if the opponent was twice as strong as him, Xu Yan had the confidence to remain undefeated, relying on the Yin-Yang Undying Sword Miracle!</p><p></p><p>"This is good too. Xu Yan's opponents have always been weaker than him. Now truly battling enemies stronger than himself will help him comprehend the martial dao and miracles, helping to increase his strength."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to the gains from Xu Yan's battle.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple was indeed stronger than Xu Yan, so Li Xuan didn't dare to be careless. He paid close attention, ready to intervene and crush the 726 Blood Disciple at any moment if Xu Yan was in danger.</p><p></p><p>Above the azure sea, the 726 Blood Disciple's body emanated a bloody aura. With a crimson long blade resting on his shoulder, he strode across the waves, step by step towards Hong Province.</p><p></p><p>A powerful oppressive force surged towards Hong Province. He wanted to make the strong cultivators of the Spirit Realm kneel and beg for mercy under this pressure, to kneel and submit! The Blood Slave's speed was not actually fast - his purpose was to create psychological pressure on the Spirit Realm cultivators and break down their mental defenses.</p><p></p><p>The powerful bloody aura and rolling blood light reflected on the waves, as if turning the azure sea into a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure appeared. A young man stood holding a sword, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple frowned, looking at Xu Yan in surprise. This youth had appeared silently and instantly. Especially the other's aura was somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Kid, you have good talent. You can be the head of the Blood Slaves. This is your honor. Kneel down and receive the blessing!" the 726 Blood Disciple said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan was extraordinary, his strength was far inferior to his own.</p><p></p><p>"726 Blood Disciple? I've come to challenge you. If you want to sacrifice the Spirit Realm, you'll have to get past me first. Remember this - I am the Sword God Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Immortal Sword instantly appeared, circling around his body, endlessly cycling and indestructible.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple's crimson eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty light! He raised his crimson long blade, his aura exploding, revealing his powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>"An ant dares to block the way!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple slashed down with his blade. The crimson blade light seemed as if it would split the heavens and earth in two.</p><p></p><p>In Hong Province, all the powerful cultivators of the Spirit Realm were shocked.</p><p></p><p>The expert hadn't made a move, but Xu Yan had? That person had shattered the God Bridge and killed Celestial Venerables, yet Xu Yan dared to directly challenge him?</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was also shocked. Had Xu Yan become this powerful in such a short time?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged as he slashed down with his sword! Technique: Absolute Heaven-Severing Sword! In an instant, a black sword light seemed to descend from the sky, as if to extinguish heaven and earth, to extinguish everything! As this sword strike came out, the 726 Blood Disciple's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword technique was this? It was so terrifying that if the opponent's strength was one level higher, he absolutely wouldn't be able to withstand this strike!</p><p></p><p>"You're too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blood-colored blade light slashed out.</p><p></p><p>"So strong! What kind of sword technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but it's unheard of. As expected of the expert's personal disciple!"</p><p></p><p>All the powerful cultivators of the Spirit Realm were shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, the 726 Blood Disciple's slash was even stronger. The bloodthirsty blade light split open the black sword light and slashed directly towards Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Not good, Xu Yan is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the other strong cultivators instinctively looked towards Changqing Pavilion. The expert should intervene to save him, right? But a shocking scene appeared before them.</p><p></p><p>That crimson blade light, as it slashed in front of Xu Yan, seemed to turn in a circle. The crimson blade light actually counterattacked back.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple was also startled.</p><p></p><p>He had fought countless battles and killed countless martial artists. The name of the 726 Blood Disciple was earned through killing his way up.</p><p></p><p>However, such a strange martial technique that could return his own attack was something he had never encountered before! Boom! The 726 Blood Disciple slashed out with his blade to defend against this strike, then said in a deep voice, "What martial technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a divine ability!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt the pressure. Although that slash hadn't broken through the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword, it gave him a heavy burden, as if the Yin-Yang Immortal Sword would collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"So strong!"</p><p></p><p>The more it was like this, the more Xu Yan's fighting spirit rose. Finally, he had a chance to truly fight a stronger opponent across realms.</p><p></p><p>"Divine ability?"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple frowned. What was a divine ability? Before he could ask further, Xu Yan struck out with his palm. A golden giant dragon roared out, unleashing a terrifying dragon's roar. The might of the true dragon's roar came crashing down with overwhelming force.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: True Dragon's Fury! At this moment, Xu Yan didn't dare to be careless. He unleashed his full strength, a faint glow emanating from his body, with vague images of mountains and rivers appearing.</p><p></p><p>He deployed all his martial techniques - Sword of Mountains and Rivers, Yin-Yang Immortal Sword, Absolute Heaven-Severing Sword, True Dragon's Fury and other divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple grew more alarmed as the battle went on. Although his strength was greater than his opponent's, he was unable to break through that endlessly cycling, marvelously profound sword light.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, every attack would be countered back by his opponent.</p><p></p><p>Although each strike made his opponent's body shake and the sword light flicker, as if it would collapse at any moment, it still defended with incredible toughness.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Disciple wanted to unleash killing moves in succession to shatter that marvelous sword wheel in one go. However, after each of his attacks, Xu Yan's form would instantly disappear and transfer to another position, never giving him the chance to attack the sword wheel continuously.</p><p></p><p>For a time, the battle was in a stalemate. Although Xu Yan was at a disadvantage, he remained undefeated.</p><p></p><p>"How could the Spirit Realm have such a powerful cultivator? Could it be that the God Realm already knew of my plans? Impossible, absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The 726's heart shook with rage. He let out a roar, and the blood light became even denser! The battlefield was covered in a bloody aura and enveloped in blood light. Cold and bloodthirsty power poured out continuously, wanting to grind Xu Yan down.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's Yin-Yang Immortal Sword cycled endlessly. Although it flickered unsteadily, as if it would collapse at any moment, it barely managed to withstand, like a small boat rising and falling in stormy waves, about to capsize at any time.</p><p></p><p>"Blood sacrifice the Spirit Realm for me!" the 726 Blood Disciple ordered coldly, his killing intent chilling.</p><p></p><p>The group of Blood Slaves who had already slowed their advance, preparing to return and surround Xu Yan, immediately responded respectfully: "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Their eyes flashing with bloodthirsty killing intent, they looked at the powerful cultivators of Hong Province as if looking at treasures and pounced over.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a huge figure appeared like a descending god, an 18-zhang golden body shrouded in divine waves, majestic and extraordinary!</p><p></p><p>"Blood Slaves? Is the Spirit Realm a place where monsters like you can run wild?" Meng Chong laughed coldly.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A great sun appeared behind his head. He smashed down with a punch, the scorching power of the great sun sweeping out.</p><p></p><p>Wind and thunder turned into a blade, slashing across.</p><p></p><p>He actually fought the group of Blood Slaves alone! He deployed divine abilities and went all out, fighting freely and majestically.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Before the group of Blood Slaves could join forces, the azure sea's shocking waves rose up, forming a strange formation. In an instant, it swept up a portion of the Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>"I am your opponent!" Fang Hao said with a brilliant smile, carrying the Qimen Weapon Box on his back.</p><p></p><p>The weapon box opened, and a torrent of ten thousand swords flew out. Strange weapons flew out one after another, laying down formation after formation.</p><p></p><p>Layered formations of Heaven and Earth Qimen, imbued with the profundity of divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure floated over. In an instant, phantom images appeared all over the azure sea, making it impossible to see where the true body was. Blue flames appeared.</p><p></p><p>With a rumble, it seemed to turn into a huge divine furnace, sweeping up a portion of the Blood Slaves. A terrifying refining power seemed about to refine the Blood Slaves.</p><p></p><p>Divine ability: Divine Furnace Hundred Refinements!</p><p></p><p>In an instant, starlight like needles also appeared between heaven and earth, piercing into a Blood Slave's body. The Blood Slave's life force was being extinguished!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

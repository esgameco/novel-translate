        <h1>Chapter 363</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The sudden turn of events caught everyone by surprise, even Li Xuan was unexpectedly shocked - the Divine Bridge had collapsed, and a True Monarch Celestial was slain, falling on the spot.</p><p></p><p>Although that True Monarch Celestial's strength was not at its peak, he was still a True Monarch Celestial, with strength far exceeding the previous Cultivated Law Celestial. In terms of power, he was even stronger than the Bewitching Witch back then.</p><p></p><p>This shows that the one who struck was no ordinary person in strength.</p><p></p><p>Looking towards the crimson sea, numerous blood-red figures emerged. Li Xuan thought of the small notebook left behind by the Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>"From today onwards, the Spiritual Realm shall be the hunting ground of my Underworld Blood Disciple 726. From today onwards, the Spiritual Realm shall be the Blood Realm. Those with decent talents and strength, if you wish to live, become my blood slaves!</p><p></p><p>"Those who wish to live, kneel and submit immediately!"</p><p></p><p>The cold, ruthless voice echoed.</p><p></p><p>A powerful aura surged up from the azure sea, a blood-red light illuminating the sky. The bloody, murderous qi was so strong that even from a distance, it could be felt oppressively.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others felt heavy in their hearts - the speaker was too powerful! Even from afar, that bloody, murderous qi gave them a terrifying sensation, like an invisible mountain pressing down on their hearts.</p><p></p><p>This person had severed the Divine Bridge and slain a Celestial - their strength far exceeded even the Bewitching Witch of the Ice Cave Celestial Palace. And those blood figures were the blood slaves he mentioned.</p><p></p><p>Underworld Blood Disciple 726? Could the Abyss of the Azure Sea be called the Underworld Celestial Palace? Where did these Underworld Blood Disciples come from?</p><p></p><p>The Divine Bridge has collapsed, surely the powerhouses of the Divine Realm would come to the rescue? </p><p></p><p>"The Azure Flower Realm is currently preoccupied with its own troubles, no one can save you. The Divine Bridge is severed, no one can come. Your fates are in the hands of my Blood Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>"The talentless shall become blood food. Those with talents and strength, become my blood slaves, sacrifice to the Spiritual Realm, and you may have a chance to live.</p><p></p><p>"You can only survive by pledging allegiance to my Underworld!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Disciple 726 resounded, piercing the hearts, seemingly plucking the strings of fear.</p><p></p><p>As 726's voice rang out, the surging blood light seemed to dye the entire Azure Sea a crimson hue, the bloody, murderous qi staining the sky a deep red, even the spiritual energy of heaven and earth tinged with a faint redness.</p><p></p><p>"Is 726 the 726th Blood Disciple, or is it ranked 726 in strength?" Li Xuan mused.</p><p></p><p>726 was clearly the title of this Underworld Blood Disciple, a name of sorts. Whether it was ranked by strength or order was unknown, but Li Xuan leaned towards it being a ranking of strength.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of strength do the top ten Blood Disciples possess? And what lies above the Blood Disciples?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, the Underworld must possess extremely powerful existences.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge is severed, does that mean we can't go to the Divine Realm?" Xie Tianhe said, somewhat unwilling.</p><p></p><p>As for the crimson sea above, the surging blood light did not worry him at all, his only concern was being unable to reach the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Just reconnect it." Xu Yan said nonchalantly.</p><p></p><p>"Reconnect it?" Xie Tianhe's eyes lit up. "Can you reconnect the Divine Bridge?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head, looking at his master. "Master can reconnect it."</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianhe slapped his forehead, how could he have forgotten - with Xu Yan going to the Divine Realm, his master would surely lend a hand to reconnect the bridge.</p><p></p><p>"That Disciple 726 is so arrogant and bloodthirsty, where did this enemy come from? It seems they want to turn the entire Spiritual Realm into a land of blood," Xie Lingfeng frowned.</p><p></p><p>Apart from Disciple 726, those blood slaves were also of Cultivated Law Celestial realm strength, although not as strong as that previous Cultivated Law Celestial.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Spiritual Realm, aside from the few in the Evergreen Pavilion, no one could rival them. If Disciple 726 succeeded, the Spiritual Realm would truly become a land of blood, a domain of blood sacrifice, as he claimed.</p><p></p><p>The calamity brought by the Ice Cave Celestial Palace to Cloud State and Great Marsh State was immense, but the disaster the Underworld Blood Disciples would bring to the Spiritual Realm would be even more terrifying.</p><p></p><p>However, with powerful experts present, the Underworld Blood Disciples were destined to fail.</p><p></p><p>"Such a dense blood aura, these blood slaves are like blood storage tanks. If they could be refined, it would yield great tonics to replenish one's qi and flesh!" Su Lingxiu exclaimed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The bloody, murderous qi surged towards the shores of Rainbow State, the powerful experts of the Spiritual Realm felt a sense of suffocation, an involuntary fear arising in their hearts.</p><p></p><p>The blood light was like an omen of great calamity, sweeping towards Rainbow State, intent on engulfing the entire Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Above the Azure Sea, blood-red figures wielding blood-red long sabers charged forth.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's expression was grave, Xin Mengrao's brows were also furrowed, including the Palace Master of the Thousand Martial Palace, their minds flashing back to the previous Blood Demon calamity.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Sect disciples had also been blood-soaked, but they were nowhere near as potent in bloody, murderous qi as these blood slaves, their bodies not dyed entirely crimson.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan thought of the small notebook left by the Blood Spirit Child - he was almost certain that the Blood Spirit Child's strength was not inferior to these blood slaves. But he was unwilling to be controlled, and to erase his remaining soul, his strength had fallen, yet he still brought the Blood Demon calamity to the Spiritual Realm, sacrificing sects, families, and cities.</p><p></p><p>A single Blood Demon had caused such great disaster in the Spiritual Realm, and these blood slaves were far beyond what the Spiritual Realm could withstand. Without powerful experts intervening, the Spiritual Realm would perish, the cultivators sacrificed as blood food.</p><p></p><p>"Blood food, the wonderful blood food, those with ambition, join my Underworld and enjoy the bliss of blood sacrifice together!"</p><p></p><p>The voice of Disciple 726 seemed to carry a bewitching tone.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go meet him!" Xu Yan's battle spirit soared.</p><p></p><p>After breaking through the Divine Technique Realm, he could finally unleash the full power of his divine techniques.</p><p></p><p>Although Disciple 726 was extremely strong, Xu Yan was not afraid in the least, he wanted to truly challenge an opponent stronger than himself.</p><p></p><p>With a single step, Xu Yan vanished from the airship.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go meet these blood slaves." Meng Chong patted his bald head, a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"I'll go too!" Fang Hao nodded.</p><p></p><p>The time had finally come to display their might.</p><p></p><p>"I'll join in the fun as well." Su Lingxiu murmured.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained seated, his gaze fixed on Xu Yan, focused on his battle against Disciple 726.</p><p></p><p>Disciple 726, who could slay a True Monarch, was far beyond Xu Yan's current capabilities.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan's Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword Technique was extremely powerful, as long as he could not be instantly overwhelmed, Disciple 726 would be unable to truly harm him.</p><p></p><p>This was Xu Yan's confidence in challenging a stronger opponent.</p><p></p><p>Even if the other party was twice as strong, Xu Yan had the assurance of being undefeatable, all thanks to the Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword Technique!</p><p></p><p>"It's good this way, Xu Yan has always faced opponents weaker than him, now truly engaging a stronger enemy will help him comprehend the Dao and his divine techniques, aiding in his cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan eagerly anticipated the harvest from Xu Yan's battle.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave was ultimately stronger than Xu Yan, so Li Xuan dared not be careless and kept a close watch. If Xu Yan was in danger, he would immediately intervene and crush the 726 Blood Slave.</p><p></p><p>Above the azure sea, the 726 Blood Slave emanated a bloody aura, carrying a crimson long saber on his shoulder and stepping on the waves, approaching Rainbow State step by step.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming pressure constantly surged towards Rainbow State, intending to make the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm kneel and submit under this oppression. The speed of the Blood Slaves was not particularly fast, as their purpose was to create psychological pressure for the Spirit Realm experts and break their mental defenses.</p><p></p><p>The powerful bloody aura cast a bloody glow on the rolling waves, making the azure sea appear like a sea of blood.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a figure emerged, a young man standing with a sword, blocking his path.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave furrowed his brows, looking at Xu Yan with surprise. This youth had appeared silently and suddenly, and his aura was somewhat unusual.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, your talent is not bad. You can become the leader of the Blood Slaves, which is an honor for you. Kneel down and receive the blessing!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave spoke in a cold voice.</p><p></p><p>Although Xu Yan was extraordinary, his strength was far inferior to the 726 Blood Slave.</p><p></p><p>"726 Blood Slave? I've come to meet you. If you want to offer a blood sacrifice to the Spirit Realm, you'll have to get past me first. Remember, I am the Sword Immortal Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>The Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword instantly appeared, circling around him, endlessly flowing and inextinguishable.</p><p></p><p>"Seeking death!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave's crimson eyes flashed with a bloodthirsty glow! He raised his crimson long saber, and his powerful strength was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>"Daring to block my way, you insignificant insect!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave slashed down, and the crimson sword light seemed to split the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>In Rainbow State, the powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>The Elders had not intervened, but Xu Yan had? That person was the one who had severed the Divine Bridge and killed a Celestial Venerable. Xu Yan actually dared to directly challenge him?</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan was also greatly shocked. Could it be that in such a short time, Xu Yan had become so powerful?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged as he slashed down with his sword! A divine technique, the Peerless Heavenly Sword! In an instant, a black sword light descended from the sky, seemingly intent on annihilating heaven and earth, annihilating everything!</p><p></p><p>When this sword was unleashed, the 726 Blood Slave's expression tightened.</p><p></p><p>What kind of sword art was this? It was so terrifying. If the opponent's strength was one level higher, this sword would be impossible for him to block!</p><p></p><p>"You are too weak!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! The blood-colored saber light slashed out.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful! What kind of sword art is this?"</p><p></p><p>"I've never heard of such a martial art before. It must be a supreme technique passed down by a great master!"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spirit Realm were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>However, the 726 Blood Slave's slash was even stronger, and the bloodthirsty saber light cut through the black sword light, directly attacking Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>"Oh no, Xu Yan is in danger!"</p><p></p><p>Experts like Wu Tian Nan instinctively looked towards the Long Qing Pavilion, thinking the Elders should intervene and save him. But a shocking scene unfolded before them.</p><p></p><p>That crimson saber light, when it struck in front of Xu Yan, seemed to turn in a circle, and the crimson saber light was actually reflected back.</p><p></p><p>"Impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave was also startled.</p><p></p><p>He had fought and killed countless warriors, and the name "726 Blood Slave" was earned through his bloody path. However, such a mysterious martial art that could reflect his own attack had never been encountered before!</p><p></p><p>Boom! The 726 Blood Slave slashed out again, and after withstanding the blow, he said in a deep voice, "What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p></p><p>"This is a divine technique!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt the pressure, and although that strike had not broken through the Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword, it had still placed a heavy burden on him, as if the sword was about to collapse at any moment.</p><p></p><p>"So powerful!"</p><p></p><p>The more this happened, the more Xu Yan's fighting spirit soared. Finally, he had the opportunity to truly fight against a powerful expert who had broken through the boundaries.</p><p></p><p>"Divine technique?"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave knitted his brows, wondering what a divine technique was. Before he could ask further, Xu Yan slapped out, and a massive golden dragon roared out, unleashing a terrifying dragon's roar, a furious and powerful attack.</p><p></p><p>Divine technique, Furious Dragon! At this moment, Xu Yan did not dare to be careless, fully unleashing his strength, and a faint glow emanated from his body, with the vague silhouette of mountains and rivers appearing.</p><p></p><p>Sword of Mountains and Rivers, Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword, Peerless Heavenly Sword, Furious Dragon, and other divine techniques were all unleashed, fully demonstrating his martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave became more and more shocked as the battle progressed. His strength was superior, yet he was unable to break through the endless and extraordinary sword lights.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, each of his attacks was reflected back at him.</p><p></p><p>Although each strike caused Xu Yan's body to sway, the sword lights flickering as if they were about to collapse, they stubbornly defended against it.</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave wanted to launch a continuous series of attacks to crush the divine sword array, but after each strike, Xu Yan's figure would instantly disappear and reappear in another position, not giving him the opportunity to attack the sword array continuously.</p><p></p><p>The battle was at a stalemate, with Xu Yan clearly at a disadvantage, yet he remained undefeated.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm, how could there be such a powerful expert? Could it be that the Divine Realm already knew of my plan? Impossible, absolutely impossible!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave was furious, and his bloody aura became even more dense. The battlefield was shrouded in a bloody haze, and the cold and bloodthirsty power constantly poured out, intent on annihilating Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's Yin-Yang Inextinguishable Sword continued to circulate endlessly, flickering as if it would collapse at any moment, yet it still managed to withstand the onslaught, like a small boat tossed about in the raging waves, on the verge of capsizing.</p><p></p><p>"Give me the blood sacrifice of the Spirit Realm!"</p><p></p><p>The 726 Blood Slave's killing intent was chilling as he coldly commanded.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Slaves who had previously slowed down their movements, preparing to surround and attack Xu Yan, immediately responded respectfully, "Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Their eyes gleamed with bloodthirsty intent as they charged towards the powerful experts of Rainbow State, as if they were eyeing precious treasures.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, a massive figure descended like a divine deity, an eighteen-zhang golden body, towering amidst the divine waves, majestic and awe-inspiring. "Blood Slaves? The Spirit Realm is not a place for you monsters to run wild!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A massive sun appeared behind him, and he struck down with a powerful fist, the blazing solar force sweeping across.</p><p></p><p>A wind and thunder blade slashed forth.</p><p></p><p>He alone fought against the horde of Blood Slaves, unleashing divine techniques and fighting with all his might, his divine might radiating.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Before the Blood Slaves could even join forces, the azure sea surged, forming a mysterious formation that instantly swept some of the Blood Slaves into it.</p><p></p><p>"Your opponent is me!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao, carrying the Mysterious Armament Chest, revealed a brilliant smile.</p><p></p><p>The chest opened, and a torrent of myriad swords poured out, one mysterious formation after another being deployed.</p><p></p><p>The heavenly and earthly Mysterious Formations were overlaid with divine techniques, becoming even more profound.</p><p></p><p>A graceful figure drifted over, and in an instant, multiple illusions appeared on the azure sea, with the true form nowhere to be seen, and azure flames emerged.</p><p></p><p>Boom, it was as if a massive divine furnace had formed, engulfing some of the Blood Slaves, with a terrifying refining force that seemed intent on refining them.</p><p></p><p>Divine technique, Hundred Refinements of the Divine Furnace!</p><p></p><p>In the heavens and earth, starry needles suddenly appeared, piercing into a Blood Slave, and the Blood Slave's life force began to extinguish.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

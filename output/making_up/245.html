        <h1>Chapter 245</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Three people and a snake gathered together.</p><p></p><p>Yu Xiaolong opened his mouth and kept spitting out storage bags, turning his face green.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family's treasure trove contained many treasures, and in order to clear it out, Yu Xiaolong had swallowed many empty storage bags. When moving the Dai family's treasure trove, he opened his mouth to suck and absorb, not swallowing the items into his stomach, but into the various storage bags.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou was excited, rubbing his hands eagerly, his eyes shining, as if he had found a path to wealth.</p><p></p><p>The Dai family had once been a second-rate aristocratic family, with no shallow foundations, and their treasures were certainly not few.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Shen, this time I must also thank you. Take one-third of the treasures here."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted Shen Haizhou's shoulder and said.</p><p></p><p>He was not a stingy person, and Shen Haizhou had also contributed to the destruction of the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>"That won't do!" </p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou shook his head and said, "I only provided some intelligence, taking one-third is too much, I would feel unworthy."</p><p></p><p>"One-tenth, one-tenth is enough, for me it's an amount I can't even finish."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou raised one finger and said.</p><p></p><p>"Alright then."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan did not insist.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou took one-tenth, and the remaining Xu Yan and Meng Chong didn't bother to count, letting Yu Xiaolong swallow them back in.</p><p></p><p>With so many treasures, they naturally couldn't carry them all on their person, so Xu Yan and Meng Chong planned to go back and hand these items over to their master and junior sister. </p><p></p><p>This way, their junior sister could refine the spiritual herbs into elixirs, and they only needed to carry the elixirs.</p><p></p><p>It was a pity about those spiritual weapons and materials.</p><p></p><p>As for the spiritual weapons in the Dai family's treasure trove, the two of them didn't see anything worth taking, so they didn't pay much attention.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said regretfully, "It's a pity that spiritual weapons can't be changed in size, when I manifest the Six-Zhang Golden Body, I won't have any swords to use."</p><p></p><p>Once he transformed into a six-zhang giant, the swords he had now would be too small to use.</p><p></p><p>However, when he unleashed the Heavenly Earth Dominating Sword, it wouldn't necessarily require a sword.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he had a spiritual sword in hand, the power of his techniques would naturally be even stronger.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou's mouth twitched, a six-zhang giant? What a powerful cultivation method! It completely overturned his understanding of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Realm, I've never heard of being able to freely change the size of spiritual weapons."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou shook his head and said.</p><p></p><p>Then he excitedly said, "Brother Xu, Brother Meng, the Shu family has a spiritual ore vein with an astounding amount of spirit crystals. How about we take it down and give the Shu family a little warning!"</p><p></p><p>"A spiritual ore vein, that's not easy to dig up, we won't be able to clear it out in a short time," Xu Yan frowned slightly.</p><p></p><p>The Shu family was also an enemy, as long as he could cause them heavy losses, Xu Yan didn't mind taking action.</p><p></p><p>However, spiritual ores were difficult to dig out in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou said mysteriously, "I know someone who has a third-rank Swallowing Mountain Toad. With the Swallowing Mountain Toad's ability, swallowing half the spiritual ore vein would be no problem."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, "Reliable?"</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, don't worry, it's absolutely reliable," Shen Haizhou assured, thumping his chest.</p><p></p><p>"The Shu family has certainly strengthened their defenses now, so there's no need to rush. You go and investigate first, find an appropriate opportunity before making a move."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered for a moment and said.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, leave it to me," Shen Haizhou said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>After agreeing on a way to stay in contact, Xu Yan, Meng Chong, and Shen Haizhou left their hiding place, changing their appearances to avoid pursuit by the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong even wore a wig.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Success!" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao wiped the sweat from his brow, looking at the circular disc in his hand with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"This money is really hard to earn!"</p><p></p><p>The last one was the main disc, the other eight were auxiliary discs that could be combined with the main disc.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao inserted the eight small auxiliary discs one by one into the main disc.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder what miraculous uses this thing has? That mysterious pattern seems to be one of disorientation and confusion?"</p><p></p><p>After pondering for a moment, Fang Hao was eager to try it out.</p><p></p><p>But he was also worried that the treasure he had forged might have uncontrollable or unknown dangers.</p><p></p><p>He looked towards the well in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, come out!"</p><p></p><p>A gray toad jumped out of the well and squatted on the ground, looking at him.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>Its lively eyes stared at Fang Hao, opening its mouth and croaking softly.</p><p></p><p>"Wait, I'm going to try this treasure. If anything uncontrollable happens, you swallow this auxiliary disc, understand?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took out one of the auxiliary discs and instructed Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>If this auxiliary disc was swallowed, the entire treasure set would lose its balance and have a flaw.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>Little Ha nodded.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a deep breath, his expression solemn. He felt that he might have forged something extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>He placed the auxiliary disc in front of Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>Holding the main disc, he input power into it, and with a hum, the seven smaller auxiliary discs inside the main disc suddenly flew out and landed in seven different places.</p><p></p><p>Hum! In an instant, the courtyard seemed to disappear, yet also not disappear.</p><p></p><p>The houses seemed to have changed positions, and even the well appeared to have moved.</p><p></p><p>The familiar courtyard now seemed disoriented, to the point that Fang Hao himself couldn't tell where the houses or the well were.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the spot where Little Ha had been squatting, he saw the forging furnace.</p><p></p><p>"That's not right, how is the forging furnace there?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was greatly shocked. What kind of treasure was this? Why did it have such an effect? He tried to take a few steps forward, but found himself lost in the courtyard, unable to find his direction.</p><p></p><p>Lowering his gaze to the main disc, he took a deep breath, and a formation diagram appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>"This is controllable, the main disc is in my hand, I should be able to control it."</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, swallow the disc."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao gave the order.</p><p></p><p>However, he did not receive a response.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's heart sank, could something have happened to Little Ha?</p><p></p><p>"No, this disc shouldn't have any attack power, it only has the ability to disorient and confuse. Perhaps Little Ha simply can't hear my voice."</p><p></p><p>Taking a deep breath, Fang Hao stepped out, but suddenly stopped.</p><p></p><p>In front of him was a well, and a toad squatting on the ground, its lively eyes staring at the disc on the ground, waiting obediently.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao called out softly, but received no response.</p><p></p><p>He gently kicked the toad with his foot, but it was not soft, but hard.</p><p></p><p>"Is it a stone or a discarded treasure?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>He shook his head and stared wide-eyed, and what he saw was clearly Little Ha.</p><p></p><p>"Why is this happening?"</p><p></p><p>This treasure was extraordinary! Fang Hao's heart raced as he remembered Li Xuan's words - if he could forge it, it would be an opportunity to change his fate. "Change my fate!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a deep breath, gently closing his eyes, and the formation diagram appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The main disc was in his hand, but even though he stopped inputting power, the strange scene had not disappeared. He was searching for how to stop the power of the treasure.</p><p></p><p>The formation diagram flashed through Fang Hao's mind, each formation line appearing one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Here it is!"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, Fang Hao opened his eyes, his expression excited.</p><p></p><p>He had finally found how to stop it.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The treasure artifact. Raising his hand, his finger pointed to a place where the patterns on the main plate were intertwined, and power surged into it.</p><p></p><p>The little Ha at his feet was a discarded treasure artifact.</p><p></p><p>The buildings in the courtyard were still in their original positions, and the familiar scenery appeared before his eyes.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's heart was trembling, this treasure artifact was too magical, what kind of pattern was this?</p><p></p><p>He hurriedly looked towards where little Ha was.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a terrified frog's cry came.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, this is my frog!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>Standing by the well, reaching out to grab the person who had been startled and jumped up, wasn't that the big brother?</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>When Fang Hao successfully refined the array plate, Li Xuan, who was sitting in the chair, leisurely studying the Tai Cang Book, suddenly saw the Great Dao Golden Book open.</p><p></p><p>"Your candidate disciple Fang Hao has refined the Bewildering Reversal Array Array Plate, you are proficient in the Bewildering Reversal Array + Array Plate refining method."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had actually refined the array plate.</p><p></p><p>This was a little faster than he had expected.</p><p></p><p>"Candidate disciple, so only feedback the Bewildering Reversal Array, and not the entire basic array Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also had a deeper understanding of the feedback from the Great Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>Immediately stepping out, in an instant, he arrived in Fang Hao's small courtyard.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Hao was preparing to try the array plate.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently watched.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Hao activated the array plate and the Bewildering Reversal Array was triggered, Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this formation, although only a small formation, and the layout was rough.</p><p></p><p>But it was also extremely extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary cultivated celestial beings, if their divine souls swept over, if they were not careful, they would not be able to detect any abnormalities.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this is also because of the way of the array, which has never appeared in the Spirit Realm, so even a rough array can evade the divine souls of the cultivated celestial beings.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Swallow Mountain Toad?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a few steps and came to the little Ha, looking at this toad, its eyes were lively and its intelligence was not low.</p><p></p><p>"A third-stage Swallow Mountain Toad, it seems to have reached its peak?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also understood the Swallow Mountain Toad, after all, it was the main material for refining the storage bag, and when the Swallow Mountain Toad reached the third stage, it was almost at its peak.</p><p></p><p>It was difficult to advance further.</p><p></p><p>Fourth-stage Swallow Mountain Toads had hardly appeared in history.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao actually raised a Swallow Mountain Toad, and it was a Swallow Mountain Toad with high intelligence, which was truly rare.</p><p></p><p>After all, the intelligence of Swallow Mountain Toads was not high, they were just more clever and better at avoiding danger than ordinary frogs.</p><p></p><p>The storage bags in the Spirit Realm were mostly made by raising Swallow Mountain Toads, and they were used for refining after reaching the first stage.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was watching little Ha while waiting for Fang Hao, wondering how long it would take for him to understand the formation and deactivate the activated Bewildering Reversal Array.</p><p></p><p>In less than a quarter of an hour, Fang Hao had already grasped the key to the formation and deactivated the array.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan showed a smile, this fourth disciple was him! Little Ha was originally squatting and watching the array plate, in its eyes, Fang Hao had been tinkering with the array plate, and there was no abnormality at all.</p><p></p><p>But suddenly, a stranger appeared.</p><p></p><p>It was frightened immediately.</p><p></p><p>The Swallow Mountain Toad would be used to refine the storage bag if it was caught.</p><p></p><p>It was so frightened that it let out a cry and jumped up, ready to escape.</p><p></p><p>A hand grabbed it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao ran over, his face full of tension, and said, "Big brother, this is my pet, I won't sell it!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and put down little Ha. "A third-stage Swallow Mountain Toad is indeed rare, especially one with high intelligence. If all Swallow Mountain Toads had this intelligence and could be commanded, most warriors would probably keep one by their side.</p><p></p><p>"Instead of using Swallow Mountain Toads to refine storage bags."</p><p></p><p>Swallow Mountain Toads could not be commanded because they could not understand orders, and could not be kept by their side, so they were refined into storage bags.</p><p></p><p>But this little Ha was an exception.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha was a little panicked, hopping onto Fang Hao's shoulder, clinging tightly to his neck, its lively eyes warily watching Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha is indeed a bit special..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao let out a sigh of relief, reaching up to stroke little Ha and introduce the origin of this Swallow Mountain Toad.</p><p></p><p>It was Fang Hao's father who accidentally caught it in a stone cave, originally planning to sell it or entrust someone to refine it into a storage bag.</p><p></p><p>The young Fang Hao saw that little Ha's eyes were lively and seemed to have spirituality, so he asked his father to let him keep little Ha as a pet, and so it remained.</p><p></p><p>After these years of feeding, little Ha had risen to the third stage.</p><p></p><p>But it had also reached its peak.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, I have forged the thing you wanted."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao pressed his palm on the main plate, and the scattered secondary plates flew back and merged into the main plate in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Big brother, what is this..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had a curious look on his face.</p><p></p><p>"You refined an array plate, this is the Bewildering Reversal Array, the pattern I gave you is the array diagram of the Bewildering Reversal Array..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Array formation? Bewildering Reversal Array?" </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was greatly shocked in his heart, he had never heard of such an array formation! "Big brother..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan interrupted him and said, "You shouldn't call me big brother, I see you have great talent, our meeting is fate, I have a unique martial art here..."</p><p></p><p>Boom! Fang Hao didn't wait for him to finish, he knelt down with a thud.</p><p></p><p>"Disciple Fang Hao pays respects to the master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was excited, his face flushed with excitement, kowtowing on the ground.</p><p></p><p>The little Ha on his shoulder also squatted on the ground, imitating the kowtowing.</p><p></p><p>"Rise."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction.</p><p></p><p>He liked people like Fang Hao who were quick-witted and knew how to seize opportunities!</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao excitedly stood up.</p><p></p><p>"From today on, you are my fourth disciple, above you there is one senior sister and two senior brothers."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly, "My rules are not many, you will know them when you meet your eldest senior brother. Tomorrow you will move to the place where I temporarily reside.</p><p></p><p>"You can pack up now."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao respectfully replied.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is this Unique Martial Art, why have I never heard of it?"</p><p></p><p>He then asked excitedly and curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This is a unique martial art of mine, encompassing forging, array formations, and prohibitions. I will teach you tomorrow, hope you can study it diligently and not let me down!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was greatly shocked in his heart, such a mysterious array formation was just one of the Unique Martial Arts?</p><p></p><p>This Unique Martial Art must be incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will prepare to move now, and follow the master to cultivate the Unique Martial Art tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I'll come back for you tomorrow."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took the Bewildering Reversal Array and nodded, then disappeared from the spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao needed some time to handle some miscellaneous matters, so Li Xuan did not take him back immediately.</p><p></p><p>"I should leave a message for Shen Dasha, my opportunity has come, I have taken a master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao thought excitedly.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

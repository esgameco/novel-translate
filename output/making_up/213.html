        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched as Shi Er hung a gold chain around the neck of the Red Cat, and the corner of his mouth twitched. What a sin! Earlier, he had said that he knew some beast-taming techniques.</p><p></p><p>After taming the Red Cat for some time, it seems the Red Cat has now retaliated against Shi Er, right? Li Xuan didn't bother with these matters. The Red Cat and Shi Er still have feelings for each other, so it's just Shi Er being tormented a bit, it won't really do anything to him.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat, with your large body size, you're perfect for doing hard labor!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head as he said this.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat let out a few grunts, looking a bit depressed. Its huge body size means that in the future when they move, it will have to carry a pile of things again.</p><p></p><p>"Great demon, be adaptable in size, conceal your tracks. You must comprehend this well."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan instructed the Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat nodded, indicating it understood. </p><p></p><p>This nod caused Shi Er, who was hanging the gold chain on its neck, to be knocked down.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Seeing Shi Er fall to the ground unexpectedly, Li Xuan simply pretended not to see it. Shi Er and the Red Cat are just a pair of enemies.</p><p></p><p>"Red Cat!" </p><p></p><p>Shi Er's face turned green.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat had an innocent expression.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the Red Cat is really big, like a small mountain. If we stewed it, we could eat for a long time, right?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came over, muttering in admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was frightened and lowered its head, sticking out its tongue, looking very obsequious.</p><p></p><p>"You're really timid. I wasn't really going to stew you!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan laughed.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat's tail swayed as it stuck out its tongue, acting like a dog desperately trying to curry favor with Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was at a loss for words. </p><p></p><p>This Red Cat was indeed a bit timid.</p><p></p><p>On Canglan Island, it was calm and peaceful. The Red Cat was in the final stage of its transformation.</p><p></p><p>As for Su Ling Xiu, she had already begun to break through to the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has cultivated the Pill Medicinal Martial Dao you created, and has broken through to the Tong Xuan Realm. Your Pill Medicinal Martial Dao has reached the great perfection of the Tong Xuan Realm, with strength a hundredfold of those at the same realm."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Dao opened on the Spiritual Platform, and golden light emerged.</p><p></p><p>The Pill Medicinal Martial Dao had also advanced to the great perfection of the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Its strength had further increased.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu was consolidating her breakthrough, continuing to comprehend the wonders of the Tong Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also cultivating the Sword Dao, especially enhancing the power of the Xun Wind Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>Outside Canglan Island, a major event that shook the Inner Domain suddenly erupted.</p><p></p><p>The seven garrison cities of the Great Yue Kingdom suddenly rebelled! The Tian Yi Guard and the Shen Ji Army were besieged in the Zheng Hou Wang's Mansion, and in the moment they were annihilated, the other four Marquis Wangs, led by the Du Hou Wang, suddenly struck.</p><p></p><p>The Tian Yi Guard and Shen Ji Army were trapped, and the Great Yue Emperor was furious, dispatching the Tian Yu Guard and the imperial court's peak Grandmaster Cultivators to suppress the four Marquis Wangs.</p><p></p><p>Even though the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court had declined, its foundation was still not to be underestimated.</p><p></p><p>However, at this moment, all the prefectures of the Great Yue Kingdom suddenly rebelled! </p><p></p><p>The aristocratic families of the Great Yue Kingdom announced that they no longer supported the Great Yue imperial court, and one high-ranking official after another in the capital rebelled, leading experts to attack the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>What angered the Great Yue Emperor even more was that there were also traitors rebelling within the imperial palace!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Great Yue imperial court was undoubtedly in a state of power vacuum.</p><p></p><p>Although the Great Yue Kingdom had become the foremost of the three great nations in the Inner Domain, its strength and foundation were naturally not to be underestimated. Although they were caught off guard and their elites were mostly dispatched, and more than half of the high-ranking officials in the capital had rebelled, the foundation of the Great Yue imperial court was still revealed at this moment.</p><p></p><p>In the imperial court, there were still loyal high-ranking officials of the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court. At this moment, they led experts to come to the aid, and one imperial court cultivator after another walked out of the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>The peak Grandmaster Cultivators surged with momentum, and there was even an old prince whose aura was majestic, surpassing the peak Grandmaster Cultivators and approaching the realm of Half-Step Celestial Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Unexpectedly, this old prince would soon become the Great Yue Kingdom's imperial court's pillar of the nation, a Half-Step Celestial Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The rebelling group of high-ranking officials had their momentum instantly suppressed and began to fall into a disadvantageous position, about to be crushed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Just then, a sword light flashed across, tyrannical and unmatched, slaying that old prince who was almost a Half-Step Celestial Cultivator with a single stroke!</p><p></p><p>The sword light did not stop, and after slaying the old prince, it continued to slay two peak Grandmaster Cultivators!</p><p></p><p>The originally confident Great Yue Emperor's expression changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>His heart sank to the bottom. The scene he had feared the most had finally arrived.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's appearance meant that this rebellion was being masterminded by the Long Qing Chamber, or rather, the Great Wasteland was taking over!</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland wanted to replace the Great Yue Kingdom!</p><p></p><p>"Kill!" </p><p></p><p>A Great Yue Kingdom general roared, brandishing his long spear and suddenly turning around, charging towards the Great Yue Emperor.</p><p></p><p>"Incompetent Great Yue Emperor, it's time to abdicate. The Great Yue is decaying, the Great Wasteland shall rise!"</p><p></p><p>"Restore the rightful order of heaven and earth, the Great Wasteland shall rise!"</p><p></p><p>Amid the shouts of the originally Great Yue Kingdom's high-ranking officials, the Great Yue imperial court retreated step by step. Seeing the situation turn unfavorable, the officials one by one turned against the imperial court and joined the rebel army.</p><p></p><p>On this day, the Inner Domain was shaken.</p><p></p><p>After thousands of years of establishment, with a deep foundation, the Great Yue Kingdom, the strongest of the three great nations, had collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland was officially established!</p><p></p><p>From now on, there would be no more Great Yue in the Inner Domain, only the Great Wasteland!</p><p></p><p>The slogan "Restore the rightful order of heaven and earth, the Great Wasteland shall rise" also spread.</p><p></p><p>Cultivators of the Great Wasteland Martial Dao expressed their support one after another!</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the major forces in the Inner Domain turned their eyes to the Yan Kingdom and the Purple Cloud Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The Great Wasteland was shining brightly, with the prospect of once again unifying the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>After replacing the Great Yue Kingdom, the Great Wasteland did not take further action, but instead focused on consolidating and stabilizing the Great Wasteland, pacifying the hearts of the Great Wasteland people, and freely spreading the Great Wasteland Martial Dao techniques.</p><p></p><p>The Transcendence Techniques also began to be passed on to the Grandmaster Cultivators who had joined the Great Wasteland.</p><p></p><p>The various major forces within the former Great Yue Kingdom borders voluntarily went to the Great Wasteland to register their sects.</p><p></p><p>The names of the two Great Wasteland Emperors also spread.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the Great Wasteland Cabinet was the one truly in charge of Great Wasteland affairs. The Cabinet Elders needed to be appointed by the two Emperors, but it was just a formality.</p><p></p><p>Many major forces knew that a major change was about to take place in the Inner Domain.</p><p></p><p>They also needed to consider how their own forces could be passed on.</p><p></p><p>The martial dao of the Inner Domain had currently reached the limit of the Half-Step Celestial Cultivator realm. To break through the martial dao to the Celestial Cultivator realm, one needed to enter the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, what the Spiritual Realm was like, no one knew.</p><p></p><p>After enjoying the treatment of the strong in the Inner Domain, to fall to the bottom tier in the Spiritual Realm, or even have to strive for Celestial Cultivator realm cultivation methods, was too great a gap for the Inner Domain's strong experts.</p><p></p><p>But the Great Wasteland Martial Dao did not have this limitation, and one could directly cultivate to a realm equivalent to the Celestial Cultivator.</p><p></p><p>This was a huge attraction.</p><p></p><p>The major forces in the Inner Domain were all considering their own path forward, while also paying attention to the movements of the Yan Kingdom and the Purple Cloud Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil outside did not affect Canglan Island.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had returned.</p><p></p><p>"For the disciples who have cultivated the introductory Great Wasteland Martial Dao reaching one thousand people, you will obtain the Thousand Martial Spirit Shadows."</p><p></p><p>The Golden Book of the Dao opened, and golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Spirit Shadows!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's heart was already unperturbed. This was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Contrary to his expectations, the Great Desolate martial artists were now experiencing explosive growth, with some coming from the inner domain martial arts to cultivate the Great Desolate way.</p><p></p><p>The fusion of the Thousand Divine Shadows granted them the power to penetrate the mysteries.</p><p></p><p>In the coming period, the number of Divine Shadows would rapidly increase, as more and more people were turning to cultivate the Great Desolate martial arts, which had become a trend.</p><p></p><p>Especially in the Great Desolate region, almost everyone was switching to cultivate the martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The demand for medicinal pills would naturally be immense.</p><p></p><p>To this end, the Pill Refinement Halls were repeatedly expanded, and many apprentice pill refiners were recruited.</p><p></p><p>The number of Pill Refinement Halls on Canglan Island had been reduced, with only the elite apprentices of the Changqing Pavilion remaining, all preparing to become pill refiners.</p><p></p><p>They all possessed a certain talent in the martial dao of pill refining. Suling Xiu had already begun to pass on his knowledge of the martial dao of pill refining to them. Of course, for those lacking in the talent for the medical dao, they would turn to cultivate the art of pill refining instead.</p><p></p><p>"It takes three cultivators to gain a Divine Shadow, is it because their cultivation of the Great Desolate martial arts is not pure enough?" Li Xuan discovered a problem.</p><p></p><p>For inner domain martial artists who switched to cultivate the Great Desolate martial arts, it took three successful cultivators to gain one Divine Shadow. For master-level martial artists who switched, it took five successful cultivators to gain one Divine Shadow. This should be due to the impurity of the cultivators' practices.</p><p></p><p>However, there were so many inner domain martial artists that even if only one out of a hundred who switched to the Great Desolate martial arts succeeded, the total number of Divine Shadows they could contribute would still be staggeringly large.</p><p></p><p>Around Canglan Island and on the Cangjiang River, there were occasionally small boats drifting, but no one could be seen - these were Li Xuan's Divine Shadows, wandering and playing on the water.</p><p></p><p>It was no exaggeration to say that even the most skilled in stealth and concealment would be unable to hide from Li Xuan's Divine Shadows on Canglan Island, as they would be detected before even approaching.</p><p></p><p>Atop the mountain peaks of Canglan Island, Li Xuan was casually playing with a jade talisman, gazing out at the vast Cangjiang River. Meng Chong stood respectfully and excitedly behind him.</p><p></p><p>"You have already broken through to the Penetrating the Mysteries realm, and the cultivation of the Great Sun Golden Body is now without any obstacles. It is only a matter of time before you perfect it," Li Xuan said slowly.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong listened respectfully.</p><p></p><p>His master was about to pass on the techniques beyond the Great Sun Golden Body.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao of the physical body, on top of the physical body, the profundity of the Great Sun Golden Body, I believe you have already experienced. As for the power of the Three-Zhang Golden Body, you also have a grasp of it."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice was gentle.</p><p></p><p>"I still lack some understanding of the wonders of the Great Sun Golden Body, and I am constantly researching and exploring the methods of the Great Sun Golden Body to enhance my own strength, especially in the application of the Three-Zhang Golden Body," Meng Chong replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Very good! The martial dao is boundless, and one should have the heart to explore and seek the true essence," Li Xuan nodded approvingly.</p><p></p><p>He was fully aware of Meng Chong's progress, especially in the application of the Great Sun Golden Body, as its enhancement would also benefit him.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I shall pass on to you the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body!" Li Xuan turned around, his expression solemn as he looked at his disciple.</p><p></p><p>"I will diligently cultivate and strive to comprehend it as soon as possible," Meng Chong said excitedly as he bowed.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Penetrating the Mysteries realm is the Realm of the Divine Will. Although the martial dao of the physical body also refines the Divine Will, it is different from the pure martial dao. The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body has three layers. The first layer corresponds to the Realm of the Divine Will. Upon successful cultivation, you will obtain the first layer of the Indestructible Golden Body's profundity - the Indestructible Divine Armor!"</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body had three layers, with the first layer corresponding to the Realm of the Divine Will. Once cultivated successfully, it would grant the practitioner the profundity of the first layer - the Indestructible Divine Armor.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Divine Armor would defend both the physical body and the spiritual consciousness, providing all-encompassing protection. Even if the armor was instantly shattered, the physical body would still possess formidable defensive power, as if an additional layer of defense had been added.</p><p></p><p>To injure the Indestructible Golden Body, the enemy would need to not only break through the Indestructible Divine Armor but also possess the power to overcome the physical body's defenses. As long as they could not completely overwhelm the Divine Armor and the physical body in a single strike, the Indestructible Divine Armor would instantly regenerate, continuing its all-encompassing defense.</p><p></p><p>Unless the enemy could completely shatter the Indestructible Golden Body in a single blow, the Indestructible Divine Armor would never disappear. This was the essence of "indestructibility."</p><p></p><p>"The Indestructible Divine Armor, while primarily for self-defense, is not limited to that. The profundities within, you shall explore them yourself once you have cultivated the Indestructible Golden Body," Li Xuan did not define the Indestructible Divine Armor's abilities, leaving room for Meng Chong to discover its other potential uses.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Meng Chong was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Indestructible Golden Body sounded incredibly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Listen carefully, the methods of the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body have three layers, all of which I shall impart to you now..." Li Xuan slowly and meticulously explained the complete Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body technique to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>If Meng Chong could comprehend all three layers at once, he would be able to directly ascend to the third layer of the Indestructible Golden Body, with strength powerful enough to crush Transcendent Celestials with a single punch. However, Li Xuan did not believe Meng Chong would be able to comprehend all three layers immediately.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, if Meng Chong could break through to the first layer of the Indestructible Golden Body, he should be able to quickly comprehend the remaining two layers.</p><p></p><p>After imparting the Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body technique to Meng Chong, Li Xuan sat down and began contemplating the martial dao realms and techniques beyond the Realm of the Divine Will.</p><p></p><p>The Great Sun Indestructible Golden Body was incredibly powerful, fully revealing the might of the martial dao of the physical body. Once Meng Chong broke through, his strength would approach that of Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's martial dao was the purest, but it did not mean his physical body was weak. His jade-like foundation, spiritual bones, and spiritual body were all extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at his own Sword Intent, which had been constantly changing and strengthening in recent times, indicating that Xu Yan had gained new insights.</p><p></p><p>His strength had increased again in a short period. The Three Profound Mountains Sword Intent was no longer the same as it was initially, with its fierce and destructive power capable of destroying all.</p><p></p><p>The Gentle Wind Sword Intent was also improving, interweaving with the Three Profound Mountains Sword Intent to enhance its killing power, capable of annihilating both the physical body and the spiritual soul with a single sword strike. "Xu Yan's Heart Sword Realm has reached great mastery, and he seems to be contemplating how to cultivate the Heart Sword Realm. Once he comprehends it, my sword dao realm will break through to the Heart Sword Realm."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Heart Sword Realm, where mountains become swords, waters become swords, and all things in heaven and earth can be used as swords - what an incredibly profound and powerful sword dao!</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong's blade dao cultivation has fallen a bit behind, I should give him some guidance."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>While Xu Yan was continuously improving in the sword dao, Meng Chong's progress had been relatively average.</p><p></p><p>He had only just reached the initial stage of the Blade Soul.</p><p></p><p>He was still far from the Concealed Blade Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even if he could not cultivate to the Concealed Blade Realm, he should at least comprehend how to cultivate to that realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan decided to use the Great Dao Golden Book to further refine the Concealed Blade Realm, reducing the difficulty of comprehension, in the hope that Meng Chong could comprehend it sooner.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, a thunderous roar echoed across Canglan Island, causing the entire island to tremble.</p><p></p><p>Crash! Some trees were instantly shattered, and a powerful aura appeared.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 468</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>There must be a reason for this.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the old man describe the realm above the Immortal realm, he realized that this old man's strength was likely extremely powerful. Could he be a Divine Venerable expert? "So elder is a Divine Venerable expert, this junior has been disrespectful!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Divine Venerable, hehe!" The old man chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask how to address elder?" Wu Tiannan asked respectfully and curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This old man wanders around freely and leisurely, you can just call me Old Man Xiao." The old man pondered for a moment before replying.</p><p></p><p>"So it's Elder Xiao!" Wu Tiannan became even more respectful.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Xiao, what do you think about this true dragon calamity?" Old Man Xiao seemed to be a Divine Venerable martial artist, or perhaps even stronger. Could he possibly subdue that true dragon?</p><p></p><p>"The true dragon calamity? Perhaps. This matter is not for this old man to interfere with, naturally there will be others to worry about it." Old Man Xiao smiled.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was very curious about the legendary true dragon, and couldn't help but continue asking about it.</p><p></p><p>Finally, Old Man Xiao said: "What fell into the Divine Realm was a young dragon, not yet fully grown. It's a Jade Snow True Dragon, but its bloodline is extraordinary. Some fellows are so fond of scheming, they lost control and angered that old dragon. Now that will be fun to watch!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was gleefully acting like a spectator.</p><p></p><p>"A Jade Snow True Dragon? Not yet fully grown?" Wu Tiannan pondered the old man's words, realizing that the elder seemed quite knowledgeable about true dragons, and that this true spirit in the Divine Realm had clearly been schemed to fall.</p><p></p><p>Its extraordinary bloodline meant it was likely the offspring of the "old dragon" Old Man Xiao mentioned. That old dragon must be terrifyingly powerful.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, just watch from the sidelines. Although your luck is not bad, your strength is still too weak. If you encounter those fellows, you won't be able to escape. Moreover, your luck may easily attract the attention of certain individuals." Old Man Xiao warned.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you for the reminder, elder." Wu Tiannan's heart tightened, but he wasn't too worried. Worst case, he could return to the Qinghua Realm and stay by his master's side.</p><p></p><p>"This junior entered the Divine Realm searching for my martial arts guide, but has been unsuccessful so far. I wonder if elder perhaps..." Wu Tiannan hadn't forgotten the person he was looking for. </p><p></p><p>As he spoke, he took out a scroll painting.</p><p></p><p>"With your luck, you'll find information sooner or later. The people I know are definitely not ones you can come into contact with." Old Man Xiao waved his hand and turned to leave, saying: "I'm off to watch the show. We'll meet again if fate allows!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan was helpless, but felt Old Man Xiao's words made sense. How could the people an expert like him knew be ones Wu Tiannan could have encountered before?</p><p></p><p>"Where exactly is big sister? Could she have met with misfortune?" Wu Tiannan felt a lump in his throat. </p><p></p><p>Thinking back to their initial meeting, his sister had been seriously injured and was being hunted. Could it be that she ultimately failed to escape the crisis and perished?</p><p></p><p>Even if she had perished, there should still be some information to find, like the forces that were hunting her.</p><p></p><p>"Forget it, I'll go to the Taihe Realm and see how the major realms of the Divine Realm are dealing with this great calamity." Wu Tiannan set off for the Taihe Realm.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the Diyun Realm, the clouds on the ground were thicker than ever before.</p><p></p><p>The Sky Pit had grown even larger, with mists swirling around its mouth like a vortex, as if brewing something or suppressing something.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's figure appeared, arriving before the Sky Pit.</p><p></p><p>"Was it successful?" asked the Tiansha Diying expert guarding the Sky Pit in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"It was successful. The true dragon has fallen, the Divine Realm's great calamity has begun, and the Taihe Realm's Heavenly Ladder is about to open," Tian Seventeen nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>"When the Dao Realm's Heavenly Ladder opens, will Divine Venerables descend, or even Supreme Beings?" an expert asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Do you think they'll have a chance to descend?"</p><p></p><p>"Good point!"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen looked towards the mouth of the Sky Pit and said in a deep voice: "How are you all progressing with the tasks assigned by the Lord? Everything must be prepared before the Heavenly Ladder opens!"</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, we can activate it at any time," the expert guarding the Sky Pit chuckled.</p><p></p><p>"However, if we sacrifice some martial artists' blood essence, the power will be even greater, better able to stir up the rules of heaven and earth, and shake the Dao Realm to descend and merge with the Divine Realm," one of the Tiansha said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"There are many powerful experts in this Diyun Realm. They should have noticed some anomalies here by now. It's a good time to clean up a bit. I'll make a move and collect some martial artists' blood essence," Tian Seventeen nodded indifferently.</p><p></p><p>Then he looked up towards the outside of the Sky Pit, where powerful experts were cautiously approaching through the thick clouds.</p><p></p><p>"In recent days, many martial artists have come to investigate. We've thrown them all into the Sky Pit as sacrifices," a Tiansha laughed.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen's figure flashed away in an instant.</p><p></p><p>The true dragon calamity had attracted the attention of the entire Divine Realm. Even many of the powerful experts of the Diyun Realm had left to discuss it.</p><p></p><p>In recent days, the major forces of the Diyun Realm had noticed some unusual occurrences in the central region and sent martial artists to investigate. All of them had disappeared.</p><p></p><p>Various signs indicated that something was happening in the central region of the Diyun Realm.</p><p></p><p>On this day, a massacre unfolded in the Diyun Realm, but no one knew about it. No one was able to transmit any information out.</p><p></p><p>In the Bihai Realm, the Azure Sea Turtle raised its head to look at the sky, revealing a hint of solemnity.</p><p></p><p>"I must hide better. This Taicang world is indeed about to change. If some of those fellows find out I'm hiding here, it will be troublesome."</p><p></p><p>With a few gurgles, its huge body gradually shrank, merging with the seabed. Its body was completely covered by the sand and mud of the seabed, not revealing a trace of its aura.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sea Turtle's Breath - this was its technique for concealment and survival!</p><p></p><p>It was also the key to how it had escaped that great calamity in the past.</p><p></p><p>On Cloud Sky Island, Xu Yan emerged from seclusion. After pacifying the turmoil at the Bihai Realm's Sky Pit and reuniting with Xie Lingfeng to guide his cultivation, time flew by and he was unable to go to the Taikun Realm as planned. Therefore, he had to cancel his trip to the Taikun Realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with Jiang Buping's strength, taking revenge would be easy. And his second junior brother Meng Chong was already in the Taikun Realm, sufficient to suppress any changes.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Xu Yan remained on Cloud Sky Island, guiding Xie Lingfeng's cultivation while also giving some pointers on swordsmanship to Xie Tianheng.</p><p></p><p>Today, the Sea Spirit Clan's Grand Elder came to pay a visit, fulfilling his promise to let Xu Yan choose treasures from the Sea Spirit Clan's treasury.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's treasury was naturally under the sea.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan wasn't afraid of any tricks. Even underwater, he could move about unhindered.</p><p></p><p>If the Sea Spirit Clan thought they could gain an advantage or suppress him underwater, that would be courting destruction.</p><p></p><p>On the way to the Sea Spirit Clan's treasury, Xu Yan saw messages from Meng Chong and Jiang Buping, which startled and then excited him. A true dragon had fallen into the Divine Realm? And this true dragon was wreaking havoc in the Divine Realm, unstoppable?!</p><p></p><p>"I cultivate the Dragon Subduing..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>To this day, although the Dragon Subduing Palm has killed countless enemies and demonstrated its power, its true strength lies in subduing dragons!</p><p></p><p>"All along, true dragons have existed only in legends. There are no true dragons in the Inner Realm, nor in the Spirit Realm. Even in the Divine Realm, true dragons have never appeared before.</p><p></p><p>"Now the opportunity has come to test the might of dragon subduing.</p><p></p><p>"Only by truly subduing a dragon can one break through the limitations of the Dragon Subduing Palm, truly grasp its essence, and become even stronger!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>For the Dragon Subduing Palm to advance further, comprehension and fighting enemies alone were not enough. One must battle a true dragon. Only after truly subduing a dragon could one understand its essence! "Master said, to subdue a dragon with a dragon. It's time to verify how the dragon might of my Dragon Subduing Palm compares to that of a real dragon. This is also a good opportunity to cultivate true dragon might and develop an even more magnificent dragon might for the Dragon Subduing Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan felt that only by truly battling to subdue a dragon and tempering himself against a true dragon could he elevate the Dragon Subduing Palm into a powerful divine ability.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, this is our Sea Spirit Palace," said the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan, pointing to a magnificent underwater palace complex ahead.</p><p></p><p>"The underwater scenery is indeed colorful and varied. Your Sea Spirit Palace is beautifully built," Xu Yan couldn't help but praise as he looked at the Sea Spirit Palace ahead.</p><p></p><p>"It's just some minor tricks. Our Sea Spirit Palace is actually only average. It's said that the True Dragon Spirit Palace is even more magnificent and grand," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Oh, how much do you know about true dragons?" Xu Yan immediately became interested.</p><p></p><p>The news of the true dragon calamity had not yet reached the Azure Sea Realm, as there were no message talismans to transmit it. Transmission through other channels would inevitably take some time.</p><p></p><p>"Actually, it's not correct to say that our Sea Spirit Clan is the overlord of the sea. As long as true dragons exist, our Sea Spirit Clan will never be the overlord. True dragons are born to rule the sea. In the past, our Sea Spirit Clan was actually part of the true dragon lineage..." the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan began to explain with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan was one of the true spirits belonging to the true dragon lineage, ruling the sea for the true dragons. However, true dragons had long since disappeared from the Divine Realm, and with the great changes in heaven and earth, many of the former secrets could no longer be investigated.</p><p></p><p>Now, the Sea Spirit Clan had become the overlord of the sea, but it was no longer as powerful as it once was.</p><p></p><p>Although the Sea Spirit Palace was located on the seabed, there was a waterless area within the palace grounds. A sea-controlling force kept the seawater out of the Sea Spirit Palace - this was an innate ability of the Sea Spirit Clan.</p><p></p><p>Led by the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan, Xu Yan entered the Sea Spirit Palace and headed towards its treasure vault.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, many members of the Sea Spirit Clan gathered to watch, including beautiful Sea Spirit women whose gentle gazes suggested they would throw themselves into Xu Yan's arms at the slightest nod.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw a familiar face - Haibo'er from the Spirit Realm. This Sea Spirit girl was also a top talent in the Spirit Realm and had sparred with him before. In the Divine Realm's Sea Spirit Clan, her talent was not low either. She had just broken through to the Tempering Truth Realm, which was not a slow cultivation speed.</p><p></p><p>However, the gap between them was inevitably growing larger and larger.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in greeting to Haibo'er. After all, they were acquaintances, so it was natural to greet each other when they met. Haibo'er's jade face flushed red, but she also showed a delighted expression. She bowed in return, though her eyes held a complex look. After coming to the Divine Realm, she had been cultivating desperately, aiming to one day spar with Xu Yan again.</p><p></p><p>However, the gap between them had become like a heavenly moat. Not only had it not narrowed, but it had grown even wider. Her current strength was like that of an ant in the eyes of Immortal Realm powerhouses, who could annihilate her with a wave of their hand. And those Immortal Realm powerhouses? They were now like ants that Xu Yan could annihilate with a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Even the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan had to treat him with utmost respect.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, this descendant of our clan is indeed of unparalleled beauty, gentle and accomplished. Since you..." the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said delightedly upon seeing this situation.</p><p></p><p>"Just greeting an old acquaintance," Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan was stunned. An old acquaintance?</p><p></p><p>He made a mental note to ask that Sea Spirit Clan descendant later how she knew Xu Yan. Since she had this connection with Xu Yan, she would definitely need to be well-cultivated.</p><p></p><p>"This is our Sea Spirit Clan's treasure vault," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said as they arrived in front of a palace that looked inconspicuous and even somewhat old.</p><p></p><p>"Greetings, Grand Elder. This must be the Sword God Xu Yan!" An elderly Sea Spirit Clan member emerged from hiding and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, this is young friend Sword God Xu Yan," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the elderly Sea Spirit Clan member and nodded, which counted as a greeting.</p><p></p><p>This elderly Sea Spirit Clan member guarding the treasure vault was not the least bit weaker than the Grand Elder in strength.</p><p></p><p>"Our Sea Spirit Clan has a long history. Although we have declined, due to certain circumstances, we still retain some ancient artifacts. We still have some heritage, and these ancient artifacts are stored here," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said with a sigh as he opened the treasure vault and led Xu Yan inside.</p><p></p><p>"This old palace was specially built to store precious treasures and to avoid drawing attention."</p><p></p><p>There were many old palaces in this area. Ordinary people probably wouldn't think that the Sea Spirit Clan's core treasures would be stored in this palace.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, please feel free to look around. If you see anything you like, just take it," the Grand Elder made a gesture of invitation.</p><p></p><p>"In that case, I won't stand on ceremony," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Sea Spirit Clan's treasure vault contained numerous precious items, all extremely valuable, and not a few of them were imbued with the charm of the Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, after obtaining the Primordial Turtle's Shell, ordinary treasures no longer caught Xu Yan's eye.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, although the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan had promised that he could choose treasures at will, Xu Yan was not a greedy person. Therefore, he only intended to pick a few items that caught his eye.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? What's this?" Xu Yan saw a snow-white, gorgeous garment, made of an unknown material, incredibly beautiful. He couldn't help but be intrigued.</p><p></p><p>"It's said to be the garment of our Sea Spirit Clan's ancient emperor. It's a treasure. Once, a female powerhouse at the Grand Unity Realm wanted to buy this garment, but I refused," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan explained.</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity there's only one," Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>Initially, he had thought of taking this garment to give as a gift, but on second thought, it seemed inappropriate to give to either Du Yuying or Yun Miaomiao.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, he wouldn't give it to anyone!</p><p></p><p>"There's another one here," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan quickly opened a jade box on the jade platform under the garment when he heard this. "There are two in total. Since young friend likes them, please take them!"</p><p></p><p>As if afraid Xu Yan would disdain them, the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan delightedly put the garments into the jade box and handed it to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the jade box in his hand was a hot potato.</p><p></p><p>"These two garments have been coveted by others before. Due to various reasons, they were not obtained, and the other party may still be coveting them. This might bring some trouble, so young friend should think thrice about whether to accept them," the Grand Elder of the Sea Spirit Clan said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>(End of Chapter)</p>

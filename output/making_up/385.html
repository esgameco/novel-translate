        <h1>Chapter 385</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Artifact refining also entered the realm of martial artists. Almost all former blacksmiths turned to learning and practicing the art of artifact refining. As the art of artifact refining spread, the biggest change was that the power of weapons in the hands of martial artists increased.</p><p></p><p>This also led to a significant improvement in the overall strength of the Qinghua Realm. The most obvious example was the blood disciples and blood slaves in the Netherworld Abyss. Compared to the previous battle, the pressure faced in the next battle increased substantially.</p><p></p><p>The weapons in the hands of Qinghua Realm martial artists displayed over 30% more power.</p><p></p><p>The popularization of medicinal pills also greatly reduced casualties.</p><p></p><p>The most direct example was that in battle, when a martial artist was severely injured, in the past they would absolutely not be able to leave the battlefield alive. But now, after taking a medicinal pill, they could recover 60-70% of their injuries in a short time and roar back into battle.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, a saying spread throughout the Qinghua Realm: "The world's artifact refining comes from Qimen, the source of alchemy is in Lingxiu."</p><p></p><p>Artifact refining came from Qimen Fang Hao, while alchemy came from the Alchemist Immortal Su Lingxiu!</p><p></p><p>The names of Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu resounded throughout the Qinghua Realm, becoming revered figures among Qinghua Realm martial artists. All artifact refiners and alchemists enshrined Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, artifact refiners and alchemists gained esteemed status in the Qinghua Realm, and everyone wanted to become an artifact refiner or alchemist.</p><p></p><p>However, both artifact refining and alchemy required innate talent.</p><p></p><p>In five years, the Qinghua Realm went from initial crisis and turmoil, nearly being successfully invaded by the Netherworld, to entering a new era. The martial world's strength increased dramatically, with the emergence of two special types of martial artists - artifact refiners and alchemists.</p><p></p><p>One Netherworld Abyss after another was cleared out, greatly suppressing the Netherworld's momentum and significantly reducing their chances of invasion.</p><p></p><p>All of this originated from five years ago, when the Divine Bridge opened and great experts descended!</p><p></p><p>Because of this, those prodigies who came from the Spirit Realm received great attention and preferential cultivation. Of course, these spirit body prodigies also had excellent innate talents, so their strength naturally increased rapidly.</p><p></p><p>The names of Xu Yan and Meng Chong had long become household names in the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Not long ago, Xu Yan exchanged a few blows with a blood son in the Tianwu Sect's abyss. Although he was not a match, he was able to easily retreat.</p><p></p><p>The concept of the sword dao also spread widely throughout the Qinghua Realm along with Xu Yan's fame, inspiring every sword dao practitioner to pursue the true path of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>For example, attaining sword heart clarity and comprehending sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Now, in the entire Qinghua Realm, all sword dao practitioners believed that without attaining sword heart clarity, one had not truly entered the threshold of the sword dao.</p><p></p><p>Sword momentum also spread as a result. Many sword dao practitioners began to start by cultivating sword momentum, which also led to a significant increase in their strength.</p><p></p><p>The saying "In the world of swordsmanship, Xu Yan reigns supreme" had spread throughout the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's name as the Heavenly God also resounded throughout the Qinghua Realm. He was revered as the supreme body cultivator and guide for body cultivation by some martial artists who venerated brute physical strength.</p><p></p><p>The reason for this was that Meng Chong had taught martial artists the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Refinements technique, leading these martial artists onto the path of body cultivation. Although it was not pure physical body martial arts, it was considered to have opened up a branch within Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Five years was not long for powerful experts, but for the Qinghua Realm, it was an earth-shattering change.</p><p></p><p>Some powerful experts who had been in secluded cultivation for just a few short years emerged to find the entire Qinghua Realm had become unfamiliar.</p><p></p><p>There were formations and medicinal pills, martial artists discussing sword momentum, sword heart clarity, sword intent... or discussing what kind of spiritual weapon to refine.</p><p></p><p>Even muscular martial artists were discussing how to cultivate their physical bodies and where to buy medicinal pills to assist with physical cultivation.</p><p></p><p>It was completely different from previous times emerging from seclusion, when discussions were always about which abyss was in turmoil or which abyss had suffered heavy casualties. Now there was rarely any discussion of abyss matters.</p><p></p><p>In a daze, it felt as if the abysses had been completely pacified, like the passage of eons, even though only a few years had passed!</p><p></p><p>In five years, Li Xuan had already read to the sixteenth page of the Taicang Book, with only two pages left to finish the entire book.</p><p></p><p>His understanding of the laws of the Taicang world and his comprehension of the laws had greatly improved.</p><p></p><p>"It's been five years, and the gains have been substantial."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. Indeed, as one's strength increased, time became less important for powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>In the blink of an eye, five years had passed.</p><p></p><p>Over these five years, whether it was the promotion of formations, the spread of alchemy, or the emergence of Taicang martial arts body cultivation, all brought him rich feedback.</p><p></p><p>His strength was further enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had also broken through to the perfected stage of the Divine Sense realm a few days ago, and was now preparing to accumulate his foundation to break through to the Divine Form realm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was at the great completion stage of the Divine Sense realm, Su Lingxiu was at the great completion stage of the Divine Sense realm, and Su Lingxiu had already comprehended the Void-breaking realm martial arts method of the medicine dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's three schools of martial arts had all entered the Void-breaking realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's Qimen martial arts had also progressed rapidly, further comprehending the future path of Qimen martial arts, which greatly enhanced Li Xuan's Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Although it was not yet comparable to the Void-breaking realm, it was not far off.</p><p></p><p>Over these five years, the Qinghua Realm had been changing rapidly. First, all major cities were equipped with protective formation arrays, and teleportation arrays were set up between larger cities for convenient travel.</p><p></p><p>With the iteration of teleportation arrays, the distance of a single teleportation had increased to 300,000 li, greatly improving the convenience of martial artists' travel, especially in supporting crisis abysses.</p><p></p><p>This also led to the threat of the Netherworld Abysses continuously decreasing.</p><p></p><p>Powerful experts could suddenly leave to suppress one abyss, and before the Netherworld enemies in the weakened abyss could react, the powerful expert had already returned to guard their original abyss.</p><p></p><p>This tactic worked time and again, and the Netherworld suffered repeated defeats.</p><p></p><p>"Taicang body cultivation is quite interesting."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled inwardly. The emergence of the body cultivation branch in Taicang martial arts was unexpected.</p><p></p><p>Of course, because body cultivation originated from Meng Chong, and Meng Chong was his disciple who practiced the physical body martial arts he had created, the emergence of Taicang body cultivation naturally brought him some feedback.</p><p></p><p>"Master, these are the new spirit cakes I made!"</p><p></p><p>Cai Ling'er brought over a plate of spirit cakes.</p><p></p><p>Since activating her Sea Spirit Clan royal bloodline, Cai Ling'er's strength had been rapidly increasing. In just five years, she had already reached the middle stage of the Condensed Law Heavenly Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Especially after activating her royal bloodline, Cai Ling'er looked even more beautiful and enchanting, more pure and flawless, with a vague air of royalty.</p><p></p><p>"Mm!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>In five years, Jiang Buping had also made considerable gains. Although he had not yet resolved the undissipating qi in his soul and had not yet entered the door of Extreme Soul martial arts, he could now focus his mental consciousness without external stimulation. The influence of the undissipating qi on him was further decreasing.</p><p></p><p>If this trend continued, he would eventually resolve the undissipating qi and enter the door of Extreme Soul martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has already reached the Divine..."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've completed the Qinghua Realm, I've explored it thoroughly over these five years. Isn't it time to leave the Qinghua Realm?" Li Xuan mused to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Realm was still too profound. Over these five years, Xu Yan had still not been able to fully comprehend and understand it.</p><p></p><p>"By traveling and wandering, viewing the sights of heaven and earth, and comprehending the true essence of martial arts, I believe Xu Yan will be able to understand it," Li Xuan thought. He wasn't in a hurry about this - after all, only five years had passed.</p><p></p><p>The higher the realm, the more profound it becomes, naturally making it harder to comprehend. Moreover, the Heaven and Earth Realm was a major leap forward.</p><p></p><p>"I've already understood most of the Taicang Principles. I can pretty much determine the martial arts methods above the Heaven and Earth Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Principles, ah, they are the root of heaven and earth, the basis for the operation of the universe," Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>The laws of heaven and earth are derived from the universe, while the principles of heaven and earth are the root source, the foundation for the operation of the universe. Without these principles, or if they were to collapse, the universe would cease to exist.</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the principles of heaven and earth, how should I continue to create? Transcending heaven and earth can't be the end - martial arts are boundless."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already started pondering the direction and methods of martial arts beyond transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"There's no need to rush. When I truly transcend heaven and earth, I'll naturally know how to proceed," Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Tiannan has cultivated the Heavenly Wave Palm. The divine abilities you created have begun to spread in the martial world. You have gained the Way of Divine Abilities."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the Golden Book of the Great Way opened, providing unexpected feedback.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned. Wu Tiannan had actually cultivated a divine ability, and even more delightful was the feedback from the Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>The Way of Divine Abilities meant understanding the essence of divine abilities, pointing directly to their fundamental nature. Mastering the Way of Divine Abilities meant comprehending the essence of divine abilities and being able to create them.</p><p></p><p>"With my Divine Ability Martial Canon, I can now create divine abilities like Bone Transformation and Rebirth in an Instant."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>After mastering the Way of Divine Abilities, his Divine Ability Martial Canon was no longer mere fabrication.</p><p></p><p>The divine abilities he created would all be cultivable, and he now knew how to create even the most profound divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>For example, he had always been thinking about creating divine abilities like Bone Transformation, and now he finally truly understood how to create them.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Wave Palm, although just a minor divine ability, is still quite impressive and powerful."</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Wave Palm was one of the minor divine abilities he had created, and also one that Xu Yan had already comprehended. When unleashed, it was like endless waves surging forth, with considerable power.</p><p></p><p>"Now that divine abilities can be cultivated in the Taicang martial arts, even though for now it's only minor divine abilities and some truly great divine abilities still can't be cultivated, it can still enhance the power of Taicang martial arts."</p><p></p><p>"I thought Xie Tianheng would be the first to cultivate a divine ability, but unexpectedly it was Wu Tiannan."</p><p></p><p>"This guy, worthy of being the chosen one of the inner domain, with outstanding talent and luck. I wonder about the identity and strength of his martial arts guide."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly. After learning about Wu Tiannan's experiences, he had marveled at this guy's great fortune, and indeed it was so.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, for the first time, he became curious about Wu Tiannan's martial arts guide.</p><p></p><p>"I should complete the Divine Ability Martial Canon as soon as possible. Let's set it at Three Thousand Divine Abilities."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had an idea.</p><p></p><p>He would compile a total of three thousand divine abilities of various types, including major and minor ones.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, Li Xuan continued to memorize the Taicang Book Principles while starting to create divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Now that I've mastered divine abilities, it's time to accumulate foundation. Although I've obtained quite a few heavenly and earthly treasures, I lack some special items. I'm afraid there aren't such special treasures in the Qinghua Realm. It's time to venture into other realms."</p><p></p><p>On a mountain peak, Xu Yan opened his eyes, revealing a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>He had gained some new insights on how to continue building his foundation in the Divine Ability Realm. He needed to find some special heavenly and earthly treasures, which would allow him to become stronger and more unique when breaking through to the Divine Image Realm.</p><p></p><p>With this thought, Xu Yan's figure disappeared from the spot. He went to find the Sect Master of the Tianwu Gate to inquire about where he could obtain certain heavenly and earthly treasures with special effects.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianwu Gate was very enthusiastic about Xu Yan's visit, showing no airs of being one of the three supreme experts of the Qinghua Realm. He treated Xu Yan as a peer, after all, he was the disciple of a great master.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, the heavenly and earthly treasures you need - heavy and dense, solid yet flexible... I'm afraid there are no such treasures in the Qinghua Realm. However, they might exist in the Nine Mountains Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm consists of nine great mountains, each unimaginably vast. It produces a kind of heavy metal, and perhaps only there you might find treasures that are heavy and dense."</p><p></p><p>After hearing Xu Yan's purpose, the Sect Master of the Tianwu Gate pondered for a moment before speaking.</p><p></p><p>As an Immortal Venerable, he was naturally knowledgeable and well-informed. While he might not be familiar with all thirty-six realms of the Divine Domain, he was quite familiar with the neighboring Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm?" Xu Yan nodded, thinking of Feng Yan, the Immortal Venerable from the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Nine Mountains Realm is full of mountains and dense forests, with more spirit beasts and various divine herbs compared to the Qinghua Realm. Besides the Netherworld Sky Cave, there are other sky caves there. Inside, there's a treasure called the Ten Thousand Jin Duckweed. It's a small floating plant that weighs ten thousand jin, yet strangely, it can float on water."</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, you might want to look for it. It could be what you need."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianwu Gate thought for a moment and mentioned a unique treasure from the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked curiously, "What's the name of that sky cave in the Nine Mountains Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Having been in the Divine Domain for several years, he had learned quite a bit about sky caves. The Divine Domain faced external enemies not just from the Netherworld, so there were different types of sky caves.</p><p></p><p>"I believe it's called the Witch Demon Sky Cave. Since this sky cave is not large and the threat is moderate, it hasn't received much attention."</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of the Tianwu Gate thought for a moment before answering.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Sect Master of Tianwu. I'll take my leave!"</p><p></p><p>After getting the information he needed, Xu Yan cupped his hands in farewell, preparing to head to the Nine Mountains Realm to explore the Witch Demon Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>"Take care, young friend!"</p><p></p><p>Leaving the Tianwu Gate, Xu Yan headed straight for the realm gate, which was the fastest way to reach the Nine Mountains Realm.</p><p></p><p>The realm gate was located at the intersection of the three major forces - Dayue, Wanlei, and Tianwu. The three powers had established a large city there called Qinghua City.</p><p></p><p>The realm gate was a special portal for quick travel between the thirty-six realms of the Divine Domain, formed by the laws of heaven and earth, somewhat similar to the spirit realm gates.</p><p></p><p>Passing through the realm gate would directly lead to another realm.</p><p></p><p>The Nine Mountains Realm was named for the nine enormous mountains within its borders.</p><p></p><p>The vastness of the nine mountains was beyond imagination, and each great mountain contained a sky cave, which also meant that each mountain had a powerful force presiding over it.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

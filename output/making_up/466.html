        <h1>Chapter 466</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The illusory heads formed from Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er's remnant consciousness had eyes full of unwillingness and pain, with boundless fear in their gaze. </p><p></p><p>They opened their mouths as if wanting to say something, but could no longer speak.</p><p></p><p>Pop! The two illusory heads burst and disappeared like bubbles.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er were completely annihilated!</p><p></p><p>Xue Ji's lips quivered, "What kind of technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>In his consciousness, there was still only that one spear thrust from earlier - an indescribable, ineffable spear thrust that had pierced into his remnant soul as soon as it was unleashed.</p><p></p><p>That extreme killing power was dissolving his remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>It seemed that as long as it was a soul, it could not avoid or resist that spear thrust.</p><p></p><p>Xue Ji had thought that although he was a remnant soul, he had once been an extremely powerful being. How could mere Immortal Realm or even Heavenly Union Realm martial artists harm him? Even if they cultivated powerful soul-killing techniques, their realm was too low to harm his remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>As a result, he had misjudged everything.</p><p></p><p>In this final moment, he suddenly realized with horror that the killing technique Jiang Buping displayed with this spear thrust completely exceeded his understanding. It was no longer simply a secret technique for killing souls, nor was it as simple as some kind of soul-killing cultivation method.</p><p></p><p>How could such a freak of nature appear in the Cang Tian world? And this kind of killing technique was incredibly powerful. There should be no second person in the Cang Tian world who could create such a powerful killing technique.</p><p></p><p>But, hadn't he already died?</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping said calmly, "You don't deserve to know!"</p><p></p><p>Pop! Xue Ji dissipated into a blood-colored smoke, and this remnant soul was annihilated.</p><p></p><p>In the wilderness of the Tai Kun Realm, brownish-red flames emerged from within that pile of stones, revealing Xue Ji's face.</p><p></p><p>"Dead?!"</p><p></p><p>His expression was extremely shocked. That remnant soul of his was not weak, even Heavenly Union Realm martial artists could not resist it or kill it.</p><p></p><p>Yet it had perished! "Jiang Buping, huh?" </p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, Xue Ji disappeared underground.</p><p></p><p>All the powerful experts remained silent. Such a powerful remnant soul of a Netherworld expert had vanished into thin air.</p><p></p><p>The expressions of the Jiang clan elders and others were complex. The grudge between Jiang Buping and Jiang Tianming had ended at this moment, and along with it, probably all ties between Jiang Buping and the Jiang clan had ended as well.</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi, Hong Er and the others from the Treasure Alliance were overjoyed at this moment. The stronger Jiang Buping was, the better! This meant a higher chance of defeating Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Even if he ultimately couldn't defeat Meng Chong, as long as he injured him or even caused him to expend a great deal of energy, their Treasure Alliance would have a chance!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping pointed his spear and looked coldly towards the Cloud Top Sect, "I want to kill the sect leader of Cloud Top Sect. Does anyone object? Does anyone want to stop me?"</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful experts from Cloud Top Sect remained silent at this moment, but they all retreated, leaving the Cloud Top Sect leader alone and isolated.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was now unstoppable!</p><p></p><p>"One wrong thought, reaping the bitter fruits. No need for you to make a move!" The Cloud Top Sect leader smiled dejectedly.</p><p></p><p>Pop! His body began to dissipate, his soul extinguished. He had directly self-destructed!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's cold gaze still looked towards the Cloud Top Sect's side. At this moment, the Grand Elder of Cloud Top Sect, with a stern expression, reached out and grabbed several figures.</p><p></p><p>"The former sect leader made a grave mistake, bringing trouble to our sect. You are all his confidants. To protect the legacy of our Cloud Top Sect, today we will purge the remnants of the former sect leader!"</p><p></p><p>As the Grand Elder of Cloud Top Sect's voice rang out, the other elders of Cloud Top Sect tacitly made their moves. In a short time, all those in Cloud Top Sect who were related to the former sect leader, Yun Yan'er and others were killed.</p><p></p><p>"The remnants of the Yun family have all been executed. We beg Young Master Jiang to be merciful and spare our Cloud Top Sect this once!" The Grand Elder and others of Cloud Top Sect said respectfully and fearfully.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping indifferently moved his gaze away. Those who deserved to die in Cloud Top Sect had already died, and he no longer had any grudges with the rest. The Cloud Top Sect matter was thus concluded.</p><p></p><p>He strode towards the Jiang clan's camp.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, many people in the Jiang clan's side had pale faces and were trembling all over.</p><p></p><p>"Buping, you..." The Grand Elder opened his mouth wanting to say something, but Jiang Buping coldly said, "I no longer have any ties with the Jiang family!"</p><p></p><p>His gaze directly passed over the Jiang clan leader and looked at several people among the clan elders, his gaze turning ice-cold.</p><p></p><p>Swish! A spear thrust out, and in an instant, one of the elders let out a miserable scream. His physical body was collapsing, and his soul was slowly dissolving.</p><p></p><p>The other elders, scared pale, hurriedly distanced themselves from the person who had been stabbed.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Suddenly, several elders used their ultimate secret techniques, wanting to escape.</p><p></p><p>But Jiang Buping's expression remained calm. One spear thrust after another, miserable screams rang out one after another. Everyone felt their hair stand on end.</p><p></p><p>Those were the shrill screams of soul pain.</p><p></p><p>Several Jiang clan elders' physical bodies were collapsing, their souls dissolving, yet they were unable to die for the time being.</p><p></p><p>This was Jiang Buping's revenge, making them suffer the torture of soul pain before death!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the discarded son had turned the tables, grudges had been settled, and the pent-up anger in his heart was fully vented.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping indifferently glanced at the Jiang clan crowd, then turned and left. No one dared to try to keep him, nor did anyone dare to speak.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts who had rushed here from various realms now felt slightly disappointed. The Jiang clan had not fought Jiang Buping as a whole, and Jiang Buping had not razed the Jiang clan to the ground.</p><p></p><p>Though there was some small regret, the trip was not in vain. They had witnessed such a shocking battle and personally seen the killing techniques of the Spear Demon!</p><p></p><p>The winds and clouds had gathered in Tai Kun, and the battle of the discarded son's revenge that had attracted the attention of thousands had now come to an end. It would surely spread throughout the Divine Realm, becoming a heavy stroke in the martial arts history of the Divine Realm, talked about with relish by people.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Jiang Buping was seen raising his head to look at a certain place.</p><p></p><p>"Come, let's fight."</p><p></p><p>"Good!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd of powerful experts were stunned, then became excited.</p><p></p><p>The Spear Demon versus the Sky God?!</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts from the Treasure Alliance were even more excited. They had finally waited for this battle. Whether they could kill their great enemy would be decided today!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>As Meng Chong walked out, golden light burst forth. He was like a god of the sky, holding a great saber, with wind and thunder swirling, changing the colors of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the Tai Kun Realm, all the powerful experts were excitedly watching the battle between the Spear Demon and the Sky God, not knowing that in the distant Long Shan Realm, an event that would shake the Divine Realm was descending!</p><p></p><p>Above the Dragon Abyss, dark clouds covered the sky, lightning flashed, and silver chains flowed with streams of light. The illusory image of that striped giant tiger was gradually becoming more substantial.</p><p></p><p>An awe-inspiring divine might rushed towards the sky.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The tiger's roar shook the heavens, and a vast and mighty aura swept across heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Lightning flashed, and the silver chains kept tightening. The thick dark clouds were covering down, and within the clouds, one could vaguely see what seemed to be a small world.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, after a thunderclap, a roar was faintly heard. When this roar sounded, heaven and earth lost color. That illusory image of the striped giant tiger, as if stimulated by something, also began to roar.</p><p></p><p>On the jade platform of the Dragon Abyss, the Wind Spirit Tiger suddenly noticed something was wrong.</p><p></p><p>Its power was being stimulated uncontrollably, its bloodline was boiling. It raised its head to look, and its pupils suddenly contracted, revealing a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"Tian Seventeen, what is this?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger roared.</p><p></p><p>No one responded.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the wind spirit tiger realized something was wrong. It felt as if it had been sacrificed. However, looking down at the celestial tiger blood essence that was about to emerge, it was reluctant to leave.</p><p></p><p>Roar! With a bellow, its aura erupted as it suddenly transformed into a giant tiger, unleashing all of its power in this moment.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Thunder rolled, dark clouds descended, and chains made clanking sounds.</p><p></p><p>The spirit beasts of Dragon Mountain Realm had already prostrated themselves on the ground, not daring to move an inch.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists of Dragon Mountain Realm all had a sense that something was terribly wrong and that a crisis was approaching.</p><p></p><p>"What's happening?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, but my intuition tells me there might be great danger."</p><p></p><p>"This is bad. Dragon Mountain Realm isn't safe. We need to leave!"</p><p></p><p>Some of the more perceptive martial artists hurriedly made their way towards the realm gate, preparing to leave Dragon Mountain Realm.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>"It's about time!" </p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen gazed into the distance at Dragon Abyss, a pink pearl appearing in his hand.</p><p></p><p>"Let's add fuel to the fire and create even more turmoil."</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and shot out the pink pearl. It landed on one of the chains, and immediately a layer of pink light began traveling up the chain, straight into the depths of the dark clouds.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A bellow resounded from within the dark clouds. Thunder rolled, the winds shifted, and the clouds grew increasingly thick. But within the clouds, a scene like a small world gradually became clearer.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A massive striped tiger was also bellowing.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, on the jade platform in Dragon Abyss, that drop of celestial tiger blood essence finally emerged, transforming into a tiny striped celestial tiger.</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger was overjoyed and swiftly swallowed the blood essence in one gulp.</p><p></p><p>The moment it swallowed the blood essence, a thunderous sound rang out in its consciousness, shaking it dizzy.</p><p></p><p>At some point, it felt as if it was losing control of its physical body.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a vast divine might arose within its body, stimulating its bloodline and beginning to refine it. This should have been an exciting development, but at this moment the wind spirit tiger couldn't feel happy about it.</p><p></p><p>An intense sense of crisis arose in its heart, and even if it wanted to flee, it couldn't.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The celestial tiger raised its head and bellowed, assuming an attacking posture as if it had encountered its greatest enemy, as if its fighting spirit had been provoked.</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger's soul trembled.</p><p></p><p>It sensed something was very wrong, because this drop of celestial tiger blood essence was continuously being consumed, and along with it, its own essence, energy and spirit. Even though this process was refining its bloodline, if it continued like this, it would surely die! Moreover, the wind spirit tiger sensed that in the thick clouds above the sky, there seemed to be some great terror watching it, or rather, its roars had angered that great terror.</p><p></p><p>No! It wasn't itself, but the celestial tiger aura that had angered the great terror in the clouds!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The dark clouds had pressed down to just above Dragon Abyss, and the chains were making clanking sounds as if they might break at any moment.</p><p></p><p>At a certain point, the illusory celestial tiger merged with the wind spirit tiger, becoming a powerful celestial tiger that raised its head to roar and assumed an attacking posture.</p><p></p><p>An aura of celestial tiger energy swirled around its body, impacting the sky.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A cry that shook heaven and earth rang out, and a terrifying pressure descended. This pressure was so strong it could make ten thousand beasts prostrate themselves and all living things in heaven and earth tremble.</p><p></p><p>It was as if the roaring being possessed divine might from birth.</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger's soul was trembling, but it couldn't control itself.</p><p></p><p>The celestial tiger and the being in the dark clouds roared at each other, angering each other. The clouds descended, thunder rumbled, and winds raged. At a certain moment, there was a cracking sound.</p><p></p><p>Then, to the wind spirit tiger's horror, the sky shattered! The moment the chains broke, the dark clouds exploded and thunder rolled. The sky had shattered! It was as if a small world, or perhaps some special space, had suddenly collapsed, and with it the sky itself collapsed.</p><p></p><p>As the sky collapsed like a funnel, it poured down even more abundant spiritual energy. In an instant, the spiritual energy of heaven and earth became extremely active.</p><p></p><p>A profound rhythm also appeared in this part of Dragon Abyss at this moment.</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger saw above the collapsed sky an even more vast world. It was a realm beyond the divine realm. Although it was only a corner of it, it was enough to captivate one's imagination.</p><p></p><p>It was said to be a place that could only be reached when the Heavenly Stairway opened.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, two characters appeared in the wind spirit tiger's consciousness, as if transmitted through the celestial tiger's bloodline inheritance.</p><p></p><p>Dao Realm!</p><p></p><p>Before the wind spirit tiger could understand why the sky had collapsed, something even more terrifying happened!</p><p></p><p>From the collapsed sky and dissipating dark clouds, thunder rolled and an intensely cold aura spread. Snowflakes like lightning fell.</p><p></p><p>Amidst the thunder and snowflakes, something fell from above!</p><p></p><p>Roar! The celestial tiger bellowed and launched a terrifying attack. Its huge tiger mouth spewed out a devastating gale, and the wind spirit tiger's body, under the control of the celestial tiger's will, pounced fiercely upward.</p><p></p><p>"Ahhhh!"</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger's soul let out a terrified scream.</p><p></p><p>What was falling from the collapsed sky was a true dragon!</p><p></p><p>A true dragon that had only existed in legends and had never been seen before! The sky collapsed and a dragon fell!</p><p></p><p>Was this the legendary battle between dragon and tiger? How could the wind spirit tiger possibly be worthy of fighting a true dragon?</p><p></p><p>"Tian Seventeen, I'll @#$% your %%%$#@!"</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger started cursing furiously.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A dragon's cry shook heaven and earth. The majestic dragon's aura surged through the world. A jade-white, flawless dragon hundreds of zhang long looked down from above. Its dragon energy clashed with the tiger energy of the celestial tiger.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous boom, the crack showing a corner of the Dao Realm above the sky seemed to be slowly mending.</p><p></p><p>Bone-chilling cold spread as snowflakes fell like lightning. A dragon claw reached down, violently tearing apart the celestial tiger's will and extinguishing its aura, grabbing directly for the wind spirit tiger.</p><p></p><p>After the celestial tiger's will was destroyed, the wind spirit tiger suddenly regained control of its body. However, at this moment it felt extremely weak, as if almost all of its essence blood had been consumed.</p><p></p><p>Even though its bloodline had been refined and the remaining essence blood had been replaced with purer celestial tiger blood, the wind spirit tiger couldn't feel happy at all.</p><p></p><p>Let alone whether the consumed essence blood could be recovered, it couldn't even overcome the immediate crisis! That was a true dragon! Its strength had already greatly diminished due to weakness, and even at its peak it couldn't withstand this attack!</p><p></p><p>"Tian Seventeen, I fought eighteen rounds with your mother. You're a bastard!"</p><p></p><p>The wind spirit tiger roared in despair and anger.</p><p></p><p>As the dragon claw reached down, it saw that the jade-white, flawless true dragon's eyes were blood-red. It seemed extremely agitated, as if it had lost its reason, as if its rationality had been controlled by anger.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the wind spirit tiger's scalp tingled. Those bastards led by Tian Seventeen even dared to scheme against a true dragon!</p><p></p><p>As the crisis of death descended, it suddenly discovered a jade talisman in its soul. This was a life-saving treasure given to it by its sworn brother Red Cat.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, there was no time to think. It hurriedly activated the jade talisman!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

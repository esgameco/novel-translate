        <h1>Chapter 216</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Ping'er's brows furrowed, "Jiao Ming has entered the inner realm, and there has been no news since then?"</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming was a martial dao celestial being, and given his temperament, he would undoubtedly be very flamboyant and would never act low-key.</p><p></p><p>"He has entered the inner realm, and truly there is not a single bit of news?" Ping'er asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the celestial being, there is indeed no news at all. When that esteemed one left the spiritual realm, I was stationed here, expecting news of a celestial being's arrival in the inner realm. But there has not been even a whisper about that esteemed one," the purple-crowned man replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"You are stationed here, how do you know he has not shown any trace?" Ping'er knitted her brows.</p><p></p><p>"Reporting to the esteemed one, I am the hall master of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, the force with the most thorough information about the inner realm," the purple-crowned man hurriedly explained.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavenly Treasure Pavilion?" Ping'er murmured, seeming to have thought of something, and nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Where did he go?" Ping'er asked.</p><p></p><p>The purple-crowned man raised his hand and pointed in the direction Jiao Ming had left, "That esteemed one went in that direction."</p><p></p><p>Ping'er did not linger, her figure moved, and she followed the direction Jiao Ming had left.</p><p></p><p>The group of powerful figures from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion finally relaxed the hearts they had been holding. At this moment, they realized that their backs were damp with cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>Since becoming a half-step celestial being, they had always been high and mighty, with the world in their grasp. When had they ever been so disheveled? When had their lives been in the hands of others? At this moment, they felt bitterness in their hearts, feeling powerless, and also surging with unwillingness and indignation.</p><p></p><p>Ping'er frowned, Jiao Ming had entered the inner realm, yet he acted so low-key? This was not his character at all. Could it be that he was protecting that bastard? "No, Jiao Ming would not protect a bastard. Could it be that he was entertained too well and did not go to other places in the inner realm, only indulging in pleasure?"</p><p></p><p>Ping'er felt that this was very likely the case.</p><p></p><p>She had never thought that Jiao Ming might have died.</p><p></p><p>Jiao Ming was a martial dao celestial being, entering the inner realm was an invincible existence, sweeping through the inner realm would be no problem. Who could kill him? Even if he was surrounded, with his strength, he could still flee.</p><p></p><p>"Jiao Ming, you bastard, only indulging in pleasure, making me come to this inferior place to look for you, to catch the bastard. After returning, I will certainly have the young miss severely punish you, and deprive you of your management position!"</p><p></p><p>Ping'er became angrier and angrier as she thought about it.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the mountain peak of Canglan Island, Li Xuan stood with his hands behind his back, gazing at the vast Cangjiang River.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan respectfully stood beside him.</p><p></p><p>The timing was now ripe, Li Xuan decided to pass on the martial dao techniques above the Spiritual Sense Realm to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"My disciple, you have already mastered the Profound Realm, and you have also comprehended the Spiritual Sense Realm techniques. I believe you are also eager to enter the Spiritual Realm and venture into the even vaster martial dao world."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had the bearing of a strict teacher.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is too unknown. Before going, I will make sufficient preparations and will not rashly go," Xu Yan replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>The reason he had not yet entered the Spiritual Realm was not entirely due to his current strength not being strong enough, nor was it because he feared the many powerful figures in the Spiritual Realm. It was because he was concerned about the safety of his parents and family members.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolation had not yet unified the inner realm, and his parents and family members were still weak in strength. His teacher could not always protect them.</p><p></p><p>This was the fundamental reason why Xu Yan had not yet entered the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also understood this point. Xu Jiunhe had already reached the initial stage of the Innate Realm, but in the inner realm, this level of strength was still not enough.</p><p></p><p>"Today, I will pass on to you the martial dao techniques above the Spiritual Sense Realm. You should also ponder and comprehend them diligently. When you enter the Spiritual Realm in the future, you will not be hindered by the martial dao techniques," Li Xuan nodded and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan was excited.</p><p></p><p>Although he had not yet broken through to the Spiritual Sense Realm, he had already comprehended how to cultivate and break through the Spiritual Sense Realm.</p><p></p><p>Once he entered the Spiritual Sense Realm, even if he was not as strong as the Refine Spirit Celestial Beings, he would no longer fear the Combine Spirit Great Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Sense Realm is about refining the will of heaven and earth, refining the spiritual sense, the foundation of the spiritual sense, this is the foundation of the martial dao spirit. And above the Spiritual Sense Realm is the Spirit Origin Realm!" Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Origin Realm is above the Spiritual Sense Realm! At this moment, Li Xuan looked at the Dao Golden Book, the Spirit Origin Realm martial dao technique he had created.</p><p></p><p>Spirit Origin Realm Martial Dao Technique: Technique Perfection Degree: High.</p><p>Realm Connection Degree: High.</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: Medium-High.</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: Medium-High.</p><p></p><p>This was the martial dao technique with the highest technique perfection degree and realm connection degree among all the ones Li Xuan had created so far. It also had a medium-high cultivation and comprehension difficulty.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan believed that with such a high-level technique and easy cultivation, Xu Yan should be able to comprehend it quickly, perhaps even before breaking through the Spiritual Sense Realm.</p><p></p><p>In this way, his martial dao realm would continue to be higher than his disciple's!</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Origin, the origin of the spiritual sense, the wondrous essence of the spiritual sense... The spiritual sense is refined into the true origin, transforming the true origin into the spirit origin..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression became solemn as he began to explain the Spirit Origin Realm martial dao technique.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Origin Realm is a transformation of the true origin into the spirit origin, fusing with the spiritual sense. The strongest aspect of the Spirit Origin Realm is the ability to condense the spirit origin incarnation!</p><p></p><p>The spirit origin exists independently, within a certain range of the main body, it can act in place of the main body, such as exploring dangerous places.</p><p></p><p>Even if the spirit origin incarnation is destroyed, it only loses a bit of the spirit origin and spiritual sense, just like consuming in battle, and it can be restored at any time.</p><p></p><p>The spirit origin incarnation also has another wonderful aspect, which is that the spirit origin can be infused into an object to serve as a protective talisman for others.</p><p></p><p>When encountering danger, the spirit origin incarnation will manifest and block the danger, killing the enemy. It can also be actively activated.</p><p></p><p>However, the spirit origin incarnation, although possessing a certain consciousness and combat instinct, does not have true thinking and adaptability, relying solely on its own combat instinct.</p><p></p><p>The strength of the spirit origin incarnation is related to the amount of spirit origin separated. The more spirit origin separated, the stronger the incarnation will be.</p><p></p><p>This is the wondrous aspect of the Spirit Origin Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was filled with excitement. The Spirit Origin Realm actually had such wonderful powers. If he broke through to the Spirit Origin Realm, he could leave spirit origin incarnations to protect his parents and family members.</p><p></p><p>With spirit origin incarnations guarding his parents and family members, they would naturally not face any danger in the inner realm, and no one could threaten them.</p><p></p><p>After explaining the Spirit Origin Realm martial dao technique, Li Xuan looked at his excited disciple, also anticipating that Xu Yan would comprehend the technique.</p><p></p><p>In that case, he would also possess the power of the spirit origin.</p><p></p><p>The incarnation wonder of the Spirit Origin Realm was inspired by Li Xuan's Thousand Martial Shadows, which could be considered a kind of clone, but not a true clone, only able to be manifested within a certain range of the main body.</p><p></p><p>And it could not be infused into an object to provide protection for others.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about the web novels he had read in his previous life, where powerful figures in major forces liked to create clones to serve as protective talismans for their beloved juniors.</p><p></p><p>Since he had now created such a technique...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He had already created his own martial arts cultivation methods, so he couldn't lose this ability - he had to create them. </p><p></p><p>The three realms of the Spiritual Domain - the Heavenly Beings, did not seem to possess this ability.</p><p></p><p>This made his own martial arts even more extraordinary and mysterious.</p><p></p><p>Since the topic of the Divine Elemental Incarnation was brought up, Li Xuan solemnly spoke: "Disciple, do you know why your master did not give you the protection of an incarnation?"</p><p></p><p>"Master is afraid that the disciple, relying on the protection of the incarnation, would become reckless, disregarding danger, and lose the fundamental caution and steadfastness that a martial artist should have. Master is worried that the disciple would act recklessly without regard for the risks, knowingly provoking enemies stronger than himself instead of avoiding them."</p><p></p><p>"Master is afraid the disciple would become a delicate flower in a greenhouse, possessing talent but lacking the tempering of martial arts cultivation, and thus unable to go far."</p><p></p><p>After a moment of stunned silence, Xu Yan's expression became deeply moved, realizing the high expectations his master had for him. He respectfully spoke.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled contentedly and nodded.</p><p></p><p>This disciple is really good! </p><p></p><p>He didn't even need Li Xuan to make excuses, he had already figured it out completely on his own.</p><p></p><p>This is his beloved disciple, if Li Xuan had this ability, how could he be stingy and not prepare it for his disciple? It's simply that he didn't have it!</p><p></p><p>"Mm-hmm!" Li Xuan said approvingly, "I'm glad you understand the good intentions behind your master's actions."</p><p></p><p>After passing down the Divine Elemental Realm cultivation method to Xu Yan, Li Xuan did not continue to teach the next level's martial arts. Instead, he waited for Xu Yan to digest and comprehend the Divine Elemental Realm technique.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was excited as he contemplated the Divine Elemental Realm technique, and vague insights into the Divine Will Realm technique began to emerge in his mind, connecting to the Divine Elemental Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, he was still far from fully comprehending the Divine Elemental Realm technique.</p><p></p><p>"The martial arts of the Divine Will Realm, you have already gained some understanding, as you have the foundation of comprehending the Divine Elemental Realm technique. Ponder it thoroughly, and you will naturally be able to understand the martial arts of the Divine Elemental Realm," Li Xuan said when Xu Yan had almost finished digesting the technique.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, I shall now pass down to you the martial arts beyond the Divine Elemental Realm," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!" Xu Yan was extremely excited. The Divine Elemental Realm was already so powerful, what kind of profound martial arts could be beyond that realm?</p><p></p><p>"Beyond the Divine Elemental Realm is the Divine Transcendence Realm!" Li Xuan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Transcendence Realm, above the Divine Elemental Realm!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Dao Golden Book, reviewing the evaluation of the Divine Transcendence Realm martial arts technique.</p><p></p><p>Divine Transcendence Realm Martial Arts Technique:</p><p>Technique Perfection Level: Medium-High</p><p>Realm Connection Level: High</p><p>Cultivation Difficulty: High</p><p>Comprehension Difficulty: Medium-High</p><p></p><p>He had put in a lot of effort, but still couldn't raise the Technique Perfection Level to the high tier.</p><p></p><p>However, knowing that Xu Yan could cultivate and comprehend even the lowest rated techniques, a medium-high rated technique should not be too difficult for him. It would just take longer to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Future martial artists should be grateful to Xu Yan, for if he hadn't comprehended and perfected the techniques, how would later generations have cultivation methods to practice?" Li Xuan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>Although he was the Martial Ancestor, the true pioneer of the martial dao was his senior disciple, Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Transcendence Realm, where the Divine Element merges with the Divine Will, refining and condensing the Martial Dao Primordial Spirit, and the Divine Transcendences are self-manifesting..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's voice lowered as he began explaining the Divine Transcendence Realm martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Transcendence Realm, besides the Primordial Spirit coalescing and emerging, one can also cultivate Martial Dao Transcendences. These Transcendences are boundless, each unique.</p><p></p><p>At the Divine Transcendence Realm, in addition to the Primordial Spirit solidifying and emerging, one can also cultivate Martial Dao Transcendences. The Primordial Spirit can leave the physical body and even reunite with it, as long as the Primordial Spirit does not perish, one cannot die!</p><p></p><p>"The Primordial Spirit is true, the form is like the physical body. A single thought births a Transcendence, a single thought shakes the heavens and earth. The wonders of the Primordial Spirit cannot be fully expressed in a few words - you must comprehend and enlighten your own Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"The mighty power of the Transcendences, once you comprehend it, you will naturally know."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Will, Divine Element, Divine Transcendence, can also be called the Three Realms of Divine Transcendence.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan listened intently, deeply pondering the profound teachings. He solemnly nodded, "Master, I understand. I will diligently contemplate and comprehend the mysteries of the cultivation techniques."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Transcendence Realm! Transcending the physical body without perishing, the Primordial Spirit immortal, Transcendences self-manifesting.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought of the Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings in the Three Celestial Realms. The Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings were very powerful, and the descriptions in the Celestial Tombs, though not detailed, gave a general sense of their strength.</p><p></p><p>The Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings only refined the spiritual soul, without the concept of Transcendences. Their spiritual souls also seemed more ethereal and weaker compared to the Primordial Spirit.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Transcendence Realm, by refining and transforming the Martial Dao Primordial Spirit, would naturally be far stronger than the spiritual souls of the Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>"If I can break through to the Divine Elemental Realm, I should be able to kill the Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings!" Xu Yan thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Martial Dao Transcendences? My Sword Dao should also cultivate Sword Dao Transcendences. The Heart Sword Realm, to transform all things into swords, can it be made into a Transcendence? The Life-and-Death Sword Wheel, I still need to comprehend it further, this Sword Dao should be the foundation for Sword Dao Transcendences!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gradually gained some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>After passing down the martial arts of the Divine Will Realm to Xu Yan, Li Xuan turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the Divine Elemental Realm or the Divine Transcendence Realm, he had carefully considered and planned the connections between the upper and lower realms.</p><p></p><p>The Three Celestial Realms, especially the final realm of the Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings, had cultivated spiritual souls, and their strength was absolutely not weak.</p><p></p><p>But the Divine Transcendences are stronger. After all, the refinement of the Martial Dao Primordial Spirit is stronger than the cultivation of the spiritual souls of the Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>"Starting from the Divine Will Realm, I have gradually surpassed the martial arts of Taiyang. The power of the Divine Transcendence Realm will far exceed the Cultivated Spirit Celestial Beings. With the Transcendences unleashed, who can stand in my way?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face broke into a smile.</p><p></p><p>In the cultivation of the martial dao, whether it's the Primordial Spirit or the spiritual soul, this is a hurdle that cannot be bypassed. It's a case of different paths leading to the same destination, but the gap in strength between cultivating the spiritual soul and the Primordial Spirit is vast.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the will of heaven and earth into one's own body, condensing it as the foundation of the Primordial Spirit, is far stronger than simply comprehending and gathering one's own divine nature as the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"What realm lies beyond the Three Celestial Realms of Taiyang Martial Dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan already knew that the martial arts of this world were not called the Inner Domain Martial Arts or the Spiritual Domain Martial Arts, but the Taiyang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>With the Taiyang Books recording the Taiyang Heaven and Earth Principles, and the Dao Golden Book assisting him, the martial arts he created naturally far surpassed the Taiyang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>The writing got a bit stuck here...

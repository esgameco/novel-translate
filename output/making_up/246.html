        <h1>Chapter 246</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan excitedly returned to the manor, sat down in a chair, and looked at the formation plate in his hand. Although it was the lowest-level formation plate, it was the first time it had appeared in the Spiritual Realm. </p><p></p><p>This was the beginning of his Qimen martial arts, and it was of great significance.</p><p></p><p>"Finding disciples ultimately comes down to fate!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, finally understanding that even peerless experts look for disciples based on fate.</p><p></p><p>"Since the fate has arrived, everything will go as planned. These four disciples will surely carry forward the Qimen martial arts!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan tapped the formation plate, inputting spiritual energy into it, and eight sub-plates instantly flew out and landed in the eight directions of the manor.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The Disorienting Formation was activated!</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu, who was refining a dan pill, suddenly stilled, and the dan furnace overturned with a bang. </p><p></p><p>The mistake that occurred during her dan pill refinement was unbelievable, as dan pill refinement was already a very basic skill for her - she wouldn't make any mistakes even with her eyes closed.</p><p></p><p>However, just now, her palm had slightly tapped the wrong position of the dan furnace.</p><p></p><p>"Something's not right!" </p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's brow furrowed, and she looked around - the manor seemed to have... changed!</p><p></p><p>"Why is this tree over here?"</p><p>"What's going on with that battle puppet?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's brow furrowed.</p><p></p><p>Her divine sense spread out, and she finally discovered the problem. </p><p></p><p>The entire manor seemed to be affected by an unknown force, with an illusion of disorientation and inversion. What she had just seen as the battle puppet was actually Shi Er practicing his saber techniques.</p><p></p><p>"An enemy attack? Or something else?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu became alert, her divine sense spreading out as an iron shovel appeared in her hand, with fine golden needles circling around her.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, all the illusions of disorientation and inversion disappeared, and Su Lingxiu looked at her leisurely seated master.</p><p></p><p>She hurried over and asked, "Master, was that an enemy attack just now?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled mysteriously and pointed outside, saying, "Go take a look outside and you'll know."</p><p></p><p>Puzzled, Su Lingxiu left the manor and looked down from midair at the manor below.</p><p></p><p>What she saw shocked her.</p><p></p><p>From the outside, the manor had changed - the original location of the manor had become several large trees, while the manor itself had appeared in the original tree's position.</p><p></p><p>The figures of Shi Er and the others were nowhere to be seen, as if hidden by the vegetation.</p><p></p><p>The seat where her master had been sitting was also empty.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was greatly shaken. The manor was clearly right there, yet to the naked eye, it had changed position. If she hadn't been familiar with the manor and had some prior knowledge, she might not have even noticed the abnormality if she had just passed by.</p><p></p><p>Her divine sense swept over and detected an unknown force covering the manor, causing the scenery within to appear inverted and disoriented.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what's going on?" Su Lingxiu asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This is a formation," Li Xuan replied with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"A formation?" Su Lingxiu was puzzled.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan briefly explained the formation to her.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of formations has its own profound mysteries. Your fourth junior brother has a talent for it. If you're interested, you can ask him about it after he's learned the basics."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled brightly. The formations were about to manifest in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Master, you've taken on more disciples?" Su Lingxiu smiled. "I'm the senior sister, this is wonderful."</p><p></p><p>"Fang Haotian has decent talent, and it's fate that he's come. The Qimen martial arts should have an inheritor," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>The next day, in a secluded courtyard at the end of South Fang Street in the capital of Zheng Kingdom, Fang Hao looked at his residence with a bit of reluctance - today was the day he would leave.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to change his fate had arrived.</p><p></p><p>He placed the Spring Night Mirror on the stone table in the courtyard and left a few lines of text - a farewell message for Shen Haizhu.</p><p></p><p>This Shen Young Master wasn't bad, and Fang Hao had earned quite a few spirit stones from him. </p><p></p><p>He might as well give him the Spring Night Mirror.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!" </p><p></p><p>Little Ha swallowed everything into its belly.</p><p></p><p>"Master!" Fang Hao respectfully greeted the approaching Li Xuan.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, let's go," Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Today, he would pass on the Qimen martial arts to his fourth disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Fang Hao responded reverently.</p><p></p><p>Back at the manor, Su Lingxiu was already waiting, curious to see what the fourth disciple was like.</p><p></p><p>Shi Er, Zhou Ying, Meng Shushu, and the Crimson Cat were all curiously watching.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao," Li Xuan gestured to the chubby youth behind him. "This is your third senior sister, Su Lingxiu, a dan pill warrior."</p><p></p><p>Seeing the breathtakingly beautiful third senior sister, the chubby Fang Hao's face immediately turned red.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao pays respects to Third Senior Sister!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu tried to put on a stern senior sister demeanor. "Mm, fourth junior brother, as a newcomer, you must listen to Master's words. And you must also listen to what I, your senior sister, say!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes!" Fang Hao responded shyly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's mouth twitched a bit, remembering Fang Hao's lecherous expression when he first met him, especially when looking at the nude female images in the Spring Night Mirror.</p><p></p><p>After the siblings got acquainted, Su Lingxiu looked at Little Ha curiously, poking its belly with her finger.</p><p></p><p>"So this is the Swallowing Toad, but it looks a bit different."</p><p></p><p>"His name is Little Ha," Fang Hao said.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, let me take a look at you," Su Lingxiu said, reaching out to grab it.</p><p></p><p>However, Little Ha moved and hid behind Fang Hao's neck.</p><p></p><p>"Senior Sister, Little Ha is shy," Fang Hao said with an embarrassed smile.</p><p></p><p>"Shy, huh." Su Lingxiu narrowed her eyes and took out a few dan pills.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, look at these. Want to eat them?"</p><p></p><p>Little Ha poked its head out from behind Fang Hao's neck, its lively eyes staring hungrily at the dan pills in Su Lingxiu's delicate palm.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to eat, come over here," Su Lingxiu beckoned.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha hesitated, but when Su Lingxiu threw another dan pill, it couldn't resist the temptation and jumped onto her palm, croaking softly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was a bit stunned - the dan pills had such a huge allure that his Little Ha, who was usually shy around others, had overcome its shyness to approach Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>The Crimson Cat, seeing this, meowed anxiously.</p><p></p><p>"The Crimson Cat wants to eat too," Su Lingxiu said, tossing dan pills to both pets.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan held a jade scepter in one hand, the other hand behind his back, observing the scene.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>With a leisurely pace, he walked towards the mountain peak outside the manor.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao followed closely behind him.</p><p></p><p>Standing on the mountain peak, gazing at the majestic capital city of the Zheng Kingdom, Li Xuan slowly spoke: "Fang Hao, what do you think of the cultivation world of the Spirit Domain?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was taken aback, not understanding why his master asked this. After thinking for a moment, he replied: "In the Spirit Domain, there is a strict hierarchy. The Spirit Sects and Aristocratic Families are at the top, while the Scattered Cultivators face great difficulties.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone wants to become a member of the Spirit Sects and Aristocratic Families. Even if one is originally a Scattered Cultivator, or of humble origins, once they become part of the Spirit Sects and Aristocratic Families, they will not treat the Scattered Cultivators kindly. This is the illness of the cultivation world of the Spirit Domain."</p><p></p><p>Towards the end, Fang Hao looked up and said, "Master, I have always believed that this is the illness of the cultivation world of the Spirit Domain. Although I also want to establish a Family, I do not want to establish one like the current Families."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was slightly surprised, and then asked, "So, is your current dream to establish a respected Family, or to pursue the peak of the Dao of Martial Arts?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a deep breath and said, "After I came into contact with Array Techniques, establishing a Family is no longer my dream. I want to pursue the true essence of the Dao of Martial Arts. I want to develop a new system of Martial Arts, I want to promote Array Techniques to the fullest, and I want to become an immortal monument in the history of the Dao of Martial Arts!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao's gaze was resolute. He had found his true dream.</p><p></p><p>His slightly chubby face was solemn and determined.</p><p></p><p>"Very good!" Li Xuan nodded and slowly spoke, "I do not pass down techniques, but only the Dao. You must remember to comprehend the Dao within, and walk your own path.</p><p></p><p>"The Esoteric Martial Arts encompass Array Techniques, Alchemy, Seals, and Esoteric Formations. What I will pass down to you is the Dao within, the techniques are all contained within the Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Whatever Array Technique you want, you must comprehend it from the Dao. The same goes for Seals, Alchemy, and the Esoteric Formations of Heaven and Earth..."</p><p></p><p>Before passing down the Esoteric Martial Arts to Fang Hao, Li Xuan solemnly told him his teaching method: "I only pass down the Dao!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!" Fang Hao was inwardly excited.</p><p></p><p>"This is the true way of imparting knowledge and receiving the Dao, not just passing down fixed techniques. Master hopes that the disciple will ultimately walk their own path!"</p><p></p><p>In Fang Hao's eyes, his master suddenly became immensely revered.</p><p></p><p>"Now listen carefully to the Esoteric Martial Arts..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's expression was solemn as he began to impart the Esoteric Martial Arts to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Golden Scriptures of the Great Dao unfolded, revealing the techniques of the Esoteric Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan, word by word, passed on the entire theoretical foundation and basic techniques of the Esoteric Martial Arts to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression was solemn as he listened attentively, afraid of missing even a single word.</p><p></p><p>"The Esoteric Martial Arts are so profound, so abstruse. How should I comprehend them?" The more he listened, the more Fang Hao was overwhelmed with shock.</p><p></p><p>The Esoteric Martial Arts were so profound and abstruse. Even just the introductory stage was extremely difficult. He didn't even know how to begin cultivating them.</p><p></p><p>"...Fang Hao, do you remember it all?" Li Xuan finished imparting the Esoteric Martial Arts and asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I have remembered it all," Fang Hao replied respectfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded in satisfaction. It only took one round of imparting for the disciple to remember it all, which met his requirements for the disciple's talent.</p><p></p><p>"Previously, I taught you the Disorienting Array. That is a minor array. You are already familiar with it. Today, I will pass down the rest of the Array Techniques to you. You must carefully comprehend them.</p><p></p><p>"The Dao of Arrays is profoundly mysterious. It is not limited to just the Array Techniques I have taught you. You must use this as a foundation, with the Dao of Arrays as the core, to explore and create new Array Techniques yourself.</p><p></p><p>"The same goes for Seals and Alchemy. I have already taught you. As for the Esoteric Formations of Heaven and Earth, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"They are not all fixed and unchanging. As long as you comprehend the Dao within, 'one technique mastered, all techniques understood', the Array Techniques and Seals will naturally come to you.</p><p></p><p>"Depending on the different environments, you will use different Array Techniques and Seals, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Just like your Third Martial Sister, in the Dao of Alchemy, she can create new Elixir Formulas at will. If there are Elixirs she doesn't know, she will create them herself.</p><p></p><p>"Because your Martial Sister has already comprehended the Dao of Alchemy."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression was solemn as he respectfully said, "Yes, Master. I will not let you down!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, now look closely. These are nine major Arrays." Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the spiritual images appeared, sketching out the diagrams of the nine major Arrays in midair.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao carefully observed them, but the Array diagrams were so complex and profound that it was not easy to remember them at all. Unless he had already comprehended the Esoteric Martial Arts and had a foundation in the Dao of Arrays, it would be almost impossible for him to remember the major Array diagrams in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan also understood this principle.</p><p></p><p>"How much do you remember?" Li Xuan asked after about an hour.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had an embarrassed expression as he said, "Disciple is dull-witted and only remembered half of the Array diagram."</p><p></p><p>"Being able to remember half is already good enough. Work hard and carefully comprehend the Esoteric Martial Arts." Li Xuan accepted it with a somewhat reluctant expression.</p><p></p><p>"I will take the time to draw the Array diagrams for you to study in detail. You must first comprehend the principles of the Esoteric Martial Arts. Only after grasping the introductory stage can you understand the profundity of the Dao of Arrays."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. Disciple will definitely work hard and not let you down!" Fang Hao said with a resolute expression.</p><p></p><p>"When cultivating the Dao, you must be free-flowing, spontaneous, and not cling to it. If you get too attached, it will backfire!" Li Xuan warned.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was startled, and respectfully replied, "Yes, Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go and comprehend them well." Li Xuan nodded and turned, walking away with a leisurely pace.</p><p></p><p>He finally let out a sigh of relief in his heart, "I have finally passed down the Esoteric Martial Arts. Now I just have to wait for the harvest. How long will it take for Fang Hao to comprehend them?</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation of the Esoteric Martial Arts is different from ordinary martial arts. I don't know if Fang Hao can comprehend them, and in what way he will cultivate the introductory stage."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sat cross-legged on the mountain peak, and the principles of the Esoteric Martial Arts emerged in his mind, as he constantly contemplated their profundity.</p><p></p><p>The more he contemplated, the more abstruse it seemed. It was different from ordinary martial arts, a unique and unconventional Esoteric path, completely beyond his previous understanding of the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Alchemy, Arrays, Seals, Esoteric Formations, the Great Trends of Heaven and Earth..."</p><p></p><p>One by one, the techniques of the Esoteric Martial Arts appeared in Fang Hao's mind.</p><p></p><p>The Array diagrams were presented in his consciousness.</p><p></p><p>The theories and frameworks of Alchemy also emerged.</p><p></p><p>But most importantly, the introductory stage of cultivating the Esoteric Martial Arts, he found it extremely profound and couldn't find a way to enter it. The cultivation methods he had practiced were obviously not suitable for manifesting the Esoteric Arts.</p><p></p><p>"How should I start cultivating the Esoteric Martial Arts? The cultivation methods I have practiced are clearly unable to unleash the Esoteric Arts, and the cultivation of the Esoteric Martial Arts is not like cultivating techniques..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a deep breath and opened his eyes, looking towards the distant capital city of the Zheng Kingdom, the majestic city like a giant beast crouching on the earth.</p><p></p><p>"This is my opportunity. I will become an Esoteric Martial Artist. I will explore the peak of the Esoteric Martial Arts and be remembered in the history of the Dao of Martial Arts... The Spirit Sects and Families are like smoke and clouds!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao's heart was resolute. He had found his life's goal.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Sects and Families were high and mighty, but how many of them throughout history had vanished into oblivion, their names not even remembered?</p><p></p><p>He would make his name echo through the ages. He would pursue the peak of the Dao of Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>The opportunity to change his fate was right here, and no matter what, he had to seize it!</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

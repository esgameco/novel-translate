        <h1>Chapter 55</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 55: Old Man Qi, I, Xu Yan, Have Arrived</p><p></p><p>Guo Yunkai was completely bewildered, frantically looking around in alarm, and even opened the study window to check outside, making sure no one was eavesdropping, before finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>"Father, how could you..." </p><p></p><p>His own father - could it be that because of his defeat in the struggle for the crown prince, their whole family was now in danger and he had been so deeply shaken that his mind had become unsound?</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan took a deep breath, only now beginning to calm down a bit. </p><p></p><p>But he still could hardly believe it.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince had kowtowed three times and bowed nine times to take Guo Rongshan as his teacher, and Emperor Qi had directly stated that once a teacher, forever a father - how could a prince bow to a teacher like this?</p><p></p><p>Even more absurd was that Qi had sworn brotherhood with Guo Rongshan! </p><p></p><p>And the most shocking part was that Qi actually wanted to give Guo Yunkai the Empress! What emperor would give his consort to a minister?!</p><p></p><p>Qi didn't have a fetish for putting antlers on people's heads, did he?</p><p></p><p>Listening to his father's account, Guo Yunkai was completely dumbfounded, looking at his father with a doubtful gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Maybe it's not Emperor Qi who's gone mad, but my own father!"</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince returned to the prince's manor in a daze, and his confidant hurried over.</p><p></p><p>"Your Highness, the Emperor has summoned you. What is the matter?"</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince looked around cautiously, took a deep breath, and leaned in to whisper to his confidant: "I suspect my father the Emperor has a brain disease!"</p><p></p><p>The confidant: ???</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince seemed to be the one not quite right!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi returned to the imperial study and issued an order: "Decree: Appoint Guo Rongshan as the Prince of Qi, Grand Chancellor, and Grand Preceptor of the Crown Prince..."</p><p></p><p>Grand Preceptor was no longer enough to match Guo Rongshan's status, so Qi directly established a new position of Grand Preceptor of the Crown Prince.</p><p></p><p>The single word "Grand" signified the exalted status.</p><p></p><p>"Decree: Appoint Guo Yunkai as the Duke of Shenwei, commander of the Shenwei Army..."</p><p></p><p>"Establish the Prince of Ming as the Crown Prince!"</p><p></p><p>The Prince of Ming was the Third Prince!</p><p></p><p>Emperor Qi issued a series of decrees one after another, and also ordered the widespread dissemination of how Qi honored the worthy and had the Prince of Ming bow to Guo Rongshan as his teacher, as well as how Qi had humbly lowered his status to swear brotherhood with Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan's and the Guo family's unwavering loyalty to the country and the emperor, their painstaking efforts, were all widely publicized.</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan was portrayed as an upright and virtuous sage of the highest moral character!</p><p></p><p>The capital was in an uproar! </p><p></p><p>All the civil and military officials were utterly dumbfounded!</p><p></p><p>Was the Emperor insane?</p><p></p><p>Especially the Crown Prince and the ministers supporting him - they felt as if they had fallen from the clouds to the ground, and not just any ground, but a cesspool. Their pain was indescribable.</p><p></p><p>The Third Prince had been made the Crown Prince!</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan had been enfeoffed as a prince!</p><p></p><p>Grand Chancellor, Grand Preceptor of the Crown Prince...</p><p></p><p>His son Guo Yunkai had been made the Duke of Shenwei, commander of the pivotal Shenwei Army of the country!</p><p></p><p>And in the public, Guo Rongshan had already been elevated to the status of a sage of the highest virtue, a towering figure.</p><p></p><p>The principals involved, Guo Rongshan and his son, were also completely bewildered, with only one thought in their minds: "His Majesty has lost his mind..."</p><p></p><p>Countless ministers memorialized the throne, even to the point of remonstrating at the risk of their lives, and the court was in complete chaos.</p><p></p><p>Those who remonstrated were all granted their wishes.</p><p></p><p>All the civil and military officials could think was: "The Emperor has gone mad..."</p><p></p><p>Until that day, two scarlet red dragons thundered and blasted open the gates of the capital.</p><p></p><p>A figure soared, coiled around the scarlet red dragons, rushing towards the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>A voice like crashing thunder rang out: "Old man Qi, I, Xu Yan, have arrived!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>The officials were stunned - wasn't this Guo Rongshan's grandson? </p><p></p><p>Rumor had it that this grandson of his had a not-so-bright mind, believed in the tales of legends, and was single-mindedly seeking out masters to cultivate true martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The officials looked up, seeing the huge dragons soaring across the sky, their aura shaking the heavens and earth.</p><p></p><p>They were all struck with terror on their faces.</p><p></p><p>There was truly such powerful martial arts in this world?</p><p></p><p>It was we ourselves who had the not-so-bright minds?!</p><p></p><p>In that instant, the officials all understood why Emperor Qi had taken such absurd actions, why he had so flatteringly favored Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>All because of Guo Rongshan's grandson, Xu Yan!</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang looked at the giant dragon, dozens of meters long, coming across the sky, and his face turned green.</p><p></p><p>Although the secret edict of the Flying Eagle mentioned that Xu Yan's palms could strike out a huge red dragon, whose might was unparalleled, the written description was one thing, but seeing it with his own eyes and experiencing it firsthand was another.</p><p></p><p>He almost peed his pants.</p><p></p><p>Grabbing Guo Rongshan's hand next to him, his voice trembling, he said, "Brother Guo, you must persuade your grandson, my old bones can't take this!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan looked at the soaring Xu Yan, completely dazed. My grandson is actually so powerful?</p><p></p><p>In that moment, he suddenly understood that it was not Qi Huang's mind that had gone astray, but because of Xu Yan's immense strength that he had made this series of seemingly absurd decisions!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was now rushing furiously towards the palace, it must be that the faction of the Crown Prince in Donghe Prefecture had provoked his own grandson when they were about to settle accounts with Guo Rongshan, and that's why he came to the capital city.</p><p></p><p>"Your Majesty, rest assured, my grandson Xu Yan is a simple and kind-hearted good boy, he won't do anything excessive!"</p><p></p><p>After understanding the reason, Guo Rongshan's back straightened, and he was more confident.</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang's mouth twitched, a simple and kind-hearted good boy? Only you, Guo Rongshan, could say that!</p><p></p><p>"Yan'er, what's with the grand display? You've disturbed His Majesty, which is not good!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan waved to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the Qi Huang next to his grandfather, snorted coldly, and pressed his palm down, causing the two giant dragons to merge into an even larger one.</p><p></p><p>With a thunderous sound, it crashed onto the square outside the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>A booming noise, with dust and smoke flying.</p><p></p><p>The ravine created by the giant dragon had almost split the square in half!</p><p></p><p>The officials were trembling, the imperial guards shaking, and the elite of the inner palace all covered in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>"Grandfather!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came before Guo Rongshan.</p><p></p><p>"Haha, Yan'er, you've come at the right time. Let me introduce you, this is the current Emperor, your grandfather's sworn brother!"</p><p></p><p>Guo Rongshan happily pulled Xu Yan's hand.</p><p></p><p>"Sworn brother?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked puzzled at Qi Huang.</p><p></p><p>When did his grandfather become sworn brothers with the old Emperor?</p><p></p><p>If they were sworn brothers, then why did those officials dare to raid his family?</p><p></p><p>Qi Huang forced a benevolent smile, with no trace of the majesty of an emperor.</p><p></p><p>For the officials of the Qi Kingdom, this was a day when their worldview collapsed.</p><p></p><p>The legendary martial arts deity had truly appeared! And he was the grandson of Guo Rongshan, the one who had always been mocked as a dimwit!</p><p></p><p>It turned out that the fool was actually themselves!</p><p></p><p>On this day, the people of the capital were greatly shocked, as a divine being had ridden a dragon and charged into the imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>"The incompetent and tyrannical Qi Emperor, a divine being has descended to destroy the Qi Kingdom, the Qi Kingdom's days are numbered, the Goddess of Heaven's light shines upon the people, saving the masses from disaster, it is the right time to uphold justice and the realm..."</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, some hidden followers of the Goddess of Heaven cult, excited, jumped out and rushed towards the palace, ready to take the opportunity to rebel!</p><p></p><p>The commoners were all dumbfounded, how could there still be Goddess of Heaven cult heretics in the capital? Seeing the opportunity, they really dared to rebel!</p><p></p><p>As for Qi Huang, he was afraid of Xu Yan, let alone the Goddess of Heaven cult heretics.</p><p></p><p>He was already fuming, and this was a good chance to vent his anger by capturing these heretics. So the imperial guards surged out to apprehend and search for the Goddess of Heaven cult heretics.</p><p></p><p>The capital of the Qi Kingdom, and even the entire Qi Kingdom, was destined to be unsettled because of Xu Yan's arrival.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the news of Xu Yan single-handedly sweeping away the神威 (Divine Might) Army in Donghe Prefecture also reached the officials' ears, and at this moment, they finally understood the reason behind Qi Huang's absurd actions.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 426</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Congratulations, my lord, on slaying Xu Yan and making a great contribution to restoring the glory of heaven and earth!" the newcomer exclaimed joyfully.</p><p></p><p>The corners of Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer's mouth twitched under his mask. He felt his palm start to hurt again, and his shoulder ached even more. It seemed that just hearing Xu Yan's name caused the trace of sword energy inside him to become agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is not dead!"</p><p></p><p>"What?" </p><p></p><p>The newcomer was shocked. Even with Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer personally taking action, he couldn't kill Xu Yan? After a moment's thought, he realized: "My lord, did you capture Xu Yan alive? Are you planning to frame another faction?"</p><p></p><p>That must be it! Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer didn't kill Xu Yan in order to pin his death on another faction?</p><p></p><p>"I did not capture Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer was stunned.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, has Xu Yan become so powerful? Even you couldn't defeat him in person?"</p><p></p><p>Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer glared coldly at him and snorted, "What nonsense are you spouting? If I had truly acted, capturing that brat Xu Yan would have been as easy as reaching out my hand!"</p><p></p><p>"Then why...?"</p><p></p><p>The other man looked puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"After careful consideration, I felt that capturing and killing Xu Yan would be too simple and not conducive to stirring up trouble in the Divine Realm. So after much thought, I suddenly came up with a better plan than personally ambushing and killing Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the newcomer let out a sigh of relief. So that was it. He had been frightened for a moment, thinking that even the great Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer couldn't handle Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"My lord, what brilliant plan do you have?"</p><p></p><p>Inwardly, he muttered to himself: This Heavenly Killer has always been in charge of killing and is not skilled at planning and strategizing. How did he suddenly become enlightened?</p><p></p><p>He wondered if this plan would actually be feasible.</p><p></p><p>Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer's gaze was profound, as if he had calculated everything deeply and had it all under control.</p><p></p><p>"Kill Yan Ping and frame Meng Chong for it. Right now, the Myriad Treasures Alliance and Meng Chong are bitter enemies, and their conflict cannot be resolved. No matter which realm Meng Chong goes to, he will inevitably be hunted by the Myriad Treasures Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"As long as we kill Meng Chong at the right time, the Myriad Treasures Alliance won't be able to escape blame and will have to face retaliation from the powerful figures behind Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"After much thought, I believe if we do the same to Xu Yan, it would be more valuable than if I personally killed him!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer suddenly understood, but hesitated and said: "My lord, the Myriad Treasures Alliance is targeting Meng Chong. If they target Xu Yan as well, wouldn't that be a bit..."</p><p></p><p>"Fool!"</p><p></p><p>Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer glared at him, looking exasperated as he said: "How can you be so stupid? Is the Myriad Treasures Alliance the only major power in the Divine Realm? Are they the only ones spread across the thirty realms?"</p><p></p><p>The corners of the newcomer's mouth twitched. He cursed inwardly at being looked down upon by someone who only knew how to fight and kill. "What do you mean, my lord?"</p><p></p><p>Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer had a look in his eyes as if he held all the answers. "The Hundred Battles Hall! Let Xu Yan make enemies with the Hundred Battles Hall. Their prodigy Hong Ting is in the Long Cloud Realm and has entered the Tuowu Heavenly Cave to fight. Find an opportune moment to kill him and frame Xu Yan for it!"</p><p></p><p>"My lord is brilliant!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer suddenly understood. How could he have forgotten about the Hundred Battles Hall?</p><p></p><p>However, he frowned again and said: "My lord, Hong Ting is a prodigy of the Hundred Battles Hall with formidable strength. He's not comparable to Yan Ping. To kill him would require an Immortal Venerable to take action, otherwise a True King Venerable couldn't do it. But if multiple people attack together, it would likely be exposed and we couldn't frame Xu Yan for it.</p><p></p><p>"But if an Immortal Venerable takes action, it would be easy to determine that he died at the hands of an Immortal Venerable, and we still wouldn't be able to frame Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer was stunned for a moment. How could he have forgotten about that?</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ting has gone to the Tuowu Heavenly Cave. This is our opportunity. If he's exposed to the Hundred Eyes Light of the Tuowu, his strength will greatly decrease and he won't be able to use his full power. Wouldn't that be our chance?"</p><p></p><p>"My lord is wise! I'll go make arrangements right away!"</p><p></p><p>The newcomer suddenly understood and left excitedly to start making preparations.</p><p></p><p>Eight-Leaf Heavenly Killer let out a breath. The fact that he had been beaten and forced to flee by Xu Yan absolutely could not be leaked. It would damage his prestige!</p><p></p><p>"Next, I need to go into seclusion and find a way to eliminate this trace of sword energy."</p><p></p><p>He thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Inside the Tuowu Heavenly Cave, a young man wielding dual axes was surrounded by lightning-like spiritual light. His fighting spirit was high, like a battle-hardened general who had been through many campaigns.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The lightning-wreathed sharp axes instantly cleaved apart a red-haired, copper-eyed person whose cheeks were covered in red scales!</p><p></p><p>A Tuowu!</p><p></p><p>The invader of this heavenly cave that he had just killed was a Tuowu, but not one of the immensely powerful ones. Rather, it was a weak Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>According to limited information, the weak Tuowu were all descendants of that immensely powerful Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>Hum! Suddenly, light burst forth from one of the Tuowu's bodies. Eyes appeared on its forehead and chest, each eye emitting a strange light.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Eyes Light of the Tuowu!</p><p></p><p>Once illuminated by it, one would become lazy, weak all over, and lose their fighting spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! Let's see if your Tuowu Hundred Eyes Light can shake my fighting spirit!"</p><p></p><p>The young man wielding the dual axes snorted coldly. The lightning-like spiritual light on his body became even brighter at this moment.</p><p></p><p>He held his axes in front of him, his fighting spirit soaring. In his low roar, there seemed to be the sound of thousands of troops in battle.</p><p></p><p>The Will of a Hundred Battles!</p><p></p><p>This was the martial way of the Hundred Battles Hall - condensing the Will of a Hundred Battles, growing stronger with each fight, rising up in adversity. The stronger the enemy encountered, the more intense the fighting spirit, to the point of forgetting life and death!</p><p></p><p>This young man was Hong Ting, one of the prodigies of the Hundred Battles Hall. He possessed a Lightning Spirit Body and had also condensed the Will of a Hundred Battles.</p><p></p><p>This time, he had come to the Long Cloud Realm to further temper his Will of a Hundred Battles and lay the foundation for breaking through to the Immortal Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Battles Hall was a special force spread across more than thirty realms of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were known for their love of battle and often appeared in the heavenly caves of various realms. They fought bravely and disregarded life and death. The more dangerous the place, the more likely one was to see people from the Hundred Battles Hall.</p><p></p><p>They believed in condensing the Will of a Hundred Battles through combat. Once the Will of a Hundred Battles was condensed, one would become indomitable, able to fight in adverse circumstances, and their combat power would surge.</p><p></p><p>The strength of Hundred Battles Hall martial artists was generally 30% higher than other martial artists of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>Among prodigies, when it came to combat, those of the Hundred Battles Hall were more fierce and brave. Prodigies from other major forces would not lightly engage in sparring matches with prodigies from the Hundred Battles Hall.</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of prodigies from other major forces, the prodigies of the Hundred Battles Hall were all madmen! Battle-loving madmen who fought like crazy once they started, with the attitude of fighting to the death.</p><p></p><p>When people from the Hundred Battles Hall had conflicts or grudges with others, they would directly and simply resolve it with a battle.</p><p></p><p>A life-or-death battle. If the Hundred Battles Hall lost, they would admit inferiority and let bygones be bygones.</p><p></p><p>If the enemy lost, naturally they would have achieved their revenge and resolved the conflict.</p><p></p><p>This direct and simple method of resolving grudges seemed to make it easy to settle conflicts with the Hundred Battles Hall, but in reality it was not so. After all, the martial artists of the Hundred Battles Hall were 30% stronger than others of the same realm.</p><p></p><p>And those who fought to resolve grudges were always the elite of the Hundred Battles Hall. When fighting opponents of the same realm, no one had ever survived such a duel.</p><p></p><p>If someone was dissatisfied and violated the duel rules, the Hundred Battles Hall would not be polite. They would directly and forcefully crush them.</p><p></p><p>This straightforward yet decisive style, fighting like madmen, also meant that the major forces in the Divine Realm would not lightly provoke conflicts with the Hundred Battles Hall.</p><p></p><p>The Hundred Battles Hall believed in combat and was full of battle-loving people who fought year-round in the heavenly caves. As long as they didn't actively provoke...</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>They never provoked others, and others never provoked them.</p><p></p><p>Because of this, when members of the Hundred Battles Hall appeared, the various powers actually welcomed them into the Celestial Abyss, as they could help reduce the pressure of guarding it.</p><p></p><p>In fact, when a Celestial Abyss somewhere was invaded on a large scale and the situation became critical, they would immediately seek help from the Hundred Battles Hall. The members of the Hundred Battles Hall never refused, but instead charged into the Celestial Abyss with high morale. Countless critical situations in the Celestial Abyss were suppressed because of the Hundred Battles Hall's assistance.</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting, as one of the geniuses of the Hundred Battles Hall, had fought in many Celestial Abysses and had quite a reputation. News of his arrival at the Tuowu Celestial Abyss in Changyun Territory had naturally spread quickly.</p><p></p><p>All the major powers knew that Hong Ting had come here to train.</p><p></p><p>Buzz! As the light of the hundred eyes of Tuowu shone upon him, Hong Ting's fighting spirit surged. He even let out a roar as his twin axes flashed with lightning, resisting the illumination of the hundred eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Tuowu is indeed quite strange!" </p><p></p><p>Hong Ting was inwardly alarmed. The Tuowu he faced was at a similar level to him, yet the light from its hundred eyes somehow made him feel lazy.</p><p></p><p>It should be noted that with his strength, he was considered top-tier among those at the same level, especially with the Hundred Battles Intent of the Hundred Battles Hall, which was an extremely powerful will-based combat technique.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he could still feel the terrifying nature of the hundred-eyed light.</p><p></p><p>"This is a strange power that erodes will and invades the soul and mind!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting understood inwardly.</p><p></p><p>However, he remained fearless. His fighting spirit grew even stronger, and that slight feeling of laziness was quickly dispelled.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>He stepped forward and swung his great axe. With a flash of lightning, he killed that Tuowu with a "puff" sound!</p><p></p><p>"Mere Tuowu power, how could it shake my will!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting's gaze was sharp as he looked up at the dozen or so Tuowu ahead and strode forward to kill them.</p><p></p><p>Buzz! Those dozen or so Tuowu, holding black tridents, cursed angrily as the hundred eyes on their chests and abdomens opened, emitting powerful hundred-eyed light.</p><p></p><p>Over a dozen Tuowu unleashed their hundred-eyed light together.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting let out a roar, his eyes turning red at this moment. His fighting spirit soared, and his whole being seemed to enter a berserk battle state.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>His twin axes chopped out, the fierce axe power slashing towards the dozen or so Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>Clang! The dozen or so Tuowu raised their tridents to block, and both sides instantly engaged in a fierce battle. The hundred-eyed light continued to shine on Hong Ting, attempting to erode his will.</p><p></p><p>However, Hong Ting fought more and more fiercely, becoming more and more frenzied. There was no sign of him becoming lazy or losing his fighting spirit. Instead, he seemed to enter a state of frenzy.</p><p></p><p>"As expected of a genius from the Hundred Battles Hall. He's too powerful, actually able to resist the hundred-eyed evil light!"</p><p></p><p>"Hong Ting's Hundred Battles Intent is too refined, too pure. No wonder he's one of the Immortal Realm candidates of the Hundred Battles Hall!"</p><p></p><p>The other warriors in the Celestial Abyss couldn't help but exclaim in admiration.</p><p></p><p>Because of the Tuowu's hundred-eyed evil light, none of these warriors dared to face a Tuowu alone. At least two people had to team up.</p><p></p><p>Yet Hong Ting was fighting over a dozen Tuowu single-handedly without falling behind.</p><p></p><p>"Will this alert the avatar of the Tuowu Ancestor?" </p><p></p><p>A warrior asked worriedly.</p><p></p><p>"It shouldn't."</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting's battle with the Tuowu continued. His roars were constant, his fighting spirit high, and he became more frenzied as the battle went on. His crazed appearance made even the Tuowu he was fighting want to retreat.</p><p></p><p>This guy's a madman, too frenzied, and he can even resist the hundred-eyed illumination.</p><p></p><p>Puff! Suddenly, one Tuowu felt the urge to retreat. Just as it was about to back away, Hong Ting seized the opportunity in its moment of weakness and killed it with one axe strike! This made the other Tuowu afraid, and they began to retreat while defending themselves.</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting chased and killed for a while before stopping.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all you've got?"</p><p></p><p>His body was steaming hot, his skin flushed red. His whole being was filled with fighting spirit as he looked at the retreating Tuowu with contempt.</p><p></p><p>"In the process of resisting the Tuowu's hundred eyes, my fighting spirit has been further refined, but my soul power has also been considerably depleted."</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting exhaled, preparing to leave the Celestial Abyss to recuperate.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a Tuowu figure appeared.</p><p></p><p>This Tuowu was different from the others. It had red hair and no scales on its cheeks, looking no different from a normal person.</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting's heart tightened.</p><p></p><p>The other warriors were also shocked and said in unison, "Brother Hong, retreat quickly!"</p><p></p><p>It was an avatar of the Tuowu Ancestor! Or rather, this was the true Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>"The hundred eyes of Tuowu, all who see become lazy, without exception."</p><p></p><p>The Tuowu gazed at Hong Ting indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"An avatar of the Tuowu Ancestor? This avatar of yours hasn't reached the Immortal Realm, it's at the same level as me. What do I have to fear?"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting's fighting spirit rose again.</p><p></p><p>Although it was an avatar of the Tuowu Ancestor, this avatar was only at the True King Heavenly Venerate Realm, the same level as him. What did he have to fear?</p><p></p><p>"I am Tuowu, and Tuowu is me. What Tuowu Ancestor? That's just your ignorance. The rest are merely my puppet Tuowu, not even counting as my blood descendants."</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting's heart tightened. Those he had killed and defeated were merely puppets?</p><p></p><p>Mere puppets had such power?</p><p></p><p>"Fine, then let me, Hong Ting, experience the hundred-eyed evil light of Tuowu!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting remained fearless. He let out a low growl, his fighting spirit now even higher than during the previous battle, appearing even more frenzied.</p><p></p><p>"Kill! Kill! Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting roared as he charged towards the Tuowu.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, a hundred eyes appeared on the Tuowu's body, suddenly opening. The hundred eyes seemed to have a hundred different gazes, a hundred different expressions, each eye looking extremely strange.</p><p></p><p>There was no dazzling light, only strangeness.</p><p></p><p>"Kill!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting suddenly stopped, roaring frantically. However, he was horrified to find that his fighting spirit was disintegrating under the gaze of the hundred eyes.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that the feeling of laziness was growing stronger and stronger. His fighting spirit was crumbling. It felt like lying limp on the ground, being lazy and not moving, would be the most comfortable thing to do.</p><p></p><p>"Not good!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting was inwardly alarmed. He knew he couldn't resist the hundred-eyed evil light.</p><p></p><p>Before becoming completely lazy, Hong Ting's figure flew backwards, retreating frantically.</p><p></p><p>The hundred eyes of the Tuowu disappeared. It looked at him indifferently, not pursuing to kill. Instead, the corner of its mouth turned up slightly as it said, "The number of geniuses who have fallen under my hundred eyes is not small. Let's see if you can pull yourself together."</p><p></p><p>It turned and stepped away, its figure disappearing into the depths of the Celestial Abyss.</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting now had a look of horror on his face. He felt his whole body starting to go limp. His entire being seemed unable to muster any energy. The thought of lying limp on the ground, doing nothing, not even bothering to raise a hand to defend himself if attacked, was growing stronger and stronger!</p><p></p><p>"This hundred-eyed evil light is too strange, too powerful!"</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting hurriedly left the Celestial Abyss. He had to find a way to deal with the Tuowu's power as soon as possible.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, several figures appeared in his mind. It was rumored that they had all once been famous geniuses, but for some unknown reason had become lazy, neither cultivating nor even bothering to fight back when beaten.</p><p></p><p>They had become so lazy that they were unrecognizable, their cultivation regressing until one day they died from laziness!</p><p></p><p>Hong Ting suddenly understood. They had all been illuminated by the Tuowu's hundred-eyed evil light, which was why they had ended up like that.</p><p></p><p>Thinking that he might become like that as well, a feeling of fear arose in his heart.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

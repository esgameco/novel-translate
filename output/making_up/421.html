        <h1>Chapter 421</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan naturally didn't know what kind of being Mingwu was. Regardless of his strength, he was already dead after all, so what did it matter to call him an ant?</p><p></p><p>"How would I remember the name of an ant? Those whose names I can remember are few, and not even worth mentioning," Li Xuan said earnestly. </p><p></p><p>He had to let his disciple know not to ask if he knew every strong person they encountered. In his eyes, they were all ants, and ants weren't worthy of him remembering their names!</p><p></p><p>"Who was that towering figure? My disciple, if he's alive, you'll naturally know when your strength reaches that level. If he's already dead, there's no use in you knowing.</p><p></p><p>"Focus on your cultivation and strive to comprehend the Heavenly Realm martial arts method soon. Then I'll pass on new martial arts methods to you.</p><p></p><p>"Just treat him as a short-term goal, and strive to surpass him soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to reply earnestly.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple understands. Master is pleased!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded with satisfaction, and encouraged his disciple further.</p><p></p><p>"Mingwu? I never remember the names of ants. If you have questions, ask your senior brother."</p><p></p><p>Seeing Meng Chong's message also asking about Mingwu, Li Xuan's mouth twitched, and he told him to go ask Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan couldn't help but think of someone.</p><p></p><p>Meiwu!</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, "Meiwu, could she be on the same level as this Mingwu? If that's really the case, I can't defeat her true form right now."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky. No matter how strong Meiwu was, she couldn't come in to seek revenge on him for now, so she posed no threat.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is confident he'll soon comprehend the Heavenly Realm martial arts method. I'm also about to break through to the Heavenly Realm. My strength will make a huge leap, and I won't be far from transcending heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Who was that figure, and who was he fighting?</p><p></p><p>"I'm afraid only the one in the stone house in Wu Kingdom would know. It involves changes in the Taicang world.</p><p></p><p>"After breaking through to the Heavenly Realm and memorizing the Taicang general principles, I'll go meet him and explore these secrets of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had a plan in mind.</p><p></p><p>Understanding the realms of these supreme experts would be more beneficial for him to create subsequent martial arts methods.</p><p></p><p>"I've almost completely memorized the general principles of the Taicang Book."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was very excited.</p><p></p><p>Once he fully memorized the Taicang Book, he had a feeling that he could use it to control the laws of the Taicang world. Even if he couldn't fully control the entire Taicang world, he could still manipulate some of its laws.</p><p></p><p>"When I break through to the Heavenly Realm and comprehend the origin of the Taicang world, although I won't be the master of the Taicang world, I'll be able to protect myself even if I encounter supreme experts within the Taicang world, unless their strength is comparable to the owner of the Taicang Book."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly felt much more confident.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Traveling alone through the wilderness, the world was desolate. After half a month of solitary walking, he finally crossed the wilderness and entered the Changyun territory.</p><p></p><p>After exchanging messages with Meng Chong and Jiang Buping, Xu Yan began to look for a place to seclude himself.</p><p></p><p>"The Changyun territory hasn't been disturbed yet. Tianshadiying probably doesn't know I've already left the Jiushan territory. It's a good time to seclude myself and consume the Seven Wonders Divine Flower."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"I must surpass that figure soon!"</p><p></p><p>Master was right to set a short-term goal of surpassing that powerful expert!</p><p></p><p>"Master called it a short-term goal, which means that figure's strength isn't too impressive in Master's eyes?" Xu Yan muttered.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, Master is truly a great expert, truly invincible. Master is so reclusive, it must be because he's lonely from being invincible."</p><p></p><p>Thinking back to when he first met his master in the small mountain village, Xu Yan now understood more clearly. His master's seclusion in a remote mountain village was clearly because he had been invincible for too long, had no opponents left in the world, and lost interest. He secluded himself in the small mountain village out of loneliness.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to experience Master's state of loneliness from being invincible?</p><p></p><p>"Unless I surpass Master, I'll never be able to experience it.</p><p></p><p>"Since Master is lonely from being invincible and secluded in a small mountain village, is it also because he's reached the end of the martial path?</p><p></p><p>"At the end of the martial path, is Master supreme?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered with great emotion.</p><p></p><p>"No, Master has repeatedly said that the martial path is endless, so Master is actually still walking on the martial path, constantly pioneering new martial ways.</p><p></p><p>"Because on the martial path where Master is, there are no more companions, no more equals.</p><p></p><p>"Everyone else has long been left behind, and he walks alone, so he's lonely and secluded himself in a small mountain village!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized that his master's strength was unimaginable.</p><p></p><p>"This is the place."</p><p></p><p>In the Changyun territory near the wilderness, mountains were layered with verdant forests, and clouds stretched across them. There were few traces of people. In a valley of ancient green trees, a cave was hidden among grass, wood, and vines.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around. This place was perfect for secluding himself to consume the Seven Wonders Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>He immediately set up a concealment formation, and the Mountains and Rivers Illusion also appeared, merging into the valley.</p><p></p><p>The valley was still that valley, but it was now formed by the Mountains and Rivers Illusion.</p><p></p><p>Inside the cave, after cleaning up, Xu Yan began his seclusion.</p><p></p><p>In the Jiushan territory.</p><p></p><p>Tianshadiying began to search for traces of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, while the Immortal Venerable from Hengfeng Mountain and Qiandie Mountain personally set out to search within the Jiushan territory.</p><p></p><p>Dagai Mountain also became one of their search targets, after all, Xu Yan had some friendship with Wan Tianlin and connections with the Wan family.</p><p></p><p>However, the Wan family's strength was ultimately extremely powerful, with top Immortal Venerables stationed there, so they weren't afraid of them.</p><p></p><p>Time passed quickly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had suddenly disappeared without a trace again, just like before. No matter how they searched, they couldn't find any clues to their whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>"Could these two have some supreme treasure to conceal themselves?" Tian Shiqi frowned.</p><p></p><p>The treasures had all been sent to Wind Spirit Tiger, but they couldn't find the people, so naturally Wind Spirit Tiger had no way to take action. In that case, hadn't they given Wind Spirit Tiger treasures for nothing?</p><p></p><p>At Spirit Venerable Mountain, Tian Shiqi came again.</p><p></p><p>"What, have you found them?" Wind Spirit Tiger sat on his throne, looking down at Tian Shiqi from above. This made Tian Shiqi's face darken a bit. This tiger was getting more and more fond of putting on airs.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, let's change the request. We won't kill Xu Yan and Meng Chong anymore. Help me do something else instead."</p><p></p><p>"Well... Who do you think I am? You think you can change the deal whenever you want? If you want to change our cooperation, give me another set of treasures. Otherwise, forget it!"</p><p></p><p>Wind Spirit Tiger was about to agree at first, but changed his mind at the last moment.</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi glanced at the striped old tiger beside Wind Spirit Tiger. Wind Spirit Tiger's changes seemed to be related to this tiger.</p><p></p><p>Including the changes in Spirit Venerable Mountain, which were also related to it.</p><p></p><p>"Wind Spirit King, double the amount is a bit much," Tian Shiqi shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"It's not too much. It must be double!" Wind Spirit Tiger's attitude was firm.</p><p></p><p>Brother was right, why put in effort when you can get things for free?</p><p></p><p>If they wanted him to put in effort again, they must prepare additional treasures to offer. This way, it wouldn't damage his dignity as the Wind Spirit King!</p><p></p><p>Tian Shiqi pondered for a moment, then said, "How about this, I can offer double the treasures, but where I need you to take action is not in the Jiushan territory. You'll need to leave the Jiushan territory..."</p><p></p><p>Before he could finish speaking, Wind Spirit Tiger interrupted, "Leave the Jiushan territory? Travel long distances</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"So far away, double isn't enough!"</p><p></p><p>Damn! Tian Seventeen's face darkened.</p><p></p><p>He looked at Red Cat, pondered for a moment, then transmitted a message: "I'll give you one treasure if you can persuade Wind Spirit King. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat remained expressionless and replied: "Elder Brother Wind Spirit is the king of our Spirit Veneration Mountain. How could he leave so easily? Not possible!" His attitude was very firm.</p><p></p><p>"How about this - as long as you persuade Wind Spirit King, I'll give you a treasure to help elevate your bloodline and become an immortal-level spirit beast. What do you say?"</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen seemed to have made up his mind, willing to pay a big price to invite Wind Spirit King.</p><p></p><p>"And don't worry, Wind Spirit King won't leave the Nine Mountains Realm right away. You'll have enough time to reach immortality. That way, when Wind Spirit King leaves, you can take charge, and the spirit beasts of Spirit Veneration Mountain won't be without a ruler!"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Red Cat fell into deep thought. Tian Seventeen's insistence on cooperating with Wind Spirit Tiger must mean there's some inside information, maybe even a threat to Wind Spirit Tiger.</p><p></p><p>However, since it wasn't an immediate departure, there would still be opportunities.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, a treasure that could help it reach immortality was certainly extraordinary. Although it wasn't a spirit beast and cultivated the Great Demon method, such a treasure would undoubtedly bring huge improvements.</p><p></p><p>"Once Wind Spirit Tiger leaves, it will be time for me to establish the demon race. I, Red Cat the Great Demon King, should make my debut. Tian Sha and Di Ying's schemes may be significant, perhaps even life-threatening to Wind Spirit Tiger."</p><p></p><p>"After all, Wind Spirit Tiger is a powerful member of my tiger clan. I call him Elder Brother now, but if I save his life, it would be natural for him to call me Great King and become a general under my command as the Great Demon King."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Red Cat replied: "That's my elder brother. How could I send him into danger? You must increase the price!"</p><p></p><p>Under his mask, Tian Seventeen's face grew darker. This striped tiger was truly greedy. But a greedy tiger would be easier to manipulate.</p><p></p><p>If Wind Spirit Tiger failed, this tiger could still be useful.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Tian Seventeen nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Then give my elder brother three treasures, and give me two. I'm afraid one won't be enough for a breakthrough!"</p><p></p><p>Red Cat said matter-of-factly.</p><p></p><p>Since Tian Seventeen was so insistent on Wind Spirit Tiger's cooperation, he naturally had to make big demands and rake in as much as possible.</p><p></p><p>"Very well then." Tian Seventeen agreed.</p><p></p><p>He spoke again: "Wind Spirit King, three treasures. No more than that."</p><p></p><p>"Good, it's a deal!" Wind Spirit Tiger agreed immediately, very decisively.</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen became even more convinced that this striped tiger was the real decision-maker.</p><p></p><p>"When the time is right, I'll deliver the treasures."</p><p></p><p>Tian Seventeen turned and left.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan swallowed the Seven Wonders Divine Flower in one gulp. His whole body was enveloped in seven-colored light as he entered a state of enlightenment. The martial path he had traveled so far appeared before him one by one.</p><p></p><p>More and more realizations emerged in his mind.</p><p></p><p>His pure and flawless martial foundation glowed with light. Above his spirit platform, his primordial spirit opened its eyes, seeming to see a series of images.</p><p></p><p>In the hazy vision, he saw a world.</p><p></p><p>And a majestic figure that could make martial artists bow in worship.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in enlightenment, his body shrouded in seven-colored light as the Seven Wonders Divine Flower slowly refined.</p><p></p><p>"My martial path."</p><p></p><p>"Holy Sword Realm, no sword not worshipped, no sword not followed... So that's how it is. I finally understand how to cultivate the Holy Sword Realm. The door to the Holy Sword Realm has opened."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized in his heart that this was the profundity of the Holy Sword Realm. At this moment, he fully understood how to cultivate the Holy Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although the road ahead was long, he had finally found the direction.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had mastered the Wisdom Sword Realm.</p><p></p><p>His aura was also strengthening, just one step away from mastering the Divine Image Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Rivers and Mountains Sacred Body was also glowing with light, its aura constantly rising.</p><p></p><p>Who knows how much time had passed.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he took that step, and his aura suddenly increased greatly.</p><p></p><p>Divine Image Realm mastered! One step closer to the Void Breaking Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Using the body as heaven and earth, using the divine image as the form of heaven and earth, using one's own martial dao laws as the laws of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was immersed in comprehending the martial methods of the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>He had only been one step away from fully comprehending the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>Now, under the effect of the Seven Wonders Divine Flower, he was organizing his martial dao, from the Blood Qi Realm all the way to the Void Breaking Realm he had already comprehended. Every realm was integrated, presenting a clear martial path.</p><p></p><p>And the Heaven and Earth Realm was also appearing on this martial path.</p><p></p><p>"So that's how it is, I understand now!"</p><p></p><p>After an unknown amount of time, Xu Yan suddenly realized. His martial path instantly expanded, continuously extending, as if entering a world of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>This was a great leap on the martial path.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he comprehended the martial methods of the Heaven and Earth Realm.</p><p></p><p>The seven-colored light enveloping his body was also fading away.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan exhaled and opened his eyes. "Mei Wu is truly a good person. This Seven Wonders Divine Flower is indeed an extraordinary treasure. I wonder if she has even better treasures."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan wanted to see Mei Wu again and ask her if she had any treasures even more wondrous than the Seven Wonders Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>If she did, he wouldn't mind being "schemed" by her again.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and Earth Realm, I've comprehended it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was extremely excited.</p><p></p><p>"I must strive to break through to the Void Breaking Realm soon."</p><p></p><p>Now that he had mastered the Divine Image Realm, the Void Breaking Realm wasn't far off. However, before breaking through, he needed to accumulate foundation and transform during the breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Breaking Realm should be the final transformation, right? The Heaven and Earth Realm probably can't transform anymore. That's no longer a realm of physical transformation."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan realized in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The transformation when breaking through to the Void Breaking Realm was already the final physical transformation.</p><p></p><p>The Heaven and Earth Realm had surpassed the level of physical transformation.</p><p></p><p>Even if transformation was possible, it wouldn't be a physical transformation, or it wouldn't be achievable just by continuing to accumulate foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Ten years to break through to Void Breaking!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan set a small goal for himself - to break through to the Void Breaking Realm within ten years.</p><p></p><p>"If Mei Wu helps, perhaps it won't take ten years!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"I heard there's a Demon Magic Sky Cave in the Long Cloud Realm. I wonder if there's a way to get Mei Wu to come find me."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu's strength must be extremely powerful. The stronger one is, the more wondrous treasures they have. She must have treasures superior to the Seven Wonders Divine Flower.</p><p></p><p>"Long Cloud Realm, here I come!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked out of the cave, waved his hand to put away the formation disk, and soared into the sky, heading towards a large city in the Long Cloud Realm to learn about some information, especially about the location of the Sky Cave.</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, ordinary Immortal Venerable Lords can't do anything to me anymore."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's confidence greatly increased. With the Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword, even facing top Immortal Venerable Lords like Da Yue Huang, he could resist and easily escape.</p><p></p><p>A day later, a large city appeared in his view. Xu Yan entered the city and began to inquire about the Sky Caves in the Long Cloud Realm, wondering which Sky Cave might have a chance of attracting Mei Wu.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

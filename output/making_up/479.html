        <h1>Chapter 479</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt into English:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan hesitated briefly, then waved his hand. The Dragon Subduing Palm force coiled around the true dragon was withdrawn one by one, until finally eighteen golden giant dragons circled around him.</p><p></p><p>Looking at the jade-white true dragon again, her crimson eyes had disappeared, and she had regained her consciousness and rationality.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the jade-white true dragon appeared somewhat weak. She glared at Xu Yan, with shock and anger in the depths of her eyes, as well as confusion and bewilderment.</p><p></p><p>"You..." </p><p></p><p>She wanted to say something, but ultimately closed her mouth and turned to leave.</p><p></p><p>Roar! As a result, a golden giant dragon coiled over, instantly entangling with her.</p><p></p><p>The jade-white true dragon struggled and cursed, "You shameless bastard, you lecher, what are you trying to do!"</p><p></p><p>"You're the dragon I subdued. Who said you could leave without my permission?" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand, and the golden giant dragon entangled with the jade-white true dragon, dragging her over.</p><p></p><p>"Let me go, you- you shameless, you- you..."</p><p></p><p>The jade-white true dragon struggled, but at this time, her energy had weakened considerably. How could she resist? She was entangled by the golden giant dragon and continuously dragged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this scene, all the onlookers were stunned. Looking at the two intertwined dragons, the corners of their mouths twitched involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>No wonder the jade-white true dragon was almost crying with anger. This entangled posture was indeed somewhat indecent!</p><p></p><p>"You caused such a great disaster in the Divine Realm and thought you could just leave? You've been subdued by me now, so surrender."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and sent out another golden giant dragon to coil around her.</p><p></p><p>"It was you who ambushed me. I haven't even settled accounts with you yet, and now you want to pin the blame on me? Dream on!"</p><p></p><p>The jade-white true dragon struggled, furious.</p><p></p><p>Then she became aggrieved, her voice carrying a crying tone: "You people are so despicable, taking advantage of my youth and ignorance. You bastard, humiliating me like this, I- I..."</p><p></p><p>At this point, the golden giant dragon had dragged the jade-white true dragon over. The jade-white true dragon seemed to be sobbing, having given up struggling.</p><p></p><p>Seeing the true dragon subdued, many of the watching powerful experts immediately became excited.</p><p></p><p>However, the tremors in the Divine Realm continued. They all realized that great changes in the Divine Realm had begun, and it was all related to this true dragon.</p><p></p><p>Swoosh! A figure instantly came forward and said, "Young friend Xu, this dragon has committed heinous crimes and brought calamity to the Divine Realm. In my opinion, we should skin her alive, extract her tendons, and divide her flesh to eat!"</p><p></p><p>By the end, his eyes had become somewhat fanatical.</p><p></p><p>When the jade-white true dragon heard this, she immediately screamed in fright: "You dare? You all dare? My grandfather won't let you get away with this!"</p><p></p><p>However, she had no strength to struggle. At this moment, her eyes were filled with despair.</p><p></p><p>Following the first martial artist's words, the rest of the watching Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords immediately came forward, angrily saying in unison: "That's right, this dragon has committed heinous crimes and brought calamity to the Divine Realm. We should skin her alive, extract her tendons, and divide her flesh to eat to quench the hatred in our hearts!"</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Xu, you absolutely cannot spare this true dragon!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, the evil of this dragon cannot be forgiven!"</p><p></p><p>"We implore Young Master Xu to severely punish this dragon, skin her alive, extract her tendons, eat her flesh and drink her blood!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, emotions ran high. They wanted to skin the true dragon alive, extract her tendons, eat her flesh and drink her blood. They even invoked the greater good of the Divine Realm, and didn't forget to praise Xu Yan, saying they would erect statues of him, make his name known for thousands of years, calling him the savior of the Divine Realm's great calamity, and so on.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao narrowed his eyes slightly, silently observing, but didn't speak.</p><p></p><p>The Sect Master of Tai Miao and others seemed lost in thought. Several elders were somewhat tempted, but were stopped by the Sect Master of Tai Miao's gaze.</p><p></p><p>"These people want to eat the dragon!" </p><p></p><p>Du Yuying said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Moreover, they want to coerce Young Master Xu with righteousness, and even hope that Young Master Xu will agree in the midst of their praise!"</p><p></p><p>Yun Miaomiao also said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression remained unchanged as he looked at the jade-white true dragon and said, "You see, they all want to eat you. Even if I let you go, in your current state, could you survive?"</p><p></p><p>"What- what do you want?" </p><p></p><p>The jade-white true dragon's voice was trembling, her eyes full of despair.</p><p></p><p>In her view, with so many powerful experts in an uproar, invoking the righteousness of the Divine Realm, seeking justice for the victims of the Divine Realm, and the temptation of erecting statues to make his name known for thousands of years, Xu Yan would surely agree.</p><p></p><p>She was doomed!</p><p></p><p>"If you want to live, open your mind."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I open my mind, you can protect me?"</p><p></p><p>The jade-white true dragon was somewhat doubtful.</p><p></p><p>"Of course. They're just a bunch of nobodies. Do they think they can threaten me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>The true dragon hesitated for a moment, then nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this point, she had no choice. And by opening her mind, no matter what method Xu Yan used, as long as her grandfather appeared, he would surely be able to remove it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and waved, imprinting a mark into the true dragon's mind. It was a small golden giant dragon, the dragon-subduing mark he possessed after mastering the Dragon Subduing Palm.</p><p></p><p>Once the true dragon was imprinted with the mark, she was thoroughly subdued! The true dragon only felt as if a small golden dragon was coiled in her mind, emanating a certain majestic aura that made her not dare to act rashly at all.</p><p></p><p>Her heart sank involuntarily.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of technique is this? It's too terrifying. And the golden dragons he manifested are almost indistinguishable from us true dragons. It seems to be a method that specifically counters us true dragons!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, she became less confident about whether she could remove the golden dragon mark from her mind.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the voices of angry people were growing louder and more numerous. The Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords who had successively arrived also joined in after learning about the situation. Their eyes were fanatical as they stared at the flawless jade-white true dragon.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan imprinted the dragon-subduing mark, he waved his hand, and the Dragon Subduing Palm force disappeared, restoring the true dragon's freedom.</p><p></p><p>"Young Hero Xu..."</p><p></p><p>The crowd of Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lords, their eyes fanatical, wanted to say something more.</p><p></p><p>"Enough noise! All of you, shut up!"</p><p></p><p>A voice like thunder rang out.</p><p></p><p>Then sword light rose from all directions, filling the world with a sense of annihilation, as if in an instant, it could kill all the powerful experts.</p><p></p><p>"How I handle matters is none of your business!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was cold, his sword intent soaring to the sky.</p><p></p><p>The uproar of voices immediately fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"Young Master Xu, this true dragon has caused such a great calamity and killed so many. How can you just let her off like this? Where is the face and dignity of our human race? Could it be that Young Master Xu, you would disregard the dignity and face of our human race..."</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Heavenly Venerable Lord began to speak righteously and indignantly.</p><p></p><p>Puff! A sword light slashed down, and before he could finish speaking, he directly turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>"What does your dignity have to do with me, Xu Yan? What, do you represent the human race now? Talking about dividing and eating at every turn. Do you think you can deceive me, Xu Yan, because I'm young and don't understand your intentions?</p><p></p><p>"Or do you think my sword is not sharp enough?!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a step forward, sword light soaring to the sky. The Ten Directions Annihilation Sword illuminated in all directions, filling the world with a sense of annihilation, as if anyone who dared to say otherwise would be annihilated to ash! At this moment, the clamoring martial artists suddenly felt a chill in their hearts. Their faces showed shocked expressions as they suddenly realized that Sword God Xu Yan was also a fierce person!</p><p></p><p>Not to be trifled with! Absolutely not to be trifled with!</p><p></p><p>"We wouldn't dare! We wouldn't dare!"</p><p></p><p>"The true dragon was subdued by Young Master Xu, naturally it's up to Young Master Xu to handle as he sees fit!"</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Yes, yes, we have no objections, not a single objection!" </p><p></p><p>The group of immortal celestial lords immediately became submissive.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, Yun Miaomiao and Du Yuying's eyes became entranced. As expected of Young Master Xu Yan, he was as domineering as ever, looking down on the crowd as always!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" Xu Yan let out a light snort, and the sword light disappeared. He raised his head to look at the sky. The tremors in the divine realm were still continuing, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth became even more active, but also seemed somewhat agitated.</p><p></p><p>"Is heaven and earth becoming one?" Xu Yan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He turned back to look at the true dragon and asked, "What's your name?"</p><p></p><p>"Ao... Ao Yuxue!" A crisp young girl's voice replied.</p><p></p><p>After speaking, Ao Yuxue transformed into human form. She was a girl wearing snow-white clothes, with an extremely beautiful face and two small horns about an inch long on her head.</p><p></p><p>After transforming into human form, Ao Yuxue's face looked extremely pale, her aura weak, showing she had consumed a great deal of energy.</p><p></p><p>"You..." There was still fear lingering in her eyes as she looked at Xu Yan, wanting to say something, but not knowing how to begin.</p><p></p><p>"Judging by your appearance, you've consumed a huge amount of energy, almost injuring your essence, right?" Xu Yan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Ao Yuxue responded softly.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, she didn't dare to show even a hint of dragon might. The proud true dragon had lowered her head.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was simply too inconceivable. That golden giant dragon was just like a real true dragon, and was actually able to suppress her.</p><p></p><p>"Within the same realm, my true dragon clan will definitely be restrained by this technique!" Ao Yuxue was shocked in her heart.</p><p></p><p>Her realm was originally stronger than Xu Yan's, yet she was still suppressed. Although not everyone who cultivated this technique could be as powerful as Xu Yan, it was almost certain that in a battle between equals, the true dragon clan was very likely to be at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue's heart grew heavy as she thought about what had happened to her. She seemed to sense a huge conspiracy coming against the true dragon clan.</p><p></p><p>She had been suppressed, would the other members of the true dragon clan also be suppressed?</p><p></p><p>Even her grandfather...</p><p></p><p>The more she thought about it, the more alarmed Ao Yuxue became.</p><p></p><p>"Then you can rest in here." Xu Yan raised his hand, and a small tortoise shell appeared, which was the shell of the Primal Tortoise.</p><p></p><p>When Ao Yuxue saw it, she was shocked again, her eyes widening unconsciously.</p><p></p><p>"This is?" </p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's eyes widened at this moment, looking at the Primal Tortoise shell in Xu Yan's hand with a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>A space containing a small world, this was a supreme treasure of heaven and earth. Such treasures could only be possessed by powerhouses who were masters of small worlds.</p><p></p><p>To put it bluntly, only those who had originally obtained the purple light to open up a small world could possess such supreme treasures.</p><p></p><p>"This tortoise is?" Old Man Xiao frowned. The tortoise shell in Xu Yan's hand gave him a familiar feeling.</p><p></p><p>"The Primal Tortoise?" Suddenly, he thought of a powerful true spirit.</p><p></p><p>His heart was shocked, and then he realized.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it contains a small world, so it's the shell of the Primal Tortoise. It seems the Primal Tortoise has perished."</p><p></p><p>However, he was very curious why the shell of the Primal Tortoise after its death was in Xu Yan's hands.</p><p></p><p>"Could it be that the person behind Xu Yan is related to the Unchanging Land?"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao frowned.</p><p></p><p>Ao Yuxue had already transformed into a beam of white light and entered the Primal Tortoise shell.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan put away the Primal Tortoise shell and looked at the group of immortal celestial lords with varying expressions. His expression was calm, not fearing at all that these people would come to snatch the treasure.</p><p></p><p>Then, his gaze fell on Old Man Xiao, and his expression became solemn.</p><p></p><p>"This person is so strong, a powerhouse of the Dao Realm?"</p><p></p><p>Although Old Man Xiao had hidden himself well, appearing to be just an ordinary immortal celestial lord, he couldn't escape Xu Yan's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Apart from my master, this person is the strongest I've ever seen."</p><p></p><p>Of course, if that majestic figure was counted, this person was still not as strong.</p><p></p><p>However, among the strong people he had personally seen, this was the strongest one. Xu Yan secretly assessed that this person's strength was probably greater than Dun Wu and Yan Mo.</p><p></p><p>As for how strong Mei Wu was, Xu Yan couldn't easily assess. After all, Mei Wu's power was somewhat special. If this person couldn't resist Mei Wu's charm, no matter how strong he was, it would be useless.</p><p></p><p>"Promising youth indeed. At such a young age, you've already subdued a true dragon. This is unprecedented in history."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao suddenly smiled.</p><p></p><p>In a single step, he came before Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" Xu Yan asked vigilantly.</p><p></p><p>"You can call me Old Man Xiao." Old Man Xiao stroked his beard, his face full of kindness.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, however, he was secretly shocked. Xu Yan had actually discovered his unusualness, which he had never encountered before.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan's strength was comparable to his, or even surpassed his, Old Man Xiao would have found it normal for him to see through him. However, Xu Yan's strength was far inferior to his.</p><p></p><p>Yet he could see through him at a glance?</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, who is your master? Perhaps this old man is an old acquaintance of your master."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He was very curious about who had nurtured such a prodigy as Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head and said, "My master couldn't possibly be an old acquaintance of yours."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, why? This old man has traveled the world and knows countless supreme powerhouses."</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"Because you're too weak. My master never remembers the names of the weak, so I'm sure you're not an old acquaintance of my master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said sincerely.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's smile froze, and the hand stroking his beard stopped. "This old man is too weak? Young man, do you know what level of strength this old man actually has? It's no exaggeration to say that in the entire world, those who can match me are few!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Old Man Xiao straightened his back and said proudly.</p><p></p><p>"You said it yourself, in the entire world, those who can match you are few. But the entire world, in my master's eyes, is as small as a speck of dust. There is no one in the world who can match my master, so I'm sure you're not an old acquaintance of my master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said seriously.</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao's mouth twitched, his face turning black. "Good! Good! Good! This old man must ask, what exactly is your master called, that he views the world as small as a speck of dust?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed and said, "Senior, you should stop inquiring about my master. My master's name carries too much karma, you can't bear it!"</p><p></p><p>Fuck! Old Man Xiao almost swore out loud. Even a name as powerful as Tai Cang didn't carry unbearable karma. In this world, including the Unchanging Land of混蒙, there was no name that he couldn't bear.</p><p></p><p>"It's fine! Just tell me. If this old man can't bear the karma and dies, it's what I deserve. I won't blame you!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao took a deep breath and said with a black face.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was silent for a moment, then said helplessly, "Senior, it doesn't matter if you die, but my master's name carries such great karma that even heaven and earth can't bear it. We can't cause a great calamity in heaven and earth because of you!"</p><p></p><p>Old Man Xiao was dumbfounded. One couldn't boast like this. A name that even the Tai Cang heaven and earth couldn't bear, that would cause a great calamity in heaven and earth?!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

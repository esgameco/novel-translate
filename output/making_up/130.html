        <h1>Chapter 130</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Speak, where is the person?" </p><p></p><p>As the manager of the Wushuang Pavilion left, a figure in a black robe emanated a surging aura, and a gloomy voice spoke.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not the least bit flustered. "Where are the spirit crystals? Bring out the spirit crystals and let me see them. If I take you there, what if you don't give me the spirit crystals?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's eyes turned cold, and a powerful aura of a Sect Master erupted, trying to intimidate him.</p><p></p><p>"Don't think that just because you're a Sect Master, you're so impressive. Without the spirit crystals, there's nothing to discuss."</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan remained unmoved.</p><p></p><p>"You're courting death!" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's eyes were filled with murderous intent.</p><p></p><p>"The spirit crystals can be given to you!"</p><p></p><p>Another black-robed man waved his hand, stopping his companion from taking action, and summoned ten spirit tickets, sending them flying towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and reached out to take the spirit tickets, each worth 10,000 spirit crystals, totaling 100,000 spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>"Spirit crystals aren't that hard to earn after all," he said cheerfully as he pocketed the spirit crystals. "What about the spirit herbs?"</p><p></p><p>"Since we've found the person, the spirit herbs will naturally be given to you," the black-robed man said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, bring them over then," Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>A mere Grade 7 spirit herb, if the black-robed men had it on them, he could naturally obtain it.</p><p></p><p>"The enemy of your disciple sister, what kind of force are they? Judging from their evasive behavior, they don't seem like good people. They probably want to kill and silence her. They didn't even want to give the spirit crystals and herbs, did they?"</p><p></p><p>He sneered inwardly, then rose into the air and flew in a certain direction.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed men exchanged a glance and quickly followed after him.</p><p></p><p>As a Great Sect Master and a Peak Sect Master, they naturally did not fear Xu Yan, a mere Sect Master. As long as they captured him, they could easily retrieve the 100,000 spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's speed was not particularly fast, just the average speed of a Sect Master cultivator.</p><p></p><p>"What are your names, gentlemen?" Xu Yan asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"In a business transaction, there's no need to know too much," the black-robed man replied coldly.</p><p></p><p>"That can't be right. Who knows, we might have a chance to do business again in the future? People like you two, who are so generous with your resources, are already quite rare."</p><p></p><p>He continued chattering, "By the way, what do you want with that young lady? Is she an important person to you?"</p><p></p><p>"You've said too much. Don't ask about things you shouldn't," the black-robed man said sternly, his gaze at Xu Yan akin to that of looking at a dead man.</p><p></p><p>"I've figured it out. That young lady is very important, very important to you. If she's so important, is 100,000 spirit crystals too little?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan narrowed his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, don't have any ideas. The consequences would be more than you can bear," the black-robed man said in a cold, harsh tone.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have any ideas, I just want to earn more spirit crystals. You two seem quite wealthy. How many spirit crystals do you have on you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan noticed they had arrived at a desolate area with no signs of life.</p><p></p><p>No need to keep up the act.</p><p></p><p>The two black-robed men's gazes sharpened, and one of them sneered, "Sir, could it be that you're coveting the wealth on our persons? Hmph, you should measure your own abilities!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Their powerful auras erupted, revealing their Peak Sect Master and Great Sect Master levels.</p><p></p><p>The other black-robed man also unleashed his Great Sect Master strength, preparing to directly subdue Xu Yan and interrogate him about Suli Xiu's whereabouts. If he had dared to deceive them, he would deserve to die!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "I'm tired of your evasive behavior."</p><p></p><p>He paused, then raised a hand and unleashed a palm strike.</p><p></p><p>Roar! A golden giant dragon roared out, directly charging towards the Peak Sect Master.</p><p></p><p>Trouble! </p><p></p><p>The Peak Sect Master's expression changed drastically. He tried to muster his full power to resist the attack, but under the might of the golden dragon, he appeared so insignificant.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The dragon struck, instantly shattering him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved swiftly, absorbing everything the black-robed men had on them. The golden dragon circled and churned, emanating scorching energy.</p><p></p><p>The shattered remains of the Peak Sect Master were ground into ash, scattered by the wind.</p><p></p><p>The sudden change of events had caught the Great Sect Master off guard. His companion had been reduced to ash before he could even act.</p><p></p><p>He was horrified! A Great Sect Master? How could a mere Sect Master instantly annihilate a Peak Sect Master with a single strike?</p><p></p><p>"Flee!" </p><p></p><p>That was the only thought in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to move, a golden dragon coiled around him, trapping him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan collected the spirit tickets he had obtained, finding that these black-robed men were indeed wealthy, another tens of thousands of spirit crystals added to his account. This trip had been worthwhile.</p><p></p><p>"Hand over everything," Xu Yan said coldly.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's eyes were filled with terror and he angrily said, "Are you from the Demonic Sect?"</p><p></p><p>This bastard had tricked them, pretending to have information about Suli Xiu, but in the end, he was just here to kill and loot.</p><p></p><p>The first thing he thought of was the Demonic Sect, as many cultivators who did such things were often from there.</p><p></p><p>"Demonic Sect? What nonsense. Stop stalling and hand over your things, or I'll spare your life," Xu Yan said icily.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" </p><p></p><p>The black-robed man quickly handed over everything on him, another over 10,000 spirit crystals added to Xu Yan's gains.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw this and frowned, "Where's the Grade 7 spirit herb? Good, you didn't intend to pay me for that, did you?"</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's eyelid twitched a few times before he said, "The spirit herb is at the Wushuang Pavilion. After capturing the person, you can go to the Wushuang Pavilion to claim it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clasped his hands behind his back and stepped forward, saying, "Take off your mask. You're hiding your identity, unfit for a Sect Master."</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man's gaze turned cold, but he was weaker, so he could only remove his mask.</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man with a pale complexion and short beard was revealed.</p><p></p><p>"What force do you belong to?" Xu Yan asked.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man said in a deep voice, "Sir, you know too much, and it's not good for you."</p><p></p><p>"Hmph, I've already killed your people. Are you still afraid I'll know more? Are you going to tell me or not?"</p><p></p><p>The golden dragon began to constrict, its dragon head shining with brilliant light, exuding a powerful aura.</p><p></p><p>"Even if you kill me, I have nothing to tell!" The black-robed man's attitude was resolute.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knitted his brows, considering whether to use some methods to interrogate the man and force him to reveal his background.</p><p></p><p>But the black-robed man coldly said, "Don't even think about getting anything out of me. Sir, you must know Suli Xiu, right? Hand her over, and everything will be fine. Otherwise..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled, "Suli Xiu? You mean that young lady?" </p><p></p><p>He took out Suli Xiu's portrait and said cheerfully, "I don't know her. It's just that 100,000 spirit crystals were too tempting, and you two were too easy to trick."</p><p></p><p>He naturally wouldn't admit that he knew Suli Xiu, as this matter involved too much. If it was revealed, he would be targeted, especially by Great Sect Masters.</p><p></p><p>Unless he broke through to the level above the Great Sect Master, he wouldn't be able to act recklessly without fear.</p><p></p><p>The black-robed man frowned, looking at Xu Yan's expression, not seeming like he was lying. He was inwardly furious. This person dared to ambush and kill Sect Master experts, his strength was extraordinary, especially that golden dragon, the cultivation method behind it was unknown.</p><p></p><p>He must be from the Demonic Sect without a doubt.</p><p></p><p>Within the Demonic Sect, aside from the cultivators who practiced murderous techniques, there were also some with eccentric personalities and strange behaviors, even peculiar preferences.</p><p></p><p>And this person seemed to be one of that type.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Sir, which Demon Sovereign do you serve under?" </p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe asked coldly.</p><p></p><p>Clearly knowing that the forces behind the two of them were not weak, yet daring to attempt to kill, there must be a powerful backer. And the greatest backer of the Demon Sect would be the Nine Great Demon Sovereigns! "I have nothing to say!" Xu Yan did not explain.</p><p></p><p>Mistaking him for a member of the Demon Sect, so be it. He and the Demon Sect did have some grievances.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the Golden Dragon disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"You may leave."</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe was stunned, unexpectedly, the other party actually let him go?</p><p></p><p>"Sir, aren't you afraid?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered, "Afraid of what? Just a Patriarch, a mere chicken and dog, I can crush one with a palm strike. Since I have promised, to hand over the item and let you leave, of course I will not go back on my word!"</p><p></p><p>"Farewell!"</p><p></p><p>The man in the black robe moved swiftly and departed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan watched him leave, then silently followed his trail.</p><p></p><p>Since he could not interrogate the other party's origins, he would cast a wider net to catch a bigger fish.</p><p></p><p>"My Shijie's enemy seems quite wealthy. If I eliminate them, will I not have a shortage of Spirit Crystals? I can help my Shijie vent her anger and also earn Spirit Crystals, killing two birds with one stone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Outside of Qinglin City, in a dense forest, a carriage was parked.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu came out of the carriage, having already removed his disguise, finally letting out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>After a long journey, he had encountered several pursuers along the way, but all were avoided safely, entirely relying on Meng Chong's ferocity. The others did not expect that he would hire a Patriarch as a coachman, thinking the one inside the carriage might be a powerful Grandmaster.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu himself had not expected it either, he had just seen Meng Chong's burly and fierce appearance, thinking he would be suitable to entrust the stored items to. Unexpectedly, he turned out to be a Patriarch-level martial artist.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he felt somewhat worried.</p><p></p><p>Afraid that Meng Chong might see the money and have the idea to rob him.</p><p></p><p>From any perspective, Meng Chong seemed to be a greedy fellow.</p><p></p><p>What slightly relieved him was that Meng Chong seemed to have some principles and most likely would not commit robbery and murder.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Meng Chong, this is the storage certificate from the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion. When you go to Qinglin City, use this to retrieve the stored items, just say they are your weapons."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu handed a silver-colored storage certificate to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong examined the certificate, it was made of a material similar to spirit tickets, with the three big characters "Heavenly Treasure Pavilion" printed on it.</p><p></p><p>In the middle was an illustration of a storage box.</p><p></p><p>In the bottom left corner were four small characters:</p><p></p><p>"Present certificate to retrieve."</p><p></p><p>Behind were a few numbers, which should be the item's storage number.</p><p></p><p>"No problem, where's my reward?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong put away the certificate and asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu took out another certificate and said, "This stores three Grade Eight Spirit Herbs..."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, Meng Shushu gritted his teeth and said, "I'll just give you all of them, consider it the reward for this trip!"</p><p></p><p>"Our family is so generous, don't worry, I'll definitely retrieve the items intact for you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'll leave it to Brother Meng."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, you wait here for me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong hurriedly went to Qinglin City.</p><p></p><p>Qinglin City was much more prosperous than Tieshan County, and the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was also larger in scale. Occasionally, even Origin Realm cultivators could be seen entering, something that was almost impossible to see in Tieshan County.</p><p></p><p>The martial artists' strength in Tieshan County was ultimately too weak.</p><p></p><p>There was not even a single Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong entered the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, and a maid came to greet him.</p><p></p><p>"Retrieve the items!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took out the storage certificate.</p><p></p><p>The maid took the certificate, glanced at the storage number, and smiled, "Esteemed guest, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong followed the maid into the back hall of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, to a storage room.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask what the guest has stored?"</p><p></p><p>"My weapons!"</p><p></p><p>The maid nodded, put away the certificate, and went to a small room at the back of the storage room.</p><p></p><p>Opening it, the maid gestured, "Esteemed guest, please retrieve your stored items."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked inside and saw a pile of black hammers in the small room.</p><p></p><p>The hammer heads were in a polygonal shape, only slightly smaller than the carriage's wheel. Meng Chong was secretly astonished, no wonder Meng Shushu wanted him to retrieve the stored items.</p><p></p><p>Only a burly and robust fellow like him would be more suitable to use such a weapon, less likely to arouse suspicion.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stepped forward and picked up two of the large hammers.</p><p></p><p>As he held them, his expression flickered slightly, the hammers were a bit lighter than expected, not completely solid, but the heads were still very thick and not light.</p><p></p><p>"What's hidden inside?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was curious.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the hammers out, he handed the Spirit Herb certificate to the maid and asked, "I want to inspect the contents inside."</p><p></p><p>The maid looked at the certificate and smiled, "Certainly, please follow me."</p><p></p><p>The storage for the Spirit Herbs was in another storage room, filled with countless drawers.</p><p></p><p>The maid went to the drawer corresponding to the certificate number and took out a box.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, these are three Grade Eight Spirit Herbs."</p><p></p><p>The maid opened the box, allowing Meng Chong to inspect.</p><p></p><p>"Do you wish to retrieve them?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the Spirit Herbs in the box, three Grade Eight Spirit Herbs, all the same type, small flowers that would be convenient to carry.</p><p></p><p>"Retrieve them."</p><p></p><p>The maid put away the certificate and handed the Spirit Herbs to him, which were sealed in a thin membrane to preserve the medicinal properties.</p><p></p><p>The three Spirit Herbs were placed in a small bag, which Meng Chong took and put in his bosom.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, have a safe journey!"</p><p></p><p>The maid saw Meng Chong off.</p><p></p><p>"This Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's treasury stores so many treasures, aren't they afraid of being robbed?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>However, the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion was extremely powerful, and there must be powerful experts guarding it in secret. Moreover, with the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion's strength, no one would dare to have such thoughts, not even Grandmasters.</p><p></p><p>Carrying the two large hammers out of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, the people on the street all hurriedly moved aside, this burly and fierce fellow did not seem easy to provoke.</p><p></p><p>Those two large hammers looked truly frightening! Meng Chong carried the hammers and left Qinglin City, traveling at a brisk pace to return to the meeting point with Meng Shushu, also secretly keeping an eye out for any followers.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the meeting point, he only saw the carriage, but no Meng Shushu. Meng Chong focused his senses and looked towards a certain direction, "Master, come out, there's no one following."</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu walked out from behind a large tree, looking relieved. Seeing the two large hammers, he had an expression of joy on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Brother Meng."</p><p></p><p>He finally retrieved the items.</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu took the two hammers and put them in the carriage, saying, "Brother Meng, the transaction is complete, I'll be taking my leave now!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright, if our family has any more money-making opportunities, be sure to find me."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Definitely, definitely!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Shushu quickly agreed and drove the carriage away in a hurry.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

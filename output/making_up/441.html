        <h1>Chapter 441</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Cloud Peak Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's gaze turned cold as he looked at the appearing Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, you really think the three of you can capture me?"</p><p></p><p>Against three Immortal Heavenly Venerables, he was absolutely no match with his current strength. A layer of illusion appeared, and in an instant, Jiang Buping's true form had already fled far away.</p><p></p><p>"Chase after him!"</p><p></p><p>The two Immortal Heavenly Venerables from the Jiang clan glanced at the one from Cloud Peak Sect, then without a word, tacitly agreed to pursue and kill together. </p><p></p><p>"This youth absolutely cannot be allowed to live. He hasn't even reached the Immortal realm yet but already has such power. Once he breaks through to Immortal realm, both of us will be killed by him!"</p><p></p><p>"Exactly!"</p><p></p><p>The three Immortal Heavenly Venerables gave chase, but Jiang Buping's speed was even faster than theirs. In just an instant, he had disappeared into the horizon.</p><p></p><p>"With just the three of us, I'm afraid we won't be able to seal off Jiang Buping. It seems we'll need to borrow some strength."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go find the major powers of the Abyss Realm. You two continue the pursuit."</p><p></p><p>The injured Immortal Heavenly Venerable said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>The other two continued to chase along Jiang Buping's escape route.</p><p></p><p>Inside a large tree, Jiang Buping's form emerged. He looked towards the two distant Immortal Heavenly Venerables with a cold gaze.</p><p></p><p>Using the special properties of his indestructible soul, he had directly merged into the tree, concealing his aura to avoid detection.</p><p></p><p>"I can't go to the Heavenly Cave now. If I get trapped in there, unless I use Master's jade talisman, I won't be able to escape."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression was gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"I can't stay in the Abyss Realm either."</p><p></p><p>Since the Immortal Heavenly Venerables of the Jiang family and Cloud Peak Sect had chased him to the Abyss Realm, he could only temporarily avoid their attacks and travel to other realms.</p><p></p><p>"When I break through, it will be your time to die!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>He moved, heading towards the border of the Abyss Realm, preparing to flee.</p><p></p><p>"The abandoned son of the Jiang family? You've delivered yourself right to us, perfect for capturing you!"</p><p></p><p>However, just as Jiang Buping arrived at the border, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable guarding this place suddenly attacked, intending to capture him.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Jiang Buping thrust out his spear and retreated explosively.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Tianming, hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping could only flee.</p><p></p><p>The major powers of the Abyss Realm were actually hunting him, offering a high bounty. Even to curry favor with the Tai Kun Jiang clan, Immortal Heavenly Venerables from various powers had personally taken action.</p><p></p><p>"A soul secret technique as the bounty condition?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>For most Immortal Heavenly Venerables, soul secret techniques were truly powerful techniques. One can imagine the temptation of such a technique.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, since they knew Jiang Buping was a criminal of the Jiang clan and possessed a powerful soul secret technique, how could these Immortal Heavenly Venerables not be tempted?</p><p></p><p>Without the backing of a major realm power, they had no more scruples.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, surrender now. You can't escape."</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the wilderness in the Abyss Realm, Jiang Buping's face looked grim.</p><p></p><p>He had been careless! Besides the three Immortal Heavenly Venerables from the Tai Kun Realm, there were five more from the Abyss Realm who had now completely sealed off the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping, who had been preparing to cross the wilderness and leave the Abyss Realm, was now cornered at the edge of the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Though surrounded, Jiang Buping wasn't panicked, just a bit frustrated that he had been careless for a moment and failed to conceal his traces well.</p><p></p><p>"Compared to First Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother, I'm still lacking in experience and not careful enough."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sighed inwardly. After this lesson, he would have to be more cautious on the road ahead. He should change his appearance and disguise as much as possible to avoid being tracked.</p><p></p><p>"Esteemed cultivators of the Abyss Realm, do you really want to wade into these troubled waters? This is a grudge between Jiang Buping and the Tai Kun Realm. You should think carefully about the consequences of getting involved!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping coldly looked at the Immortal Heavenly Venerables of the Abyss Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, there's no need for threats. You should know what consequences await you today. As you are now, you're not qualified to threaten us."</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Heavenly Venerable from the Abyss Realm said coldly.</p><p></p><p>Outside the circle of Immortal Heavenly Venerables, a group of True King Heavenly Venerables were watching.</p><p></p><p>"Ah, Jiang Buping, I know who he is now. The abandoned son of Tai Kun, that former youngest True King Heavenly Venerable!"</p><p></p><p>"Why did the Jiang clan abandon such a genius?"</p><p></p><p>"Wasn't it said that Jiang Buping was already crippled? Looking at him now, he seems invincible below the Immortal realm. To make so many Immortal Heavenly Venerables take action, this will leave a heavy mark in martial arts history."</p><p></p><p>The many observing True King Heavenly Venerables sighed in admiration.</p><p></p><p>This must be the first True King Heavenly Venerable in history to be hunted by so many Immortal Heavenly Venerables, right?</p><p></p><p>"What a pity, Jiang Buping won't escape this calamity today. I wonder who will obtain his soul secret technique?"</p><p></p><p>"What are you thinking? That's a secret technique of the Jiang clan, who would dare obtain it? However, the Jiang clan did offer a soul secret technique as a bounty, so those Immortal Heavenly Venerables won't have come in vain."</p><p></p><p>"That's true. Such a powerful soul secret technique, who would dare covet it? The Jiang clan would surely strike with lightning speed."</p><p></p><p>The crowd of martial artists nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>The more powerful a soul secret technique, the more it was a core inheritance of a major realm power. Anyone who dared to steal it would be thoroughly eliminated, with nowhere to hide in the entire divine realm.</p><p></p><p>This was the tacit understanding of all major realm powers. No other major realm power would offer protection.</p><p></p><p>This was also one of the reasons why no core secret techniques of major realms had been leaked to this day.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping held his long spear, coldly facing the encirclement of eight Immortal Heavenly Venerables without a trace of fear. With his current strength, it was almost impossible for him to break through the encirclement.</p><p></p><p>However, it was also impossible for them to kill him.</p><p></p><p>Even without his master's life-saving jade talisman, Jiang Buping was confident that Immortal Heavenly Venerables couldn't destroy his indestructible soul.</p><p></p><p>The indestructible qi had merged into his soul. As long as the indestructible qi wasn't extinguished, he couldn't be killed. However, if captured, the enemy could wear down his soul power, weakening his soul.</p><p></p><p>This was also the power of the indestructible soul. It wasn't something he should have been able to cultivate at his level, but because of his innate soul and contact with indestructible qi, he was able to cultivate the indestructible soul at this realm.</p><p></p><p>"There is a way to escape!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping looked at the ground.</p><p></p><p>"To escape this way, I'll have to disperse my original physical body and completely become a soul state. I'm somewhat reluctant to do so."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Although his physical body had long since merged with his soul, it still existed. If he wanted to transform into soul power and merge into the ground to escape, he would have to completely abandon his physical body. Only then could he turn his soul into a large, formless and traceless entity that could merge into the ground without being detected.</p><p></p><p>"So be it. It was my own carelessness, I should bear the consequences myself!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping made his decision and was about to escape using this method.</p><p></p><p>If he could avoid using his master's jade talisman, he would try his best not to use it. Trying not to cause trouble for his master was the greatest adherence as a disciple!</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, don't vainly attempt to escape. Surrender now and suffer less."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heavenly Venerable from the Tai Kun Jiang clan surged with energy as he stepped closer.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly!</p><p></p><p>A figure drifted over.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at his fifth disciple, somewhat exasperated that he had actually been cornered. How careless could he be?</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating the Extreme Soul Martial Way, you've become a bit arrogant, haven't you?"</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>"Master?!" Jiang Buping was startled, then immediately overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm," Li Xuan nodded. "You were able to leave Taikun Realm back then, so you're someone who's good at adapting and protecting yourself. How did you end up surrounded now?"</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Buping felt ashamed and embarrassed. "Master is right to criticize me. I was careless."</p><p></p><p>Since cultivating the Extreme Soul Martial Way and surpassing his peak strength, he had become somewhat arrogant. Believing he could easily handle Immortal Venerable experts, he had grown careless and ended up surrounded.</p><p></p><p>"I've repeatedly emphasized that true martial artists are not reckless. Don't be arrogant just because you're powerful. Always remember there's a bigger sky beyond the sky, and someone better beyond every person.</p><p></p><p>Throughout history, how many geniuses have died from arrogance? How many powerful experts have failed due to overconfidence..." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan lectured sternly.</p><p></p><p>The surrounding Immortal Venerables now had ugly expressions, with solemn looks in their eyes. </p><p></p><p>This person had appeared suddenly, without them noticing beforehand.</p><p></p><p>And he was actually Jiang Buping's master?</p><p></p><p>Seeing him so casually lecturing his disciple, completely ignoring their presence, they couldn't help but feel furious.</p><p></p><p>"You still have the mood to lecture your disciple? Jiang Buping is a criminal of our Taikun Jiang Clan. Since you're his master, you should come back to Taikun with us to atone for your crimes..."</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable from Taikun Realm's Jiang Clan spoke coldly.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his head slightly and glanced at him. "Ant, you're noisy!"</p><p></p><p>To the shock of the other Immortal Venerables, the one who had just spoken turned to ash and scattered in the wind in an instant, without even a chance to scream.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the remaining seven Immortal Venerables felt their scalps tingle and their hearts tremble. Their whole bodies were shaking slightly.</p><p></p><p>Just a glance, and an Immortal Venerable turned to ash?</p><p></p><p>What kind of terrifying being was this? It was unheard of.</p><p></p><p>Even the other Immortal Venerable from Taikun's Jiang Clan and the one from Yunshang Sect were shocked, breaking out in cold sweat.</p><p></p><p>What level of expert could make an Immortal Venerable turn to ash with just a look?</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that he hadn't displayed any aura or pressure of a powerful expert. It was just an ordinary, simple glance.</p><p></p><p>And the person turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>Even Immortal Venerables couldn't make an ant on the ground turn to ash with just a look.</p><p></p><p>In his eyes, Immortal Venerables weren't even worth ants!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping was shocked. This was his invincible master - just a glance, and an Immortal Venerable turned to ash.</p><p></p><p>"An expert who has transcended heaven and earth is this terrifying!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's heart surged with excitement. "I, Jiang Buping, will definitely transcend heaven and earth too, and become an expert like Master!"</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable from Yunshang Sect slowly moved backwards, then suddenly turned and fled.</p><p></p><p>Too frightening!</p><p></p><p>With Jiang Buping having such a terrifying master, it was impossible to capture or subdue him!</p><p></p><p>"Letting you leave?" Li Xuan's indifferent voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The other six Immortal Venerables were about to flee as well, when they saw in horror that the one who had just escaped turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>Gulp!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the remaining Immortal Venerables were so scared their faces turned pale. Their bodies trembled slightly as they fell to their knees.</p><p></p><p>"Please spare us, Senior. This matter has nothing to do with..."</p><p></p><p>An Immortal Venerable from Yuanping Realm began to plead shakily.</p><p></p><p>"Noisy!"</p><p></p><p>Poof! The Immortal Venerable who had just begged for mercy turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>The remaining Immortal Venerables were so frightened they hurriedly shut their mouths tightly, not daring to even breathe, afraid of making any sound that might annoy this terrifying being.</p><p></p><p>They even frantically tried to control their bodies' trembling, fearing that shaking too much would displease that terrifying existence.</p><p></p><p>However, they couldn't suppress the fear in their hearts. Their kneeling bodies shook uncontrollably.</p><p></p><p>Cold sweat streamed down their faces.</p><p></p><p>Even these Immortal Venerables, who were usually revered and respected, felt fear when facing such a terrifying and unknown being. Even with their powerful cultivation, they couldn't control their fear.</p><p></p><p>In the distance, the group of True Monarch Celestial Venerables watching didn't know exactly what had happened, but they saw a figure suddenly appear beside Jiang Buping.</p><p></p><p>Then a group of Immortal Venerables knelt down!</p><p></p><p>"Run!"</p><p></p><p>If even Immortal Venerables were kneeling, one could imagine how terrifying that being was.</p><p></p><p>The group of True Monarch Celestial Venerables frantically fled, but didn't dare make any noise, afraid of drawing attention.</p><p></p><p>"What was that?"</p><p></p><p>"Could it be a powerful being hidden in the wilderness that was disturbed?"</p><p></p><p>"It's possible!"</p><p></p><p>The fleeing True Monarch Celestial Venerables discussed via voice transmission.</p><p></p><p>There had always been rumors about the wilderness, including rumors of Immortal Venerables perishing there.</p><p></p><p>So the first thing they thought of was that an unknown being in the wilderness had been disturbed.</p><p></p><p>Soon, the group of observing True Monarch Celestial Venerables had all fled.</p><p></p><p>At the edge of the wilderness, several trembling experts knelt with their heads bowed, not daring to look up.</p><p></p><p>"How do you want to deal with these people?" Li Xuan asked Jiang Buping after finishing his lecture.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's eyes were cold as he took a deep breath and said, "Naturally, kill them all!"</p><p></p><p>"Mm." Li Xuan nodded in approval.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, the Immortal Venerable from Yuanping Realm hurriedly tried to beg for mercy, his voice shaking so much he could barely speak clearly.</p><p></p><p>"Spare..."</p><p></p><p>However, before he could finish speaking, a breeze blew by and they all turned to ash and scattered.</p><p></p><p>"You can resolve your grudges with Taikun Realm yourself. I won't intervene," Li Xuan said as he walked away leisurely, with Jiang Buping following closely behind.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master. I will seek justice for myself," Jiang Buping said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The Extreme Soul Martial Way is a path of killing - extreme killing. You still lack some of that extreme killing intent. Practice more.</p><p></p><p>Today, I'll give you further guidance on the Extreme Soul Martial Way and pass on more Extreme Soul divine abilities to you. How much you can comprehend and cultivate depends on you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan passed on the further refined and newly created Extreme Soul Martial Way divine abilities and secret techniques to Jiang Buping one by one.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master. I will cultivate diligently and break through soon," Jiang Buping said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"You're already on the path of the Extreme Soul. How far you can go depends on yourself. The martial way is endless. Work hard and forge your own martial path soon."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, upgrading Jiang Buping's jade token.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

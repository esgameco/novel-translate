        <h1>Chapter 204</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The distant Ziyu was dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had transformed into a mighty little giant?</p><p></p><p>What kind of cultivation technique was this, what kind of secret art - it was unheard of! That giant bear now seemed insignificant before Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>The giant bear roared angrily and pounced, biting down on Meng Chong's arm, but it couldn't even leave a tooth mark.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it nearly broke its own teeth.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong punched the snow bear's head.</p><p></p><p>At that moment, the oppressive aura surged towards him again, sharp as a knife, trying to pierce into his mind.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong snorted, as the True Meaning of Wind and Thunder swept over him, along with an unparalleled Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>In this moment, the fluctuations he had felt when his master unleashed the Annihilation Sword appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>As the oppressive aura and fluctuations kept assaulting him, he gradually gained some understanding, as if he was grasping the essence of the Annihilation Sword.</p><p></p><p>Now, combined with the icy chill of the ravine, the unrivaled Sword Intent and the True Meaning of Wind and Thunder surged forth, and a flash of insight struck Meng Chong's mind.</p><p></p><p>He felt like he had almost grasped it! Yet, there was still something missing.</p><p></p><p>The oppressive aura weakened, the invisible fluctuations trying to retreat. In that instant, Meng Chong intentionally weakened his True Meaning of Wind and Thunder, as if he could no longer withstand the onslaught.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Intent also became faint.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In that moment, the oppressive aura and fluctuations intensified again.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong continued to ponder, his face showing the strain of resisting, as if he was about to be overwhelmed.</p><p></p><p>At a certain point, the fluctuations of the Annihilation Sword became clear in his mind, the bone-chilling intent intertwining with this wave, merging with the unparalleled Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>This sword strike could invade the consciousness and annihilate the spirit!</p><p></p><p>"Let's call it the Absolute God Slash!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's eyes widened, and he sneered, "No matter what you are, today I will completely destroy you. I killed one before, and killing another is no different!"</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand, and the treasured sword that had flown away earlier suddenly rushed back, falling into his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"If I don't want to let go of the sword, no one can take it from me. What are you? Since you want to rely on your beast body to fight, then I'll oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>With the sword in hand, the unparalleled Sword Intent surged, as if this single sword could subdue the world! The oppressive aura and fluctuations suddenly retreated, as if they were frightened.</p><p></p><p>"Can you hide from me?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong looked at the snow bear's corpse, the oppressive aura and fluctuations had been hiding within it, seemingly residing in the bear's flesh.</p><p></p><p>"Die!"</p><p></p><p>The sword strike fell.</p><p></p><p>The snow bear's body remained unharmed, but a bone-chilling, unparalleled Sword Intent, containing the might of thunder, slashed into the bear's body.</p><p></p><p>Absolute God Slash! Poof! The oppressive aura instantly dissipated, the fluctuations fading away. Vaguely, Meng Chong saw a faint ripple appear on the bear's body, the ripples undulating and shattering under the Absolute God Slash.</p><p></p><p>And the outline of the ripples seemed to be that of a human.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I'm free. The jade token is in the storage bag..."</p><p></p><p>A sigh of relief and liberation echoed.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Everything returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood holding the sword, silently gazing at the snow bear's corpse.</p><p></p><p>Ziyu hurried over, looking at the still giant-like Meng Chong, who was now completely naked. Her jade-like face flushed red.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're so strong!"</p><p></p><p>She reached out her small hands, seemingly wanting to touch him.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong's expression changed, and he quickly dispelled the Golden Body transformation, reverting to his true form, feeling a bit embarrassed as his clothes were now in tatters.</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any clothes I can borrow?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked Ziyu with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Ziyu looked disappointed, but took out a pink garment from her storage bag, saying, "This is the only one that would fit you. It's woven from Cloud Realm Silkworm silk, so it won't tear even if you turn into a giant."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong snatched the garment and put it on without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>"When we return, I'll go to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and buy some Cloud Realm Silkworm silk clothes," he thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>"The jade token you were looking for is on the storage bag, I don't know if the storage bag was found on the bear's body."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong approached the snow bear's corpse and bent down to search.</p><p></p><p>"Was your storage bag found here?"</p><p></p><p>He asked curiously. After all, as a top genius of the Purple Cloud Kingdom, Ziyu might not have been able to obtain a storage bag, as her strength was still somewhat lacking.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Ziyu nodded.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong understood - Ziyu's storage bag must have belonged to one of the powerful experts who had once surrounded and killed the Demon Lord.</p><p></p><p>He grew excited at the thought. The experts who had surrounded and killed the Demon Lord were not just one or two, and each of them would have had a storage bag. That meant there could be several more to be found! Of course, it was also possible that some storage bags had been destroyed in the great battle.</p><p></p><p>After searching the snow bear's body thoroughly without finding the storage bag, Meng Chong continued deeper into the ravine.</p><p></p><p>The deeper he went, the more terrifying the remnants of the battle became - large craters, deep gullies, evidence of an incredibly fierce conflict.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought about the sigh he had heard - what kind of powerful expert had left their consciousness behind, residing within the snow bear's body?</p><p></p><p>The further he went, the more spiritual herbs he found, with sixth-grade herbs being the most common, and occasionally even fifth-grade herbs.</p><p></p><p>In a large crater ahead, there was no snow, only a layer of solid ice covering the ground. Beneath the ice, Meng Chong could see a body that had been cleaved in two by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong punched out, shattering the ice layer, and looked at the shriveled corpse, furrowing his brows.</p><p></p><p>The body was completely dried up, as if all its essence had been drained by a single sword strike.</p><p></p><p>The facial features were unrecognizable.</p><p></p><p>Beneath the tattered clothes, a gray, toad-like pouch was revealed - a storage bag! Meng Chong's heart leaped, and he took the storage bag, opening it to find only a few bottles and jars, some spirit crystals, and a jade token.</p><p></p><p>"What a pity," Meng Chong sighed. These powerful experts who had come to surround the Demon Lord clearly knew the risks of their mission, and so had not brought any precious items with them, only some medicinal supplies and spirit crystals.</p><p></p><p>He took out the jade token and handed it to Ziyu. "Is this the jade token you were looking for?"</p><p></p><p>Ziyu looked at it and shook her head. "No, this is not the one I need. You can keep it. If we enter the Spiritual Realm's gate, it might be useful."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong pocketed the jade token and hung the storage bag on his waist, then continued deeper into the ravine.</p><p></p><p>Along the way, he saw several more completely destroyed corpses, all shriveled and fragmented, with their storage bags seemingly damaged beyond repair.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong lamented the loss.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he came across another body, seemingly that of a woman.</p><p></p><p>"This person died a rather gruesome death," he murmured.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was stunned. The corpse had been sliced open from bottom to top, clearly done intentionally by someone.</p><p></p><p>He took the pouch of items from the corpse and opened it to find a jade token, some bottles and jars, and a few spirit crystals - nothing else.</p><p></p><p>It seemed the weapons of these powerful experts had been destroyed in the great battle.</p><p></p><p>"What a great harvest!" Meng Chong was greatly excited. </p><p></p><p>This trip had been worthwhile, as he had obtained two pouches, and these were high-quality ones made from the skin of the Swallow Toad, a creature of a higher realm.</p><p></p><p>The spatial capacity inside was quite large, enough to store the Snow Bear's corpse.</p><p></p><p>"Since I've got these pouches, I won't ask you for any other rewards," Meng Chong said cheerfully to Zi Yun.</p><p></p><p>"Then I'm very grateful to you!" Zi Yun smiled happily.</p><p></p><p>By the end of the ravine, Meng Chong had collected a total of three pouches.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly that the precious pouches, so valuable in the Inner Realm, had become less rare after he obtained three of them.</p><p></p><p>At the end of the ravine, on the cliff wall, was a corpse impaled by a spike through the head.</p><p></p><p>It wore a faint purple robe that shone brightly.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun ran over, respectfully kneeling and kowtowing a few times before the corpse, then searching it and finding a storage pouch. Inside was a purple jade token.</p><p></p><p>"I found it!" Zi Yun exclaimed excitedly, carefully putting away the pouch.</p><p></p><p>She then handed the original pouch to Meng Chong, saying, "Meng Chong, I'm truly grateful to you. If you hadn't escorted me, I wouldn't have been able to come here. </p><p></p><p>"This is the reward I promised you. There are spirit medicines and spirit tickets inside."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong took the pouch without hesitation, looking at the purple-robed corpse. "Is this your ancestor?"</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun shook her head. "No, but he left something behind. With his jade token, I can enter the Gate of the Spiritual Realm without hindrance.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, come with me to the Spiritual Realm when the time comes."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong shook his head. "We'll talk about that later. You seem to know quite a bit about the Gate of the Spiritual Realm."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun smiled. "By chance, I obtained some information. In the pouch I gave you, there's a small booklet. Read it and you'll know some secrets."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong opened the pouch Zi Yun had given him and found the small booklet, but he didn't take it out to read it immediately. </p><p></p><p>Zi Yun was digging a hole, seemingly wanting to bury the purple-robed corpse.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong raised a hand and punched the ground, creating a large pit.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you're so kind!" Zi Yun exclaimed excitedly, reaching out as if to hug his neck. Meng Chong simply grabbed her and tossed her in front of the purple-robed corpse.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun grunted, then moved the corpse and buried it in the pit.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong observed the ravine, feeling there was something special about this place, though he couldn't quite pinpoint what.</p><p></p><p>Their journey here had come to an end, and the harvest had been bountiful.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go," Zi Yun said after burying the corpse.</p><p></p><p>They retraced their steps out of the ravine and back to where the Snow Bear's corpse was. Meng Chong took out a storage pouch, infused it with true energy, and placed the Snow Bear's body inside. Even this massive corpse fit easily within the small pouch.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong couldn't help but marvel at the incredible capacity of these storage pouches, truly an essential item for those on the martial path.</p><p></p><p>He also stored away the long spear, the only remaining weapon of a powerful expert from the Demon-Hunting Battlefield.</p><p></p><p>As soon as they exited the ravine, a rippling wave suddenly emanated from the side of the ravine.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned and looked over. A distant peak seemed to be covered by a layer of water, the ripples distorting and twisting it, as if the peak was about to disappear.</p><p></p><p>"What is this?" Meng Chong asked.</p><p></p><p>"Possibly, the Gate of the Spiritual Realm is opening," Zi Yun said, her expression changing.</p><p></p><p>She then muttered to herself, "But that can't be. The Gate of the Spiritual Realm shouldn't be opening now."</p><p></p><p>"What happens when the Gate of the Spiritual Realm opens?" Meng Chong asked as he opened the pouch Zi Yun had given him and took out the small booklet.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is said to be the true origin of the martial dao, the vast and boundless martial world. The Inner Realm is just a barren land. The Gate of the Spiritual Realm is the portal between the Inner Realm and the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Only when the Gate of the Spiritual Realm opens can one enter the Spiritual Realm. And only the experts of the Spiritual Realm can come to the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Inner Realm cannot open the Gate of the Spiritual Realm - only the Spiritual Realm can. The Demon Monarch originally escaped from the Spiritual Realm to the Inner Realm."</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun spoke solemnly, while Meng Chong had already begun reading the small booklet.</p><p></p><p>This booklet was left behind by a powerful expert who had once entered the Inner Realm from the Spiritual Realm, seemingly for the purple-robed corpse in the ravine as a legacy.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun had obtained it by chance.</p><p></p><p>The booklet described the ravine and briefly introduced the Demon-Hunting Battle, as well as some information about the Spiritual Realm, including the function of the jade tokens.</p><p></p><p>The more Meng Chong read, the more serious his expression became, yet there was also a sense of fascination.</p><p></p><p>The Inner Realm was too small - the Spiritual Realm was the true vast martial world.</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm!" Meng Chong looked at the rippling peak and said excitedly, "I'll stay here for now and see what powerful experts emerge from the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Is it truly as described in this booklet, that any random expert from the Spiritual Realm can easily dominate the Inner Realm, treating the people of the Inner Realm as servants and dogs?"</p><p></p><p>The booklet mentioned that those from the Inner Realm who entered the Spiritual Realm would either be forced into servitude or be killed or expelled back to the Inner Realm. In the eyes of the major powers of the Spiritual Realm, the people of the Inner Realm were like pigs and dogs.</p><p></p><p>Even the peak Grandmasters of the Inner Realm, upon entering the Spiritual Realm, would either have to kneel and serve as servants to gain a position, or be slaughtered or driven out. They could not bear this humiliation.</p><p></p><p>Thus, those who entered the Spiritual Realm were often killed in large numbers, and the subsequent ones could only submit to being treated as pigs and dogs.</p><p></p><p>Only those who held a jade token would be treated as people. If their talent was not lacking, they could be accepted and become members of the powers of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Before the Demon Monarch's incident, the jade tokens were highly sought-after treasures in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>But now, those who knew of the jade tokens were almost all gone.</p><p></p><p>This was why Zi Yun had come to obtain the jade token.</p><p></p><p>The Gate of the Spiritual Realm was a hidden secret in the Inner Realm. Those who knew of it were extremely few, especially after the Demon Monarch's incident, when the experts from the Spiritual Realm had erased the records of the Gate.</p><p></p><p>This was why most of the peak Grandmasters of the current Inner Realm were unaware of the existence of the Gate of the Spiritual Realm.</p>

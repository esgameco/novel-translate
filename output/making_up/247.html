            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan returned to the manor and saw Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu Shu three people cultivating. In a good mood, he pointed out some guidance to them.</p><p></p><p>The three people's strength was not very strong, they had just entered the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>And they could only be considered ordinary Tong Xuan martial artists, unable to reach the powerful strength of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, who could slay small celestial beings in the Tong Xuan realm.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat had eaten the elixir and was now resting on the side to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>After Xu Yan guided it, the Red Cat had some enlightenment, and it was drawing formations in its acupoints, which was equivalent to deploying a formation within its body's acupoints.</p><p></p><p>This was obviously impossible to achieve.</p><p></p><p>So the Red Cat did not completely follow the formation diagram, but drew the patterns as it wished, as Xu Yan said, drawing the patterns it could draw.</p><p></p><p>Then it fused these patterns together.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps it could gain some wonderful techniques.</p><p></p><p>Little Ha had obviously overeaten the elixir and was lying in a corner digesting it.</p><p></p><p>"I hope Fang Hao can soon comprehend the Qi Men martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took out the Tai Cang book and continued to study the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Divine Realm, one must certainly involve the use of the laws of heaven and earth, but cannot be limited by the laws of heaven and earth, so it needs to be pondered a bit more.</p><p></p><p>"To be able to use the laws of heaven and earth, and yet not be bound by the laws of heaven and earth, to be above the laws, rather than under the laws, limited by the laws.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Realm cultivates a complete spiritual soul, and divine abilities are self-generated, these divine abilities can also be regarded as the martial artist's own laws.</p><p></p><p>"Using one's own laws, in harmony with the laws of heaven and earth, and then using the power of the laws of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>With his research on the Tai Cang laws of heaven and earth, Li Xuan had a deeper understanding of the laws of heaven and earth, and also realized that once one merged with the laws of heaven and earth, one would ultimately be limited by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>In the future, wanting to transcend heaven and earth, to transcend the laws of heaven and earth, will become difficult.</p><p></p><p>So the realm above the Divine Realm can only use the laws of heaven and earth, but cannot be limited by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If one does not contain the laws of heaven and earth, how can one use the laws of heaven and earth? And using the laws of heaven and earth also requires one's strength to be strong enough to continue to surpass the power of the Tai Cang martial dao.</p><p></p><p>This is also a difficult point.</p><p></p><p>However, the Divine Realm refines the spiritual soul, and the Divine Realm will give birth to divine abilities, as for how to give birth to divine abilities, this is something Xu Yan needs to ponder.</p><p></p><p>If the self-generated divine abilities are regarded as one's own laws, then using one's own laws to control the laws of heaven and earth, is it feasible? Will it still continue to lead far ahead and maintain powerful strength?</p><p></p><p>"One cannot simply fuse divine abilities with the laws of heaven and earth, if so, wouldn't the divine abilities be limited? And lose the powerful divine abilities."</p><p></p><p>"The realm above the Divine Realm, since it involves the laws of heaven and earth, the divine abilities should become stronger."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan fell into deep thought.</p><p></p><p>Various ideas flashed through his mind.</p><p></p><p>He was already a Spirit Origin Realm martial artist, and had also obtained the Martial Ancestor's Heart, no longer a weak martial artist, but a creator of the martial dao. With his in-depth research on the Tai Cang book's laws of heaven and earth,</p><p></p><p>How to use the laws of heaven and earth to enhance himself, without being limited by the laws of heaven and earth, he already had some ideas, just need to refine them further, and the martial dao above the Divine Realm will be completed.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was on the mountain peak, pondering the Qi Men martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was in the courtyard, continuing to research the Tai Cang book's laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>And in the Jade State martial dao world, a storm was brewing at the moment.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, in order to suppress Xu Yan, this hidden danger, had paid a huge price.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, are they crazy? A city, a spiritual vein, and even supporting it to become a third-rate family, and a third-rate family supporting a second-rate family?"</p><p></p><p>"Whoever captures or kills Xu Yan and Meng Chong can assist in establishing a spiritual sect and obtain two-thirds of the Dai Family's legacy resources!"</p><p></p><p>"Providing clues to their whereabouts will be rewarded with 5 million spirit stones or equivalent valuable treasures."</p><p></p><p>"All participants in the assassination, whether successful or not, will receive 1 million spirit stones!"</p><p></p><p>The bounty announced by the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family has shaken the entire Jade State martial dao world. Some third-rate families that were originally prepared to play it safe and not participate in this matter were now tempted.</p><p></p><p>This is an opportunity to become a second-rate family, and they can also gain the backing of the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>Whether it is the territory and resources left by the Dai Family, or the spirit stone mine provided by the Jade Divine Sect, they have made the second and third-rate families and spiritual sects eager.</p><p></p><p>As for the conditions for supporting the establishment of third-rate spiritual sects and families, this is a promise made to the strong Refining Spirit Celestial Beings among the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>Although the number of Refining Spirit Celestial Beings among the scattered cultivators is scarce, and their strength is generally weaker, there are still Refining Spirit Celestial Beings.</p><p></p><p>The bounty offered by the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family is indeed very tempting, this is an opportunity for the scattered cultivators' Refining Spirit strong ones to break away from their scattered cultivator identity and enter the ranks of spiritual sects and families.</p><p></p><p>It can be expected that there will be scattered cultivators who will be tempted.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this bounty is not only in the Jade State, but has also spread to the neighboring Luo State.</p><p></p><p>The strong scattered cultivators in the Luo State will certainly enter the Jade State to try to obtain this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>In the Myriad Worlds Alliance.</p><p></p><p>"The Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, what a big move!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Patriarch Yu sneered.</p><p></p><p>"Elder Patriarch, how should we proceed?"</p><p></p><p>Left Guardian frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>Although the Myriad Worlds Alliance was formed by scattered cultivators, not all scattered cultivators could join, otherwise, once it was leaked out, the Myriad Worlds Alliance would be attacked by the spiritual sects and families before it could even get started.</p><p></p><p>With the bounty announced by the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, there will certainly be some strong scattered cultivators who will be tempted, and even prepared to join forces to obtain the bounty and enter the ranks of the spiritual sects.</p><p></p><p>"Find Xu Yan and Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Elder Patriarch Yu said in a deep voice: "Also, closely observe which scattered cultivator strong ones have entered the Jade State."</p><p></p><p>"Yes!"</p><p></p><p>Left Guardian nodded, but he was a bit troubled: "Xu Yan and Meng Chong's whereabouts are so secretive, it's too difficult to find them. I'm afraid we might not be able to find them before the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family do."</p><p></p><p>Elder Patriarch Yu's face darkened a bit. Due to the Myriad Worlds Alliance not being able to expose itself openly, its intelligence capabilities ultimately cannot match the Jade State's spiritual sects and families.</p><p></p><p>After all, the entire Jade State is under the rule of these spiritual sects and families.</p><p></p><p>"Pay close attention to the movements of the Refining Spirit strong ones of the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, and immediately notify me if you find anything unusual."</p><p></p><p>Elder Patriarch Yu thought for a moment and instructed.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Jade State, from the spiritual sect and family martial artists to the bottom-level scattered cultivators, everyone is searching for the traces of Xu Yan and Meng Chong. As long as they provide clues, they can receive the spirit stone rewards.</p><p></p><p>How can they not be tempted?</p><p></p><p>"The power of the spiritual sects and families is truly terrifying."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong sighed.</p><p></p><p>"Heh, the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family, I'll destroy them sooner or later."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were in a shop, buying books about various treasures in the spiritual domain, while listening to the discussions of the martial artists, learning about the bounty offered by the Jade Divine Sect and the Su Family.</p><p></p><p>At the moment, the entire Jade State martial dao world was in an uproar because of them.</p><p></p><p>The city they were in was the territory of the Jade Divine Sect, and there were almost martial artists all over the city searching for them.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan and Meng Chong were not at all panicked.</p><p></p><p>Both their appearance and aura had already been changed.</p><p></p><p>Even if a Refining Spirit Celestial Being stood in front of them, they would not be recognized.</p><p></p><p>After purchasing the books they needed, the two of them...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The person continued to wander around the city.</p><p></p><p>"Killing a Refining Divine Celestial is a bit difficult, but killing a Great Celestial is as easy as turning one's hand. The Great Celestials here are subordinates of the Jade Divine Sect, so let's add some fuel to the fire for the Jade Divine Sect!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan let out a cold laugh.</p><p></p><p>The bounty offered by the Jade Divine Sect was still a bit lacking, not forceful enough.</p><p></p><p>Then let's add some more fuel to the fire, let the Jade Divine Sect continue to raise the bounty.</p><p></p><p>The next day, a piece of news shook the entire city.</p><p></p><p>The city lord was killed! The killer was Xu Yan! And he left behind mocking words towards the Jade Divine Sect! "Who is this Xu Yan? How dare he be so arrogant? A mere wandering cultivator, yet he dares to be an enemy of the Spiritual Sects, and the number one sect in Yuzhou at that!"</p><p></p><p>"Although I feel that Xu Yan is courting death, I don't know why, but I feel quite refreshed!"</p><p></p><p>"I have the same feeling, these Spiritual Sect fellows, it's good that they died. I even have a sense of pride and relief."</p><p></p><p>The wandering cultivators discussed animatedly.</p><p></p><p>But the Jade Divine Sect was greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had openly appeared in the city, yet no one had discovered him.</p><p></p><p>Even until long after the city lord was killed, it was only then discovered!</p><p></p><p>At this point, Xu Yan must have already escaped the city.</p><p></p><p>Soon after the city lord under the Jade Divine Sect was killed, the emperor supported by the Shu family was also killed.</p><p></p><p>The killer was Meng Chong!</p><p></p><p>This time, the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family truly had a strong sense of crisis.</p><p></p><p>They were not afraid of a powerful enemy, but they feared not being able to find the enemy's trail!</p><p></p><p>Just as the powerful experts of the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family were scouring everywhere, searching for the whereabouts of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, a certain third-rate Spiritual Sect that was highly affiliated with the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family, participated in the hunt for Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Its sect master was ambushed and killed outside the sect. Xu Yan and Meng Chong even released a wild statement, warning that anyone who dared to get involved in their feud with the Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family would be mercilessly eliminated! Another Refining Divine Celestial was surrounded and killed!</p><p></p><p>The martial dao world of Yuzhou was truly shaken, even the neighboring Luozhou, the major Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families, knew that Yuzhou had produced two fierce wandering cultivators.</p><p></p><p>They actually dared to kill Refining Divine Celestials of the Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families!</p><p></p><p>With this incident, the third-rate Spiritual Sects and aristocratic families that had originally participated in the pursuit of Xu Yan and Meng Chong suddenly lost their courage!</p><p></p><p>They did not want to be ambushed and killed! Advancing to become a second-rate Spiritual Sect or aristocratic family, and the allure of spiritual crystal mines, were all illusions if they lost their lives.</p><p></p><p>"Father, you see, these are fierce people. Don't think that wandering cultivators can't produce fierce ones, don't forget the Bloodfiend Demon Lord."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou spoke to his father.</p><p></p><p>He was also greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong, these two sworn brothers, were truly fierce.</p><p></p><p>"My son is right, it's a good thing that our Shen family did not get involved."</p><p></p><p>Shen Wang nodded.</p><p></p><p>Although the Shen family was powerful, they could not withstand being targeted by these two fierce individuals. Shen Wang did not want to face a frantic situation.</p><p></p><p>In a certain city in Zheng Country, Xu Yan and Meng Chong walked side by side.</p><p></p><p>"It's time to go back."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Divine Sect and the Shu family were now on guard, if they rashly attacked, they might encounter an ambush, so the two did not plan to continue and instead returned to their master's temporary abode.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>After Li Xuan passed the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao to Fang Ao, he occasionally checked on Fang Ao and found that Fang Ao had been meditating on the mountain peak.</p><p></p><p>A few days later, Fang Ao still had not comprehended it.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not in a hurry either, the difficulty of comprehending the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao was highly praised by the Great Dao Golden Book, so to comprehend it would not be something that could be achieved in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Even just to enter the door.</p><p></p><p>While he was studying the laws of the Vast Azure Heavenly Earth, on the spiritual platform, the Great Dao Golden Book opened, and a golden light surged out.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but be delighted, could it be that Fang Ao had comprehended the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao? But he immediately denied it, according to the feedback rules of the Great Dao Golden Book, for a new martial dao system, one could only obtain feedback after cultivating to the entry level.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan and Meng Chong have been killing Refining Divine Celestials, your Divine Oblivion Two Techniques have been enhanced."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan: ...</p><p></p><p>What's going on with Xu Yan and Meng Chong? How come they've killed Refining Divine Celestials again?</p><p></p><p>"Were they from the Jade Divine Sect, or the Shu family?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan didn't take it to heart, Xu Yan and Meng Chong knew what they were doing, in terms of experience in roaming the martial dao world, they were far more experienced than their master.</p><p></p><p>One day, Fang Ao came down from the mountain peak, saying that he was going to look for a cultivation site, and once he found it, he was confident he could cultivate to the entry level.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly delighted, it seemed that Fang Ao had comprehended how to cultivate the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Is he going to rely on the momentum of heaven and earth, and set up a Mysterious Gate formation, in order to cultivate?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had some guesses in his heart.</p><p></p><p>After Fang Ao left with Little Ha for two days, he came back.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I've found the place to cultivate, I need to make some preparations for entering the cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded and said, "Whatever you need, just say it."</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Ao was overjoyed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>So, he began to build a forging platform in the manor, and Suli Xiu helped him complete the forging platform that Fang Ao needed.</p><p></p><p>After all, refining dan and forging artifacts have some similarities.</p><p></p><p>After the forging platform was built, Fang Ao began to forge precious artifacts, and during the forging process, he would inscribe some array patterns on these precious artifacts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quietly observed, and roughly guessed how Fang Ao was going to cultivate the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Ao has actually comprehended this cultivation method, could it be that this is the true cultivation method of the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao, and it is feasible?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became secretly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Mysterious Gate Martial Dao was something he had compiled, although he didn't give a specific cultivation method, he had compiled a theoretical one, and the method Fang Ao had comprehended was the most difficult and profound one in the theory.</p><p></p><p>"If this is truly the way to enter the door, the strength of the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao will exceed my expectations."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan couldn't help but look forward to it.</p><p></p><p>Fang Ao spent three days forging the precious artifacts he needed, these artifacts were all different, some were long poles, some were circular discs, some were columns, some were pedestals, etc.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, how are you going to use these forged artifacts?"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu looked at them curiously.</p><p></p><p>Each precious artifact seemed unrelated to each other, and she really couldn't figure out how they were related to cultivating the Mysterious Gate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"They are for borrowing momentum, but I'm not sure if I can succeed."</p><p></p><p>Fang Ao scratched his head and said modestly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I'm ready."</p><p></p><p>Fang Ao came before Li Xuan and said respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go do it according to your own comprehension."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Ao's gaze was determined.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to set out to the place he had found to cultivate, suddenly two figures descended in the manor.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had a curious expression.</p><p></p><p>When they returned, they found that the manor had some abnormalities, as if it was shrouded by an unknown force, creating a kind of disorienting illusion.</p><p></p><p>"Big Brother, it's a formation, the array plate that Fourth Brother forged and activated!"</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu smiled and greeted the two senior brothers.</p><p></p><p>"A formation?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong were shocked, so this was a formation? It indeed had some unusual aspects.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 382</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>For each realm, one must carefully consider and strive to make significant leaps in strength while maintaining a high degree of continuity and ease of comprehension, avoiding situations where progress stalls due to inability to grasp the concepts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan put a great deal of thought into the methods of the Heaven and Earth realm, finally compiling something he was satisfied with and that was sufficiently powerful.</p><p></p><p>"The cultivation direction beyond the Heaven and Earth realm has been roughly determined, but there's no rush to fully compile it yet. It needs deeper consideration to be perfected as much as possible," Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>For the Taicang martial arts system, he was still unclear about how to cultivate beyond the Immortal Heavenly Venerable realm and what realms lay beyond it. </p><p></p><p>Judging by the Dayue Emperor and other Immortal Heavenly Venerables, they didn't seem to have a concrete understanding of the path ahead either.</p><p></p><p>"The Immortal Heavenly Venerable is said to be in harmony with Heaven and Earth, with a lifespan equal to Heaven and Earth. But in reality, they have not truly become one with Heaven and Earth. They appear to wield the power to control a region of Heaven and Earth, but it ultimately feels somewhat insubstantial.</p><p></p><p>"From my understanding, the realm above Immortal Heavenly Venerable should possess the true power of unity with Heaven and Earth, truly grasping a region of Heaven and Earth in one's hand and genuinely wielding the power to control the laws of Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had some speculations about the realm above Immortal Heavenly Venerable.</p><p></p><p>And for the Taicang martial arts system, further cultivation would inevitably involve the Dao principles.</p><p></p><p>"Condensing laws into the body to become a Law Condensation Heavenly Venerable, then involving Dao principles should be condensing Dao principles into the body. A Dao Condensation realm perhaps?" Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>"What realm was the master of the Taicang Book at? To be able to record the laws and Dao principles of the Taicang Heaven and Earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought again of the master of the Taicang Book and the mysterious small stone house in the Wu Kingdom's imperial palace.</p><p></p><p>He had not yet fully memorized the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>The Dao principles were ultimately too profound. Even with his Void Breaking realm cultivation, it was somewhat difficult to memorize in a short time. The further he went, the more abstruse the Dao principles became and the more difficult they were to memorize.</p><p></p><p>"With transcending Heaven and Earth as the goal, once I transcend Heaven and Earth, I'll truly be invincible, right? Even the master of the Taicang Book won't be feared then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was full of confidence.</p><p></p><p>Of course, whether the master of the Taicang Book was still alive was an unknown. </p><p></p><p>He even suspected that the being in the mysterious small stone house might be the sealed master of the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>After teaching Xu Yan the methods of the Heaven and Earth realm, the next step was naturally to teach Meng Chong the second and third levels of the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body technique.</p><p></p><p>"The physical martial arts are the ultimate in physical cultivation. Each acupoint a star - isn't this also forging one's own Heaven and Earth? A physical Heaven and Earth, with a body as vast as Heaven and Earth, as powerful as Heaven and Earth..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan began to explain the Great Sun Star Indestructible Body technique, carefully explaining the second and third levels several times, especially the third level which involved cultivating the physical Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>After Meng Chong had fully memorized it, Li Xuan also supplemented Fang Hao with follow-up cultivation methods for the Qimen martial arts, further enhancing the Qimen techniques.</p><p></p><p>With this, the transmission of martial arts cultivation methods was complete.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sipped some spirit tea and said to Xu Yan: "Disciple, you are only half a step away from the Wisdom Sword realm. Today, your master will transmit to you the realms beyond Wisdom Sword."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was already very close to the Wisdom Sword realm, so it was time to pass on the subsequent sword realms to him.</p><p></p><p>Above the Wisdom Sword realm was the Sacred Sword realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had already compiled this - it was the best realm to connect with the Wisdom Sword realm.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Wisdom Sword realm is the Sacred Sword realm, centered on the word 'sacred'! You must thoroughly comprehend the true meaning of sacredness. The great sage of the sword - no sword does not bow to it, no sword does not follow it, no sword does not revere it, no sword dares to oppose it.</p><p></p><p>"With a thought of the sacred sword, all swords in the world respond to it, all bow down and follow.</p><p></p><p>"One thought of the sacred sword, and all swords of Heaven and Earth can gather and be used..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan transmitted the Sacred Sword realm to Xu Yan bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was excited and greatly shocked. The Wisdom Sword realm was already mysterious and extraordinary, but the Sacred Sword realm was even more inconceivable.</p><p></p><p>In a single thought, all swords under heaven could be used as one's own, all could become disciples of the sacred sword? Wasn't this like in a single thought, all swords under heaven had gained intelligence and would rush through fire and water for the sacred sword?</p><p></p><p>It was simply unimaginable!</p><p></p><p>"The Wisdom Sword realm is already so difficult to comprehend, so mysterious, so powerful. When will I ever be able to understand the Sacred Sword realm?</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps when I transcend Heaven and Earth, with sufficient martial realm and insights, I'll be able to comprehend the Sacred Sword realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>After transmitting the Sacred Sword realm to Xu Yan, Li Xuan naturally also transmitted to Meng Chong the realm above the Bright Blade realm. The sword and blade had similarities.</p><p></p><p>So, above the Bright Blade realm was similarly called the Sacred Blade realm. Once one entered the Sacred Blade realm, it was similar to the Sacred Sword realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan had also wanted to give the realm above Bright Blade in the way of the blade a more mysterious name, different from the sword way.</p><p></p><p>However, it wasn't easy to come up with one, so he had to give up and use the name Sacred Blade realm.</p><p></p><p>"Whether it's the way of the sword or the way of the blade, they ultimately arrive at the same destination by different routes. It's just that the intent of blade and sword are different," Li Xuan added after finishing the transmission.</p><p></p><p>With this, the transmission of martial arts was complete. What followed would depend entirely on the disciples.</p><p></p><p>As for Li Xuan, he needed to start arranging for subsequent martial arts, including compiling powerful divine abilities and classifying them into tiers.</p><p></p><p>"Being the Martial Ancestor isn't easy either. It really taxes the brain," Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong each went to find a place to digest and comprehend what they had learned.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao also went back to attend to matters of the Qimen Institute. Whether it was artifact refining or formations, they were extremely busy. The demand for formations from the Great Yue Kingdom alone was already enormous, not to mention the entire Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was the same, busy with alchemy and researching various pills.</p><p></p><p>And Jiang Buping, the newly accepted disciple, was also in seclusion comprehending the Extreme Soul martial arts. However, Li Xuan estimated that he wouldn't be able to enter the door in a short time.</p><p></p><p>The Unchanging Qi was not so easily resolved.</p><p></p><p>"Finally, I can quietly delve into the Taicang Book again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a breath and took out the Taicang Book to continue studying it.</p><p></p><p>Time flew by. After arriving in the Divine Realm, everyone was busy. No one came to disturb Li Xuan in his courtyard, and he was happy to have the peace and quiet.</p><p></p><p>But he was not idle. Though he appeared leisurely reading a book, he was actually using divided attention, racking his brains for the great cause of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>On this day, Wu Tiannan broke through to the Law Condensation Heavenly Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou and Yue Changming also broke through in succession, followed by Fu Tianhai, the Great Zhou Emperor and others, who also broke through to the Law Condensation Heavenly Venerable realm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng also broke through immediately after. As soon as he broke through, he became arrogant again, seeking to spar with his father-in-law and defeating Fu Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai was quite upset, with a dark expression all day long. Whenever he saw his daughter, he complained about what kind of husband she had found who didn't know how to respect his father-in-law.</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun was furious. So every time Fu Tianhai complained, she would beat Xie Tianheng once. This family became quite lively.</p><p></p><p>The farce only ended when Xie Tianheng yielded to his father-in-law.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has broken through to great completion of the Divine Ability realm. Your divine ability power has doubled."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had broken through to great completion of the Divine Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>"My strength has increased a bit again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt somewhat regretful that he hadn't</p><p></p><p>Here is a full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Advancing to a higher realm only doubled the power of spiritual abilities.</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan broke through, Meng Chong also achieved minor accomplishment in spiritual abilities. </p><p></p><p>Then Su Lingxiu also achieved minor accomplishment in spiritual abilities, and Li Xuan's strength increased once again, though not by a large margin.</p><p></p><p>Half a year after arriving in the Great Yue Kingdom, Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao, Zi Yun, and Yue'er also successively broke through to become Condensed Law Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>On this day, strong experts sent by the upper sects of Tai Miao Sect, Great Zhou Kingdom, and Yuntian Beihai City arrived.</p><p></p><p>Finally, it was time to say goodbye again.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, you must come find me," said Zi Yun, hanging onto Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>She had wanted to stay too, but considering her martial arts cultivation was ultimately different, only by going to the upper sect of the Great Zhou Kingdom could she cultivate better.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I'll come visit you when I travel the Divine Realm," Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>The Great Zhou Kingdom's background was stronger than the Imperial Spirit Mansion, Thousand Martial Palace, and Thunder Cloud Manor, belonging to the Divine Realm's number one dynasty, a subordinate of the Great Yan Dynasty.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yan Dynasty ruled over the Great Yan Territory of the Divine Realm, with extremely strong power, far surpassing the Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao were also leaving, saying goodbye to Xu Yan and Su Lingxiu.</p><p></p><p>The upper sect of Tai Miao Sect was Tai Miao Divine Sect, with strength ranking at the top in the Divine Realm. </p><p></p><p>And because Xin Mengrou cultivated special techniques, she would receive attention upon entering Tai Miao Divine Sect, with a status that wouldn't be too low.</p><p></p><p>The Yuntian Island of Beihai Territory that Yuntian Beihai City belonged to was also extremely strong, home to the Sea Spirit race.</p><p></p><p>However, Cai Ling'er had no plans to go to Beihai Territory, choosing to stay instead. For her, the greatest opportunity was to follow an expert.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, I'll be waiting for you in Beihai Territory!" Xie Lingfeng said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>He was also going to Beihai Territory with his parents and grandfather.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was not far from the Spiritual Ability realm. It was believed that after arriving in Beihai Territory, he would quickly break through to the Spiritual Ability realm.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, martial arts techniques all the way up to the Void Breaking realm had been passed down to Xie Lingfeng, so there would be no stagnation in his martial arts progress.</p><p></p><p>If Xie Lingfeng cultivated to the Void Breaking realm, his strength would only be stronger than Immortal Celestial Lords, enough to roam freely in the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, there were Heavenly Caves in the Divine Realm, facing invasions from enemies beyond the sky. Entering the Heavenly Caves to fight was ultimately dangerous.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, everyone had life-saving jade talismans.</p><p></p><p>After reluctantly parting, they set off on the road to the upper sects with the people from the upper sects.</p><p></p><p>After all the familiar faces from the Spirit Realm had left, Wu Tiannan stayed for a few days before also bidding farewell and leaving to roam the Divine Realm in search of his martial arts guide.</p><p></p><p>Everyone now had their own martial arts path. Xu Yan and Meng Chong were also preparing to go out and make a name for themselves.</p><p></p><p>"Master, this disciple may not return until breaking through to the Void Breaking realm!" Xu Yan respectfully bid farewell to his master.</p><p></p><p>"Go then. The path of martial arts is ultimately under one's feet. Looking at the world of the Divine Realm and seeing the wonders of heaven and earth will help with martial arts insights," Li Xuan nodded and said.</p><p></p><p>He wasn't worried about his disciple's safety, as they had life-saving jade talismans.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, Xu Yan and Meng Chong were no longer newcomers to the martial arts world, being experienced in roaming the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, they both had life-saving spiritual abilities.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not far from the Divine Phase realm. Once he entered the Divine Phase realm, ordinary Immortal Celestial Lords would be unable to break through his Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword defense.</p><p></p><p>The same was true for Meng Chong. His defense was extremely powerful, and his abilities to conceal his aura and escape far surpassed those of Great Cang martial artists.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu, Fang Hao, and Jiang Buping, who had been in seclusion comprehending Extreme Soul martial arts, all temporarily came out of seclusion.</p><p></p><p>"Big Senior Brother, Second Senior Brother, we await news of your fame spreading throughout the Divine Realm," Su Lingxiu said with a grin.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Rubbing his bald head, Meng Chong said, "Junior Sister can just wait. My fame will surely spread throughout the Divine Realm, just like in the Spirit Realm."</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, where are you heading next?" Xu Yan looked at Meng Chong with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"I'll roam around Qinghua Territory for now. I want to go to the Heavenly Caves to kill some blood slaves and blood disciples, and loot some treasures from the Heavenly Caves," Meng Chong said after some thought.</p><p></p><p>"I have the same idea. I'm going to the territory of Tianwu Gate, which happens to be the upper sect of Thousand Martial Palace. I suddenly miss blocking the entrance of Thousand Martial Palace, but unfortunately I can't do that at Tianwu Gate," Xu Yan said with some regret.</p><p></p><p>"If Big Senior Brother is going to Tianwu Gate, then I'll go to Ten Thousand Thunder Sect," Meng Chong also made his decision.</p><p></p><p>After the two senior brothers bid farewell to their junior brothers and sisters, they each set off on their own journeys.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had an envious look, "It's a pity I can't get away, and my strength is also a bit weaker. My martial arts path is different from Big Senior Brother and Second Senior Brother, otherwise I would also want to make a name for myself. I can only wait until my strength increases before going out."</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu, however, didn't have this idea. She smiled and said, "I still prefer to stay by Master's side. Wherever Master goes, I'll follow. I can also see the world that way."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had an envious look. He sighed and said, "It's a pity my body is unwell and I haven't yet entered the door of martial arts. Otherwise I would also go roam this Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>His gaze gradually became determined, his expression solemn as he said, "I will return to Taikun Territory. Some people and some accounts need to be settled!"</p><p></p><p>"Junior Brother, I believe you will definitely be able to cultivate successfully and resolve the undissipating qi. Then you'll be able to take revenge," Su Lingxiu comforted.</p><p></p><p>"Fifth Junior Brother, if you need anything, Senior Brother will lend a hand to help you show your might in Taikun Territory, letting those people see how you look down on the geniuses of the Divine Realm!" Fang Hao patted Jiang Buping's shoulder and said.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Third Senior Sister and Fourth Senior Brother. I will definitely succeed in my cultivation," Jiang Buping said excitedly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao continued to busy himself with matters of the Qimen Academy, while also teaching the methods of formation arrangement.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was the same, beginning to teach the arts of medicine and alchemy, imparting knowledge of pill refining.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping returned to seclusion to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>The small courtyard became quiet. Li Xuan sat in a chair reading the Taicang Book, with only Cai Ling'er attending to him.</p><p></p><p>"Your bloodline is extraordinary, being that of the Sea Spirit Monarch. It just hasn't been activated yet. Once activated, you will receive the inheritance of the Sea Spirit Monarch.</p><p></p><p>"Very well, you've been following me for some time now. I'll guide you in activating your bloodline," Li Xuan said, looking at Cai Ling'er who was quietly brewing tea and attending to him.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Cai Ling'er was stunned, then excitedly bowed deeply.</p><p></p><p>"Since you've chosen to attend to me, don't call me Senior anymore. Call me... Sir," Li Xuan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Sir!" Cai Ling'er said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and pointed, transmitting the method to activate the bloodline into Cai Ling'er's soul.</p><p></p><p>"Go now, find a place to activate your bloodline on your own. You don't need to attend to me these days."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze returned to the Taicang Book.</p><p></p><p>"Yes!" Cai Ling'er respectfully retreated, leaving excitedly to go into seclusion and activate her bloodline.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

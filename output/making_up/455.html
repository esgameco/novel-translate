        <h1>Chapter 455</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The island was moving slowly.</p><p></p><p>It seemed like a floating island, but it was completely barren, without a single plant or tree visible.</p><p></p><p>The island was not small, spanning over ten miles in circumference, floating on the sea surface and moving slowly.</p><p></p><p>The "Ten Thousand Islands of the Azure Sea" refers to islands with martial arts forces and human settlements, not that the Azure Sea Realm only has ten thousand islands.</p><p></p><p>No one knows exactly how many islands exist in the entire Azure Sea Realm.</p><p></p><p>An island spanning ten miles in circumference is nothing special in the Azure Sea Realm, just a negligible small island.</p><p></p><p>What caught Xu Yan's attention was not the island itself, nor that it could move, but that this island was not actually a real island.</p><p></p><p>It turned out to be a huge black giant turtle in disguise.</p><p></p><p>Even though this giant turtle was trying its best to conceal its aura and blend into the sea, disguised as an island, it still could not escape Xu Yan's notice.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a native turtle!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan immediately became intrigued.</p><p></p><p>The aura on this giant turtle clearly did not belong to a spirit beast of the divine realm, nor was it a sea beast of the Azure Sea Realm, but rather a creature from beyond heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He thought of some rumors about the Heavenly Cave in the Azure Sea Realm, that some creatures had escaped from the Heavenly Cave and were hiding in the vast sea. Every time an Immortal Venerable of the Azure Sea Realm inspected the entire realm, they would discover some hidden outsiders.</p><p></p><p>With this giant turtle's disguise, an Immortal Venerable would definitely not be able to discover it!</p><p></p><p>"This turtle is interesting, I wonder if it's hiding any treasures from beyond the heavens!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes lit up.</p><p></p><p>He was quite interested in treasures from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>After all, the Seven Wondrous Divine Flowers seemed to be treasures from beyond the heavens, and the jade bamboo in his hand was also a treasure from beyond the heavens.</p><p></p><p>Mei Wu was an existence from beyond heaven and earth, so her treasures naturally could not be from within the Cang Heaven and Earth.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan put away his flying boat and soared into the sky, flying towards the giant turtle.</p><p></p><p>As soon as Xu Yan appeared, the originally slowly moving giant turtle immediately stopped moving.</p><p></p><p>Thud! Xu Yan landed on the giant turtle's back, and the soil and rocks disguised as an island instantly crumbled away in a large area, revealing a patch of dark black turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>Thud thud thud! Xu Yan stomped his feet on the turtle shell, making thumping sounds. Each time his foot landed, a ripple of dark black light would spread out.</p><p></p><p>"Huh, this small island is really strange!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stomped while pretending to mutter to himself.</p><p></p><p>The soil and rocks continued to crumble away, revealing an increasingly wide area of turtle back. The dark black turtle back seemed to contain some profound patterns, heavy and solid, indestructible.</p><p></p><p>"This turtle shell's defense is so strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was secretly surprised.</p><p></p><p>His seemingly casual stomps each contained enough force to destroy an ordinary Immortal Venerable, yet the turtle shell remained unharmed, completely unaffected.</p><p></p><p>Let alone cracks, the entire turtle shell barely even felt any vibrations.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The seawater surged up, and a turtle head emerged from the water, looking back at Xu Yan on its back. "Stop stomping, if you stomp any more, I'm going to die!"</p><p></p><p>This young man clearly discovered me, yet he's still pretending! The giant turtle felt somewhat helpless. I was careless, I didn't notice there was someone like him nearby, otherwise how could I have been exposed.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out his sword and said, "Stomping definitely won't kill you. I want to try if one sword strike can break open your turtle shell!"</p><p></p><p>"Young man, if you have any conditions just say them directly. This old turtle really can't withstand your torment. Besides, I have no malicious intentions or hostility here, I've never harmed anyone!"</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle said with great distress.</p><p></p><p>"Since Brother Turtle is so straightforward, I won't be polite then!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>While observing this giant turtle, its strength was at the Immortal realm, but its true power was probably stronger than even a typical peak Immortal realm cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Xu Yan suspected that no Immortal realm cultivator could break through its defense.</p><p></p><p>On the giant turtle's head was a patch of blue scales, with fine patterns like waves, and at a glance, it seemed as if one could see the waves surging.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's intuition told him that this giant turtle was extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"I've been struggling with cultivation lately, encountering bottlenecks in my martial insights. I'm a bit short on resources and lacking in treasures. What do you think, Brother Turtle?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle was very helpless. It opened its mouth and spat out a storage bag, saying, "Young friend, you can take the things in here. This is all my treasured collection."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reached out and grabbed the storage bag. He opened it to look inside while putting it away, and said, "Brother Turtle, are you trying to brush off a beggar? This little bit of stuff, and they're all common treasures from the divine realm, just things you collected in the Azure Sea Realm. These originally belong to the divine realm."</p><p></p><p>"You're an outsider, occupying treasures of the divine realm, which you shouldn't do in the first place. Yet you dare to try to brush off me, Xu Yan, with this?"</p><p></p><p>Sword intent surged from his body. In an instant, giant swords rose up from the sea surface, surrounding the area. More giant swords crossed in the air above, completely enveloping the giant turtle.</p><p></p><p>An aura of annihilation and killing intent rippled through heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle raised its head to look at the giant swords formed from sea waves, with shock in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend, let's talk this over. Just tell me directly, what do you want?"</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle sighed and said.</p><p></p><p>"Sure, sure. I, Xu Yan, am quite interested in things from beyond the heavens. I wonder if Brother Turtle..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle was silent for a moment, then said in a deep voice, "Young friend, I have an item I can give you, but I need to make a deal with you. How about it?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, "That depends on whether your item is worth it."</p><p></p><p>"It won't disappoint you, young friend."</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle said, then opened its mouth and spat out a small turtle shell. The shell was pale green, emanating a faint glow. Although it didn't reveal a powerful aura, Xu Yan immediately noticed the extraordinariness of this turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>It seemed as if there was a universe inside the turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"This is the shell of the Primordial Turtle, which I obtained by chance. It can be considered a supreme treasure. What do you think, young friend?"</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Not bad, this Primordial Turtle Shell is extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, expressing his approval.</p><p></p><p>"Tell me, what deal do you want?"</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle said in a deep voice, "My deal is simple. When young friend becomes powerful enough, capture a strand of heaven and earth's Dao essence for me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. Capture a strand of heaven and earth's Dao essence? For now, he was unable to capture heaven and earth's Dao essence.</p><p></p><p>Unless he broke through to the Heaven and Earth realm, then he could do it.</p><p></p><p>Heaven and earth's Dao essence was extremely mysterious, not as easy to capture as the essence of Dao principles. This involved the fundamental essence of the Dao of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"Heaven and earth's Dao essence is very precious, and not easy to capture."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan didn't immediately agree.</p><p></p><p>"This Primordial Turtle Shell is much more precious than a strand of heaven and earth's Dao essence. It contains some mysteries within itself, even the Dao of the Primordial Turtle."</p><p></p><p>"However, after all, I am the one asking a favor from young friend. How about this - when young friend comes to capture a strand of heaven and earth's Dao essence for me in the future, I will gift you an additional great secret. This secret holds a great opportunity, though it also comes with some risks."</p><p></p><p>The giant turtle pondered for a moment before saying.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of great</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was somewhat curious.</p><p></p><p>The great opportunity the giant turtle spoke of must be outside of heaven and earth. It would be a long time before he had enough strength to explore it.</p><p></p><p>"An opportunity much greater than this primordial turtle shell, a truly great opportunity," the giant turtle said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Such a great opportunity, why don't you go after it yourself?" Xu Yan stomped his foot on the turtle's back.</p><p></p><p>"I don't have that ability, and that place also fills me with fear... This matter is too profound. When you have enough strength, young friend, I will naturally tell you the details. </p><p></p><p>"Also, if you can obtain that great opportunity, I will follow you for the rest of my life," the giant turtle said with a sigh.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned. The giant turtle wasn't lying. When speaking of that opportunity, a hint of fear unconsciously flashed in the depths of its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, I agree!" Xu Yan nodded after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>Since it was a great opportunity, he could go after it when his strength was great enough.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, young friend!" The giant turtle breathed a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan waved his hand, and the primordial turtle shell fell into his palm.</p><p></p><p>Without examining it closely, he put it away directly and asked, "Turtle brother, what should I call you?"</p><p></p><p>"Canghai!" The giant turtle replied after pondering for a moment.</p><p></p><p>"Canghai Turtle?" Xu Yan murmured. He had never heard of this turtle's name before.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and tossed a communication talisman to Canghai Turtle, saying, "Keep this communication talisman. If I obtain the Dao rhyme of heaven and earth, I will naturally contact you. If I have any questions, I will also use this to contact you."</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle was stunned, looking at the communication talisman, and asked, "How far can it communicate?"</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother said it can communicate anywhere within heaven and earth, but we haven't tested it yet. However, it can communicate within the divine realm," Xu Yan said. After finishing, his figure soared into the sky and disappeared in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Canghai Turtle looked at the communication talisman, somewhat dazed, muttering to himself: "When did the Taicang world have such an item? Why do I feel that this person's martial way is not the Taicang martial way?" Strange, how could there be a non-Taicang martial way in the Taicang world? Moreover, among the world's martial ways, Taicang is supreme. No one would abandon the strong for the weak.</p><p></p><p>"No, his martial way is stronger than the Taicang martial way!</p><p></p><p>"Has something changed in the Taicang world? Could it be that Taicang didn't die and developed an even stronger martial way?"</p><p></p><p>As Canghai Turtle thought this, he was startled, but then shook his head: "Impossible, Taicang couldn't possibly be alive."</p><p></p><p>He looked up at the sky, sighed, and slowly disappeared into the sea.</p><p></p><p>After leaving Canghai Turtle, Xu Yan took out a flying boat and drifted on the sea. He sat in the flying boat and took out the primordial turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"How strong was Canghai Turtle in the past?" Xu Yan wondered curiously.</p><p></p><p>He didn't directly snatch it, but made a deal with Canghai Turtle. One of the most important reasons was that although Canghai Turtle seemed to be only at the Immortal realm, once it fought with all its might, it was impossible to gauge how strong it could become.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if he had done so, Canghai Turtle would probably have paid a huge price for it, perhaps never being able to recover.</p><p></p><p>It was precisely because of this that Canghai Turtle was unwilling to turn hostile.</p><p></p><p>Of course, there was another factor. Canghai Turtle had perceived Xu Yan's extraordinariness, his enormous potential, that he was a prodigy of the world. Therefore, it befriended him and made a deal.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the primordial turtle shell, his expression full of joy.</p><p></p><p>Inside the primordial turtle shell was a small space, like a small world, with spiritual energy swirling. It would absorb spiritual energy from the world, and martial artists could seclude themselves in it for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it couldn't be stored in the storage ring."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was overjoyed. The primordial turtle shell was indeed a treasure.</p><p></p><p>"It contains a small world, operating with its own rules. Perhaps I can comprehend the Realm of Establishing the Way in it."</p><p></p><p>As Xu Yan thought this, his divine elemental power surged out, entering the primordial turtle shell, beginning to claim ownership of it and nurture it into his body.</p><p></p><p>As the primordial turtle shell was being nurtured by the divine elemental power, its swirling light became brighter, and patterns like rules flashed on the turtle's back.</p><p></p><p>The flying boat drifted on the sea, and Xu Yan was immersed in claiming ownership and nurturing the primordial turtle shell, unaware of where the flying boat was drifting.</p><p></p><p>Time passed, and finally Xu Yan's consciousness formed a connection with the primordial turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>With a single thought, he could see the small world inside the primordial turtle shell.</p><p></p><p>"Finally succeeded!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan showed a joyful expression.</p><p></p><p>He pointed with his hand, and the primordial turtle shell glowed with swirling light. Xu Yan's figure instantly disappeared from the spot, leaving only a small turtle shell in the flying boat.</p><p></p><p>"Is this the space of the primordial turtle shell?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around, his face full of shock.</p><p></p><p>Only after truly entering the small world of the primordial turtle shell did he genuinely feel the wonder of this small world.</p><p></p><p>The spiritual energy was dense, swirling into a faint mist.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, because Xu Yan had claimed ownership and nurtured the primordial turtle shell, he could clearly sense the existence of rules in this small space, similar to the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"This is like a small world, and the primordial turtle shell has its own laws, operating this small world..."</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Xu Yan's mind became clear, and the methods of the martial way of the Realm of Establishing the Way emerged one by one.</p><p></p><p>"What level of strength did this primordial turtle have when it was alive?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was amazed.</p><p></p><p>The turtle shell contained its own small world, with rules operating. Weren't these rules formed from the insights the primordial turtle gained during cultivation?</p><p></p><p>"Canghai Turtle's strength is probably not weaker than the primordial turtle's."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was astounded.</p><p></p><p>However, such a powerful Canghai Turtle had fallen to this state. What great calamity had it encountered?</p><p></p><p>"Even with such powerful strength, one can fall and end up like this. I'm merely at the Void-breaking realm, I must be even more cautious and careful, and not be arrogant or conceited!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan admonished himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>He also thought of the towering figure he had seen when crossing the wilderness.</p><p></p><p>Was the owner of this towering figure still alive? Or had they also perished? What terrifying enemy had they encountered?</p><p></p><p>"Only Master is truly invincible!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"This place is perfect for comprehending the Realm of Establishing the Way. When I nurture the primordial turtle shell into my mountains and rivers, it will further help me understand the Realm of Establishing the Way."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sat cross-legged in the primordial turtle world, his divine consciousness sensing the rules of the primordial turtle world, beginning to comprehend the Realm of Establishing the Way.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, a jade bamboo appeared, landing in front of him.</p><p></p><p>"Jade bamboo, primordial turtle world, with these as aids, I can quickly comprehend the Realm of Establishing the Way, and also lay the foundation for my breakthrough to the Heaven and Earth realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thought silently.</p><p></p><p>A flying boat drifted aimlessly in the sea, having long since deviated from any shipping route of the Bihai realm.</p><p></p><p>In the flying boat, there was only a small turtle shell, and this small turtle shell no longer emitted swirling light. Instead, it seemed as if a layer of moss had grown on the turtle shell, making it look like the shell of an ordinary turtle that had died.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 243</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao belatedly realized that something was amiss.</p><p></p><p>"How come I just said everything just now?" </p><p></p><p>He had almost revealed all his secrets.</p><p></p><p>"I was too excited this time, and ended up saying everything. Next time I must be more careful, I must be cautious!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao silently admonished himself. </p><p></p><p>He absolutely cannot be so careless again, blurting out whatever others ask. </p><p></p><p>Little did he know that with his abilities, under Li Xuan's divine will, he was completely unable to resist, and unknowingly ended up revealing everything.</p><p></p><p>The divine will is the will of heaven, and the will of heaven cannot be defied!</p><p></p><p>As a great master-level martial artist, how could he resist it? </p><p></p><p>He didn't even notice anything improper.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao did not dwell on it further, but instead stared at the formation diagram, feeling that the patterns contained profound principles, far from ordinary.</p><p></p><p>"A great opportunity?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>He immersed himself completely in researching the formation diagram, pondering how to refine it into a treasure, and what the shape of the treasure should be.</p><p></p><p>"A treasure may not be able to contain the diagram, judging from the flow of the patterns, it seems to belong to a set? A main treasure, accompanied by a few auxiliary treasures, forming a combination?"</p><p></p><p>Gradually, Fang Hao began to get some ideas.</p><p></p><p>Since there were no restrictions on the treasures or their quantity, he could freely follow his own ideas.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao threw himself wholeheartedly into the treasure refining, full of drive.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan brought the battle puppet back to the small manor.</p><p></p><p>"Master, what is this?"Su Ling asked curiously as she approached.</p><p></p><p>"A puppet? Using so many precious materials to forge this puppet, isn't that a waste?" Su Ling exclaimed after taking a look around.</p><p></p><p>"This is a battle puppet, but the one who forged it did not understand its essence, so it turned out quite useless," Li Xuan said, tapping a divine element into the puppet.</p><p></p><p>The battle puppet started moving, repeating the same few attack techniques.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling's eyes widened in amazement. "It can actually fight? But it's too crude, and the attack power is not strong, it can only deal with cultivators below the first rank."</p><p></p><p>"No, below the third rank. As long as one can dodge its attacks, they can find its weaknesses and defeat it. Only cultivators below the third rank, whose strength is not great, may be slain by its attacks," Shi Er, Zhou Ying, and Meng Shu Shu all nodded in agreement after taking a look.</p><p></p><p>"So it's quite useless," Li Xuan smiled. "It can still serve as a toy."</p><p></p><p>The battle puppet stopped moving, and Su Ling curiously infused some true qi, making it move again.</p><p></p><p>"Master, the battle puppet seems too fragile, it can hardly withstand much true qi, or it will collapse," Su Ling said with a frown.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. Even a thread of his divine will was almost too much for it to bear.</p><p></p><p>"It's truly just a toy."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling soon lost interest in playing with it, but Shi Er took it to the side to play with.</p><p></p><p>"Fang Hao has extraordinary ideas and talent, he should be able to pass the test. This disciple, it seems that only fate can determine him," Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's talent in treasure refining was truly extraordinary, be it the battle puppet or other treasures, they were beyond the current Spiritual Realm's capabilities. They were Fang Hao's own creations.</p><p></p><p>This showed his exceptional talent in this area, which was very suitable for cultivating the Mysterious Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>However, the Mysterious Martial Dao encompassed not only treasure refining, but also formations, seals, and more. So it still needed to be tested. If Fang Hao could refine the formation diagram into a treasure, it would prove his talents in both treasure refining and formations.</p><p></p><p>"In the vast Spiritual Realm, finding a suitable disciple is not easy. I hope Fang Hao is the unique one," Li Xuan thought to himself as he opened the Great Dao Golden Book to review the Mysterious Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Even my indestructible divine armor cannot be broken through."</p><p></p><p>"I'll go directly to raid the treasure vault, and then deal with them. As for you, senior brother, Dai Sheng the Cultivated Celestial is not weak in strength either."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong spoke in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"As for Dai Sheng's strength, I'm well aware of it. I clashed with him a few times before, and now my strength has increased significantly, having broken through to the Heart Sword Realm. </p><p></p><p>"Even if I cannot defeat Dai Sheng, he won't be able to harm me either."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said confidently.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon coiled around Xu Yan's wrist, feeling that these two brothers were truly too reckless, wanting to raid a powerful clan. </p><p></p><p>If they really succeeded, the entire Yuzhou would be shaken.</p><p></p><p>The Jade Deity Sect and the Su Clan would be restless day and night.</p><p></p><p>"Be careful, other clans or Spiritual Sects may come to their aid, as many of these clans are intermarried. Once they face the threat of annihilation, the powerful experts of other clans will surely come to their rescue."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon warned.</p><p></p><p>"It's not a big problem. Neither the Jade Deity Sect nor the Su Clan would expect us to dare to attack the Dai Clan. By the time the other experts arrive, we'll have already raided and left."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sneered.</p><p></p><p>"It doesn't matter if I can't kill Dai Sheng, as long as I can plunder the Dai Clan's treasure vault, I'll be satisfied."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly grabbed the Jade Little Dragon and stuffed it into Meng Chong's pocket, instructing, "You're responsible for looting the treasure vault."</p><p></p><p>"I'll try my best to clean it out."</p><p></p><p>The Jade Little Dragon nodded.</p><p></p><p>At this point, there was no turning back. Unless it didn't want to follow Xu Yan or obtain the Great Demon's Technique, it had no choice but to go all-in.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, it also found this thrilling! Raiding a powerful clan would definitely be a sensation in the martial arts world.</p><p></p><p>Night fell!</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was in the midst of cultivation when suddenly, his expression turned cold, and he abruptly opened his eyes.</p><p></p><p>"Enemy attack!"</p><p></p><p>The Dai Clan elder roared.</p><p></p><p>Howl! A golden giant dragon thundered down, directly smashing a building, and a figure flew out from the building.</p><p></p><p>"If you seek your own destruction, then I shall oblige you!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng held a spiritual weapon, a long saber, in his hand.</p><p></p><p>He slashed out with the saber, and the sword light swept across the night sky, the might of the Cultivated Celestial shaking the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised his hand and unleashed a sword, the Xun Wind Sword Intent surging and colliding with Dai Sheng's spiritual power, even subtly suppressing Dai Sheng's spiritual power, preventing him from fully unleashing his spiritual power's might.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's expression changed drastically. At this moment, he felt a heavy sensation in his spiritual power, hastily activating his cultivation technique to refine his spiritual power, lest he suffer damage to his spiritual power if he let his guard down.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of cultivation technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was alarmed.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power was like being blown by a fierce wind, occasionally wavering, and the originally domineering spiritual power had lost its usual spiritual might.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was cold as he said, "Old ghost of the Dai Clan, behold my sword!"</p><p></p><p>Mountains and rivers appeared, thunder rumbling, and Xu Yan slashed out sword after sword, instantly engaging in a fierce battle with Dai Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng was greatly shocked. The last time he had clashed with Xu Yan, he was not a match for him and had to flee frantically. Yet, it had been such a short time, and Xu Yan's strength had increased so terrifyingly! "He is not in the Cultivated Realm or the Unified Realm, the cultivation technique he practices seems to be extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's killing intent surged. Tonight, no matter what, he could not let Xu Yan escape, or else the consequences would be dire. With Xu Yan's rate of improvement, would he not become Dai Sheng's opponent in the near future?</p><p></p><p>Boom! The saber light shook, and at this moment, Dai Sheng dared not be the slightest bit careless, as layers of saber light illuminated the sky, the might of the Cultivated Celestial fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>The Dai Clan elders were all anxious, fearing that Dai Sheng would not be able to withstand it, and then the Dai Clan would be in danger.</p><p></p><p>A spirit pearl was crushed! This was a signal to seek aid from allied clans and Spiritual Sects.</p><p></p><p>"The Cultivated Celestial is indeed powerful, not to be underestimated."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression was grave.</p><p></p><p>He had reached the Spirit Sense Realm, and the Spirit Sense Realm Mastery was not far away. The Xun Wind Sword Intent was also targeted at the spiritual power, yet even so, he was still at a disadvantage in the battle against Dai Sheng.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt the pressure.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is not an easy path, but this is a good opportunity to temper myself!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not afraid at all, his body radiating a brilliant glow, as if the divine aura was revealed.</p><p></p><p>He unleashed the Mountain and River Sword Dao, sword after sword, constantly refining himself in the battle.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Two sword lights suddenly flew out, forming sword wheels, sweeping towards Dai Sheng! The Life-and-Death Sword Wheels!</p><p></p><p>The fierce battle kept Dai Sheng occupied, preventing him from diverting his attention, and then Meng Chong made his move!</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>A golden armored giant descended from the sky, like a divine deity, startling all the Dai Clan elders, who broke out in cold sweat!</p><p></p><p>Transforming into a sixty-foot giant, Meng Chong unleashed his Indestructible Divine Armor, the golden armor covering his body, shining with a blazing golden light, like burning golden flames.</p><p></p><p>He paid no heed to the elders and rushed straight towards one of the treasure vaults.</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, stop him!"</p><p></p><p>The elders frantically shouted.</p><p></p><p>The powerful Celestial-level elders unleashed their mighty powers, but the torrents of force merely struck the giant's body, unable to cause significant damage.</p><p></p><p>The armor was only briefly damaged, but it instantly recovered.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The giant's massive fist, accompanied by the might of wind and thunder, struck out!</p><p></p><p>Thud! The Dai Clan ancestral hall was instantly smashed open, and the hidden treasure vault within the ancestral hall was exposed.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! The Jade Little Dragon swiftly darted into the treasure vault, its body rapidly expanding, and it opened its huge mouth, frantically devouring the treasures inside.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned around, blocking the entrance to the treasure vault, preventing the Dai Clan elders from interfering.</p><p></p><p>His fists thundered out, the savage power akin to swatting mosquitoes, and in an instant, one of the Celestial-level elders was blasted to pieces!</p><p></p><p>"Kill him!" </p><p></p><p>The Dai Clan elders roared, their eyes reddened, charging towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Although they were numerous, Meng Chong was unafraid, not even bothering to defend, just punching out one after another, causing the elders to be horrified.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Another elder was blasted to pieces! At this moment, the elders were utterly despairing.</p><p></p><p>What kind of person was this? Where did this golden armored giant come from? When had there ever been giants in the Spirit Realm? The defense was too terrifying, the spiritual weapons only managed to crack the golden armor, but it instantly recovered.</p><p></p><p>There was no way to harm the giant! The opponent didn't even need to defend, relying solely on the overwhelming physical strength to withstand the attacks, while they, if they were not careful, would be blasted to pieces by a single punch! The disparity in strength was simply too great!</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?"</p><p></p><p>Dai Sheng's expression changed drastically, and he slashed out a few powerful sword strikes, forcing Xu Yan back slightly, before turning to deal with the mysterious golden armored giant. However, in that instant, Dai Sheng's expression changed dramatically! Forgetting about the golden armored giant, he roared, and the sword light formed a sword light shield to defend himself.</p><p></p><p>In that moment, the houses, trees, and plants all rose up, transforming into fierce swords, attacking from all directions!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked forward calmly, and behind him, the houses and plants all took to the air, becoming a swarm of swords in the sky above the Dai Clan.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, all things became swords! Dai Sheng's face was filled with fear, his body shivering, what kind of cultivation technique was this? Where did this monstrous cultivator come from?</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

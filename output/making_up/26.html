            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 26 What a Demonic Disciple This Is (Seeking Continued Readership)</p><p></p><p>"Gulp!"</p><p></p><p>Feeling the terrifying aura of his master, Xu Yan's heart was trembling. The excitement and thrill of entering the martial dao had instantly subsided.</p><p></p><p>"I am too weak!</p><p></p><p>"In the face of my master, I am like an ant. I still have a long way to go!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan felt incredibly insignificant. After just entering the door, what right did he have to be excited? What right did he have to be proud?</p><p></p><p>"It must be that my master saw me being arrogant, so he revealed a bit of his aura to let me know what true strength is.</p><p></p><p>"I must be humble, low-key, and diligently cultivate!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan restrained the aura around him and respectfully approached his master.</p><p></p><p>"Master, your disciple has entered the martial dao!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi had one hand behind his back, slightly trembling, which was from excitement, but his expression remained calm, still like a strict teacher.</p><p></p><p>"Mm."</p><p></p><p>He nodded slightly, revealing a look of contentment as he gazed at his foolish disciple.</p><p></p><p>"Did you see it? This is the aura at the threshold of mastery. Your master is showing you a glimpse."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I will be humble and diligently cultivate!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with an ashamed expression.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi retracted the aura and looked at his disciple, saying contentedly, "I give you one year. That you could enter the threshold so quickly pleases me."</p><p></p><p>He stepped and sat down on the chair under the big tree. Xu Yan hurriedly brewed tea for his master and served him respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"The martial dao is boundless. You have just entered the threshold. You still have a long way to go. Let me ask you, is your heart resolute in the martial dao?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Master, my heart is resolute in the martial dao!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan knelt down with a resounding voice, his heart filled with excitement. "Master, are you truly going to take me as your disciple and teach me the supreme martial arts?"</p><p></p><p>"Good, very good. From today, you are my true disciple!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi looked very pleased.</p><p></p><p>Then, with an seemingly indifferent tone, he said, "My disciple, as you have cultivated arduously, do recall when you refined your skin, bones, and organs."</p><p></p><p>Regarding this demonic disciple, Li Xuanyi was truly curious about how he had managed to cultivate the fabricated techniques successfully.</p><p></p><p>When Xu Yan entered the martial dao, his golden finger appeared, and he directly achieved mastery of the techniques. Naturally, he also had the processes and methods of refining skin, bones, and organs in his mind.</p><p></p><p>These processes and methods of refining skin, bones, and organs were obviously insights that Xu Yan had gained himself. </p><p></p><p>They could not be said to be completely unrelated to the fabricated techniques he had, as they were derived from those. But ultimately, the fabricated techniques were fabricated, while the actual cultivation methods were real.</p><p></p><p>The two were different. The fabricated techniques could be seen as a set of illusory theories, while Xu Yan had realized those illusory theories and turned them into actual cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Only by understanding how Xu Yan had taken the fabricated techniques and derived the real cultivation methods could Li Xuanyi continue to edit the subsequent cultivation methods and martial dao realms.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi felt that even fabricated techniques required a certain theoretical basis, even if it was illusory. The realms had to be connected and clearly tiered. They could not jump from the martial dao realm to the immortal cultivation realm.</p><p></p><p>That would be impossible to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanyi felt that these insights of his were likely conveyed by the golden finger.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan heard this and his heart was filled with excitement. His master was going to guide him, to help him fully comprehend the cultivation process and experience the profundity of the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He began to recount how he had cultivated and how he had comprehended the profound meaning in the master's words.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened quietly, nodding from time to time, but inwardly thinking "Fuck, this disciple is too much of a prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>His comprehension ability was simply extraordinary, and he was also extremely skilled at self-interpretation, turning the master's words into another layer of deeper meaning!</p><p></p><p>"The secret techniques imparted by the master are truly extraordinary and profound. This disciple is dull-witted and took a very long time to comprehend them. If not for the master imparting the techniques to me, I'm afraid I would not have been able to refine the golden bones," Xu Yan sighed emotionally.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was completely dumbfounded: "The cultivation technique I just made up, and he was actually able to comprehend it? Too much of a prodigy! In the future, I'll just make up more cultivation techniques and let this foolish disciple go and comprehend them!"</p><p></p><p>"I had already been satisfied with refining the golden bones, but thanks to the master's guidance, I persisted and was able to refine the jade bones!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, recalling the time when he had refined the golden bones, was quite proud of himself, ready to report the good news to his master, thinking he had now reached the level of the ancient prodigies.</p><p></p><p>If not for the master's hints, encouraging him to refine the jade bones, how could he have become so powerful now?</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Xu Yan had an ashamed expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to be dumbfounded: "When did I ever guide this foolish disciple to refine the jade bones?"</p><p></p><p>Maintaining a calm expression, he spoke, "Disciple, how did you know that I was guiding you?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said embarrassedly, "When I had refined the golden bones and was about to report the good news to the master, the master saw me coming and put down the golden sword, playing with the jade ruyi scepter... I then knew the master was hinting at me, encouraging me to persist in scaling the peak and have the confidence to refine the jade bones.</p><p></p><p>"I almost failed to comprehend the master's hints, which is truly shameful!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze at his disciple had changed somewhat. Originally, he had simply liked the jade ruyi scepter more than the golden sword, feeling that it was more valuable.</p><p></p><p>He never expected such a coincidence would lead the disciple to misunderstand.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, the disciple had engaged in self-interpretation and refined the jade bones.</p><p></p><p>Thinking of this, Li Xuan felt a chill on his scalp. It wasn't that this disciple's brain didn't work well, but rather that it worked too well!</p><p></p><p>"Mm, that you were able to comprehend my hints means your comprehension ability is still acceptable. To have persisted and refined the jade bones, you must have endured some hardships as well," Li Xuan said with a look of contentment.</p><p></p><p>"It is all thanks to the master's guidance that I was able to refine the jade bones. If not for the master instructing me to go to the Evil Aura Forest and hunt the Fire-Maned Wolves, I'm afraid I would not have been able to refine the jade bones," Xu Yan looked at his master with reverence and adoration.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's scalp tingled. Now he understood that whether it was the tiger or the so-called Fire-Maned Wolves, they were all killed by this guy Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It was not a matter of mobilizing the guards or hunters.</p><p></p><p>That fierce tiger must have been formidable, yet Xu Yan actually hunted it down!</p><p></p><p>And what about this Fire-Maned Wolf? What was the story there?</p><p></p><p>"Tell me the process of how you hunted the Fire-Maned Wolf," Li Xuan's expression remained calm, his tone peaceful, as if he wanted to point out the shortcomings in his disciple's wolf hunting.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master!" Xu Yan respectfully responded, and began to recount how he fought and killed the Fire-Maned Wolf, how he consumed the wolf's blood, and then refined the wolf's meat into a powerful tonic to aid his cultivation, which allowed him to quickly complete the refinement of his dantian and enter the martial dao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's face remained calm, but inwardly he was greatly shocked. The Fire-Maned Wolf was so fierce, no longer an ordinary beast.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that Xu Yan had actually fought and killed the Fire-Maned Wolf with his bare hands, and used it to refine the jade bones!</p><p></p><p>From Xu Yan's narration, Li Xuan could feel how perilous that battle had been. If Xu Yan had not been careful, he would have become the prey of the Fire-Maned Wolf.</p><p></p><p>"This foolish disciple is also a prodigy, actually comprehending the method to refine the jade bones and defeating the Fire-Maned Wolf!" Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this disciple was truly too much of a prodigy.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

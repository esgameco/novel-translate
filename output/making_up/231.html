        <h1>Chapter 231</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Huang Meng saw that Wen Yong's expression was off, so he asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"It wasn't me, I was just carried away and threatened her recklessly, but I didn't dare to really kill her. Moreover, her protectors are stronger than me!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong was almost in tears.</p><p></p><p>He was deeply regretful in his heart that he shouldn't have threatened her in a fit of anger back then.</p><p></p><p>Who would have thought that Dai Yingying was actually killed by someone? Now he couldn't explain it clearly.</p><p></p><p>Huang Meng took a deep breath and said, "Could it be that one of the other brothers in the alliance did it? But they should have informed us first!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong cried and said, "It might be the despicable, shameless and cunning Ling Zong or the aristocratic families who framed me."</p><p></p><p>"Little Yong, flee, leave Yuzhou, I'll arrange for you to go to the alliance in another state. When our Wanshi Alliance is officially established, we won't fear the inferior Dai family."</p><p></p><p>Huang Meng said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, I'll flee now!"</p><p></p><p>Wen Yong's face turned pale. Sooner or later, the Dai family would come after him in Zheng State, even in all of Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Dai family were mobilized to track down the murderer, and a generous bounty was offered.</p><p></p><p>The royal family of Zheng State also offered a bounty.</p><p></p><p>At this time, the martial arts world of Zheng State was in an uproar, and countless scattered cultivators were trembling in fear of being implicated.</p><p></p><p>But the real culprit, Xu Yan, had already left the territory of Zheng State.</p><p></p><p>The place with spiritual energy and dragon qi was far from Zheng State, and on his way, Xu Yan was learning about the situation in Zheng State and Yuzhou, and how many Ling Zong and aristocratic families existed there.</p><p></p><p>The gate to the Spirit Realm was in Yuzhou, Zheng State, so if the Changqing Pavilion wanted to move to the Spirit Realm, the landing point must be in Yuzhou, so he needed to understand the situation in advance.</p><p></p><p>The power structure in the Spirit Realm was vastly different from the Inner Realm, with Ling Zong and aristocratic families as the main ruling forces.</p><p></p><p>The royal dynasties were subordinate forces of the Ling Zong and aristocratic families, established and supported by the Ling Zong and aristocratic families to rule a region.</p><p></p><p>In the entire Spirit Realm, the hierarchy was extremely strict, even between the Ling Zong and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>Third-rate Ling Zong must follow the hierarchy and stand behind the second-rate and first-rate Ling Zong, not crossing the line.</p><p></p><p>Of course, if they were sworn enemies in a state of hostility, they would not follow this rule, unless there were stronger Ling Zong or aristocratic families present, in which case they would have to outwardly follow the rules.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou was ruled by the three major Ling Zong, five major aristocratic families, and eighteen medium and small aristocratic families and Ling Zong.</p><p></p><p>There were a total of six royal dynasties.</p><p></p><p>Zheng State was the only one that was not under the rule of the Ling Zong and aristocratic families of Yuzhou, but directly under the command of several transcendent Ling Zong.</p><p></p><p>The task of guarding the gate to the Spirit Realm was a special privilege granted by the transcendent Ling Zong.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect was the number one Ling Zong in Yuzhou, and the only first-rate Ling Zong in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Aside from the Yushen Sect, the other Ling Zong and aristocratic families in Yuzhou did not have the strength and foundation of a first-rate Ling Zong in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were only first-rate Ling Zong and aristocratic families within Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>From Yulong's mouth, Xu Yan gradually learned about Yuzhou and some common knowledge about the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>For example, the Spirit Realm did not have a unified spirit token, the spirit tokens circulating in the martial arts world were all issued by several transcendent Ling Zong, and the spirit tokens of any transcendent Ling Zong could be used in the eighteen states of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>"This Great Zhou spirit token, for example, is the only one issued by the Great Zhou Kingdom, which is the only independent royal dynasty in the Spirit Realm, with strength and foundation comparable to the transcendent Ling Zong."</p><p></p><p>Yulong introduced to Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>It was a bit puzzled in its heart, why did Xu Yan know so little about the basic common knowledge of the Spirit Realm?</p><p></p><p>A novice scattered cultivator?</p><p></p><p>It's just that, why was his strength so powerful? The Great Zhou Kingdom could be independent and not under the rule of the Ling Zong and aristocratic families, and its strength was comparable to the transcendent Ling Zong, which showed that the strength of the Great Zhou royal family was truly extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"The place we are in now is the territory of the number one aristocratic family in Yuzhou, the Mo family."</p><p></p><p>Yulong pointed its head towards a city in front and said.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go to the city and take a look."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan decided to go to the city's shops and see if there were any treasures worth buying.</p><p></p><p>"I'll hide."</p><p></p><p>Yulong coiled around Xu Yan's wrist and was hidden by the sleeve.</p><p></p><p>Qingling City was one of the six major cities of the Mo family, the number one aristocratic family in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>The city walls were embedded like scales, hence the name.</p><p></p><p>Among the first-rate aristocratic families in Yuzhou, the Mo family did not support any royal dynasties to rule a region, but established the Mo family cities to rule their own territory.</p><p></p><p>Since Qingling City was one of the six major cities of the Mo family, it had a peak Great Celestial expert stationed there.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, in the Thunder Cloud Hall in Qingling City, some warriors were holding portraits and issuing a bounty.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever provides information about this person will be rewarded with 100,000 spirit crystals or one Gathering Spirit Pill."</p><p></p><p>The warriors were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>100,000 spirit crystals, or a Gathering Spirit Pill? The Thunder Cloud Hall was a shop set up by several transcendent Ling Zong in Qingling City, and there were a large number of warriors gathering there every day, even scattered cultivators with a little strength and wealth would come to this place.</p><p></p><p>The warriors looked at the portrait, which was of a young man with a sword in his chest, with a handsome and extraordinary bearing.</p><p></p><p>"May I ask, what did this young man do wrong?" </p><p></p><p>A warrior asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>Hearing the way he spoke, it was clear that he was a scattered cultivator.</p><p></p><p>The warrior holding the portrait looked at him indifferently and said coldly, "You shouldn't ask. Don't ask, just provide information and claim the reward."</p><p></p><p>Someone in the crowd spoke up, "If I can capture this person, what is the reward?"</p><p></p><p>The warrior holding the portrait looked at the speaker and smiled, saying, "If you can capture him, the reward is five Gathering Spirit Pills, or something of similar value."</p><p></p><p>The scattered cultivators present were secretly angry, the one who spoke up was not a scattered cultivator, so the attitude was different, truly bullying the weak!</p><p></p><p>But more scattered cultivators were already used to this differential treatment.</p><p></p><p>They even thought this was normal.</p><p></p><p>"Are the Gathering Spirit Pills from the Shen family, or...?"</p><p></p><p>The man continued to ask.</p><p></p><p>The one who spoke up must have a certain status in the Ling Zong and aristocratic families, otherwise he wouldn't know the difference between the Gathering Spirit Pills of the Shen family and other Ling Zong and aristocratic families.</p><p></p><p>In Yuzhou, the Gathering Spirit Pills of the Shen family were ranked first.</p><p></p><p>"They are from the Yushen Sect and the Shu family."</p><p></p><p>The Shu family was one of the five first-rate aristocratic families in Yuzhou.</p><p></p><p>And the Yushen Sect was the number one Ling Zong in Yuzhou, the warriors in the hall were all secretly shocked, what did this young man do to be wanted by these two powers?</p><p></p><p>"Does he have to be captured alive, or is life and death not an issue?"</p><p></p><p>"He must be captured alive. According to the intelligence, his strength is at least at the late stage of the Small Celestial Realm."</p><p></p><p>The warriors coming and going in the Thunder Cloud Hall all knew that the Yushen Sect and the Shu family were offering a bounty to track down a young man.</p><p></p><p>And this young man possessed strength at least at the late stage of the Small Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Such a high-profile bounty on a young man, without giving any specific information, it was clear that this young man must be a scattered cultivator.</p><p></p><p>In a certain manor in Qingling City, some scattered cultivators gathered.</p><p></p><p>"Does anyone know the identity of the person the Yushen Sect and the Shu family are offering a bounty for?"</p><p></p><p>"I don't know, I've never heard of such a talented young scattered cultivator in Yuzhou."</p><p></p><p>"Among us scattered cultivators, if such a genius emerges, how can we allow the Ling Zong and aristocratic families to harm him? We must quickly find his whereabouts without revealing his location."</p><p></p><p>"That's right, this person must be able to become our future..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Our Yuzhou Wanshi Alliance has a talented genius, who is in confrontation with the Lingzong and the prominent families. We must find a way to locate him and recruit him into our Wanshi Alliance."</p><p></p><p>After some discussion among the scattered cultivators, they began to take action and search for the young man's whereabouts.</p><p></p><p>Outside of Qingling City, deep within a mountain, there were several buildings hidden away. Weng Yong's face was pale, he had suffered severe injuries, narrowly escaping death, fleeing from the hands of an elder of the Dai family, and hiding here.</p><p></p><p>"Weng Yong, you must leave this place quickly now, we will try our best to delay the pursuit of the Dai family."</p><p></p><p>A middle-aged man pointed at the map and said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Understood, I shall depart immediately!" </p><p></p><p>Weng Yong nodded, just about to turn and leave, when a figure hurriedly approached.</p><p></p><p>"Hall Master, the Yushen Sect and the Su family are offering a bounty for a talented scattered cultivator genius, our alliance has already arranged people to search for this young man."</p><p></p><p>He placed the portrait on the table.</p><p></p><p>The Hall Master narrowed his eyes and said, "Our scattered cultivator genius?"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, his cultivation is at the late-stage of the Small Celestial Realm or above, this is the information provided by the Yushen Sect and the Su family."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Such a genius must be recruited into our Wanshi Alliance, for we are in need of geniuses."</p><p></p><p>The Hall Master said joyfully.</p><p></p><p>"But Hall Master, the Yushen Sect and the Su family have both put out a bounty for him, and it is said that a Grand Celestial Realm elder has been dispatched."</p><p></p><p>The newcomer said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"The more the Lingzong and prominent families value him, the more it proves he is a true genius. As a scattered cultivator, if he does not join our Wanshi Alliance, how can he ensure his safety and survival?" Quickly find his whereabouts, and if necessary, I will intervene to hold back the Grand Celestial Realm experts of the Yushen Sect or the Su family."</p><p></p><p>The Hall Master said resolutely.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Hall Master!" </p><p></p><p>The newcomer hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong glanced at the portrait of the young man, sighing inwardly that another genius would be joining the alliance.</p><p></p><p>He, Weng Yong, was also a genius among the scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>However, his current situation was rather dangerous, as he had greatly offended the Dai family.</p><p></p><p>If it were just empty threats, the Dai family would only send Small Celestial Realm experts, or at most a Grand Celestial Realm cultivator to pursue him.</p><p></p><p>But Dai Yingying had died, and the Dai family had determined him to be the murderer, even the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm ancestor had come out to personally eliminate him.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong did not know if he could escape from Yuzhou. He was a wanted man by the Refining Spirit Celestial Realm expert! If not for the help of the alliance, he might have already died and not survived until now.</p><p></p><p>But the Wanshi Alliance would not reveal more of its strength before the time was right, so they would not go all-out for him.</p><p></p><p>Weng Yong hurriedly departed, beginning his escape.</p><p></p><p>As for the one being hunted by the Yushen Sect and the Su family, Xu Yan, he was currently unaware of this.</p><p></p><p>He was on his way to Qingling City, preparing to enter the city and take a look.</p><p></p><p>On the way to Qingling City, cultivators were coming and going, when suddenly a cultivator leaving the city was startled, realizing that the young man was the one the Yushen Sect and the Su family had put a bounty on.</p><p></p><p>Overjoyed, he circled around and quietly returned to Qilin City.</p><p></p><p>"The great cities of the Spirit Realm are truly extraordinary," Xu Yan sighed as he looked at Qingling City, worthy of being one of the six premier families' cities.</p><p></p><p>When he first entered the Inner Realm from the Borderlands, he had already felt that the cities of the Inner Realm were prosperous and magnificent, with even a small county town nearly rivaling the capital of a Borderland nation.</p><p></p><p>Now, seeing the great cities of the Spirit Realm, Xu Yan's horizons were further expanded.</p><p></p><p>The massive city gates of Qingling City were guarded by peak Grandmaster cultivators, responsible for collecting entry fees from scattered cultivators.</p><p></p><p>"Grandmasters are everywhere, and even Supremes can be seen casually. A First-Grade Martial Artist is already considered low-tier among cultivators in the Spirit Realm, almost akin to a common person."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed as he observed the cultivators coming and going at the city gates. The gap with the Inner Realm was too great! Grandmasters were already considered powerful experts in the Inner Realm, but here in the Spirit Realm, they were commonplace, just like the Third-Grade and First-Grade Martial Artists of the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was not surprised by this, as the Spirit Realm had more abundant spiritual energy and more active spiritual mechanisms, making cultivation easier. In such a heaven and earth, people's natural talents would be higher.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with the active spiritual mechanisms, the cultivation of the Martial Way was also more effortless.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan was about to enter the city, a man suddenly approached him and said in a low voice, "Young brother, do you still dare to enter the city? Quickly come with me, or it will be too late."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow. "What do you mean, sir?"</p><p></p><p>"You have a bounty on your head, quickly come with me!" the man said urgently.</p><p></p><p>A bounty on his head?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned. Was it because of the incident at the Qingtianjiao Tomb? While following the man, he asked, "Who are you, and why are you telling me about this bounty? Which force has put a bounty on me?"</p><p></p><p>"I am just a scattered cultivator, but I cannot stand how the Lingzong and prominent families are trying to suppress the genius scattered cultivators, so I'm warning you out of goodwill." The man said solemnly, "The ones who have put a bounty on you are the Yushen Sect and the Su family. Young brother should know what you will face if the Lingzong and prominent families are after you, right?"</p><p></p><p>The man continued, "However, I do have a place where I can protect your life!"</p><p></p><p>A cold light flashed in Xu Yan's eyes. "The Yushen Sect and the Su family have put a bounty on me? When I break through, I'll make them regret it!"</p><p></p><p>He thought coldly.</p><p></p><p>"You are just a scattered cultivator, how can you help me escape from the bounty of the Yushen Sect and the Su family?" Xu Yan asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"This is a secret, young brother just needs to come with me to meet someone, and you'll understand," the man said. "Young brother can rest assured, I have no intention of harming you. We scattered cultivators, if we keep harming each other, we will forever be slaves to the Lingzong and prominent families."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother, what's wrong?" the man was startled.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked back and said calmly, "The ones who put the bounty on me are here, you can leave now and not get involved."</p><p></p><p>The man's expression changed, looking up to see two figures rapidly approaching.</p><p></p><p>"Young brother, quickly run!" the man said anxiously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood still and said, "Run? They are just Small Celestial Realm cultivators, I want to see why they have put a bounty on me!"</p><p></p><p>Seeing that he could not persuade Xu Yan, the man hurriedly left.</p><p></p><p>"Come with us," the two Small Celestial Realm cultivators looked down at Xu Yan arrogantly, "the Yushen Sect's envoy and the Su family's envoy."</p><p></p><p>As the executors of the number one sect in Yuzhou, the Yushen Sect, and the top-tier family, the Su family, they were used to their lofty status and arrogance.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the emblems on their clothes, recognizing them as cultivators of the Yushen Sect and the Su family.</p><p></p><p>He sneered coldly, "Are you here to invite me or to command me? If you're here to invite me, then show some respect. If you think you can command me, then prepare to die!"</p><p></p><p>"Insolent!" The Yushen Sect's envoy roared angrily, "A lowly scattered cultivator dares to disregard the rules? You shall be punished accordingly!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression turned cold, and he raised his hand, unleashing a sword strike without any hesitation.</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

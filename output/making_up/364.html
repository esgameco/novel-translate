        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The blood slaves who were attacking Hong Zhou, preparing to sweep through and blood sacrifice the Spirit Realm, suddenly had a drastic change in expression, looking utterly incredulous.</p><p></p><p>How could there be such powerful experts in the Spirit Realm? And what kind of martial arts technique was this, how could it be so terrifying? Meng Chong transformed into a giant, fighting the horde of blood slaves single-handedly with great gusto, throwing punch after punch, slashing with blade after blade, incredibly fierce and completely ignoring the blood slaves' attacks. </p><p></p><p>The Divine Tide Immeasurable technique defended against all attacks, unable to shake him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fought the most blood slaves alone, followed by Fang Hao, who combined the Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Gates with a great formation, fighting blood slaves alone second only to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was both excited and nervous, as she had rarely engaged in combat before and this was her first time fighting such powerful blood slaves. However, now that she had reached the Mystical Power realm, she wanted to personally experience the wonders of mystical powers, so she grew more excited as the battle went on. Apart from appearing inexperienced at first, she became increasingly skilled as the fight progressed.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong, Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had blocked most of the over 100 blood slaves and were locked in fierce battle, several blood slaves still slipped through.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these few blood slaves did not join the battle, but with bloodthirsty light flashing in their eyes, continued charging towards Hong Zhou, intending to blood sacrifice the Spirit Realm and devour its essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad! We're no match for them!"</p><p></p><p>"Will the expert step in?"</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Spirit Realm were shocked by the formidable strength of Xu Yan and the other three, as well as their incredibly powerful martial arts. Seeing the blood slaves continuing to attack, they grew worried.</p><p></p><p>However, they did not panic too much. Although Xu Yan and the others could not spare any effort, there was still the expert present. The expert could eliminate these few blood slaves with just a wave of his hand.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and stepped forward. He wanted to block one blood slave for a life-and-death battle, perhaps allowing him to break through to the Condensed Law realm in the Spirit Realm!</p><p></p><p>Roar! At that moment, a deafening roar sounded out. A majestic striped tiger the size of a small mountain suddenly appeared, landing in front of those few blood slaves. </p><p></p><p>Fierce winds swirled around it, its striped fur billowing like raging flames!</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Beast King!"</p><p></p><p>"The Great Beast King is this powerful?"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Governing Mansion Lord had a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>How long had it been? The Great Beast King's strength had already completely surpassed his own.</p><p></p><p>"Why do I feel like the Great Beast King is that fat cat from Evergreen Pavilion?" Xin Mengrou said with a puzzled look.</p><p></p><p>"That fat cat may very well be the Great Beast King!" Wu Tiannan said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>The others were all shocked - these prodigies of the Spirit Realm were all connected to the expert.</p><p></p><p>The red cat also excitedly made its entrance, transforming to the size of a small mountain, its beastly aura surging. It had finally cultivated a Great Beast Mystical Technique, and its strength was now incomparable to before.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Following that, the red cat stood up on its hind legs, wielding a large blade in one paw. It swung the blade and charged forward, a lone tiger blocking the remaining blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>In front of Hong Zhou, an intense battle raged above the blue sea.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant was like a descending god, incredibly fierce with each punch and slash, forcing those blood slaves to retreat step by step. In just an instant, one blood slave was blasted to pieces on the spot.</p><p></p><p>In another area, a great formation enveloped everything, the Heaven and Earth Extraordinary Gates changing unpredictably. The situation on that battlefield could no longer be seen, but everyone knew Fang Hao must have gained the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's battle did not seem as intense. Green flames spread out as she deployed the Hundred Refinements Divine Furnace, seeming to refine the group of blood slaves as if in a furnace.</p><p></p><p>Star Heavenly Divine Radiance constantly emerged, impossible to defend against. Layer upon layer of illusory shadows made it impossible for the blood slaves to locate Su Lingxiu's true body.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an iron shovel swept out, instantly severing a blood slave's neck.</p><p></p><p>The red cat's battle was similar to Meng Chong's, incredibly fierce as if engaged in close combat. As the Great Beast King, its physical body was already extremely powerful. Moreover, it had also cultivated defensive mystical techniques, so it did not fear the blood slaves' attacks at all.</p><p></p><p>Roar! All of a sudden, the red cat opened its mouth and roared. A blood slave's body shook under the roar, then was sucked into the cat's mouth. Within the giant tiger's maw, there seemed to be flames burning, as if a furnace had been placed inside. The blood slave fell into the furnace and was instantly dissolved.</p><p></p><p>Puff! The red cat spat out a blood-red pearl from its mouth.</p><p></p><p>It looked somewhat confused - how did a pearl appear after killing the blood slave?</p><p></p><p>This pearl seemed to contain pure blood essence, perhaps greatly nourishing for the physical body?</p><p></p><p>The furnace in its mouth was a Great Beast Mystical Technique that could directly incinerate enemies to ashes. This was the first time it had used this mystical technique.</p><p></p><p>The battle here was incredibly intense. All the blood slaves had been blocked and seemed unable to break through the defense of the three humans and one tiger.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, the battle between Xu Yan and Blood Disciple 726 was even more fierce. The roars of true dragons constantly echoed through the clouds, stirring up changes in the wind and clouds.</p><p></p><p>The sword light was extremely sharp, unrivaled in its killing power.</p><p></p><p>But that blade of blood-colored light was even more terrifying. Each slash lit up half the sky blood-red. Even from a great distance, the bloodthirsty, sharp blade light gave people a sense of horror.</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Spirit Realm found it hard to imagine how Xu Yan was able to withstand such terrifying attacks.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the experts also discovered Xu Yan's unusual qualities. The sword light surrounding him was endless and cyclical, not only able to deflect Blood Disciple 726's attacks, but also able to counterattack with the remaining force.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial technique is this?"</p><p></p><p>"Using the enemy's attacks against them, it's unbelievable."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan seems to be retreating step by step, as if he could be defeated at any moment, yet he has always managed to withstand the attacks, all thanks to this wondrous martial technique!"</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm experts had shocked expressions.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Pavilion Master's face was especially bitter. When Xu Yan had challenged them at their gates before, he had already thought him a prodigy. But now he realized Xu Yan's talent far exceeded imagination, almost unbelievable that such a monstrous prodigy could exist in the world.</p><p></p><p>Looking at those spirit body geniuses, although they were all top-tier talents, compared to Xu Yan they weren't even fit to tie his shoes.</p><p></p><p>As expected of the expert's disciple!</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was taken as the expert's disciple. This level of talent truly could not be viewed by normal standards.</p><p></p><p>Blood Disciple 726 was furious and shocked. He had hidden and schemed for such a long time, all waiting for this opportunity to blood sacrifice the Spirit Realm and turn it into a Blood Realm! For the Netherworld Prison to thoroughly infiltrate and plant a nail in this world, creating a weak point to facilitate continued infiltration in the future.</p><p></p><p>He could have used this great merit to be promoted to Blood Son in one step! As a result, although the spirit bridge was cut off and that Heavenly Venerate was killed, he never imagined the Spirit Realm would have such an unusual martial artist.</p><p></p><p>This youth's strength was originally much weaker than his, but relying on that wondrous and strange sword light, he was actually able to deflect most of the power from his attacks, and even counterattack with the remaining force.</p><p></p><p>Whenever he tried to take the opportunity to attack again and destroy this sword light, the opponent's figure would flash and dodge away, avoiding being attacked continuously. </p><p></p><p>And the opponent's movement technique was silent and traceless, instantly changing positions with no trail to follow. Each time he was able to</p><p></p><p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Avoiding his second attack.</p><p></p><p>What angered him even more was that the group of blood slaves had also been blocked.</p><p></p><p>That bald giant was incredibly powerful, with terrifying physical defense. He ignored the attacks of the blood slaves, unleashing powerful punches, sword strikes, and the great sun behind his head, all displaying formidable might. Though numerous, the blood slaves were unable to shake their opponent or break through the blockade to reach the spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>The strength of these blood slaves seemed comparable to Condensed Law Celestial Lords, but their true power was ultimately slightly weaker than a Condensed Law Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>It would take two to three blood slaves to resist one early-stage Condensed Law Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>Besides the bald giant, there was also an area shrouded in a mysterious, ever-changing formation that blocked many blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, though the battle didn't seem as intense, it similarly trapped the blood slaves and even began refining them. Once refined, the blood slaves would reveal their life blood pearls! These pearls were the source of the blood slaves' power, condensed from their essence. They were considered treasures that could aid martial artists in cultivation.</p><p></p><p>In addition, the red cat also shocked the 726th blood disciple. This giant tiger was very unusual and didn't seem like a spirit beast from this world at all!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of tiger is this? Something's not right with the spirit realm!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th blood disciple's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>"We can't drag this out any longer!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th blood disciple knew that if he continued fighting Xu Yan, although he could keep pressuring him, he wouldn't be able to defeat him completely.</p><p></p><p>The only option now was to have the blood slaves attack the spirit realm. After blood sacrificing the spirit realm and enhancing his own strength, he could then defeat the enemy in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>So the 726th blood disciple attacked frantically, forcing Xu Yan to dodge. Then his figure flickered as he moved to kill Meng Chong and rescue the blocked blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>"I'm your opponent!"</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, one golden dragon after another roared and attacked from all directions.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, there were eighteen golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan continuously used his True Dragon Fury technique. The mountain and river phenomena all over his body became increasingly clear.</p><p></p><p>Hum! At the same time, the Sword Mountain and River technique enveloped the area, instantly trapping the 726th blood disciple inside.</p><p></p><p>Black sword light, sharp and destructive, as if wanting to annihilate everything, appeared within the mountains and rivers.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Xu Yan struck out with a palm and a sword.</p><p></p><p>These were techniques from the Divine Technique Martial Classic that Xu Yan had only recently cultivated.</p><p></p><p>In this instant, Xu Yan used almost all his strength, continuously unleashing techniques.</p><p></p><p>The 726th blood disciple's eyes narrowed, with crazy anger surging in his crimson eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You brat, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Terrifying blood color frantically surged out from the 726th blood disciple. Sword light surrounded him, and the blood-colored patterns on his forehead also radiated an evil blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In this moment, terrifying crimson sword light and blood killing intent surged to the sky, seemingly wanting to invade Xu Yan's spirit in an instant.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>In just a moment, the Sword Mountain and River collapsed, the golden dragons collapsed, and a series of attacks all crumbled under the 726th blood disciple's furious counterattack!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression tightened as he moved, instantly disappearing from his original spot.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you hiding!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th blood disciple's crimson eyes flashed with blood light. Vaguely, there seemed to be an aura tightly locked onto Xu Yan's aura, as if sticking to his spirit, making it impossible for Xu Yan to avoid the 726th blood disciple's lock.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan raised an eyebrow, moved again, and once more disappeared from his spot. At the same time, he struck down with the Absolute Heaven Sword again.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The moment Xu Yan struck with the Absolute Heaven Sword, his spirit surged for an instant. In that moment, the 726th blood disciple's aura was instantly purified and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th blood disciple was shocked. He had just used his life blood essence to invade the other's martial power, which should have made it impossible to avoid his aura lock.</p><p></p><p>This wasn't his first time fighting martial artists from this world. Anyone whose martial power was invaded by life blood essence absolutely could not remove the life blood essence in such a short time, especially during battle.</p><p></p><p>This was a method the Netherworld blood disciples used to hunt martial artists of this world.</p><p></p><p>This time, it actually failed! At this moment, the 726th blood disciple's heart tightened as he realized something was unusual about the spirit realm. He couldn't continue to be entangled in battle and had to quickly break through the situation.</p><p></p><p>The 726th blood disciple believed he could no longer quickly defeat Xu Yan, unless he was willing to pay a price and use some of his trump card secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>But he wasn't sure if Xu Yan had already used all his strength and techniques.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, after forcing Xu Yan back again, the 726th blood disciple moved towards where Meng Chong was fighting the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>However, he was blocked by Xu Yan again.</p><p></p><p>The intense battle continued. Although Xu Yan blocked the 726th blood disciple each time, the blood disciple was still getting closer to where Meng Chong was fighting, just at a slower pace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also helpless. The difference in their strength was too great. If not for the mysteriousness of the Yin-Yang Undying Sword, how could he have fought until now?</p><p></p><p>"Second junior brother still hasn't defeated all the blood slaves. Once they get close, it will be dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was heavy.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong's Infinite Divine Waves had unparalleled defense and his physical body was incredibly strong, the difference in strength was ultimately too great. He wouldn't be able to withstand more than a few attacks.</p><p></p><p>"My techniques are strong, but they're mainly for killing. Even the Sword Mountain and River can only trap him for a while, unable to stop him from getting closer to second junior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Although Master was overseeing and there wouldn't be any danger, having Master step in every time would make the disciples seem incompetent, wouldn't it? "I can't disappoint Master. If I can't even block a mere blood disciple, how can I reach 50% of Master's strength at the same level?"</p><p></p><p>The Divine Technique Martial Classic appeared in Xu Yan's mind, with various techniques emerging, especially the few grand techniques.</p><p></p><p>A grand technique appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Great Heaven Plucking Hand!</p><p></p><p>Even heaven and earth could be plucked into one's hand. When this technique was used, it could instantly pluck and grab the enemy! It had both capturing and killing power.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan's eyes focused as he raised his hand and grabbed. In midair, a huge hand instantly descended, grabbing towards the 726th blood disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, this huge hand was too weak, at most condensed from the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, without any power of a divine technique!</p><p></p><p>Puff! The 726th blood disciple laughed coldly. Blood killing intent surged up, instantly shattering the huge hand.</p><p></p><p>He moved, continuing to attack towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath. His sword pointed, and in an instant, waves rose into huge swords, each radiating a chilling sword intent.</p><p></p><p>The huge swords lined up one after another, instantly surrounding and forming a sword formation as their sword intents merged!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

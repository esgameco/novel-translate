        <h1>Chapter 364</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The group of blood slaves who were about to invade Hongzhou and sweep across the Spiritual Realm, sacrificing the Spiritual Realm, suddenly changed their expressions, looking utterly disbelieving.</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm, how could there be such powerful experts? And what kind of martial art is this, why is it so terrifying? Meng Chong transformed into a giant, fighting the group of blood slaves with unrestrained fervor, punching and slashing one after another, his violence boundless, completely disregarding the attacks of the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>The Boundless Divine Tide blocked all the attacks, unable to shake him in the slightest.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong fought the most blood slaves alone, followed by Fang Hao, with the Heaven and Earth Mysterious Doors combined with the grand formation, he fought the blood slaves single-handedly, second only to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was both excited and nervous, after all, she had rarely taken action against enemies before, this was her first time facing such powerful blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>However, since she had already reached the Spiritual Enlightenment realm, she also wanted to personally display the profundity of her spiritual powers, so she became more and more excited as the battle progressed, apart from the initial clumsiness, she became increasingly skilled.</p><p></p><p>Although most of the over a hundred blood slaves were blocked by Meng Chong, Fang Hao, and Su Lingxiu, who were engaged in fierce battles, there were still several blood slaves that slipped through.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, these few blood slaves were not participating in the battle, but their eyes were gleaming with a bloodthirsty light, continuing to kill towards Hongzhou, wanting to sacrifice the Spiritual Realm and devour the essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad! We are no match for them!"</p><p>"Surely the senior experts will intervene?"</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spiritual Realm were shocked by the formidable strength of Xue Yan's group, stunned by the incredibly powerful martial arts, and became worried as they watched the continuing onslaught of the blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>However, they were not too panicked, although Xue Yan's group could not spare a hand, there were still senior experts present.</p><p></p><p>A wave of the senior expert's hand could annihilate these few blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan took a deep breath, gritted his teeth, and stepped forward, wanting to go obstruct one of the blood slaves, to undergo a life-and-death tempering, perhaps he could break through to the Refined Law Realm in the Spiritual Realm! Just then, a thunderous roar resounded, and a majestic and awe-inspiring spotted giant tiger suddenly appeared, descending in front of those few blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>Fierce winds swirled around it, its spotted fur billowing like raging flames!</p><p></p><p>"It's the Great Demon King!"</p><p>"The Great Demon King's strength is this powerful?"</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm Lord was utterly shocked.</p><p></p><p>It had been such a short time, yet the Great Demon King's strength had completely surpassed him.</p><p></p><p>"I feel like the Great Demon King is that fat cat from the Evergreen Pavilion?"</p><p>Xin Mengrou said with a puzzled expression.</p><p></p><p>"That fat cat might just be the Great Demon King!"</p><p>Wu Tiannan said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>The others were all inwardly shaken, these demonic prodigies of the Spiritual Realm were all related to the senior experts.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet cat also excitedly made its appearance, transforming into a mountain-like size, its demonic aura overwhelming. Now it had finally cultivated the Great Demon Spiritual Technique.</p><p>Its strength was vastly different from the past.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Immediately after, the scarlet cat stood upright, holding a giant saber in one paw, and charged towards the remaining blood slaves, a single tiger holding them off.</p><p></p><p>In front of Hongzhou, above the azure sea, the battle was raging fiercely.</p><p>The golden giant, like a divine deity descending, unleashed violent punches and slashes, forcing the blood slaves to retreat step by step, but in the blink of an eye, one blood slave was smashed to pieces.</p><p></p><p>In another area, the grand formation enveloped the area, the Heaven and Earth Mysterious Doors' changes were unfathomable, the battlefield was no longer visible, but it was almost certain that Fang Hao had the upper hand.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's battle did not seem as intense, the azure flames permeated the area, the Hundred Forges Divine Cauldron was in use, the blood slaves were like being refined in the cauldron.</p><p>The Stellar Sky Divine Radiance constantly emerged, unpredictable, the layered illusions made it impossible for the blood slaves to locate Su Lingxiu's true body.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, an iron shovel swept across, instantly severing the neck of a blood slave.</p><p></p><p>The scarlet cat's battle was similar to Meng Chong's, both were overwhelmingly violent, like close-quarters brawling.</p><p>As the Great Demon King, its physical body was already incredibly powerful, and it had also cultivated defensive spiritual techniques, thus it did not fear the attacks of the blood slaves at all.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, the scarlet cat let out a thunderous roar, and a blood slave's body started trembling, then it was sucked into the cat's mouth. Inside the massive tiger jaws, it seemed there was a raging fire, like a cauldron had been placed in its mouth, the blood slave was instantly disintegrated.</p><p></p><p>Poof! The scarlet cat spat out a blood-red pearl.</p><p>It looked puzzled, this blood slave was killed, why did a pearl appear? </p><p>This pearl seemed to contain the essence of blood qi, perhaps it could greatly nourish the physical body?</p><p>Its mouth's cauldron was a powerful Great Demon Spiritual Technique, directly incinerating the enemy to ashes, this was the first time it had unleashed this spiritual technique.</p><p></p><p>On this side, the battle was extremely fierce, all the blood slaves had been obstructed, and it seemed they could not break through the blockade of the three experts and one tiger.</p><p></p><p>On the other side, Xue Yan and the 726th Blood Disciple's battle was even more intense, the roar of the True Dragon constantly resounded through the heavens, stirring up the changing winds and clouds.</p><p>The sword lights were extremely sharp and ruthless.</p><p>But that blood-colored saber light was even more terrifying, every slash it unleashed dyed half the sky blood-red, the bloodthirsty and ruthless saber qi, even from the distant location, gave people a sense of dread.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts of the Spiritual Realm found it hard to imagine how Xue Yan could withstand such a terrifying attack.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, the experts also noticed Xue Yan's unusual aspects, the surrounding sword lights, endlessly cycling, not only could they neutralize the 726th Blood Disciple's attacks, but they could also reflect the remaining attacks back.</p><p></p><p>"What kind of martial art is this?"</p><p>"Using the enemy's own attacks against them, unbelievable."</p><p>"Xue Yan seems to be retreating step by step, as if he will be defeated at any moment, yet he has been holding out, relying on this wondrous martial art!"</p><p></p><p>The experts of the Spiritual Realm were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Palace Master of the Thousand Martial Hall was full of bitterness, when Xue Yan had blocked the mountain gate to challenge them, he had already felt that Xue Yan was demonic, but now he realized that Xue Yan's demonic nature far exceeded his imagination, it was simply unbelievable that such a demonic prodigy existed in this world.</p><p>Compared to Xue Yan, those spiritual body geniuses, although they were all top-tier geniuses, were not even worthy of being his shoes.</p><p></p><p>No wonder he was accepted as a disciple by the senior expert, this level of demonic nature could not be judged by ordinary standards.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple was furious and shocked, he had been planning and scheming for such a long time, just waiting for this opportunity to sacrifice the Spiritual Realm and turn it into a Blood Realm! The Underworld had completely infiltrated here, establishing a foothold in this world, creating a weak point for future continuous infiltration.</p><p>He could also, with this great merit, be promoted to a Blood Son!</p><p>But the Divine Bridge was severed, and that Celestial Venerable was also killed, he never expected the Spiritual Realm to have such extraordinary experts.</p><p>This person's strength was originally weaker than his by a large margin, yet relying on that wondrous and mysterious sword light, he could neutralize most of his attacks, and even reflect the remaining attacks back.</p><p>Whenever he tried to seize the opportunity to strike again and break through that sword light, the opponent's figure would flash and evade, avoiding his continuous attacks.</p><p>And the opponent's movements were silent and invisible, switching positions in an instant, leaving no trace to be found, each time managing to avoid...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Evade his second attack.</p><p></p><p>What angered him even more was that a group of blood slaves had also been blocked.</p><p></p><p>The bald giant, extremely powerful, with a terrifying physical defense, actually ignored the attacks of the group of blood slaves, with one punch, one knife, and the great sun at the back of his head, all displaying formidable power.</p><p></p><p>Although the blood slaves were numerous, they were unable to shake the opponent, nor could they break through the blockade and rush to the spirit domain.</p><p></p><p>The strength of these blood slaves, although it seemed to be comparable to that of the Condensing Law Supremes, was ultimately a little weaker than that of the Condensing Law Supremes.</p><p></p><p>It would take two to three blood slaves to resist a Condensing Law Supreme in the early stage.</p><p></p><p>In addition to the bald giant, the area that was shrouded in a mysterious and changeable manner also blocked many blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>On the other hand, although the battle did not seem so fierce, it similarly trapped the blood slaves, and even began to refine them. Once the blood slaves were refined, their innate blood pearls would be revealed! These blood pearls are the source of the blood slaves' power, and are refined from the blood slaves themselves, and can be considered a treasure that is beneficial to the cultivation of martial artists.</p><p></p><p>In addition to this, what also shocked the 726th Blood Disciple was the Crimson Cat, this huge tiger was very abnormal, and it did not look like a spiritual beast of this world at all!</p><p></p><p>"What kind of tiger is this? Something is wrong with the spirit domain!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's heart sank.</p><p></p><p>"We can't drag this on any longer!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple knew that if he continued to fight with Xu Yan, although he could always suppress the other party, he would not be able to defeat him.</p><p></p><p>The only solution now is to let the blood slaves kill their way into the spirit domain, and after sacrificing the spirit domain, strengthen their own strength, and then defeat the enemy in one fell swoop.</p><p></p><p>So the 726th Blood Disciple frantically attacked, forcing Xu Yan to dodge, and then his figure flickered as he was about to rush towards Meng Chong to rescue the blocked blood slaves.</p><p></p><p>"Your opponent is me!"</p><p></p><p>Roar! Suddenly, one golden dragon after another came rushing from all directions.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, there were eighteen golden dragons.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan's True Dragon Angry Divine Ability was continuously displayed, and the extraordinary scenes on his body became more and more distinct.</p><p></p><p>Hum! At the same time, the Sword Containing the River Divine Ability covered the 726th Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>The black sword light, sharp and deadly, as if wanting to annihilate everything.</p><p></p><p>Emerging from the rivers and mountains.</p><p></p><p>In addition, Xu Yan also unleashed a palm strike and a sword strike.</p><p></p><p>This is a divine ability from the Divine Martial Classic, which Xu Yan has recently cultivated.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan almost exhausted all his strength, unleashing divine abilities one after another.</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's eyes narrowed, and the ferocious red in his eyes was surging.</p><p></p><p>"Bastard, you deserve to die!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! Terrifying blood color erupted from the 726th Blood Disciple, with knife light surrounding him, and the blood-colored patterns on his brow also emitting a sinister blood-colored light.</p><p></p><p>Boom! In that instant, the terrifying crimson knife light, the blood-killing aura, bloomed in all directions, seemingly wanting to invade Xu Yan's divine core.</p><p></p><p>Rumble!</p><p></p><p>In just an instant, the Sword Containing the River collapsed, the golden dragons collapsed, and a series of attacks were all shattered by the 726th Blood Disciple's furious strike.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's expression tightened, his figure moved, and he disappeared from the original spot in an instant.</p><p></p><p>"Where are you hiding!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's crimson eyes flashed with blood light, and vaguely, there seemed to be a breath tightly locked onto Xu Yan's breath, as if it was attached to his divine core.</p><p></p><p>This made it impossible for Xu Yan to avoid the 726th Blood Disciple's lock.</p><p></p><p>"Hmm?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's brow raised, his figure moved again, and he disappeared from the spot again, and at the same time, the Peerless Heavenly Sword struck down.</p><p></p><p>Hum! At the moment Xu Yan's Peerless Heavenly Sword struck down, his divine core surged for an instant, and in an instant, the 726th Blood Disciple's breath was instantly purified and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"How is this possible!"</p><p></p><p>The 726th Blood Disciple's expression was shocked. Just now, he had used his innate blood essence to invade the other party's martial dao power, and it was absolutely impossible for the other party to avoid his breath lock in such a short time, especially in the midst of the battle.</p><p></p><p>This is the method used by the Infernal Blood Disciples to hunt the martial artists of this world.</p><p></p><p>But this time, it failed! At this moment, the 726th Blood Disciple's heart tightened, realizing that there was something unusual about the spirit domain, and he could not continue to fight.</p><p></p><p>To quickly defeat and crush Xu Yan, the 726th Blood Disciple felt that he could no longer do it, unless he was willing to pay a certain price and unleash some of his secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>But he couldn't tell if Xu Yan had already exhausted all his secret techniques.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the 726th Blood Disciple retreated from Xu Yan again and headed towards the battlefield where Meng Chong and the group of blood slaves were fighting.</p><p></p><p>But he was blocked by Xu Yan again.</p><p></p><p>The fierce battle continued, and although Xu Yan blocked the 726th Blood Disciple every time, the 726th Blood Disciple was still approaching the battlefield where Meng Chong was fighting, only at a slower pace.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was also helpless, the difference in strength was too great, if not for the miraculous Yin-Yang Indestructible Sword, how could he have fought to this point?</p><p></p><p>"My second senior brother has not yet completely defeated the blood slaves, if they are approached, it may be a bit dangerous!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's heart was heavy.</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong's Surging Infinite Divine Tide had peerless defense and a powerful physique, the difference in strength was too great, and he would not be able to withstand a few attacks.</p><p></p><p>"My divine abilities are strong, but they are mainly for killing, and the Sword Containing the River can only trap the opponent for a while, and cannot prevent him from approaching my second senior brother!"</p><p></p><p>Although the master is sitting in command, and there will be no danger, but every time the master has to step in, wouldn't it make the disciple look incompetent?</p><p></p><p>"I can't let the master down, if I can't even block a mere blood disciple, how can I reach half the strength of the master at the same boundary?"</p><p></p><p>In Xu Yan's mind, the divine abilities of the Divine Martial Classic appeared, especially the few great divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>One great divine ability appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>The Great Plucking Heavenly Hand! Being able to pluck the heavens and the earth in one's hand, this divine ability, once unleashed, can instantly grab the enemy, possessing both the power of capture and killing.</p><p></p><p>Boom! Xu Yan's eyes narrowed, and he raised his hand, and in mid-air, a huge palm descended, grabbing towards the 726th Blood Disciple.</p><p></p><p>However, this huge palm was too weak, at most it was just the condensation of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, and did not possess the power of a divine ability! Pu! The 726th Blood Disciple sneered coldly, the blood-killing aura surged, and in an instant, the huge palm was shattered.</p><p></p><p>His figure moved, continuing to rush towards Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took a deep breath, pointed his sword, and in an instant, the waves rose up in a frenzy, turning into a series of giant swords, each emitting a sharp sword intent.</p><p></p><p>Giant sword after giant sword was arranged in formation, and in an instant, the giant swords surrounded him, the sword intent intertwined, forming a sword formation!

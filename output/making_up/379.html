        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao revealed the wonders of his array techniques, which was naturally done with purpose.</p><p></p><p>The further one progresses in cultivation, the more resources are needed, especially for the unique martial arts he practiced. Whether upgrading the Qimen weapon box, refining artifacts, or cultivating arrays, all required consuming vast resources. </p><p></p><p>In the early stages, he relied entirely on his senior and second senior brothers to provide resources. Now that he had his own strength, it was time for him to earn resources for cultivation himself.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm lacked arrays for guarding the Heavenly Pit and defending against external enemies, where the marvels of arrays would be fully displayed.</p><p></p><p>This way, he could obtain an endless supply of cultivation resources to continuously research artifact refining and arrays, without worrying about resource consumption.</p><p></p><p>With such vast resources, and constant research into various artifact refining and array techniques, the speed of power increase and array improvement would enter a rapid growth phase.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of Qimen martial arts, involving artifact refining, arrays and other aspects, consumed far more resources than pure martial arts or physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded silently. After the experiences with the Eternal Alliance, Fang Hao had also become more sophisticated, knowing how to seize opportunities and pave the way for future cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Even if array techniques were spread, it would not necessarily be a bad thing. </p><p></p><p>He would ultimately be the one to benefit.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong both had their own paths and knew how to pave the way for their own cultivation. They would both leave soon to venture into the Qinghua Realm and Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether pure martial arts or physical martial arts, one could better comprehend the true essence of martial arts through tempering, battle, and traversing the world.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan had rapidly advanced his martial arts by traveling throughout the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, he would surely take this path as well, which was also the correct path.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's cultivation relied entirely on resource provision, allowing him to freely display the mysteries of Qimen martial arts and research Qimen techniques, arrays, artifact refining, restrictions and so on.</p><p></p><p>In the Spirit Realm, the Eternal Alliance provided vast resources, which was why Fang Hao could advance so rapidly.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was the same, though she focused on alchemy and healing.</p><p></p><p>"Being an Imperial Advisor is not impossible, but I have a few conditions..." Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Please speak, young friend!" The Great Yue Emperor said joyfully in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"The conditions are quite simple. The way of arrays ultimately requires consuming quite a few materials..." </p><p></p><p>Fang Hao listed out his conditions one by one.</p><p></p><p>Finally he added: "I alone naturally cannot travel to all corners to set up arrays for various major cities. However, I can teach those with talent in arrays how to set them up, and even how to refine array instruments."</p><p></p><p>Qimen martial arts covered a broad scope, with arrays and artifact refining being just one aspect. Fang Hao also had the intention of spreading array and artifact refining knowledge.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when his strength was great enough, establishing a sect would not be out of the question.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was still too far off.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, the Great Yue Emperor became extremely excited and nodded: "Good, everything will be according to Brother Fang's wishes. I will establish an Array Academy in Great Yue, with Brother Fang in full charge.</p><p></p><p>"No one in all of Great Yue may disobey Brother Fang's will. The resources of Great Yue will be at Brother Fang's disposal for setting up arrays!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao revealed a smile and said: "Good, it's a deal!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took out several bottles and said with a beaming smile: "Great Yue Emperor, I have some medicinal pills here. Would you like to see their effects?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor's heart stirred. The disciple of a great expert was naturally extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>He took the medicinal pills and looked. With his strength, he could naturally see their miraculous effects. What shocked him even more was that these pills seemed to use only ordinary spirit herbs, not divine herbs.</p><p></p><p>If divine herbs were used in refining, how much more miraculous would the effects be?</p><p></p><p>"What are Miss Su's conditions?" The Great Yue Emperor naturally realized the value of these medicinal pills. With enough of them, cultivators' speed of cultivation, breakthrough of bottlenecks, recovery from injuries, and replenishment during battle would all be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"Similar conditions to my junior brother!" Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The Great Yue Emperor agreed immediately.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was anxiously sweating, but could not interject. After all, he was only a True King Celestial Lord, while the Great Yue Emperor was one of the three supreme experts of the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had just formed a partnership with Great Yue, but what about the Myriad Thunder Sect?</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Thunder Sect needed them too.</p><p></p><p>He could only secretly decide to find Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu privately to discuss terms after the Great Yue Emperor left.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had not actually considered the Myriad Thunder Sect. The reason was that the Myriad Thunder Sect was a martial arts sect, while the Great Yue Nation was not a sect. There were ultimately differences between the two.</p><p></p><p>Great Yue could be more free and better able to utilize their talents.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the Myriad Thunder Sect or Heavenly Martial Gate had any needs, the two of them could provide assistance as long as the price was right.</p><p></p><p>They were not bound exclusively to the Great Yue Nation.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, how long they would stay in the Qinghua Realm was still unknown. They would eventually leave one day, and with the Divine Realm being so vast, they both wanted to travel and see more of it.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor looked at Xu Yan and Meng Chong with great anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me. My martial path is different. I, Xu Yan, intend to travel the lands of the Divine Realm, to meet the geniuses and experts of this Divine Realm." Xu Yan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>"Me too!" Meng Chong said, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was somewhat disappointed.</p><p></p><p>Next, without Xu Yan and the others needing to act, the Great Yue Emperor ordered the True Kings to plunder the resources of the Heavenly Pit, including things like Blood Cloud Gold, and deliver it all to the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>These were the spoils of war!</p><p></p><p>After exploring the Heavenly Pit, the flying ship departed. The Great Yue Emperor arranged for people to guard the Heavenly Pit and prevent invasion by enemies from the Netherworld.</p><p></p><p>Then they returned to the capital of Great Yue to deal with the turmoil in Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>The experts guarding Great Yue's Heavenly Pit finally had use for their abilities. They were dispatched to clear out rebels, blood disciples and blood slaves within Great Yue's borders, and suppress unrest at other Heavenly Pits.</p><p></p><p>Some experts were even sent to support the Myriad Thunder Sect and Heavenly Martial Gate.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan and the others were arranged to stay in a separate courtyard of the Great Yue Imperial Palace. The Great Yue Emperor apologized to the great expert and then busied himself with state affairs.</p><p></p><p>In the courtyard, Cheng Zhan was negotiating terms.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had also given their promises. Cheng Zhan was helpless - it was impossible to invite them to the Myriad Thunder Sect now.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still room for cooperation.</p><p></p><p>The turmoil of the Heavenly Pits was now entering the pacification stage. It was time to make arrangements for the lower sect geniuses who had come from the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Controlling Manor group would belong to the Great Yue Dynasty. True Kings had already come to make arrangements.</p><p></p><p>Out of respect for the great expert, their treatment was improved and they no longer had to worry about being used as cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Realm experts breathed a sigh of relief. Although they could no longer stay by the great expert's side, they had benefited from his influence with preferential treatment and would not become cannon fodder. That was enough.</p><p></p><p>Next was to cultivate diligently and strive for early breakthrough to Condensed Law Celestial Lord, then True King Celestial Lord, and even aim for Immortal Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>They had heard that among the Immortal Celestial Lords of Great Yue, one was formerly a spirit body genius from the Spirit Controlling Manor of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The cultivators who came from the Spirit Controlling Manor were all placed under his command.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan took the Thunder Cloud Manor group and Thousand Martial Palace group away. Those belonging to the Myriad Thunder Sect were sent there.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Those belonging to Tianwu Gate were escorted to Tianwu Gate.</p><p></p><p>As for Fu Tianhai, Emperor Dazhou, Xin Mengrou and others, their affiliated upper sects were not in Qinghua Realm, so they could only wait for people from their respective upper sects to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Emperor Dayue had already arranged for people to send messages to their respective upper sects, but it would take some time before anyone would come.</p><p></p><p>According to Cheng Zhan, for the subordinate sects outside of Qinghua Realm, Dayue Nation was responsible for sending messages. Most of their affiliated upper sects would come to Qinghua Realm during the time the divine bridge was open.</p><p></p><p>Originally, Spirit Barrier City had personnel dispatched from their respective sects, but Spirit Barrier City had been destroyed, leaving only Dayue Nation responsible for sending messages.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou, Fu Tianhai, Emperor Dazhou and others could only temporarily stay in Dayue's capital city, waiting for people from their respective upper sects to arrive.</p><p></p><p>Because the Dayue Heavenly Cave had been cleared out, Dayue Nation was able to free up more powerful experts to clean up within Dayue's borders, killing the invading blood disciples, blood slaves and rebels.</p><p></p><p>Some Immortal Venerable Lords took this opportunity to go clear out the heavenly caves in various places.</p><p></p><p>The great battle between Wanlei Sect and Tianwu Gate was also coming to an end with the support of Dayue Nation's experts. Both the Wanlei Sect Master and Tianwu Sect Master were greatly shocked - had a powerful expert descended upon Qinghua Realm? Like Emperor Dayue, they suspected that the appearance of this powerful expert was aimed at disrupting the Netherworld Prison's schemes.</p><p></p><p>In Dayue's capital city, two adjacent martial arts academies sprang up - the Qimen Academy and the Medicine Academy. Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had already moved in.</p><p></p><p>Accompanying Su Lingxiu were Yuer, Meng Shushu, Zhou Ying, as well as Du Yuying, Yun Miaomiao and others, responsible for helping handle affairs at the Medicine Academy.</p><p></p><p>In the Qimen Academy, Yue Changming was still following Fang Hao, and Emperor Dayue had also dispatched personnel to assist.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu began treating the injuries of Dayue Nation's martial artists. For ordinary injuries, medicine was sufficient, but for injuries that affected one's foundation, Su Lingxiu would personally treat them.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the treatments were not free.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in the Divine Realm, everything began to get on the right track as they each started on their own paths of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong did not go out to make a name for themselves for the time being, but instead focused on consolidating their own abilities, comprehending their divine abilities, and cultivating the divine abilities from the Divine Ability Martial Classics.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also seizing the time to cultivate desperately.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan drew a portrait - it was of his martial arts guide, the person he had been searching for all his life.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had arrived in the Divine Realm, he naturally wanted to continue searching for his guide.</p><p></p><p>Relying on his connections as a disciple of the powerful expert, Wu Tiannan sought out powerful figures in Dayue to inquire for information.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no news at all.</p><p></p><p>Neither Emperor Dayue, nor any Immortal Venerable Lord, not even those powerful experts who had come from the Spirit Realm, had ever seen the person in his portrait.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Wu Tiannan was not discouraged. The Divine Realm was so vast, and Qinghua Realm was just one part of it.</p><p></p><p>There would eventually come a day when he would find a clue.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I have clarified my path of martial arts. I feel I have found the suitable martial arts path I should take, but this junior feels his strength is insufficient to travel the Divine Realm in search of someone.</p><p></p><p>"Would it be possible for this junior to also cultivate divine abilities?" Wu Tiannan asked, prostrating himself on the ground.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze fell upon him. After pondering briefly, he said, "Whether you can cultivate divine abilities depends on yourself. If you wish to learn, there is no issue with me passing on a few divine abilities to you."</p><p></p><p>He did not object to passing on divine abilities to those who cultivated the Taicang martial arts. After all, if Taicang martial arts could also cultivate divine abilities, he would ultimately benefit from it.</p><p></p><p>It might even assimilate Taicang martial arts, causing Taicang martial arts to be tinged with traces of his own martial arts.</p><p></p><p>The more widely martial arts spread, the more he, as the Martial Ancestor, would benefit.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Wu Tiannan said excitedly, bowing respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"I'll pass on a few divine abilities to you then."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought for a moment, then transmitted to Wu Tiannan the minor divine abilities that Xu Yan had already comprehended, as well as two divine abilities that had not yet been comprehended but were suitable for Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and directly transmitted the methods of the divine abilities into Wu Tiannan's soul.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's spirits lifted. He suddenly felt marvelous methods of divine abilities appear in his soul consciousness. Just by carefully pondering them, he felt they were extraordinarily profound, with a sense of being difficult to comprehend.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng saw this and immediately perked up. The martial arts he cultivated were neither Dahuang martial arts nor pure Taicang martial arts, but the general path of his martial arts still followed Taicang martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Your Eminence, I also wish to comprehend divine abilities!" Xie Tianheng said respectfully, bowing.</p><p></p><p>As Li Xuan's sword disciple, his relationship was closer than Wu Tiannan's.</p><p></p><p>"Very well!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan transmitted several divine abilities to Xie Tianheng, including sword divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou was somewhat tempted, but she was ultimately too shy and their relationship was not close enough for her to ask for divine ability methods.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao's eyes lit up. They had always longed for divine ability methods, and now was their chance.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, this junior also wishes to learn divine abilities!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright then!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. These two girls were practically his disciples' future wives, so naturally there was no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and transmitted several divine abilities to the two women, then without waiting for Zi Yun to speak, also transmitted some to her.</p><p></p><p>He also transmitted some to Yuer and Yue Changming while he was at it.</p><p></p><p>"As for the methods of divine abilities, if you comprehend them or feel someone is suitable to pass them on to, then do so. They are not martial arts secrets," Li Xuan said finally.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrou felt relieved. She would also be able to obtain divine ability methods from Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao.</p><p></p><p>"Having passed on so many divine abilities, how many will be able to comprehend them? If Taicang martial arts finds a way to cultivate divine abilities, the strength of Taicang martial arts will see a not insignificant increase," Li Xuan pondered to himself.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun had received the divine ability methods but frowned, unable to comprehend them no matter what. Her eyes flickered and she went over to Meng Chong's side, taking his hand and asking him to explain the divine ability methods to her.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a helpless expression.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao's eyes lit up and they immediately went to find Xu Yan, but Yuer had already gone to find him first.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Yan could only explain the divine abilities to everyone. He couldn't trouble his master with such things, could he? </p><p></p><p>As the senior disciple, these responsibilities fell to him.</p><p></p><p>And so, Wu Tiannan, Xie Tianheng and the others all listened to Xu Yan explain the divine abilities. Xu Yan even pointed out to them the direction for Taicang martial arts to cultivate divine abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan silently listened for a while, then nodded approvingly. "As expected of the pioneer of my martial arts. He also has quite a good understanding of Taicang martial arts. His comprehension of martial arts surpasses everyone else.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has the best chance of truly forging his own path of martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's martial arts lay in their purity. This purity was multifaceted, not singular. There was truly a sense that all martial arts were in his heart, following his heart's desires.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan was not yet able to have martial arts in his heart and follow his heart's desires, but he had already laid the foundation and outline.</p><p></p><p>This had also laid a solid foundation for Xu Yan to forge his own path of martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to seeing what gains he would have after Xu Yan forged his own path of martial arts!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

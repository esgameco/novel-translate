        <h1>Chapter 379</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>At this time, Fang Hao revealed the wondrous uses of the formation technique, naturally with a purpose.</p><p></p><p>As cultivation progressed, the resources required became more and more, especially for his cultivation of the Qimen Martial Dao. Whether it was the upgrade of the Qimen Armory, the cultivation of forging or formations, it all required the consumption of massive resources.</p><p></p><p>In the early stage, he fully relied on the resources provided by the senior brother and second senior brother. Now that he had the strength, he should earn the resources for his own cultivation.</p><p></p><p>The Divine Realm lacked formations to guard the Heavenly Abyss and defend against external enemies. The wondrous uses of formations were undoubtedly displayed.</p><p></p><p>In this way, he could obtain a continuous stream of cultivation resources, constantly research forging and formations, without worrying about the issue of resource consumption.</p><p></p><p>With such a huge amount of resources, as well as the continuous research into various forging and formations, the speed of strength improvement, the advancement of formations, would all enter a rapid upward phase.</p><p></p><p>The cultivation of the Qimen Martial Dao, due to its involvement in forging, formations, and the like, consumed far more resources than pure martial arts or physical martial arts.</p><p></p><p>Now, this was an opportunity.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuanmo nodded silently. After the tempering of the Myriad Worlds Alliance, Fang Hao had also become more experienced, knowing how to seize the opportunity and pave the way for the upcoming cultivation.</p><p></p><p>As for the Dao of formations, even if it was spread out, it would not be a bad thing. The ultimate beneficiary would be him.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong both had their own paths, knowing how to pave the way for their own cultivation. In the future, the two of them would leave and venture into the Azure Flower Realm and the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the pure martial arts or the physical martial arts, in the process of tempering, in battles, in traversing the heavens and earth, one could better comprehend the true essence of the Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>Just as Xu Yan had made rapid progress in the Spiritual Realm by traveling in all directions.</p><p></p><p>In the Divine Realm, he would surely walk this path, and this was the correct path.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's cultivation relied entirely on the provision of resources, so he could fully display the profundity of the Qimen Martial Dao and delve into formations, forging, and restrictions.</p><p></p><p>In the Spiritual Realm, with the Myriad Worlds Alliance providing abundant resources, Fang Hao was able to improve so quickly.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was the same, but she specialized in alchemy and healing.</p><p></p><p>"Becoming a national teacher is not impossible, but I have a few conditions..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Little brother, please state them!" The Great Yue Emperor was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"The conditions are quite simple. The Dao of formations ultimately requires the consumption of a lot of materials..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao stated his conditions one by one.</p><p></p><p>Finally, he said, "I alone cannot travel in all directions to set up formations for the various cities. However, I can teach those with the talent for formations how to deploy formations and even how to forge formation tools."</p><p></p><p>The Qimen Martial Dao involved a wide range of aspects, and formations and forging were just one of them. Fang Hao also had the idea of spreading formations and forging.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps when his strength was strong enough, he could even establish his own sect.</p><p></p><p>Of course, that was too far in the future.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor heard this and became extremely excited, nodding and saying, "Good, everything will be done according to Brother Fang's wishes. I will establish a Formation Academy in the Great Yue, and Brother Fang will be in charge of it all.</p><p></p><p>"In the entire Great Yue, no one is allowed to go against Brother Fang's will. The resources of the Great Yue will be devoted to Brother Fang for the deployment of formations!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao revealed a smile and said, "Good, it's a deal!"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu took out a few bottles and said with a smile, "Great Yue Emperor, I have some medicinal pills here. Would you like to see their effects?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was moved. The disciple of a high-level expert was naturally extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" He took the medicinal pills and, with his strength, naturally saw the extraordinary effects of the pills. What surprised him even more was that these pills seemed to be made from ordinary spiritual herbs, not divine herbs. If divine herbs were used, what kind of miraculous effects would they have? "What are the conditions of Miss Su?"</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor naturally realized the value of these medicinal pills. Once there were enough of them, the cultivation speed, breakthrough of bottlenecks, recovery of injuries, and restoration of consumption in battles for martial artists would all be greatly enhanced.</p><p></p><p>"About the same as my senior brother's conditions!" Su Lingxiu said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Good!" The Great Yue Emperor agreed without hesitation.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan was sweating anxiously, but he couldn't interject, after all, he was just the True King Celestial, while the Great Yue Emperor was from the Azure Flower Realm, one of the three supreme powers.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had already cooperated with the Great Yue, so what about the Myriad Thunder Sect? The Myriad Thunder Sect needed it too.</p><p></p><p>He could only secretly decide that after the Great Yue Emperor left, he would privately find Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu to discuss the conditions.</p><p></p><p>In fact, Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu did not consider the Myriad Thunder Sect. The reason was that the Myriad Thunder Sect was a martial arts sect, while the Great Yue was not a sect, so there was a difference between the two.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue could be more free and better display their strengths.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, if the Myriad Thunder Sect or the Heavenly Martial Gate had any needs, the two of them could also provide assistance, as long as the price was right.</p><p></p><p>The two of them were not bound to the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>And how long they would stay in the Azure Flower Realm was also an unknown. Ultimately, they would leave one day, as the Divine Realm was so vast, and they both wanted to travel and see more.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor looked at Xu Yan and Meng Chong with great anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"Don't look at me, my martial dao is different. I, Xu Yan, am going to roam the Divine Realm, meet the geniuses of the Divine Realm, and meet the strong experts of the Divine Realm."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>"Me too!" Meng Chong said, rubbing his bald head.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Emperor was a bit disappointed.</p><p></p><p>After that, without Xu Yan and Meng Chong taking action, the Great Yue Emperor ordered a group of True Kings to plunder the resources of the Heavenly Abyss, including the Blood Cloud Gold and the like, and have them all sent to the flying ship.</p><p></p><p>This was the spoils of war! After exploring the Heavenly Abyss, the flying ship left the Heavenly Abyss, and the Great Yue Emperor arranged for people to guard the Heavenly Abyss to prevent the invasion of the Underworld Enemies.</p><p></p><p>Then, they returned to the Great Yue capital to deal with the chaos in the Great Yue.</p><p></p><p>The strong experts guarding the Great Yue Heavenly Abyss finally had a place to display their might, being dispatched to eliminate the rebels and blood slaves, and suppress the remaining Heavenly Abyss turmoil.</p><p></p><p>They even dispatched some strong experts to support the Myriad Thunder Sect and the Heavenly Martial Gate.</p><p></p><p>In the palace villa of the Great Yue Emperor, Li Xuan and the others were arranged to stay. The Great Yue Emperor apologized to the high-level experts and then hurried to deal with court affairs.</p><p></p><p>In the villa, Cheng Zhan was making conditions.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu had also made their promises, and Cheng Zhan was helpless. He wanted to invite them to the Myriad Thunder Sect, but that was impossible now.</p><p></p><p>However, there was still room for cooperation.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly Abyss turmoil had entered the pacification stage, and the geniuses from the Spiritual Realm should have been arranged as well.</p><p></p><p>The people of the Spiritual Emblem Mansion now belonged to the Great Yue Dynasty, and True Kings had already come to arrange them.</p><p></p><p>Out of respect for the high-level experts, their treatment was improved, and they no longer had to worry about becoming cannon fodder.</p><p></p><p>The strong experts from the Spiritual Realm heaved a sigh of relief. Although they could no longer follow the high-level experts, by associating with them, they received generous treatment and would not become cannon fodder, which was enough.</p><p></p><p>Next, they would focus on cultivation, striving to break through to the Refined Law Celestial, the True King Celestial, and even the Immortal Celestial.</p><p></p><p>They had heard that among the Immortal Celestials of the Great Yue, one of them was once a spirit body genius from the Spiritual Emblem Mansion.</p><p></p><p>And the martial artists from the Spiritual Emblem Mansion were all under his command.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan led the people of the Thunder Cloud Mountain Villa and the Thousand Martial Hall to leave, and those who belonged to the Myriad Thunder Sect were sent to the Myriad Thunder Sect.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The ones belonging to the Tian Wu Gate were escorted to the Tian Wu Gate.</p><p></p><p>As for Fu Tianhai, Da Zhou Huang, Xin Mengrong, and the others, their respective upper sects were not in the Qinghua Realm, so they could only wait for people from their own sects to come.</p><p></p><p>Da Yue Emperor had already arranged for people to convey the message to the upper sects of each of them, but it would take some time before someone came.</p><p></p><p>According to what Cheng Zhan said, the sects under the spiritual domains outside the Qinghua Realm were all under the responsibility of the Da Yue Kingdom to convey the message, and the upper sects of each of them would mostly come to the Qinghua Realm when the divine bridge opened.</p><p></p><p>Originally, there were people dispatched from the respective sects in the Spirit Pass City, but the Spirit Pass City had all been destroyed, so only the Da Yue Kingdom was left to convey the message.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrong, Fu Tianhai, Da Zhou Huang, and the others could only temporarily reside in the Da Yue Capital City and wait for people from their respective upper sects to come.</p><p></p><p>The Da Yue Kingdom could deploy more powerful experts since the Da Yue Heavenly Cave had been destroyed, and they were currently sweeping the Da Yue Realm, killing the invading Blood Slaves, Blood Servants, and rebels.</p><p></p><p>Even the Immortal Venerable took this opportunity to go and destroy the heavenly caves in various places.</p><p></p><p>The great battle between the Wan Lei Sect and the Tian Wu Gate was also nearing its end with the support of the powerful experts from the Da Yue Kingdom. Both the Wan Lei Sect Master and the Tian Wu Sect Master were greatly shocked, as if a high-level expert had descended upon the Qinghua Realm. Just like the Da Yue Emperor, they suspected that the appearance of the high-level expert was to disrupt the schemes of the Mingyou.</p><p></p><p>In the Da Yue Capital City, two adjacent martial arts academies had been established, the Qimen Academy and the Danyi Academy, with Fang Hao and Su Lingxiu taking charge of them respectively.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu was accompanied by Yue'er, Meng Shushu, Zhou Ying, as well as Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao, who were responsible for assisting with the affairs of the Danyi Academy.</p><p></p><p>In the Qimen Academy, Yue Changming still followed Fang Hao, and the Da Yue Emperor had also dispatched people to assist.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu began to treat the injuries of the warriors of the Da Yue Kingdom. For ordinary injuries, she would just provide medicinal pills, but for injuries that affected the foundation, Su Lingxiu would personally intervene.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the medical treatment was not free.</p><p></p><p>After arriving in the Divine Realm, everything had started to move in the right direction, and they had all embarked on their respective martial arts paths.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong had not gone out to explore for the time being, but were instead settling down and comprehending their own spiritual powers, cultivating the martial arts classics of spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was also seizing the opportunity to cultivate diligently.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan had drawn a portrait, which was his martial arts guide, and the person he had been searching for all his life.</p><p></p><p>Now that he had arrived in the Divine Realm, he naturally had to continue searching for his guide.</p><p></p><p>Relying on the connections of the disciples of the high-level expert, Wu Tiannan searched for powerful experts in the Da Yue Kingdom and inquired about information.</p><p></p><p>However, there was no news at all. Neither the Da Yue Emperor nor any of the Immortal Venerables, nor even the powerful experts who had previously come from the Spiritual Realm, had seen the person in the portrait.</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, Wu Tiannan was not discouraged. The Divine Realm was so vast, and the Qinghua Realm was just one part of it. Ultimately, there would be a day when he found a clue.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, I have already clarified my martial arts path, and I feel that I have found the right path for me to walk, but I feel that my strength is insufficient to wander the Divine Realm in search of someone. Can I also cultivate spiritual powers?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan prostrated himself and said.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze fell upon him, and after a moment of contemplation, he spoke, "Whether you can cultivate spiritual powers or not, it depends on yourself. If you want to learn, I can pass on a few spiritual power techniques to you."</p><p></p><p>He did not reject the idea of passing on spiritual power techniques to those who cultivated the Taihuang Martial Arts, because if the Taihuang Martial Arts could also cultivate spiritual powers, the ultimate beneficiary would still be him. He might even be able to assimilate the Taihuang Martial Arts and leave his mark on it.</p><p></p><p>The more widespread the martial arts, the greater the benefits he, as the Martial Ancestor, would reap.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!" Wu Tiannan was greatly excited and respectfully expressed his gratitude.</p><p></p><p>"Then I shall pass on a few spiritual power techniques to you."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought for a moment and passed on the minor spiritual power techniques that Xu Yan had already comprehended, as well as two other spiritual power techniques that had not yet been comprehended but were suitable for Wu Tiannan.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and directly transmitted the techniques of the spiritual powers into Wu Tiannan's spiritual consciousness.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan's spirit was immediately invigorated, and he felt that mysterious spiritual power techniques had suddenly appeared in his spiritual consciousness. After carefully contemplating them, he found them to be profoundly mysterious, with a sense of difficulty in comprehending them.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng saw this and his spirit was immediately stirred. Although the martial arts he cultivated were not the Great Wilderness Martial Arts nor the pure Taihuang Martial Arts, the general path of his martial arts still followed the Taihuang Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>"Venerable, I also want to comprehend the spiritual powers!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng respectfully paid his respects.</p><p></p><p>As a disciple of Li Xuan's Sword Dao, his relationship was closer than Wu Tiannan's.</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan passed on a few spiritual power techniques to Xie Tianheng, including some Sword Dao spiritual power techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrong was somewhat tempted, but her skin was ultimately a bit too thin, and her relationship was not as close, so she did not dare to ask for the techniques of the spiritual powers.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao's eyes lit up. They had always longed for the techniques of the spiritual powers, and now was the opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"Senior, we also want to learn the spiritual powers!"</p><p></p><p>"Alright!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded. These two girls were already almost like his daughters-in-law, so there was no reason to refuse.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and passed on a few spiritual power techniques to the two girls. Then, without waiting for Ziyun to speak, he also passed on spiritual power techniques to her.</p><p></p><p>He also passed them on to Yue'er and Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>"As for the spiritual power techniques, if you comprehend them or feel that someone can pass them on, then do so. They are not some secret of the martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said in the end.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Senior!"</p><p></p><p>Xin Mengrong felt relieved in her heart, as she could also obtain the spiritual power techniques from Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao.</p><p></p><p>"After passing on so many spiritual power techniques, how many of them will be able to comprehend them? If the Taihuang Martial Arts finds a way to cultivate the spiritual powers, the strength of the Taihuang Martial Arts will have a significant boost."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Ziyun obtained the spiritual power techniques but frowned, unable to comprehend them. Her eyes moved, and she immediately went to Meng Chong's side, grabbing his hand and asking him to explain the spiritual power techniques to her.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had a helpless expression on his face.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao's eyes lit up, and they immediately went to find Xu Yan. However, Yue'er had already gone to find Xu Yan first.</p><p></p><p>Seeing this, Xu Yan could only explain the spiritual power techniques to everyone. It wouldn't be right to bother the master with this kind of thing, right?</p><p></p><p>As the eldest disciple, this responsibility fell on him.</p><p></p><p>Thus, Wu Tiannan, Xie Tianheng, and the others all listened as Xu Yan explained the spiritual powers, and he even pointed out the direction for them to cultivate the spiritual powers in the Taihuang Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan listened quietly for a while and couldn't help but nod. "No wonder he is my martial arts pioneer. He has a deep understanding of the Taihuang Martial Arts and his comprehension of the martial arts surpasses everyone else.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan is the one with the greatest chance of truly walking his own martial arts path."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's martial arts were in their purity, a purity that was multifaceted, not just a single aspect. He truly had a sense of the martial arts being entirely in the heart, with the freedom to act as he wished.</p><p></p><p>Of course, Xu Yan was still unable to achieve the state of the martial arts being in the heart and acting freely, but he had already laid a solid foundation and outline for it.</p><p></p><p>This was also the foundation that allowed Xu Yan to walk his own martial arts path.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to seeing what he would gain after Xu Yan walked his own martial arts path!

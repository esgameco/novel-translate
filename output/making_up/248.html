        <h1>Chapter 248</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The result did not disappoint him.</p><p></p><p>Both Xu Yan and Meng Chong immediately sensed something was amiss and disregarded the formation's influence, landing accurately in the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>"This formation plate is still a bit crude and elementary."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was not too surprised by this.</p><p></p><p>After all, this was the first formation plate that Fang Hao had refined, so it was crude and simple. The power of the formation was not strong.</p><p></p><p>It could not escape the detection of Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"This is my fourth disciple, Fang Hao, who cultivates the Qimen martial arts. This is your senior brother Xu Yan and second senior brother Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan introduced them.</p><p></p><p>Upon hearing this, Fang Hao's eyes widened in shock, his face filled with astonishment.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan, Meng Chong?!"</p><p></p><p>He was completely stunned. The two fierce individuals who shook Yuzhou, who the Yushen Sect and the Su family were desperately chasing after, were actually his senior brothers?</p><p></p><p>"Disciple, what's with that expression?" </p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu asked in surprise.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, second senior brother, are you really the Xu Yan and Meng Chong who are being hunted by the Yushen Sect and the Su family?"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was shocked and excited.</p><p></p><p>His senior brothers were actually such formidable people.</p><p></p><p>"That's right, it's us!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong both nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, second senior brother, you are my idols!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was extremely excited. </p><p></p><p>He grabbed the hands of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, his face filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>"Don't get too excited, fourth junior brother. This is just a small matter. The Yushen Sect and the Su family are nothing to us."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan patted his junior brother's shoulder.</p><p></p><p>Although the Yushen Sect claimed to be the number one sect in Yuzhou, their strength in the Spirit Realm was only trash-tier among the first-rate sects, barely reaching the first-rate threshold.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was overjoyed, never imagining that his senior brothers were actually Xu Yan and Meng Chong, the two fierce individuals who made even the powerful sects and families tremble.</p><p></p><p>Many wandering cultivators also felt proud because of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, and many wanted to use this opportunity to rise to the ranks of the sects and families.</p><p></p><p>After getting acquainted, Fang Hao said excitedly, "Once I enter the door, I will refine formation plates to assist my senior brothers!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao could imagine that in cultivating the Qimen martial arts, whether it was refining weapons or formation plates, he would need a lot of materials for practice and forging.</p><p></p><p>And the sects and families were not lacking in these resources. If he could seize the Yushen Sect or the Su family, he would not lack cultivation resources for a long time.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was filled with excitement and determination. This time, he must cultivate to the entry level and showcase the power of the Qimen martial arts in the upcoming confrontation between his senior brothers and the sects and families.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan and Meng Chong also became curious about the cultivation of the Qimen martial arts after learning that Fang Hao was going to cultivate the entry level.</p><p></p><p>The group left the manor and headed to the cultivation site that Fang Hao had chosen.</p><p></p><p>On the border of Zheng Country, there was a range of mountains. Among the mountains, there was a slightly sunken valley, as if embraced by the mountains, gathering the momentum of the mountains.</p><p></p><p>This was the cultivation site chosen by Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sat on the Crimson Cat, overlooking the valley from the sky, and couldn't help but sigh. Fang Hao was indeed talented in the Qimen arts, as he had chosen this valley that could nurture his cultivation with the momentum of the mountains.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's expression was solemn. He began to arrange the treasures he had refined in a certain position around the valley, as if they were connected to each other.</p><p></p><p>"Master, how does the disciple cultivate the entry level? By drawing in the spiritual energy of heaven and earth?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong asked curiously.</p><p></p><p>"Cultivating by borrowing the momentum of heaven and earth is not that easy. Just watch, you may gain some insights."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled lightly.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao directly adopting this theoretical method to cultivate the entry level of the Qimen martial arts was beyond Li Xuan's expectations. Borrowing the momentum of heaven and earth was indeed difficult and dangerous.</p><p></p><p>The key was how to borrow the momentum of heaven and earth. To do so, one must set up a formation or a heavenly and earthly anomaly, so that the momentum of heaven and earth can be drawn into the body for cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's talent in formations and heavenly and earthly anomalies was indeed extraordinary. He had found this cultivation site and was arranging a heavenly and earthly anomaly to cultivate the entry level.</p><p></p><p>However, the danger also existed. If he could not withstand it, he would be crushed by the momentum of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"I hope he can succeed."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan became a little nervous.</p><p></p><p>If Fang Hao succeeded in cultivating the entry level with this method, it would firmly establish the cultivation method of the entry level of the Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"This cultivation method may bring about some remarkable changes?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered as he flipped through the Dao Golden Book.</p><p></p><p>When he originally compiled the Qimen martial arts, he had the inspiration of the four thousand three hundred Qimen formations. In a flash of insight, he wrote down the theory of cultivating by borrowing the momentum of heaven and earth through the Qimen formations.</p><p></p><p>The original intention was for those who had already entered the door of the Qimen martial arts to cultivate with this method, as setting up the Qimen formations required entry-level cultivation. He never expected Fang Hao to directly use this as the cultivation method for the entry level.</p><p></p><p>In this way, the difficulty of the initial stage of the Qimen martial arts has become less challenging. Later cultivators would need extraordinary talent to cultivate the Qimen martial arts, making it a truly rare and esoteric martial art, more difficult to spread than the physical martial arts or the Dantian martial arts.</p><p></p><p>It also meant that the Qimen martial arts would be more formidable and unpredictable.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also a little nervous, as this cultivation method was unprecedented. One misstep could easily lead to accidents! "The opportunity to change my destiny is right in front of me. If I don't take the risk, I'll regret it. The greater the danger, the greater the reward!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao took a deep breath, his gaze becoming determined.</p><p></p><p>His senior brothers had made the sects and families tremble with fear. He also wanted to become such a person, to make the sects and families fear him!</p><p></p><p>Everything was ready.</p><p></p><p>"Little Ha, go wait outside."</p><p></p><p>He said to the little Ha on his shoulder.</p><p></p><p>"Croak!"</p><p></p><p>The little Ha rubbed against his neck, giving him encouragement, then jumped off to land on Suli Xiu's shoulder. </p><p></p><p>After eating the medicinal pill, it had become more affectionate towards Suli Xiu, as the pill was simply too delicious!</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao placed the pillar-shaped treasure in the center of the valley. In an instant, the momentum of the mountains converged, and the spiritual energy of heaven and earth seemed to be drawn in, flooding the valley.</p><p></p><p>The great momentum of heaven and earth gathered, forming a Qimen formation.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao sat cross-legged on the pillar. </p><p></p><p>Boom! In that instant, it was as if a great mountain was pressing down on him, his bones making cracking sounds, as if they would be crushed at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the valley with a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned, the gathering of the mountain momentum and the drawing in of the spiritual energy of heaven and earth had a strange and changing quality.</p><p></p><p>If this was used to cultivate the Indestructible Golden Body...</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Meng Chong had some ideas.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Silently watching with a somewhat worried expression, she had deliberately refined a high-grade healing elixir to prevent any accidents from happening to Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>If an accident were to occur, he could swallow the elixir.</p><p></p><p>She was just afraid that Fang Hao might not have time to swallow it, and then someone else would have to intervene to save him.</p><p></p><p>"The great momentum of heaven and earth is gathering... If I could refine an elixir..."</p><p></p><p>In this moment, Su Lingxiu also gained an inspiration.</p><p></p><p>"The dao of formations is truly profound. If I could succeed, I could mass-produce elixirs, or even refine more potent ones."</p><p></p><p>Some ideas emerged in Su Lingxiu's mind.</p><p></p><p>"The Void Elixir Refinement Art... The void is the heaven and earth, gathering the momentum of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a shocking and extraordinary elixir refinement art emerged in her mind, although it was just an outline, and with her current strength, she was far from being able to accomplish it.</p><p></p><p>But it laid the foundation for the advancement of her elixir refinement art.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was fully focused on Fang Hao's cultivation. Suddenly, the Great Dao Scriptures on his spiritual platform opened, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>He was startled.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had just started cultivating, he hadn't even entered the door yet, how could he have already received feedback?</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Lingxiu has comprehended the advanced version of the Void Elixir Refinement Art, and you have obtained the Heavenly-Earth Divine Furnace Elixir Refinement Art."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was stunned, looking at Su Lingxiu beside him, greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>The Heavenly-Earth Divine Furnace Elixir Refinement Art, this was already unimaginably powerful.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, he had a feeling that the Heavenly-Earth Divine Furnace Elixir Refinement Art was almost the peak of elixir refinement arts, and to comprehend an even stronger elixir refinement art would be almost impossible!</p><p></p><p>However, Su Lingxiu only had a concept now, she had comprehended a direction for the advancement of elixir refinement art, but had not fully mastered the Heavenly-Earth Divine Furnace Elixir Refinement Art.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, with her current strength, she was far from being able to wield this elixir refinement art.</p><p></p><p>Even Li Xuan himself could not yet manifest this art.</p><p></p><p>He had only just grasped this elixir refinement art, without the sufficient strength to wield it.</p><p></p><p>"This is an unexpected harvest."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was secretly delighted.</p><p></p><p>Although it was Fang Hao who was cultivating the Extraordinary Martial Dao, it was Su Lingxiu who gained an insight from it and comprehended the Heavenly-Earth Divine Furnace Elixir Refinement Art.</p><p></p><p>In the valley, on the treasure pedestal, Fang Hao's face was flushed red, and his entire body was almost bursting. He was struggling to endure.</p><p></p><p>"It's almost time, I should borrow the momentum of heaven and earth, and absorb the extraordinary patterns of heaven and earth into my body."</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Fang Hao's gaze was resolute as he began to cultivate the Extraordinary Martial Dao he had comprehended.</p><p></p><p>The momentum of heaven and earth, thread by thread, flowed through his body, as if tracing something.</p><p></p><p>As he continued to cultivate, the immense pressure gradually became more gentle.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned in deep thought. Fang Hao was deploying the extraordinary formation of heaven and earth, borrowing the momentum of heaven and earth to cultivate the Extraordinary Martial Dao, this was also the cultivation method of the Extraordinary Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>If the momentum of heaven and earth was too strong, he would be crushed in an instant, but if it was too weak, it would be difficult to enter the door of cultivation.</p><p></p><p>He needed to grasp the right balance.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao seemed to have grasped it well, which showed his monstrous talent in the Extraordinary Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"My physical body is robust, cultivating the physical martial dao, my progress has been a bit slow. If I could cultivate by borrowing the momentum of heaven and earth, my Indestructible Golden Body would be stronger, the defense more astonishing, and I could also accelerate the cultivation of my physical body."</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, some ideas gradually emerged in Meng Chong's mind.</p><p></p><p>A cultivation art to assist the cultivation of the Indestructible Golden Body was gradually taking shape in his mind.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan watched Fang Hao, and at this moment, he heaved a sigh of relief. Fang Hao's entry into cultivation did not seem to have any major problems. He also marveled at Fang Hao's talent, as this was his first time deploying the formation to borrow the momentum of heaven and earth, yet he had grasped it so perfectly.</p><p></p><p>The Great Dao Scriptures opened again, and a golden light surged forth.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has comprehended the physical cultivation art, the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Temperings Art, you have obtained the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Temperings Art, the Indestructible Golden Body has undergone a hundred temperings and has been greatly enhanced."</p><p></p><p>With the feedback from the Great Dao Scriptures, Li Xuan found that his Indestructible Golden Body had suddenly increased greatly in strength, as if it had been tempered by the heavens and earth a hundred times.</p><p></p><p>"Sss! This physical martial dao cultivation art is quite impressive, the heavens and earth as the hammer, tempering oneself a hundred times!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at Meng Chong, the second disciple seemed to have a somewhat reckless appearance, but he had actually comprehended such a powerful cultivation art.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu observed Fang Hao borrowing the momentum of heaven and earth to cultivate, and comprehended the Heavenly-Earth Divine Furnace Elixir Refinement Art, while Meng Chong had comprehended the Heavenly Hammer Hundred Temperings Art, so why hadn't Xu Yan comprehended anything?</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was somewhat puzzled, this eldest disciple was the most monstrous one.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but look at Xu Yan, who seemed to be deep in thought, not knowing whether he had comprehended anything.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's cultivation could not be completed in a day or two, especially since he was originally a Grand Master warrior, and now he was cultivating the Extraordinary Martial Dao, almost abandoning his original martial dao foundation to rebuild the foundation of the Extraordinary Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>So this process could not be completed in just a day or two.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was also not too clear about the specifics of Fang Hao's cultivation, after all, the Extraordinary Martial Dao was something he had created, but he had not cultivated it himself.</p><p></p><p>There were some differences between creating it and cultivating it.</p><p></p><p>After a day passed, Fang Hao continued to cultivate, his face still flushed red, indicating that the pain he was enduring was not small.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced at Xu Yan with puzzlement. "Something's not right, where has the monstrous insight of my eldest disciple gone, why hasn't he gained any harvest?"</p><p></p><p>He was a bit frustrated.</p><p></p><p>Among the four disciples, Xu Yan, the eldest disciple, was the true pioneer of his martial dao, the real prodigy.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong and Su Lingxiu had both gained some harvests, but why hadn't Xu Yan comprehended anything?</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his brow slightly raised, revealing a hint of surprise.</p><p></p><p>And at this moment, the feedback from the Great Dao Scriptures came.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has comprehended the Mountain and River Sword Formation, your Mountain and River Sword Formation has reached completion!"</p><p></p><p>A sword formation!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had actually comprehended a sword formation, which exceeded Li Xuan's expectations. And this sword formation was quite remarkable.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan remained silent. At this moment, Xu Yan had already deployed the sword formation with a single thought, where every blade of grass and every tree was a sword, and the sword intent of the mountain and river had merged with the surroundings.</p><p></p><p>Blending into the environment, silent and invisible.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned slightly, looking around, he vaguely sensed that something was amiss, but he could not pinpoint exactly what was wrong.</p><p></p><p>"An illusion?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong denied it, he had never believed that he would experience an illusion.</p><p></p><p>There must be a problem, but he was unable to sense where the problem lay.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, he had a sense of crisis in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"But the master is right beside us, why would there be a sense of crisis?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong frowned deeply.</p><p></p><p>He looked up at Su Lingxiu and transmitted a message, "Sister, have you noticed anything unusual?"</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu's brow slightly furrowed, as a Wood Spirit Body, she sensed that the grass and trees seemed to have some abnormalities, as if they had become sharper. She replied hesitantly, "The plants seem to have some problems."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was puzzled, the plants had problems? He couldn't see anything.</p><p></p><p>He looked at his eldest brother Xu Yan and transmitted a message, "Elder brother, have you noticed anything unusual?"</p><p></p><p>If the eldest brother hadn't noticed any abnormalities, then it was likely that he was the one experiencing an illusion.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

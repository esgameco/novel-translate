        <h1>Chapter 251</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned. He carefully examined the formation but could not find any flaws or weaknesses. He respectfully said, "Your disciple is dull and failed to discover any flaws or weaknesses in the formation. Please, Master, point them out to me."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand and a beam of light fell on a certain spot of the formation. Suddenly, a gap appeared in the formation.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of them... and this is another."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pointed out the flaws and weaknesses one by one.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao felt deeply ashamed. The formation he had set up seemed perfect, but it actually had so many shortcomings.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, Master!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Fang Hao solemnly and said, "The Qimen martial arts encompass formations, seals, and the wonders of heaven and earth. They are not separate, but fused as one, which is the true essence of Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>"Do not fall into the trap of only focusing on formations within the framework of formations, or seals within the framework of seals. </p><p></p><p>"If you do so, you will lose the true meaning of Qimen martial arts. I hope you can understand and think about how to cultivate Qimen martial arts and uncover its great power."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was stunned. He realized that he had fallen into a trap, only researching formations within the framework of formations and forgetting that formations were just one aspect of Qimen martial arts, not the foundation.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, Master, I understand!"</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said respectfully. He understood how to comprehend Qimen martial arts and unleash its great power.</p><p></p><p>"You also know about the Storage Bag. You can also refine similar storage tools that are more convenient, efficient, and have larger space than the Storage Bag.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, you'll have to figure out the required refining materials yourself."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan reminded him after a moment of thought.</p><p></p><p>Since he had formations, seals, and refining, refining a storage ring should be the next step, right?</p><p></p><p>"I understand, Master!"</p><p></p><p>After respectfully saluting, Fang Hao began to ponder how to make up for the flaws and weaknesses in the formation. At the same time, he would refine his understanding, integrating the insights on formations, seals, and refining into a true comprehension of the essence of Qimen martial arts.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>In the main hall of the Yushen Sect, over a dozen Refining Deity Realm experts gathered, including three from the Su Clan.</p><p></p><p>The one seated at the top of the Yushen Sect was the Sect's Grand Elder, the one who had led the Yushen Sect to become a top-tier sect in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Even the weakest among them were Refining Deity Realm experts! The fact that they had even summoned the Yushen Sect's Grand Elder, who was cultivating to break through the Refining Deity Realm, showed how grave the situation was.</p><p></p><p>"Have you found the origins of Xu Yan and Meng Chong?" the Yushen Sect Grand Elder asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"No!" the Yushen Sect Master's face was extremely gloomy.</p><p></p><p>"My Su Clan also has no information about the origins of these two," the Su Clan Elder's expression was also extremely unsightly.</p><p></p><p>"At their young age to have such strength, even if they are top disciples of a supreme sect, it would not be this powerful. They must be geniuses with extraordinary constitutions. Since they are not from the Yu State, perhaps they are from other states."</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect Grand Elder asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"We have already requested the help of sects and powerful families from other states, but the results have been fruitless so far. These two seem to have appeared out of nowhere, and their strength is extremely formidable.</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan alone suppressed and slew the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse in the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's Tomb, and then killed the Dai Clan's Refining Deity.</p><p></p><p>"As for the Golden Armored Giant, such a powerful cultivation method has never appeared in the Spirit Realm before. Where did they learn from? What is their inheritance? This is the key."</p><p></p><p>The Su Clan Elder said with a grave expression.</p><p></p><p>"So far, we can almost confirm that these two are not from any sect or powerful family, but are wandering cultivators. Yet such geniuses have appeared among the wandering cultivators, and their inheritances are extraordinary.</p><p></p><p>"With our control over the Yu State, we have still been unable to track down their whereabouts. This is the most terrifying part."</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect Master said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>They were not afraid of powerful enemies, but of enemies who came and went without a trace, whom they could not even ambush. Xu Yan and Meng Chong had appeared right under the noses of the Yushen Sect and the Su Clan, and this made them feel like there was a sharp blade hanging over their heads.</p><p></p><p>If Xu Yan and Meng Chong were not eliminated, they would never be at ease.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect Grand Elder pondered for a moment, then spoke, "Is it possible that Xu Yan and Meng Chong are related to the remnants of the Wanxing Sect?"</p><p></p><p>At these words, the Refining Deity Realm experts present all felt a chill.</p><p></p><p>"It's possible!" The Su Clan Elder's expression became more cautious.</p><p></p><p>"In the past, the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, despite not being a Supreme Sect, was still a top-tier sect in the Spirit Realm. It was overthrown by our sects and powerful families. </p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan and Meng Chong may be geniuses cultivated by the Wanxing Sect to return to the Eighteen States and challenge the hegemony of the sects and powerful families."</p><p></p><p>The Wanxing Martial Arts Academy had once been renowned throughout the Eighteen States of the Spirit Realm. Although it was not a Supreme Sect, it was still one of the top sects, dedicated to teaching martial arts.</p><p></p><p>In its heyday, many scions of first-rate families had gone to the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy to cultivate, and geniuses among the wandering cultivators had all aspired to join the academy.</p><p></p><p>However, after the Bloody Demon Calamity, under the oppression of the sects and powerful families in the Eighteen States, a battle of geniuses took place, telling the world that in the Spirit Realm, it was the sects and powerful families that ruled supreme.</p><p></p><p>No matter how talented the wandering cultivators were, they were still of humble bloodlines and could never compare to the geniuses of the sects and powerful families.</p><p></p><p>This battle of geniuses led to the downfall of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, and the remnants fled to the Azure Sea.</p><p></p><p>Since then, the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy had disappeared from the Spirit Realm. The sudden appearance of Xu Yan and Meng Chong, displaying such powerful abilities and suppressing the geniuses of the Yu State, inevitably made them suspect that these were geniuses carefully cultivated by the Wanxing Sect to challenge the hegemony of the sects and powerful families.</p><p></p><p>No one would doubt that Xu Yan and Meng Chong did not come from the inner realm, as such powerful geniuses could not possibly come from the lower realms.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect Grand Elder took a deep breath and said, "Regardless of their origins, use every means to find their whereabouts. This seat will personally take action!"</p><p></p><p>The Su Clan Elder's spirit was invigorated. The Yushen Sect Grand Elder, a Refining Deity Realm expert, the strongest in the Yu State, was actually going to take action personally. This showed how much of a threat Xu Yan and Meng Chong posed.</p><p></p><p>"If they are indeed remnants of the Wanxing Sect, won't they have a Dao Protector?" the Su Clan Elder frowned and said.</p><p></p><p>"Hmph! If the remnants of the Wanxing Sect dare to show themselves, let's see if the Eighteen States can accommodate them!" the Yushen Sect Grand Elder coldly smiled.</p><p></p><p>Everyone present nodded in agreement.</p><p></p><p>"Was that person from the Wanxing Sect really dead back then?" the Yushen Sect Master suddenly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, everyone fell silent. The legendary figure of the Wanxing Martial Arts Academy, a Refining Deity Realm expert who had fought evenly with the top experts of the Supreme Sects - was that person really dead?</p><p></p><p>"Most likely, he is dead," the Yushen Sect Grand Elder said in a deep voice after a long silence. "Back then, at the Thousand Martial Hall..."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The lord of the Leiyun Manor personally took action, how could he not die? The people in the main hall were all startled. When the mighty cultivators of the Qiangwu Palace and the Leiyun Manor clashed, how could the one being targeted survive? Now the crowd was relieved, as long as the protector was not this person, the rest of the remnants would not be a concern.</p><p></p><p>Several months later.</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou was shaken again.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and the Su Clan had raised the bounty again.</p><p></p><p>"The Spirit Essence Flower, the Yushen Sect is really not sparing any expense."</p><p></p><p>"Whew, I'm afraid there's no place for Xu Yan and Meng Chong in Yuzhou anymore."</p><p></p><p>"With such a high bounty, in the history of the Spiritual Cultivation Realm, I think of..."</p><p></p><p>"Shh, you want to die? Let the sects and clans hear, and your life won't be spared!"</p><p></p><p>Yuzhou was boiling again, this time even the scattered cultivators in Yuzhou who had reached the Refining Spirit Celestial realm came out of hiding.</p><p></p><p>Searching for Xu Yan and Meng Chong! The Spirit Essence Flower, the Refining Spirit Celestials were also tempted.</p><p></p><p>The Spirit Essence Flower only grows in the great spiritual mines, and it only blooms once every thousand years, showing how precious it is!</p><p></p><p>As for the effects of the Spirit Essence Flower, it nourishes the spiritual soul. For peak Grandmaster cultivators, consuming it can break through the bottleneck of Gathering Spirit. </p><p></p><p>For minor Celestials, it can open their Celestial bottleneck and increase the chances of refining their spiritual souls.</p><p></p><p>For great Celestials, it increases the chances by 50% to break through the Refining Spirit Celestial realm.</p><p></p><p>Even for Refining Spirit Celestials, it can strengthen their spiritual souls by 10% and increase the chances of breaking through the middle Refining Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>Thus, the Spirit Essence Flower is truly precious.</p><p></p><p>Even first-rate sects and clans would not use it lightly, usually only for their Refining Spirit Celestials to break through bottlenecks or when their spiritual souls are unexpectedly damaged.</p><p></p><p>Using the Spirit Essence Flower for cultivation is too extravagant, even for first-rate sects, they cannot afford such luxury.</p><p></p><p>Probably only super-first-rate sects and clans that have mastered the cultivation of the Spirit Essence Flower would be so extravagant.</p><p></p><p>"Now, not only the cultivators of Yuzhou are tempted, but the cultivators from other states will also be tempted," Yu Zongzhu sighed.</p><p></p><p>The Yushen Sect and the Su Clan really made a big move.</p><p></p><p>It can be foreseen that Refining Spirit Celestials from other states will also come to Yuzhou, scouring it to find Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>As for the wanted Xu Yan, after his breakthrough, he returned to the manor.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the location of the manor, he raised his brow, the manor had disappeared? The divine sense descended, and he nodded.</p><p></p><p>A formation!</p><p></p><p>His fourth junior brother had set up a formation to conceal the manor so quickly.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual mines of the Yushen Sect and the Su Clan cannot be wasted. With the formation covering it, we can ponder how to move the spiritual mines."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"We don't necessarily have to empty the spiritual mines, we can set up a formation to seal them, and the mines will belong to us in the future."</p><p></p><p>Formations are truly a good thing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stepped into the formation and walked towards the courtyard.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was beaming with excitement, holding a formation plate in his hands, ready to control the formation to trap Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Junior brother, how long do you think you can trap the senior brother?" Suli Xiu asked excitedly.</p><p></p><p>"A quarter of an hour should be no problem," Fang Hao said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Half a quarter of an hour, I think that's the most," Suli Xiu said.</p><p></p><p>"Sister, you're underestimating my formations." </p><p></p><p>"It's you who's underestimating the senior brother, you don't know how formidable he is!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at Xu Yan in the formation and shook his head slightly. Half a quarter of an hour? They were greatly underestimating Xu Yan! This was the pioneer of his Dao, how could this simple formation trap him? The mist was dense, the phoenix fire was raging, the power of the formation had been activated by Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked around, nodding, this formation was indeed profound. If it was Dai Sheng, the Refining Spirit Celestial, trapping him for half an hour would be no problem.</p><p></p><p>As for himself? With a step forward, the sword intent permeated, in an instant, the phoenix fire and the dense mist were transformed into sharp swords, forming a sword formation!</p><p></p><p>Heart Sword Realm! All things can become swords, even formations can become swords! Xu Yan walked into the courtyard as if strolling in a garden.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was dumbfounded, momentarily doubting if his formation was so weak. "No, it's just that the senior brother is too strong!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan chuckled and said, "This formation is not bad!"</p><p></p><p>"Senior brother, how did you break through my formation?" Fang Hao asked frustratedly.</p><p></p><p>"All things can become swords, even formations can become swords. Your formation did not exceed my control, no matter how you set it up, I can turn it into my sword with a single thought."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and patted Fang Hao's shoulder, "Fourth junior brother, your Esoteric Martial Dao is strong, it's just that your comprehension is still shallow and you haven't been able to unleash its essence."</p><p></p><p>"I understand!" Fang Hao said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>After paying respects to the master, Xu Yan had Yuxiao spit out the items.</p><p></p><p>"This is the harvest from the Dai family's treasury that I and the junior brother obtained. Sister and fourth junior brother, you don't have to worry about resources anymore."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pointed to the pile of storage bags that Yuxiao had spat out.</p><p></p><p>The treasures of a single clan, how abundant they were? Fang Hao was completely stunned.</p><p></p><p>Suli Xiu had already started sorting and categorizing these treasures with Zhou Ying, Shi Er, and Meng Shushu.</p><p></p><p>As for Yuxiao, it immediately went to the Red Cat, trying to curry favor with it.</p><p></p><p>In order to learn the Great Demon Technique, it was willing to be a little brother.</p><p></p><p>The Red Cat was very satisfied with this, and pointed to the squatting Xiao Ha, introducing him as the third brother!</p><p></p><p>Xiao Ha had a timid appearance, this snake was so scary! The Fat Cat was the master's teacher's pet, and this snake was the master's senior brother's pet, so it was at the lowest position.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan saw Fang Hao forging, so he spoke up, "Junior brother, you can forge a set of unique weapons for yourself, incorporating formations, prohibitions, and heaven and earth wonders."</p><p></p><p>"You can also forge a weapon that is a deadly tool, incorporating all kinds of Esoteric Dao tools, so that when you strike, formations will arise, wonders will appear, and the attack will be like a raging torrent..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao's hand paused, and a flash of inspiration appeared in his mind. He was extremely excited and said, "Thank you, senior brother, for the guidance. I understand, I will forge an Esoteric Armament Chest!"</p><p></p><p>In an instant, the blueprint for forging the Esoteric Armament Chest appeared in his mind.</p><p></p><p>With a thought, the chest released a set of formations, and in a flash, a great formation arose. Moreover, the chest itself was a deadly weapon, shooting out one killing tool after another.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled and nodded, "Junior brother, since you have an idea, go for it. The Dai family's treasury has endless materials, don't be afraid to waste them, since they were obtained without much effort anyway."</p><p></p><p>"You can also try to forge something with a large storage space to replace the storage bags, so you can better accommodate the Dai family's treasures."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was now extremely excited, finally finding the path of the Esoteric Martial Dao's killing techniques. He nodded and said, "Senior brother, don't worry, I already have some ideas."</p><p></p><p>(Chapter end)</p>

        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly, this Wu Tian Nan truly is a person of fortune.</p><p></p><p>A country bumpkin, he saved a beautiful and powerful woman, and under her guidance, he embarked on the path of the martial dao, rising up step by step. He established the Seven Star Academy, and then took charge of the Myriad Star Martial Institute in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Although he was defeated in the initial clash of geniuses, he rose up again, cultivating to the peak of the Spirit Realm, and even breaking through to divine abilities in his physical martial dao, feeling extremely elated, he has come to visit me.</p><p></p><p>He is truly a blessed person.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan finished recounting his martial dao journey, and his current predicament is that he can no longer continue cultivating, unable to refine the principles of heaven and earth into his body.</p><p></p><p>This is the purpose of his visit to seek advice from the senior.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan calmly spoke, "The Tai Cang Martial Dao is limited by the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth. In the Spirit Realm, the limit of the spiritual mechanisms is as such. Condensing the power of the principles has already reached the true limit. Refining the principles of heaven and earth into the body is impossible."</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan was shocked, the senior spoke not of the Spirit Realm martial dao, but the Tai Cang Martial Dao!</p><p></p><p>"Senior, how can I break through this shackle?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan asked respectfully.</p><p></p><p>"Go beyond the Spirit Realm, just as from the Inner Realm to the Spirit Realm, Tai Cang is the same." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan said calmly.</p><p></p><p>The words cannot be said too directly and clearly, as a senior, his words must give a sense of profundity and deep meaning.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan murmured to himself, "Beyond the Spirit Realm, just like from the Inner Realm to the Spirit Realm, the Divine Bridge!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he thought of the Divine Bridge, perhaps that is the bridge leading out of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued, "Of course, there are also other methods, but for you, the difficulty would be too great."</p><p></p><p>After thinking for a moment, he raised his hand and grabbed the materials used by Fang Hao for refining, bringing them to his hand.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, a thin spiritual paper appeared in his hand, refined from those materials to serve as a medium for the principles of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>He then raised his hand again, gathering the principles of heaven and earth, and drew a few strokes on the spiritual paper.</p><p></p><p>Several principles described by the power of the heavenly and earthly laws were imprinted on the spiritual paper, corresponding to the principles of the Tai Cang heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>If one can comprehend and understand the principles on this spiritual paper, they can use it as a foundation to break through the shackle and refine the principles of heaven and earth into the body, surpassing the limit of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>However, achieving this is not something that can be done in a short time.</p><p></p><p>Since Wu Tian Nan has come, and had the chance to meet this senior, he will bestow upon him this opportunity.</p><p></p><p>"This is one of the principles of heaven and earth. If you can comprehend it thoroughly, you can use it as a foundation to refine the corresponding principles of heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan waved his hand, and the spiritual paper flew in front of Wu Tian Nan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan was extremely excited, respectfully taking the spiritual paper with both hands, "Thank you, senior, for bestowing this opportunity!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan picked up the tea cup, sipping the spiritual tea, and said indifferently, "To have my senior disciple guide you here, you are indeed fortunate!"</p><p></p><p>If it were not for Xu Yan's guidance of Wu Tian Nan to come here, and Li Xuan happening to have just broken through, feeling elated, he would not have been so generous in bestowing this opportunity to Wu Tian Nan.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan sighed deeply, Xu Yan was right, meeting the senior is a deep blessing!</p><p></p><p>Today is his fortune!</p><p></p><p>After respectfully paying his respects, he and Yue Chang Ming went to find a place to ponder and comprehend.</p><p></p><p>As soon as he looked at it, he was immediately shocked, as if he could see the principles of heaven and earth operating on the spiritual paper, profoundly abstruse, difficult to fathom the true essence within.</p><p></p><p>Yue Chang Ming took a glance and realized that he was still far from being able to comprehend the true principles of heaven and earth, and continued to refine that wisp of the power of the heavenly and earthly principles on his own.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan sat cross-legged, placing the spiritual paper on his knees, his spiritual consciousness carefully observing and examining it, as if he had entered into a profound and mysterious realm.</p><p></p><p>It was as if he could see the operation of the principles of heaven and earth, unfathomable and incomprehensible.</p><p></p><p>"This Wu Tian Nan is indeed extraordinary."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan glanced over and no longer paid attention.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tian Nan's talent is undoubtedly very strong. Although he does not have the innate talent of the spirit body, he has reached the peak of the Spirit Realm, and in addition to his fortune, his comprehension ability is also indispensable.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion has not changed at all with the addition of Wu Tian Nan, and he has been quietly contemplating the principles of heaven and earth on the spiritual paper in a corner that has been overlooked.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan continued to study and memorize the patterns on the tenth page of the Tai Cang Book.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has broken through to the second layer of the Unbreakable Golden Body, your Unbreakable Golden Body power is amplified a hundredfold!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong has broken through to the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"He has become even stronger!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was excited.</p><p></p><p>With his physical strength amplified a hundredfold, without even needing to activate any cultivation techniques, a single casual punch could easily crush a cultivator like Wu Tian Nan.</p><p></p><p>"Su Ling Xiu, that girl, is also about to break through."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to it.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Meng Chong has evolved and transformed into a Golden Immortal Divine Body, you have obtained the Primordial Mountain and River Golden Immortal Divine Body."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong has also successfully transformed into a divine body.</p><p></p><p>Just a few days after Meng Chong's breakthrough, news came that he had powerfully slain an elder of the Thousand Martial Hall, and like Xu Yan, he had also gone to the Great River State.</p><p></p><p>The Thousand Martial Hall was furious, declaring that they must annihilate Xu Yan and Meng Chong, and they have once again dispatched an extremely powerful expert to the Great River State to hunt down the two.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan shook his head, these elders of the Thousand Martial Hall will soon become stepping stones.</p><p></p><p>With the speed of Xu Yan and Meng Chong's power increase, it won't be long before even cultivators who have refined the spiritual mechanisms of heaven and earth will no longer be their opponents.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Martial True Body has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan discovered that his Divine Martial True Body has increased to nine, and the nine combined into one, elevating the Divine Martial True Body to an even higher level.</p><p></p><p>"The Great Desolate Martial Dao in the Inner Realm is developing faster and faster, a million Great Desolate martial artists are imminent."</p><p></p><p>Although a million Great Desolate martial artists in the Inner Realm is nothing, this million is just the beginning.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, they are all powerful experts from the Inner Realm who have converted to cultivate the Great Desolate Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>As the Great Desolate martial artists become more and more numerous, and the Great Desolate Martial Dao is taught more and more widely, the trend is that the martial dao of the Inner Realm will eventually be eliminated.</p><p></p><p>"The highest cultivation of the Great Desolate Martial Dao techniques in the Inner Realm is only the Divine Element Realm, and only Xu Jun He possesses them. His breakthrough to the Divine Element Realm is still far away."</p><p></p><p>The Divine Element Realm martial dao techniques are already considered high-level in the Inner Realm.</p><p></p><p>To produce Divine Element Realm martial artists, it may take a very long time, as the spiritual qi in the Inner Realm is relatively sparse compared to the Great Desolate Martial Dao, so the cultivation speed is naturally slower.</p><p></p><p>And the Divine Element Realm, even ordinary Divine Element Realm martial artists, their strength will not be weaker than Refined Spirit Celestials.</p><p></p><p>The Great Desolate Martial Dao has already surpassed the Tai Cang Martial Dao.</p><p></p><p>"The day when the Inner Realm is filled with Great Desolate martial artists, I, the Great Desolate Martial Ancestor, may have truly transcended heaven and earth."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed and lamented.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Su Ling Xiu has comprehended the divine ability of the Dao of Alchemy Martial Dao, your Dao of Alchemy Martial Dao has broken through to the Divine Ability Realm."</p><p></p><p>On the Spiritual Platform, the Golden Dao Book opened, and golden light surged.</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu has comprehended the Divine Ability Realm.</p><p></p><p>With the breakthrough in the Dao of Alchemy Martial Dao, Li Xuan felt that his vitality was endless, his lifespan seemingly infinite, and his life force would never be exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dao of Alchemy Martial Dao has broken through to the Divine Ability Realm, you have obtained the Divine Ability Myriad Dao Furnace."</p><p></p><p>The first divine ability of the Dao of Alchemy Martial Dao has been born.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Furnace, the myriad Dao converging into a divine furnace, can not only refine elixirs, but also melt all things. With a wave of the hand, the divine furnace envelops and melts all.</p><p></p><p>It is both the divine art of elixir refinement and the divine art of destruction.</p><p></p><p>"Correct, this is the divine version of the Heaven and Earth Furnace Elixir Refinement Art. Refining elixirs is but a thought away. If one's cultivation is strong enough, directly absorbing the laws of Heaven and Earth to refine into elixirs is also possible."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>The Myriad Dao Furnace divine art has almost elevated the Dao of Elixir Refinement to the pinnacle. As long as one's cultivation is strong enough, refining elixirs from the laws of Heaven and Earth is no longer a problem.</p><p></p><p>"With my current cultivation, I can already extract a strand of the power of the laws of Heaven and Earth as the primary material to refine into an elixir."</p><p></p><p>Elixirs refined with the power of the laws of Heaven and Earth as the primary material will inevitably enhance one's comprehension and innate talent in the laws.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dao of Elixir Refinement has broken through to the divine art realm, and you have obtained the Divine Art of Evergreen Divine Fire!"</p><p></p><p>The second divine art of the Dao of Elixir Refinement has been born.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan saw a faint blue flame ignite and gradually grow stronger on his spiritual platform, like a small bonfire.</p><p></p><p>This is not a true flame, but a divine art manifested from the cultivator's laws. </p><p></p><p>Therefore, this Evergreen Divine Fire is a divine fire formed from the evolution of the laws. Its power and growth potential are far beyond that of a normal fire.</p><p></p><p>"The Evergreen Divine Fire has no temperature and is not a burning fire..."</p><p></p><p>On the spiritual platform, the faint blue flame was burning and flickering slightly, without any sense of temperature.</p><p></p><p>It also does not possess great destructive power, only a steady vitality, as if it were a fire of life.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Divine Fire is indeed a fire of life, which can bestow vitality, but also consume it!</p><p></p><p>Although it seems to have no temperature and no destructive power, the Evergreen Divine Fire's method of burning is different from normal fire.</p><p></p><p>Its intensity lies in melting life force, burning life force, devouring life force.</p><p></p><p>Any living being touched by it will find it almost impossible to extinguish.</p><p></p><p>The life force will not be exhausted, the fire will not be extinguished, until the life force is completely burned and devoured.</p><p></p><p>Yet the Evergreen Divine Fire can also bestow life force. Even for those whose lifespan is nearly exhausted, a strand of the Evergreen Divine Fire can grant them vitality and prolong their life.</p><p></p><p>It can even be imparted to others, and the divine fire will not be extinguished, the life force will not be depleted! This is a unique divine art of the Dao of Elixir Refinement.</p><p></p><p>"Incredible!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. The Dao of Elixir Refinement is not known for its combat prowess, yet the divine arts it has produced are not weak in the path of destruction.</p><p></p><p>This is perhaps related to the fact that he is not a pure Dao of Elixir Refinement cultivator.</p><p></p><p>Of course, the aura of being the founder of the Dao of Elixir Refinement may also have contributed to the birth of such a powerful divine art.</p><p></p><p>"The Fleshly Dao has brought me three divine arts, so the Dao of Elixir Refinement should also have three divine arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked forward to what the third divine art would be.</p><p></p><p>It should also be related to the characteristics of the Dao of Elixir Refinement.</p><p></p><p>"The Myriad Dao Furnace can refine elixirs, and the Evergreen Divine Fire is a fire of life that can bestow and consume life force. </p><p></p><p>What kind of divine art will the third one be?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked at the Evergreen Divine Fire that had fully manifested on his spiritual platform, and the third divine art should be born soon.</p><p></p><p>"Your Dao of Elixir Refinement has broken through to the divine art realm, and you have obtained the Divine Art of Bone Resurrection!"</p><p></p><p>The third divine art, Bone Resurrection!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly astonished, this was completely beyond his expectations. This divine art is so incredible.</p><p></p><p>Bone Resurrection is a divine art of resurrection! Even a pile of bones can be made to revive!</p><p></p><p>Of course, at the divine art realm cultivation, one cannot truly resurrect the dead. But Bone Resurrection is the greatest power of this divine art.</p><p></p><p>"Although I cannot resurrect the dead, if the death is recent, I can still use this divine art to revive them!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan murmured to himself.</p><p></p><p>"As long as I'm strong enough, using this divine art can revive the bones. This is incredibly powerful and miraculous.</p><p></p><p>"But perhaps it requires truly transcending Heaven and Earth to achieve this.</p><p></p><p>"And maybe the stronger the person was in life, the greater the resistance and difficulty in resurrection?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was shocked by this third divine art.</p><p></p><p>The Bone Resurrection divine art can not only revive others, but also revive oneself from death.</p><p></p><p>But there is only one chance.</p><p></p><p>When one falls, using this divine art on oneself can indeed revive, but after the resurrection, this divine art will enter a dormant state.</p><p></p><p>"If I combine my 'One Thought Resurrection' with Bone Resurrection, I can reduce the consumption of Bone Resurrection and avoid the divine art entering dormancy after resurrection.</p><p></p><p>"This is a perfect match, it's like having a few extra lives."</p><p></p><p>The more Li Xuan pondered, the more amazed he was at the power of the Bone Resurrection divine art.</p><p></p><p>"With this divine art, I no longer fear any injury. Even if I'm dealt a devastating blow by the enemy, I can instantly recover with this divine art.</p><p></p><p>"I can even resurrect from death, so what's a mere injury?"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Li Xuan felt an unprecedented sense of confidence.</p><p></p><p>"But I can't be complacent. The Heavenly Dao is still likely to have extremely powerful existences, like the one who wrote the Heavenly Dao Scriptures, whose cultivation must be beyond imagination.</p><p></p><p>"I'm only invincible in the Spiritual Realm for now, far from being truly invincible in the Heavenly Dao."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, inwardly reminding himself not to be arrogant or overconfident.</p><p></p><p>No matter how miraculous the divine arts are, if one's cultivation realm is too low, they can still be crushed.</p><p></p><p>"The Bone Resurrection divine art is so miraculous, I must find a way to create a similar divine art of my own.</p><p></p><p>"A true great divine art that grants an extra life is truly invaluable."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan now had another divine art he needed to create - something similar to 'One Thought Resurrection' for the flesh, combined with a divine art of self-resurrection like Bone Resurrection.</p><p></p><p>Bone Resurrection can be used to revive others, but the one he creates doesn't need that ability. </p><p></p><p>It only needs the power of self-resurrection.</p><p></p><p>Even so, creating such a divine art is no easy task, despite having Bone Resurrection as a reference.</p><p></p><p>"These powerful divine arts, once created, can only be comprehended and cultivated by disciples like Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"But if it's in the Fleshly Dao, even Meng Chong could do it. His and Xu Yan's talent are both monstrous, only slightly inferior to each other."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly inspired, temporarily setting aside the Heavenly Dao Scriptures to focus on creating divine arts.</p><p></p><p>While he had the inspiration and a divine art as a reference, it would be easier to create something coherent and well-founded.</p><p></p><p>"What should I name this divine art? I'll have to think carefully about that."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan quickly sketched out the initial theory for the divine art, knowing he would need more time to fully develop and refine it, as it was a profoundly powerful and abstruse divine art.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

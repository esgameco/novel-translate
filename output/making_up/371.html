        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A streak of light rose from Spirit Gate City, flying through the air towards the Great Peak Nation.</p><p></p><p>The closer one got to the Great Peak Nation, the more fighting and bloodshed could be seen everywhere. There were even blood slaves and blood disciples slaughtering people all around.</p><p></p><p>Even worse, upon encountering a small city, it was being massacred by blood slaves. Some martial artists, in order to survive, had joined the Netherworld blood slaves and become part of the blood shadows.</p><p></p><p>At this point, Cheng Zhan and the others would take action, killing any blood shadows and blood slaves they encountered along the way, and rescuing cities in crisis.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others grew more and more alarmed as they watched. The chaos in the Divine Realm exceeded imagination. Even Condensed Law Celestial Lords could encounter danger and perish at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Condensed Law Celestial Lords were invincible existences in the Spirit Realm, able to suppress the entire realm. </p><p></p><p>But in the Divine Realm, Condensed Law Celestial Lords were as common as minor Celestials in the Spirit Realm, and were not top-tier powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship's speed was not very fast as it traveled, continuously slaughtering blood shadows and killing any Netherworld blood slaves encountered along the way.</p><p></p><p>As a result, on this day, shocking news spread throughout the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>After killing rampaging blood slaves and blood shadows in one city, news arrived from Qiyun Prefecture in the Great Peak Nation.</p><p></p><p>In Qiyun Prefecture, a True King Celestial Lord had betrayed, and two more True King Celestial Lords had surrendered in despair! Besides the two True King Celestial Lords, a group of martial artists from Qiyun Prefecture had also surrendered, and Qiyun Prefecture had been blood sacrificed!</p><p></p><p>The Netherworld divine artifact, the Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Dome, had appeared and sealed off the prefecture. Together with the surrendered martial artists, they had blood sacrificed the entire prefecture.</p><p></p><p>This news shook the Azure Flower Realm!</p><p></p><p>Qiyun Prefecture was a famous major city in the entire Azure Flower Realm, with numerous martial artists. Its overall strength was quite renowned in the Azure Flower Realm, yet it had been blood sacrificed!</p><p></p><p>The casualties were so enormous that it could rank in the top ten disasters in Azure Flower Realm history! As this news spread, the Great Peak Nation was shaken, and the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect and Celestial Martial Gate were greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Dome meant that a powerful Netherworld blood disciple, or even a blood son, had infiltrated the Azure Flower Realm.</p><p></p><p>With even Qiyun Prefecture blood sacrificed, weaker cities were in danger of being blood sacrificed at any time.</p><p></p><p>Especially the other cities within Qiyun Prefecture's borders were now all in danger.</p><p></p><p>And as this news spread, blood sons appeared at the Netherworld Abyss guarded by Immortal Celestial Lords from the Great Peak Nation, Ten Thousand Thunder Sect, and Celestial Martial Gate, sparking great battles.</p><p></p><p>This was to tie down these Immortal Celestial Lords.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Celestial Lord confronting the Blood Shadow Tower Lord attacked frantically, wanting to defeat the Blood Shadow Tower Lord and go to Qiyun Prefecture to kill those performing the blood sacrifice.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!" Cheng Zhan's face turned pale on the Evergreen Pavilion flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Xu Yan asked with furrowed brows.</p><p></p><p>After receiving news of Qiyun Prefecture being blood sacrificed, the flying ship had already changed course towards Qiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not from the Divine Realm, such horrifying and brutal methods also made Xu Yan and the others furious.</p><p></p><p>"A blood son is about to be born!" Cheng Zhan said with a panicked expression.</p><p></p><p>"With Qiyun Prefecture blood sacrificed and the appearance of the Life-Slaughtering Blood Refining Dome, there must be a blood disciple wanting to use this to advance to blood son!" Such an enormous amount of martial artists' essence blood was enough for the other party to advance to blood son.</p><p></p><p>"Every blood son is comparable to an Immortal Celestial Lord!"</p><p></p><p>Once a blood son was born in the Azure Flower Realm, it would be big trouble. If they went into hiding and couldn't be killed quickly, they could cause massive disasters.</p><p></p><p>This was a huge hidden danger.</p><p></p><p>They had thought that with an Immortal Celestial Lord reinforcement arriving, it would be enough to turn the tide in the Azure Flower Realm. But if a blood son was born, the situation would continue.</p><p></p><p>They could only wait for reinforcements from outside the realm.</p><p></p><p>But the outside realms may not have spare powerhouses who could come to their aid. This disturbance was not limited to just the Azure Flower Realm!</p><p></p><p>It seemed the enemies from beyond had launched a major invasion of the Divine Realm in concert.</p><p></p><p>"Even if a blood son is born, there's no need to panic. As long as my master takes action, he can destroy them," Xu Yan said, patting Cheng Zhan's shoulder to comfort him.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan opened his mouth but then sighed. This young man didn't know how powerful Immortal Celestial Lords were.</p><p></p><p>Even among Immortal Celestial Lords, there were differences in strength. But even for a strong Immortal Celestial Lord to kill a weak one was not so easy.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, this blood son's strength would definitely not be that of a weak Immortal Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>In the history of the Azure Flower Realm, Immortal Celestial Lords who had perished could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Celestial Lords were one with heaven and earth, with lifespans equal to heaven and earth. To kill an Immortal Celestial Lord, one had to destroy the piece of heaven and earth they were one with.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, an Immortal Celestial Lord would always have a way to escape.</p><p></p><p>And to destroy a piece of heaven and earth was no easy feat.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, that piece of heaven and earth merged with the Celestial Lord's power. To destroy it, the instantaneous attack power had to far surpass that Immortal Celestial Lord.</p><p></p><p>There were no weak Netherworld blood sons. And the martial arts of Netherworld blood sons differed slightly from Divine Realm martial artists, making them even harder to kill.</p><p></p><p>In the long history of defending against the Netherworld Abyss, countless blood disciples had fallen, but blood sons who had perished could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Before the flying ship reached Qiyun Prefecture, while killing blood slaves invading a certain large city, they received the latest news from Qiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>As Cheng Zhan had predicted, a blood son had been born!</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Tu!</p><p></p><p>Blood disciples had no names, but blood sons did.</p><p></p><p>This blood son was called Tu!</p><p></p><p>The moment Blood Son Tu appeared, he displayed incredibly powerful strength, beyond even the Blood Shadow Tower Lord.</p><p></p><p>Comparable to top Immortal Celestial Lords, in the entire Azure Flower Realm only three people had such strength.</p><p></p><p>They were the Great Peak Emperor, the Ten Thousand Thunder Sect Leader, and the Celestial Martial Sect Leader!</p><p></p><p>But these three could not leave their posts.</p><p></p><p>The Great Peak Nation was in danger!</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, more of the Qiyun Prefecture powerhouses defected. One True King Celestial Lord after another surrendered to Blood Son Tu.</p><p></p><p>Even more True King Celestial Lords died in battle.</p><p></p><p>Every True King Celestial Lord who surrendered became a Netherworld blood disciple under Blood Son Tu's use of the Netherworld divine artifact to bestow Netherworld blood essence.</p><p></p><p>After surrendering, the first thing they had to do was blood sacrifice Qiyun Prefecture to collect more essence blood for Blood Son Tu!</p><p></p><p>Due to the slow spread of information, by the time the Evergreen Pavilion received the news, Qiyun Prefecture was likely already close to becoming a dead zone! Qiyun Prefecture City was now completely silent, with only a faint blood energy lingering in the city.</p><p></p><p>On the highest tower of the former governor's mansion stood a pale-faced youth with a small red pattern on his brow.</p><p></p><p>Blood Son Tu!</p><p></p><p>Behind him, over thirty people prostrated themselves respectfully. Among them, seven had eyes as red as blood - they were no longer blood shadows, but blood disciples.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-some people were all True King Celestial Lord powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Surrendering to this blood son was your wise choice. Now your task is for each of you to blood sacrifice at least ten million martial artists.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever completes the task first will be this blood son's number one blood disciple. When this blood son advances to blood spirit, they will be a blood son candidate."</p><p></p><p>Here is my full translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Remember, your time is limited. This Blood Child needs to obtain sufficient essence blood in an extremely short time to advance to Blood Spirit.</p><p></p><p>"Once this Blood Child advances to Blood Spirit, you will all be greatly meritorious."</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu spoke in a gentle tone, as if talking about a very ordinary matter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!" </p><p></p><p>Over thirty True King Celestial Venerable respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, go then!"</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu waved his hand, and a small bottle appeared in front of each person. The crimson bottles emitted a bloody aura, and their mouths seemed to have a suction force that could devour essence blood.</p><p></p><p>Blood Refining Bottles! Watching the figures depart one after another, Blood Child Tu revealed a gentle smile. Standing atop a tall building, he looked down at this deathly silent great city with an expression of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally taken this step. Next is to become a Blood Spirit. As long as I succeed, I will be a great contributor to the Netherworld Prison. </p><p></p><p>"I will surely gain the recognition of the Blood Lord and be accepted as his disciple. Only by becoming the heir of the Blood Path can I escape the lowly status of a servant."</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of blood slaves and blood disciples, Blood Children were lofty and revered, with high status and powerful strength.</p><p></p><p>However, Blood Child Tu knew that Blood Children were nothing more than servants too, who could be absorbed as nourishment at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming the heir of the Blood Path could one truly escape the status of a servant.</p><p></p><p>"The Taicang Realm truly deserves to be called the number one realm."</p><p></p><p>Blood Child Tu muttered to himself. He was someone with backing, and this trip to the Qinghua Realm was to pave the way for him.</p><p></p><p>To allow him to become the heir of the Blood Path.</p><p></p><p>With Blood Child Tu's order, Qiyun Prefecture immediately fell into great calamity. The True King Celestial Venerables who had submitted became blood disciples and began slaughtering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Sounds of killing and angry curses resounded throughout Qiyun Prefecture. One True King after another fell or fled after suffering heavy injuries.</p><p></p><p>In just a few short days, Qiyun Prefecture became like hell on earth. One city after another became deathly silent, with only faint bloody auras lingering.</p><p></p><p>Xiashan City was a small city in Qiyun Prefecture, considered a rural small town in the entire Great Yue Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>Since Xiashan City was not near the Netherworld Prison Heavenly Pit, it had always been relatively peaceful, and its overall strength was not considered strong.</p><p></p><p>The strongest person was only a Late Stage Condensed Law Celestial Venerable who had participated in the great battle at the Netherworld Prison Heavenly Pit.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he had considerable prestige in Xiashan City, and even the city lord respected him.</p><p></p><p>The changes in Qiyun Prefecture had not yet reached here, as it was a small city where news traveled slowly.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the gates of Xiashan City, a young man was leaning against the city wall as if just waking from a drunken stupor, opening his bleary eyes.</p><p></p><p>"It's evening again? I can see the beautiful scenery of Xiashan again."</p><p></p><p>Muttering to himself, he forcibly roused his spirits, lifted his head, yawned, and stared at the mountain peak outside Xiashan City.</p><p></p><p>The setting sun cast its light, turning the mountain peak a brilliant red. This was how Xiashan (Rosy Mountain) got its name.</p><p></p><p>A martial artist hurriedly rushed into Xiashan City, his eyes full of panic. Soon after, news spread throughout Xiashan City.</p><p></p><p>A great calamity had befallen Qiyun Prefecture. A Blood Child had been born in Qiyun Prefecture, and the True King Celestial Venerables who had submitted to Blood Child Tu were slaughtering and blood sacrificing martial artists everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Xiashan City was shaken, filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>"Leave Qiyun Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>A loud shout rang out. It was the voice of Tang Qian, the strongest person in Xiashan City. With his prestige, and having participated in the battle to suppress the Heavenly Pit, his shout seemed to give the people of Xiashan City someone to rally around.</p><p></p><p>They all began preparing to flee Qiyun Prefecture, hoping to escape before disaster struck. They only hoped that Xiashan City, being small, would not attract attention and could escape smoothly.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late."</p><p></p><p>The listless young man sitting at the foot of the city wall muttered.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful aura descended, and blood light shone down as a True King arrived.</p><p></p><p>"True King Shan, it's you? Why have you...?" </p><p></p><p>Tang Qian's voice rang out in disbelief.</p><p></p><p>True King Shan, one of the ten True King Celestial Venerables of Qiyun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He had actually submitted to Blood Child Tu!</p><p></p><p>True King Shan's face was expressionless as he looked at Tang Qian and said, "Considering you once served under me, I'll spare your life. Submit and become a blood slave under my command!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Qian's eyes suddenly turned blood-red as he roared angrily, "Shan you dog, if you want to be the Netherworld Prison's dog, don't drag me into it! I, Tang Qian, would rather die than commit such betrayal.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to blood sacrifice Xiashan City, kill me first!"</p><p></p><p>Tang Qian roared, his aura erupting. In an instant, he used his ultimate secret technique and charged at True King Shan.</p><p></p><p>He knew he would die, but he was not afraid at all. Tang Qian knew very well that once someone became a blood disciple traitor, they would become bloodthirsty. Xiashan City could not be saved!</p><p></p><p>Puff! Tang Qian died.</p><p></p><p>True King Shan's face remained expressionless as he looked towards Xiashan City, muttering to himself, "After blood sacrificing this place, I'll have reached ten million. I should be the first to complete the task."</p><p></p><p>"Let's fight to the death!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Condensed Law Celestial Venerables in Xiashan City roared and directly burned their essence blood to attack True King Shan.</p><p></p><p>"Don't waste your essence blood like this."</p><p></p><p>True King Shan's face remained expressionless as he raised his hand and suppressed the attacking Condensed Law Celestial Venerables. A small bottle absorbed all their essence blood.</p><p></p><p>"It's your turn now!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at all the terrified, crying, and begging people in the city, True King Shan's expression didn't change at all. Blood light shone forth as the small bottle grew larger, preparing to begin the blood refining.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his body froze, and he looked towards the young man's figure standing up at the foot of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The young man shook his head and even banged it against the city wall. Finally, he even took out a dagger and stabbed it into his own shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain made him go from listless to somewhat focused.</p><p></p><p>Silently taking out a long spear, he looked up at True King Shan and said with a bitter smile, "I thought I had long since lost any sense of compassion and no longer cared about anything. But seeing people going to their deaths, hearing babies crying, children calling out in terror for their parents.</p><p></p><p>"My heart softened. I felt I should take action one last time. After all, I'm already useless. Dying to save a city would be the final value of a useless person, right?"</p><p></p><p>The young man spoke word by word as he ascended into the sky step by step. His long spear radiated light, gathering a sharp killing intent.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, a powerful soul force surged in all directions, as if stirring up a storm.</p><p></p><p>True King Shan looked at him and silently drew his crimson long sword, his expression gradually becoming solemn.</p><p></p><p>"Rumor has it that in the Taikun Realm's Jiang clan, there was once an illegitimate genius whose soul was different from others. He was extremely powerful and was called the youngest True King Celestial Venerable of Taikun.</p><p></p><p>"But unfortunately, such a genius was ruined and even expelled from Taikun, disappearing without a trace since then.</p><p></p><p>"If I'm not mistaken, you are that abandoned son of Taikun, the ruined genius, Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's figure paused slightly, then he revealed a self-mocking expression. "On the verge of death, I can actually still be recognized. A useless person is just a useless person. But no matter how useless I am, I'm still better than a traitor like you.</p><p></p><p>"Today, let this ruined genius have a match with you, one of the ten True King Celestial Venerables of Qiyun Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! A spear thrust forth with unparalleled sharpness, like a cold glint crossing the sky, attacking True King Shan.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

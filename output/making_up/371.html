        <h1>Chapter 371</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>A beam of light shot out from the Ling Guan City, flying through the air towards the Great Yue Country.</p><p></p><p>The closer it got to the Great Yue Country, the more visible the carnage became - blood shadows rampaging, even blood slaves and blood followers slaughtering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>Even more so, they encountered a small city that was being ravaged by blood slaves. Some warriors had even joined the blood shadows in order to survive.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan and the others immediately stepped in, killing the blood shadows and blood slaves they encountered along the way, rescuing the cities in crisis.</p><p></p><p>Wu Tiannan and the others were increasingly alarmed - the chaos in the Divine Realm exceeded their imagination. Even Ning Fa Venerable, an invincible existence in the Spirit Realm, could be in danger of falling at any moment.</p><p></p><p>Ning Fa Venerable was an unrivaled existence in the Spirit Realm, capable of suppressing the entire Spirit Realm. But in the Divine Realm, Ning Fa Venerable was as common as a minor celestial being, not a top-tier powerhouse.</p><p></p><p>The flying ship's speed was not particularly fast, continuously slaughtering blood shadows and occasional Underworld blood slaves encountered along the way.</p><p></p><p>That day, a shocking news from the Qinghua Realm arrived.</p><p></p><p>After eliminating the rampaging blood slaves and blood shadows in a city, a message came from the Qi Yun Prefecture of the Great Yue Country. </p><p></p><p>The Qi Yun Prefecture city had experienced a betrayal by a True King Venerable, and two other True King Venerables had surrendered in desperation! In addition to the two True King Venerables, a group of Qi Yun Prefecture warriors had also surrendered, and the entire prefecture city had been blood sacrificed!</p><p></p><p>The Slaughter Life Blood Refining Cauldron, a Underworld divine artifact, had appeared, sealing off the prefecture city. Combined with the surrendered warriors, they had blood sacrificed the entire prefecture city.</p><p></p><p>This news shook the Qinghua Realm! The Qi Yun Prefecture city was a renowned major city in the entire Qinghua Realm, with many warriors and formidable overall strength. Yet it had been blood sacrificed!</p><p></p><p>The scale of casualties could rank among the top ten disasters in Qinghua Realm's history! With this news spreading, the Great Yue Country, the Wanlei Sect, and the Tianwu Gate were all greatly shaken.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Slaughter Life Blood Refining Cauldron meant that a powerful Underworld blood follower, or even a Blood Master, had infiltrated the Qinghua Realm.</p><p></p><p>If even the Qi Yun Prefecture city had been blood sacrificed, the weaker cities were in constant danger of the same fate.</p><p></p><p>Especially the other cities within the Qi Yun Prefecture, which were now in grave peril.</p><p></p><p>With this news, the Immortal Venerables stationed at the Underworld Celestial Cavern in the Great Yue Country, Tianwu Gate, and Wanlei Sect had all encountered Blood Masters appearing and erupting in great battles, trying to hold them back.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerables confronting the Blood Shadow Pavilion Master were also frantically attacking, wanting to rush to the Qi Yun Prefecture to kill the one who had blood sacrificed the city.</p><p></p><p>"This is bad!" Cheng Zhan's face turned pale on the Qingcheng Pavilion's flying ship.</p><p></p><p>"What's wrong?" Xu Yan frowned and asked.</p><p></p><p>Upon receiving the news of the Qi Yun Prefecture city being blood sacrificed, the flying ship had changed course towards the Qi Yun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Although they were not from the Divine Realm, such a horrifying and brutal act still enraged them.</p><p></p><p>"A Blood Master is about to be born!" Cheng Zhan said with a panicked expression.</p><p></p><p>"The Qi Yun Prefecture city has been blood sacrificed, and the Slaughter Life Blood Refining Cauldron has appeared, so there must be a blood follower trying to ascend to become a Blood Master through this!" Such a massive amount of warrior's essence blood would be enough for the other party to become a Blood Master.</p><p></p><p>"Each Blood Master is an existence comparable to an Immortal Venerable!" </p><p></p><p>Once a Blood Master was born in the Qinghua Realm, it would spell great trouble. If the other party could conceal themselves and could not be killed in time, they could wreak immense havoc.</p><p></p><p>This was a huge hidden danger. </p><p></p><p>They had thought the arrival of an Immortal Venerable would be enough to turn the tide in the Qinghua Realm, but if a Blood Master was born, the situation would continue to deteriorate.</p><p></p><p>They could only wait for reinforcements from the Outer Realms.</p><p></p><p>But the Outer Realms might not have any spare powerhouses to lend aid, as this upheaval was not just affecting the Qinghua Realm!</p><p></p><p>It seemed that external enemies had joined forces to launch a large-scale invasion of the Divine Realm.</p><p></p><p>"Even if a Blood Master is born, there's no need to panic. As long as my master steps in, he can destroy the other party." Xu Yan patted Cheng Zhan's shoulder to comfort him.</p><p></p><p>Cheng Zhan opened his mouth, then sighed. This young man did not understand the true might of the Immortal Venerables.</p><p></p><p>Even among Immortal Venerables, there were differences in strength. But to kill a weaker Immortal Venerable was not an easy task.</p><p></p><p>Let alone this Blood Master, whose strength would definitely not be that of a weak Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>In the history of the Qinghua Realm, the number of fallen Immortal Venerables could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Immortal Venerables were in harmony with Heaven and Earth, sharing the same lifespan. To kill an Immortal Venerable, one must completely destroy the Heaven and Earth they were in harmony with.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, the Immortal Venerable would have a chance to escape.</p><p></p><p>But to destroy such a Heaven and Earth was no easy feat. Especially since that Heaven and Earth was fused with the Venerable's power, requiring an attack power far exceeding that Immortal Venerable.</p><p></p><p>Underworld Blood Masters were not weak, and their Dao was slightly different from the Divine Realm cultivators, making them even harder to kill.</p><p></p><p>Throughout the long history of resisting the Underworld Celestial Cavern, countless blood followers had fallen, but the number of fallen Blood Masters could be counted on one's fingers.</p><p></p><p>Before the flying ship reached the Qi Yun Prefecture, they encountered and eliminated some invading blood slaves in a certain major city. But they then received the latest news from the Qi Yun Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>Just as Cheng Zhan had predicted, a Blood Master had been born - Blood Master Xu!</p><p></p><p>The moment Blood Master Xu appeared, he displayed power rivaling the top Immortal Venerables in the Qinghua Realm, of which there were only three - the Great Yue Emperor, the Wanlei Sect Master, and the Tianwu Sect Master!</p><p></p><p>But these three were unable to leave their posts.</p><p></p><p>The Great Yue Country was in danger!</p><p></p><p>Realizing this, more and more of the Qi Yun Prefecture's strong cultivators defected, with one True King Venerable after another surrendering to Blood Master Xu.</p><p></p><p>Many True King Venerables were also killed in battle.</p><p></p><p>Each surrendering True King Venerable was transformed into an Underworld blood follower by Blood Master Xu wielding an Underworld divine artifact.</p><p></p><p>Their first task after surrendering was to blood sacrifice the Qi Yun Prefecture to collect more essence blood for Blood Master Xu!</p><p></p><p>Due to the slow spread of information, by the time the Qingcheng Pavilion received the news, the Qi Yun Prefecture was likely already a dead land. The prefecture city was now deathly silent, with only a faint aura of blood lingering.</p><p></p><p>At the highest tower of the former city lord's mansion, stood a young man with a pale face and a small red mark on his brow - Blood Master Xu.</p><p></p><p>Behind him, over thirty True King Venerable experts were kneeling in reverence. Seven of them had eyes as red as blood, no longer blood shadows but blood followers.</p><p></p><p>These thirty-plus people were all True King Venerable powerhouses.</p><p></p><p>"Pledging allegiance to me, the Blood Master, was a wise choice. Now your task is for each of you to blood sacrifice at least ten million warriors.</p><p></p><p>"Whoever completes the task first will become my primary blood follower. When I ascend to Blood Spirit, you will be a candidate for Blood Master."</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Remember, your time is limited, and I, the Blood Child, need to obtain enough spiritual blood in a very short time to advance to the Blood Spirit realm.</p><p></p><p>"Once I ascend to the Blood Spirit realm, you will all be great contributors."</p><p></p><p>The Blood Child spoke softly, as if discussing a common matter.</p><p></p><p>"Yes, my lord!" </p><p></p><p>Over thirty Venerable True Kings respectfully responded.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, go!" </p><p></p><p>The Blood Child waved his hand, and a small crimson bottle appeared before each person, emanating a blood aura. The bottle mouths seemed to have a suction force that could devour spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>Blood Refining Bottles! Watching the figures depart, the Blood Child revealed a gentle smile, standing atop the tall building and overlooking the desolate city with an expression of enjoyment.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally taken this step. Next, I will become a Blood Spirit. As long as I succeed, I will be a great contributor to the Underworld.</p><p></p><p>"I will surely earn the appreciation of the Blood Lord and be accepted as his disciple. Only by becoming an inheritor of the Blood Dao can I shed my lowly servant identity."</p><p></p><p>In the eyes of the Blood Slaves and Blood Disciples, the Blood Child stood high above, with an exalted status and formidable strength.</p><p></p><p>However, the Blood Child knew that he was still just a servant, who could be absorbed as nourishment at any time.</p><p></p><p>Only by becoming an inheritor of the Blood Dao could he truly escape the identity of a servant.</p><p></p><p>"The Heavens and Earth are truly the first realm." </p><p></p><p>The Blood Child murmured to himself. He was a person with a powerful backer, and this trip to the Qinghua Realm was to pave the way for him to become an inheritor of the Blood Dao.</p><p></p><p>At the Blood Child's command, the Qiyu Prefecture immediately fell into great calamity. The True Kings who had pledged allegiance became Blood Disciples, rampaging and slaughtering everywhere.</p><p></p><p>The sounds of fighting and cursing echoed throughout the Qiyu Prefecture. One True King after another perished or fled in grave injury. </p><p></p><p>In just a few days, the Qiyu Prefecture had become a living hell, with one city after another turning into desolate wastelands, only faint blood auras lingering around.</p><p></p><p>Xia Mountain City, located in the Qiyu Prefecture, was a small city, and within the entire Great Yue Kingdom, it was considered a rural town.</p><p></p><p>Since Xia Mountain City was not near the Underworld Citadel, it had always been relatively peaceful, and its overall strength was not particularly strong.</p><p></p><p>The strongest figure was only a Condensed Dao Venerable who had once participated in the great battle of the Underworld Citadel, and he had only reached the late Condensed Dao realm.</p><p></p><p>Even so, he was highly respected in Xia Mountain City, and even the City Lord would show him deference.</p><p></p><p>The changes in the Qiyu Prefecture had not yet reached this place, as it was a small city, and news traveled slowly.</p><p></p><p>Not far from the gates of Xia Mountain City, a young man was leaning against the city wall, as if just waking up from a drunken stupor, his eyes hazy.</p><p></p><p>"It's evening again? I can see the beautiful scenery of Xia Mountain again."</p><p></p><p>He muttered to himself, then forcefully roused his spirit, lifting his head and yawning as he gazed at the mountain peak outside Xia Mountain City.</p><p></p><p>The setting sun cast a crimson glow on the mountain, giving Xia Mountain its name.</p><p></p><p>A warrior rushed into Xia Mountain City, his eyes filled with panic, and soon the news spread throughout the city.</p><p></p><p>A great calamity had befallen the Qiyu Prefecture, a Blood Child had been born, and the True Kings who had pledged allegiance to the Blood Child were rampaging and performing blood sacrifices.</p><p></p><p>Xia Mountain City was shaken, filled with panic.</p><p></p><p>"Flee the Qiyu Prefecture!" </p><p></p><p>A loud shout rang out, belonging to Xia Mountain City's strongest, Tangqian. With his reputation and his participation in the suppression of the Underworld Citadel, his voice seemed to provide a backbone for the people of Xia Mountain City. </p><p></p><p>They began preparing to flee the Qiyu Prefecture, hoping that the small city of Xia Mountain would not attract attention and they could escape safely before the disaster struck.</p><p></p><p>"It's too late."</p><p></p><p>The listless young man sitting at the base of the city wall murmured.</p><p></p><p>Boom! A powerful aura descended, and a blood-red light shone. A True King had arrived.</p><p></p><p>"Mountain True King, is that you? Why?" </p><p></p><p>Tangqian's disbelieving voice rang out.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain True King, one of the ten True Kings of the Qiyu Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>He had actually pledged allegiance to the Blood Child!</p><p></p><p>The Mountain True King's expression was blank as he looked at Tangqian and said, "Considering that you once served under me, I'll spare your life. Surrender and become my Blood Slave!"</p><p></p><p>Tangqian's eyes suddenly turned blood-red, and he roared, "Mountain dog, if you want to become the Underworld's dog, don't drag me into it! I, Tangqian, would rather die than commit an act of betrayal!"</p><p></p><p>Tangqian's aura surged as he immediately unleashed his trump card secret technique, charging towards the Mountain True King.</p><p></p><p>He knew he would die, but he was not afraid. Tangqian was well aware that once someone became a traitorous Blood Disciple, they would be driven to slaughter, and Xia Mountain City would not be spared.</p><p></p><p>Poof! Tangqian died.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain True King's expression remained indifferent as he looked towards Xia Mountain City and muttered, "With the blood sacrifice here, I should be the first to complete the task of obtaining one million spiritual blood."</p><p></p><p>"I'll give it a try!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the Condensed Dao Venerables in Xia Mountain City roared and ignited their spiritual blood, charging towards the Mountain True King.</p><p></p><p>"Your spiritual blood shouldn't be wasted like this."</p><p></p><p>The Mountain True King's expression did not change as he raised his hand, suppressing the attacking Condensed Dao Venerables, and a small bottle absorbed all their spiritual blood.</p><p></p><p>"Now it's your turn!"</p><p></p><p>Gazing at the terrified, wailing, and pleading people in the city, the Mountain True King's expression remained unchanged as the blood light shone, and the small bottle grew larger, preparing to perform the blood refinement.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, his figure paused, and he looked towards the young man at the base of the city wall.</p><p></p><p>The young man was shaking his head, then banged his head against the city wall, and even took out a dagger to stab his own shoulder.</p><p></p><p>The intense pain caused him to become more focused and alert.</p><p></p><p>He silently took out a long spear and looked up at the Mountain True King, letting out a bitter smile.</p><p></p><p>"I thought I had lost all compassion and no longer cared about anything, but seeing people rushing to their deaths, hearing the cries of infants and the fearful calls of children for their parents, my heart softened. I feel I should make one last effort, since I'm already a waste. At least dying to save a city would give my worthless life some final value."</p><p></p><p>The young man spoke slowly, step by step ascending towards the sky, and the long spear shone with a fierce killing intent as a powerful spiritual force surged and swept through the area like a storm.</p><p></p><p>The Mountain True King looked at him and silently drew out a crimson long sword, his expression gradually becoming more grave.</p><p></p><p>"There are rumors that the Jian Clan of the Taikun Realm once had a bastard prodigy whose spiritual force was extraordinary and who became the youngest True King Venerable in Taikun. Sadly, this talented genius was ruined and expelled from Taikun, disappearing without a trace since then.</p><p></p><p>"As I suspected, you are that discarded talent of Taikun, the ruined genius, Jiang Bupingl"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Bupingl's figure paused slightly, then he revealed a self-mocking expression. "Even at the moment of my death, I'm still recognized. I may be a waste, but I'm still stronger than you, the traitor.</p><p></p><p>"Today, let this discarded genius of Taikun meet you, one of the ten True Kings of the Qiyu Prefecture!"</p><p></p><p>Boom! A spear strike of unparalleled ferocity, like a cold gleam, pierced through the sky, charging towards the Mountain True King.</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

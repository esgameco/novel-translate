        <h1>Chapter 125</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has killed a sect master in the inner realm with a single palm strike, consecutively killing sect masters. You have obtained a divine martial art technique, a one-hit kill!"</p><p></p><p>Divine martial art technique!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited, his disciple was truly impressive.</p><p></p><p>Killing a sect master with a single palm strike, and also obtaining a powerful martial art technique as a reward.</p><p></p><p>And what is this, a divine martial art technique?! "Finally, there is another technique, not just a copy of my disciple's martial arts."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was overjoyed.</p><p></p><p>A one-hit kill, the divine martial art technique, he had already grasped it.</p><p></p><p>This was an extremely powerful cultivation method. No matter how bizarre the opponent's movements, how fast their speed, or how elusive they were, as long as he struck, the opponent would be unable to evade, apart from forcibly withstanding the attack, there was no other way.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, when the one-hit kill was unleashed, its power would instantly increase threefold. Unless the opponent's strength was more than three times his own, they would be absolutely unable to withstand it.</p><p></p><p>"No wonder it is called a divine martial art technique, a threefold increase in power for a one-hit kill, and the opponent cannot dodge, they can only forcibly receive the attack. Without three times the strength, they will be utterly defeated."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited. This was truly a divine martial art technique, able to defeat opponents stronger than oneself, as long as they were not more than three times stronger, a one-hit kill!</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even if I encounter cultivators above the Grand Master realm, as long as I unleash the one-hit kill, I should be able to instantly annihilate them."</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Li Xuan became even more excited, his sense of security greatly increased. "Xu Yan is truly remarkable, the pioneer of my martial dao undertaking, I rely entirely on him for my invincible path."</p><p></p><p>Among his three disciples, Li Xuan valued Xu Yan the most, as the eldest disciple was the core of his martial dao undertaking.</p><p></p><p>"I must quickly compile the realms above the Penetrating Mystery Realm, establish the theoretical framework, so that when Xu Yan returns from the inner realm, I can pass on the cultivation methods above the Penetrating Mystery Realm to him.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's prodigious talent, after his experiences in the inner realm, mastering the cultivation methods of the Penetrating Mystery Realm should be no problem."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>He glanced at Su Ling Xiu who was currently cultivating. She would most likely be stuck at the point of refining the Evergreen Bone, and how to break through to forge the Evergreen Bone, she could only rely on herself. Although Su Ling Xiu had created the formula for the Evergreen Pill to refine the Evergreen Bone, she lacked the spiritual herbs required, and only had one Spiritual Grass, so the effect was unknown.</p><p></p><p>"This girl seems to have a special physique, so her cultivation is so fast. Refining the Evergreen Bone should not be a problem, it will just take some time."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two knew that after Meng Chong's breakthrough, it would not be long before he went to the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, he seized this opportunity to find Meng Chong to learn some powerful sword techniques, so that he would not lose face when facing cultivators from the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>In the following days, there was no more feedback from the golden light, Li Xuan was both relieved and slightly disappointed. Had Xu Yan stopped provoking sect masters? Or had the sect masters stopped provoking Xu Yan? It was a pity that there were no more sect masters coming to be killed by Xu Yan, so he could not obtain any more feedback.</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, the golden light appeared again.</p><p></p><p>"Your disciple Xu Yan has engaged in a fierce battle with a Half-Step Grand Master, and has successfully comprehended a sword art technique, the Sword Cry of the Mountains and Rivers, mastering the Sword Cry of the Mountains and Rivers."</p><p></p><p>Sword art technique!</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was astonished, Xu Yan had actually fought against a Half-Step Grand Master. What had Xu Yan done?</p><p></p><p>Was he about to fight against a Grand Master next?</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, he couldn't help but feel a little worried. Although Xu Yan's strength was monstrous, he was still only at the initial stage of the Innate Realm, ultimately unable to match the might of a Grand Master.</p><p></p><p>"With Xu Yan's speed, even if he is no match, he should be able to escape without a problem. Moreover, he will soon be able to break through to the advanced stage of the Innate Realm, at which point Grand Masters will no longer be a concern."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan let out a sigh of relief. The sword art technique, the Sword Cry of the Mountains and Rivers, this was true sword dao, transcending the realm of mere sword techniques.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had created this based on the foundation of sword intent.</p><p></p><p>"In a sense, Xu Yan has truly entered the path of the sword dao now."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed with admiration.</p><p></p><p>The Sword Cry of the Mountains and Rivers was extremely powerful, and its might would continue to grow with the increase in cultivation. This was a sword dao that would not be obsolete as one's strength increased.</p><p></p><p>"His strength has increased again."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly excited in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Three days later, Meng Chong returned.</p><p></p><p>He had completely consolidated his realm, his powerful aura fully suppressed, although he still appeared burly and fierce, at least the aura of savagery was no longer exposed.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I am going to the inner realm."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong knelt down and kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Mm, the words I needed to say, I have already said to your elder brother when he left. I will not repeat them."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Your teachings, disciple will remember them in my heart!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong respectfully kowtowed.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu sighed in her heart, both her elder brothers were about to leave the Borderlands and venture into the inner realm.</p><p></p><p>When would she be able to return to the inner realm? Was the Innate Realm sufficient?</p><p></p><p>"Sister, don't worry, second brother will definitely help you collect spiritual herbs. Just focus on your cultivation."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong patted his chest confidently.</p><p></p><p>"Second brother, just do your best, don't get involved in dangerous situations for the sake of the spiritual herbs."</p><p></p><p>Su Ling Xiu said gratefully.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I know my limits!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong nodded.</p><p></p><p>"Stone Two, I will pass on the sword techniques to you. As long as you can learn about 60% of them, you will be a strong cultivator among your peers."</p><p></p><p>He looked at Stone Two and instructed.</p><p></p><p>"Don't worry, I will definitely work hard to cultivate them, I won't embarrass myself."</p><p></p><p>Stone Two solemnly nodded.</p><p></p><p>He raised his hand and handed a small package to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"In half a year, or a year, I will return."</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong tucked the package into his bosom, rose into the air, and disappeared into the distance.</p><p></p><p>He did not immediately go to the inner realm, but instead went to the capital of the Wu Kingdom.</p><p></p><p>That previous battle, he had almost died. He wanted to go find the Wu Emperor and get a clear explanation, to see if the Wu Senior had appeared at the instigation of the Wu Emperor.</p><p></p><p>If that was the case, he would not spare the Wu Emperor's gratitude for helping him seek revenge.</p><p></p><p>In the capital of the Wu Kingdom, since the incident with the Wu Senior, things had gradually returned to calm.</p><p></p><p>The ministers went to court as usual, continuing to handle state affairs, the younger generation of the royal family either continued to seek out powerful cultivators, or had gone to the Qi Kingdom to exchange with the scions there, hoping to obtain some martial cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Only the Wu Emperor had a lingering unease in his heart.</p><p></p><p>Since that battle, Meng Chong had not come to settle the score, as if he had disappeared. This made the Wu Emperor very uneasy, it seemed that Meng Chong had been injured too severely and was in seclusion to recover. Once he had healed, he would surely come to demand an explanation.</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor feared the most that Meng Chong would not give him a chance to explain, and just directly attack him.</p><p></p><p>"Wu Emperor!"</p><p></p><p>Sitting listlessly in the imperial study, reviewing memorials, the Wu Emperor suddenly felt a chill in his heart, and even dropped his brush.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had arrived!</p><p></p><p>After some time, the Wu Emperor noticed that Meng Chong seemed even more burly, his bald head even more shiny, the entire person exuding an even more formidable aura.</p><p></p><p>"Meng Chong, let me explain, he was not sent by me!"</p><p></p><p>The Wu Emperor hurriedly opened his mouth with a distressed expression.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, how did it happen?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"What's the matter?" Meng Chong sat down on Wu Huang's chair without any politeness.</p><p></p><p>Wu Huang stood beside him with a panicked expression.</p><p></p><p>"The matter is like this..." </p><p></p><p>Wu Huang did not dare to hide anything and told Meng Chong the whole story from the beginning of Elder Wu's appearance.</p><p></p><p>"I've already had someone send you a message, saying there was a martial arts expert. Didn't you receive it?"</p><p></p><p>Wu Huang looked wronged.</p><p></p><p>"Alright, since this matter has nothing to do with you, I won't trouble you further!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong stood up.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Wu Huang heaved a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was about to leave when he suddenly remembered something and said, "Oh yes, my master is about to transmit the martial arts to the remote wilderness. If you want martial arts cultivation methods, you can send someone to the Xu family in the East River Prefecture."</p><p></p><p>Since it had been decided to transmit the martial arts to the remote wilderness, the Wu Kingdom naturally would not be excluded. It's just that Qi Huang and the others were cultivating in secret, wanting to accumulate enough strength before gradually spreading it.</p><p></p><p>In that case, the Wu Kingdom should also have martial arts cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Wu Huang was overjoyed, "Thank you, thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong turned and left.</p><p></p><p>Wu Huang was extremely excited, and began to secretly leave the palace to go to the East River Prefecture of the Qi Kingdom, personally going to the Xu family to ask for the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>The mysterious voice in the stone house seemed to have lost its mind and could not obtain the cultivation methods.</p><p></p><p>Since there was a new way to obtain them, Wu Huang naturally would not continue to wait.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong left the capital of the Wu Kingdom and directly entered the boundless mountains, exploring along the place where Elder Wu had appeared before.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he found nothing.</p><p></p><p>In the small courtyard in Cloud Mountain County, Li Xuan sat on a chair, sighing wistfully. His second disciple had also gone out to make his way, leaving only the third disciple by his side.</p><p></p><p>"Scarlet Cat, do you remember the acupoints?"</p><p></p><p>He used a bamboo cane to point at the acupoints on Scarlet Cat's body, asking cheerfully.</p><p></p><p>Bored, he teased the big cat.</p><p></p><p>Roar! Scarlet Cat let out a low roar, seemingly telling Li Xuan that it remembered the acupoints.</p><p></p><p>"You need to open your acupoints. I think you should open this acupoint first. Once this acupoint is opened, perhaps your spiritual wisdom will be enhanced, and you'll become smarter."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled and used the bamboo cane to tap on Scarlet Cat's head.</p><p></p><p>"Roar!"</p><p></p><p>Scarlet Cat roared, seeming to be deep in thought.</p><p></p><p>"Master, it's just a beast. How could it possibly comprehend the great demonic techniques?" Stone Two couldn't help but speak up.</p><p></p><p>If Scarlet Cat really could comprehend the great demonic techniques, he would doubt his own talents, as his abilities would be inferior even to a beast.</p><p></p><p>"That's not necessarily the case. After all, it's a fierce beast, its intelligence is much higher than ordinary livestock. And the fact that I was able to capture Scarlet Cat also means there may be a chance." </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan chuckled.</p><p></p><p>Stone Two began to ponder.</p><p></p><p>"Scarlet Cat, could it really comprehend the great demonic techniques? If it does, won't its strength surpass mine?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking about this, Stone Two became a bit unsettled.</p><p></p><p>When Scarlet Cat was first captured, he had whipped it in order to tame it. If Scarlet Cat became powerful, wouldn't it retaliate?</p><p></p><p>"I must indoctrinate Scarlet Cat while its intelligence is still undeveloped. The whipping back then was for its own good, to help it open its wisdom. Its ability to comprehend the great demonic techniques is related to that."</p><p></p><p>Stone Two thought to himself, having come up with a plan.</p><p></p><p>From that day on, Stone Two would mention three times a day, morning, noon and night, in front of Scarlet Cat, that the whipping back then was for its own good, and it should be grateful.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Li Xuan looked at him strangely. This guy's brain had become more agile.</p><p></p><p>To make Scarlet Cat believe him, Stone Two even made a large thick gold chain and put it around Scarlet Cat's neck, murmuring that this gold chain was valuable.</p><p></p><p>Scarlet Cat also seemed very excited, apparently liking the gold chain.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan looked towards the inner domain direction. Meng Chong should have already entered the inner domain.</p><p></p><p>"When Xu Yan entered the inner domain, he immediately killed a sect master. Meng Chong surely won't do the same, right? With his burly and powerful physique, ordinary martial artists wouldn't dare provoke him."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan thought about it, feeling a little regretful. If Meng Chong could punch and destroy a sect master, killing a few sect masters, would that also feedback his own martial arts techniques?</p><p></p><p>"Can't ask for too much. Whether it's from the mouths of Xie Lingfeng and Hu Shan, or from Su Lingxiu, there aren't many sect masters in the inner domain, and they can't be seen whenever one wants."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, took out an ancient leather book, and began to study the profound mysteries within again.</p><p></p><p>At the same time, he continued to ponder the cultivation methods beyond the Penetration of Mysteries.</p><p></p><p>In Iron Mountain County, it was the same as always.</p><p></p><p>People were constantly coming in and out of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion, mostly martial artists, gritting their teeth as they entered, their faces full of pain as they left.</p><p></p><p>Apart from martial artists, there were also occasional ordinary people who entered, leaving with cultivation methods in hand.</p><p></p><p>The welcoming maidservant at the entrance of the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion suddenly saw a tall and burly young man with a bald head, his face full of curiosity, looking around left and right, unable to hide his excitement and curiosity.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant immediately recognized that this was a young man just venturing out from the countryside. The Iron Barrier Mountain was not far from Iron Mountain County, and the young men from the mountain villages were coming to the city for the first time.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please come in!" </p><p></p><p>The maidservant smiled and gestured for him to enter.</p><p></p><p>"Okay, okay!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong was extremely excited. This was the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Inside, there were many spiritual herbs, and there were even storage bags, those precious treasures, for sale.</p><p></p><p>Upon entering the inner domain for the first time, Meng Chong's first task was to come to the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion and take a look around.</p><p></p><p>"I wonder if my senior brother has already left Iron Mountain County? Has he gone to Blue Peace Prefecture?"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong thought to himself.</p><p></p><p>He had decided that his next destination would be Blue Peace Prefecture.</p><p></p><p>The maidservant who had welcomed Xu Yan before smiled and approached, "Young master, this way please."</p><p></p><p>Although Meng Chong was tall, burly and powerful, and his bald head made him stand out, his facial features were regular, and he was just a sixteen or seventeen-year-old young man.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, please take a look, this is the inventory list of the first floor of our Heavenly Treasure Pavilion."</p><p></p><p>The maidservant expertly handed the inventory list to Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>"Thank you!"</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong excitedly opened it and flipped through page by page, marveling in his heart. No wonder his junior sister praised the Heavenly Treasure Pavilion so highly. Just on this first floor, there were so many spiritual herbs for sale.</p><p></p><p>There were also spiritual artifacts, martial arts cultivation methods, prepared elixirs, pills, and so on.</p><p></p><p>"Young master, have you seen anything you like?"</p><p></p><p>The maidservant asked with a smile.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong smiled broadly, scratched his head, and asked, "Do you have any storage bags here? Let me take a look!"</p><p></p><p>He and Xu Yan shared the same thought - they couldn't afford to buy, but at least they could take a look, right?</p><p></p><p>The maidservant's smile stiffened a bit. She didn't know why, but she was reminded of that young man from not long ago, who had also asked about the storage bags right away.</p><p></p><p>Eyeing Meng Chong suspiciously, she suspected that these two young men might be from the same village.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

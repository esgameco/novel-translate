        <h1>Chapter 17</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 17 Five Transformations, the Golden Bone in Sight</p><p></p><p>In the secret chamber, Xu Yan took a stable stance and began to refine his bones.</p><p></p><p>As the cultivation technique operated, his qi and blood boiled, his body warming up, and his qi and blood started to continuously grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood dragon coiled around his skeleton also appeared more massive, and its refining power was stronger as it circulated around his bones.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the Crimson-Eyed Tiger is the king of tigers, containing a massive qi and blood!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan operated his qi and blood and began to temper them.</p><p></p><p>"The tempering speed has increased significantly!"</p><p></p><p>With the circulation of qi and blood, the internal and external merging, and continuous refinement, the copper bones started to emit a faint golden color.</p><p></p><p>This was a sign of the transformation towards golden bones!</p><p></p><p>"Once the nourishing medicine concocted from the Crimson-Eyed Tiger is ready, the bone refining speed will increase even further!"</p><p></p><p>"At the current speed, I can complete the first transformation in five days at the latest!"</p><p></p><p>Refining golden bones requires going through nine transformations to reach perfection.</p><p></p><p>"I can even go faster. The cultivation technique I've comprehended may not be complete, so I should continue to delve deeper into it!"</p><p></p><p>"Only by doing so can I accelerate the tempering of the golden bones!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's gaze was resolute as he entered the state of forgetting the self and the object. He continued to ponder the cultivation technique while tempering his bones.</p><p></p><p>The next day, Xu Yan obtained the nourishing medicine concocted by Physician Pan, as well as the processed tiger skin, and returned to the secret chamber to cultivate.</p><p></p><p>"Indeed, the refining speed is even faster now!"</p><p></p><p>"I must purchase more precious medicines and more tonics to strengthen my qi and blood!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited, and according to the current refining speed, he might be able to complete the first golden bone transformation in a day and a half.</p><p></p><p>After the cultivation session, he found the manager of the Xu Family's business and instructed him to go and purchase precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>"Money doesn't just blow in with the wind. What are you buying so many precious medicines for?" </p><p></p><p>During lunchtime, Xu Junhe caught Xu Yan and scolded him.</p><p></p><p>"The medicine storage in our house has been almost depleted by you. Where did that nine-leaf primordial herb go? Where did the thousand-year mountain ginseng go?</p><p></p><p>"You are a spendthrift! Are you trying to make your father sick with worry?</p><p></p><p>"Where in the world can one find so many precious medicines? If you send people to purchase them, the news will spread, and others will raise the prices. If they know it's you, a foolish young man, who wants to buy them, they'll definitely take advantage and hike up the prices."</p><p></p><p>Being scolded was not a rare occurrence, and Xu Yan knew that his actions would bring some losses to the family. However, with the prospect of martial dao in sight, no matter how great the cost, he must pay it!</p><p></p><p>It was just a matter of some financial loss.</p><p></p><p>As long as he could enter the martial dao and truly become a disciple of a master, what did a bit of money matter?</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at his mother with a pleading gaze.</p><p></p><p>"Mother!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe's face turned green with anger and he sternly said, "Don't always look to your mother. I'm the one who decides this matter!"</p><p></p><p>"Why are you shouting so loudly? You're scaring Yan'er!" </p><p></p><p>Seeing her beloved son's pleading gaze, Xu Yan's mother immediately softened.</p><p></p><p>She glared at her husband disapprovingly.</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe almost coughed up a mouthful of old blood.</p><p></p><p>"My dear wife, you can't..."</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan's mother frowned and said, "Husband, it's just a bit of money. If Yan'er likes it, then it's fine. Surely our family can afford this, can't we?"</p><p></p><p>"Of course not! This small amount of money is nothing."</p><p></p><p>"Then that's settled. Are you only concerned about money? That's our son, after all!"</p><p></p><p>"I..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe deflated.</p><p></p><p>"Mother is the best!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan grinned.</p><p></p><p>Xu Junhe puffed out his cheeks and glared, but could only tacitly agree to Xu Yan's high-priced purchase of precious medicines.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"The first golden bone transformation is about to be completed!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that the qi and blood dragon coiled around his skeleton, and the qi and blood that had permeated into his bones had already nourished his bone marrow.</p><p></p><p>A tingling sensation came, and at a certain moment, there was a rumbling sound as the qi and blood dragon surged into the bones, entering the bone marrow.</p><p></p><p>In an instant, Xu Yan felt a massive qi and blood surge out, and his entire body seemed to be in a state of sublimation, as if his blood had been reborn, and his whole being was elevated.</p><p></p><p>The qi...</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>New blood is born, old blood is expelled.</p><p></p><p>The first metamorphosis of the golden bones!</p><p></p><p>As the qi and blood became stronger, all over the body, it was as if sweat was pouring out, a layer of sticky, dark purple old blood emerged.</p><p></p><p>At a certain moment, the whole body suddenly felt light, and the bones throughout the body turned into a pale golden color.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan felt that he had become more powerful.</p><p></p><p>If he were to go and kill the Crimson-Eyed Tiger now, a single punch could crush its head!</p><p></p><p>"Is this the golden bones?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan clenched his fist, his whole body filled with power, his qi and blood had more than doubled in strength.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he felt that his current qi and blood were purer and more powerful!</p><p></p><p>"Nine metamorphoses, the golden bones are complete, how powerful will I be then!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with anticipation.</p><p></p><p>"My body is so dirty, I should go wash, is this considered a blood change? Expelling the impurities in the qi and blood, making the qi and blood purer? Such a foundation in the Dao, will be more solid and pure.</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps the ancient prodigies that my master spoke of, were precisely because of their purity!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Xu Yan had some enlightenment.</p><p></p><p>"It's not just the purity of qi and blood, but also the purity of the heart of the Dao, a clear and pure state of mind!"</p><p></p><p>"I am not far from becoming an ancient prodigy!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan came out of the secret room, changed his clothes, and washed off the polluted blood on his body.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>On the twelfth day after returning to the Xu family.</p><p></p><p>In the secret room, a layer of faint red polluted blood seeped out of Xu Yan's body, like sweat.</p><p></p><p>"This is the fifth metamorphosis!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's eyes shone with excitement, these days, relying on the restorative medicine refined from the Crimson-Eyed Tiger, as well as another enlightenment of the cultivation technique, the tempering speed had once again increased.</p><p></p><p>Now it was the fifth metamorphosis.</p><p></p><p>The bones throughout his body had already turned golden.</p><p></p><p>The nine metamorphoses to truly temper the golden bones were not far away.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, after the fifth metamorphosis, there was no more polluted blood being expelled from his body.</p><p></p><p>The qi and blood were now almost completely pure!</p><p></p><p>"With my current strength, even the top masters in the jianghu today, I can kill them with a single punch!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited.</p><p></p><p>Based on his current knowledge, the martial arts masters in the jianghu today were all too fragile to him.</p><p></p><p>A single punch could kill them!</p><p></p><p>Even those renowned powerful experts were the same.</p><p></p><p>"I must not be arrogant, I must be cautious and composed, there must be other powerful martial artists in this world, they are just hidden very deep, perhaps they do not reveal their whereabouts in the mundane world!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reminded himself in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow I should go back."</p><p></p><p>This time, he had purchased some precious medicines, as well as the medicine refined from the Crimson-Eyed Tiger, which had not been used up yet. If he could gain further enlightenment of the cultivation technique, the tempering speed should be able to increase even more.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked out of the secret room, preparing for his return to the small mountain village tomorrow.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"Tomorrow will be half a month, my foolish disciple should be coming back, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan stood on the hillside, sighing with emotion.</p><p></p><p>Since his foolish disciple left, he had to do everything himself, his days were not as leisurely.</p><p></p><p>"The fierce tigers and beasts in the Evil Demon Forest, should have been killed, right?</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the prerequisite is that my foolish disciple was able to leave safely, and did not perish in the Evil Demon Forest."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan still had some worries in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"I don't know why, but I feel like my body has become a bit stronger."</p><p></p><p>"Is the effect of the precious medicines really that strong?"</p><p></p><p>In the past half month, Li Xuan felt that his body had become more robust again, and his strength had also increased.</p><p></p><p>He once suspected that he had some hidden cheat.</p><p></p><p>But in the end, he concluded that it was simply the effect of the precious medicines brought by Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>He sighed inwardly, the nourishing power of the precious medicines in this world is truly remarkable.</p><p></p><p>(End of this chapter)</p>

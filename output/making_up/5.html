        <h1>Chapter 5</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Chapter 5 - Mastering Skin Refinement (Seeking Continued Readership)</p><p></p><p>It had been over half a month since Li Xuan accepted Xu Yan as his disciple and imparted the fabricated cultivation technique to him.</p><p></p><p>These past few weeks had been the most carefree days Li Xuan had experienced since his transmigration. Every day, he had a disciple attending to him, not needing to cook for himself or tend to the chickens and vegetable garden.</p><p></p><p>Every day, he would either sleep or wander around the village, or just lie leisurely in a chair.</p><p></p><p>The nine-leaf spirit ginseng was down to its last piece, which would be consumed today.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed, the nine-leaf spirit ginseng was indeed a rare and precious medicinal herb, its effects were truly remarkable. Over the past half month, he could clearly feel the changes in his body - his spirit was better, his eyesight improved, his body became much stronger, and his strength increased as well.</p><p></p><p>"Should I cook the thousand-year-old ginseng tomorrow? Won't that be too nourishing?" Li Xuan muttered to himself as he lay in the chair.</p><p></p><p>"The thousand-year-old ginseng is different, should I keep it in reserve instead?"</p><p></p><p>He turned his head to glance at Xu Yan, who was practicing horse stance cultivation, feeling somewhat puzzled.</p><p></p><p>"It's been half a month already, how is he able to remain so calm and patient? This unruffled and steady temperament is not bad, but it's a pity his brain doesn't work very well."</p><p></p><p>"It's actually better this way, the more steadfast his temperament, the more beneficial it is for me... But it's been half a month already, and he hasn't cultivated anything, nor does he have any questions?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was greatly surprised.</p><p></p><p>"I'll ask him if he has any questions during mealtime, fulfilling my duty as a master."</p><p></p><p>"Let me think about how to fabricate some plausible explanations, how to comfort Xu Yan, and how to encourage him to persist..."</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"I've finally mastered skin refinement!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who was in the midst of cultivation, suddenly felt a surge of qi and blood, his skin tightening and then loosening. In that moment, he sensed a significant breakthrough.</p><p></p><p>Skin refinement had been mastered!</p><p></p><p>"My master was right, cultivation cannot be rushed, it requires a balance of work and rest."</p><p></p><p>"Every day, I take time to cook, feed the chickens, and tend to the vegetable garden, even catching wild game for extra meals. Although it seems to reduce my cultivation time, the ebb and flow has led to a completely different state of mind, allowing my cultivation to progress even faster and more effortlessly!"</p><p></p><p>"My master's realm of attainment is truly extraordinary!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with admiration.</p><p></p><p>His master was undoubtedly a hidden supreme expert, every word and action, every small guidance, had been tremendously beneficial to him.</p><p></p><p>Glancing at the reclining Li Xuan, Xu Yan's eyes reflected reverence and aspiration.</p><p></p><p>"When will I be able to reach my master's realm? He may seem ordinary and unassuming, but that is the true mark of a great cultivator."</p><p></p><p>"Perhaps this is what my master once referred to as returning to the original and approaching the Dao?"</p><p></p><p>"I must not be overly ambitious, I need to stay grounded and steadfast. One day, I will become a powerful expert like my master!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued to fantasize and encourage himself.</p><p></p><p>"In less than 20 days, I've already mastered skin refinement, and I'm only a step away from completion. At most, it will take me three to five days to finish skin refinement and then begin bone refinement."</p><p></p><p>"After completing skin refinement, I'll ask my master about the intricacies of bone refinement."</p><p></p><p>"My master said that ancient prodigies could complete skin refinement in five days. Although I may not be at their level, finishing it in less than a month should still be considered quite good, right?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at the time, it was time to prepare the meal.</p><p></p><p>He ceased his cultivation and went to the chicken coop to catch a chicken, which he then slaughtered and cooked with the last piece of nine-leaf spirit ginseng.</p><p></p><p>As he was killing the chicken, Xu Yan suddenly had a thought.</p><p></p><p>"My master said that after mastering skin refinement, ordinary people's blades and weapons would have difficulty harming me. Let me try a small cut and see."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan gripped the kitchen knife and made a light cut on his arm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>He was a martial artist who had mastered the art of skin refining, so naturally he did not belong to the ranks of ordinary people. When he made that slash, he did not use any internal energy or much force.</p><p></p><p>It was just the strength of an ordinary person.</p><p></p><p>The blade slid across his arm, leaving only a faint white mark that quickly faded back to normal!</p><p></p><p>"Is this the defensive power of one who has mastered skin refining?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was greatly excited. Although he did not use much force with that strike, he could easily slice open a chicken's belly. For an ordinary person, a single slash would tear the flesh and cut to the bone.</p><p></p><p>Yet, it could not leave even the slightest mark on his skin.</p><p></p><p>"Just as my master said, after refining the skin, ordinary blades and swords cannot harm me!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was filled with anticipation for the upcoming bone refining, and even the refining of his internal organs.</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>"These past few days, you have been able to calm your mind, not arrogant or hasty. Your teacher is very pleased," Li Xuan said thoughtfully.</p><p></p><p>"Master, I understand. I must be humble and not arrogant, and keep a calm and steady mind!" Xu Yan responded respectfully.</p><p></p><p>He was relieved in his heart, thinking that he had not been impatient or anxious, and had thus left a good impression on his master.</p><p></p><p>"After cultivating for so long, Xu Yan may seem steady, not hasty or anxious, but he must be anxious inside. I should comfort him a bit, urge him to persist, as things have progressed this far, I can only continue to deceive him," Li Xuan muttered to himself, then spoke aloud, "The path of cultivation requires perseverance, unwavering determination, and steady, solid progress. Seeking quick results is undesirable, you must remember this."</p><p></p><p>"Yes, master, your disciple will surely remember your teachings!" Xu Yan nodded solemnly.</p><p></p><p>But in his heart, he realized: "I have already mastered skin refining, so master must be afraid that I will be impatient and rush into bone refining without a solid foundation."</p><p></p><p>"Even if I have perfected skin refining, I must solidify myself before starting bone refining, not be hasty, so as not to leave a flighty impression on my master."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan reminded himself inwardly not to become arrogant and self-satisfied due to his increased abilities.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan did not know that Xu Yan had already engaged in self-reflection, nor did he know that Xu Yan had not only sensed the flow of his qi and blood, but had already fully mastered skin refining.</p><p></p><p>Seeing Xu Yan so obedient, Li Xuan felt relieved.</p><p></p><p>"This disciple is indeed a sincere person, just not very smart. If he had encountered others, he might have been completely deceived and ruined."</p><p></p><p>"It's a pity I'm not a reclusive immortal, otherwise taking in such a respectful and sensible disciple would be a joy."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>He then spoke again, "Your teacher knows you must have accumulated some questions about your cultivation. I can now provide you with answers."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's spirits lifted, and an excited expression appeared on his face.</p><p></p><p>"Master knows I'm about to start bone refining, so he must have some questions about that. First, he cautioned me not to be hasty, to keep a calm and steady mind, and then he'll explain the details of bone refining to me. Every word of his is full of deep meaning, guiding me."</p><p></p><p>"Master, regarding the method of bone refining, where the qi and blood permeate the bones, constantly refining and tempering them, are there any key points to it? And to what degree must the bone refining be completed?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan asked his questions about bone refining, but Li Xuan was taken aback. He had prepared beforehand what to say about the stage of qi and blood sensing and skin refining, but he had not fabricated any lies about bone refining.</p>

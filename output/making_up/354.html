        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded. These remnant souls, able to survive until now, were certainly not simple.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had been cautious enough to completely destroy the opponent.</p><p></p><p>The fact that such remnant souls existed in the Tiankuyu Ruins meant that someone must have encountered them before, and may even have been bewitched by them.</p><p></p><p>After thoroughly searching the surroundings and confirming there were no omissions, Xu Yan continued his exploration. </p><p></p><p>This Tiankuyu Ruin was not particularly large, but not small either.</p><p></p><p>Carefully exploring bit by bit would still take several days to complete.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he discovered a skull beneath the loose soil. Even more bizarre was that this skull was blood-red, as if it had been soaked in fresh blood.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the skull floated up.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally waited for you!"</p><p></p><p>Faint red flames suddenly danced in the skull's eye sockets as it let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I have been dormant for so long, just waiting for the destined one to pass down my legacy..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any divine artifacts or treasures?" Xu Yan interrupted to ask.</p><p></p><p>"What are divine artifacts? Young man, don't set your sights so low. As long as you obtain my legacy, forget about divine artifacts and treasures, you'll be able to choose from the supreme treasures of heaven and earth..." </p><p></p><p>The skull said proudly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drew his sword, with the Xun Wind Sword Intent surrounding the skull, and said calmly: "Don't waste words or make empty promises. If you don't have divine artifacts then just die. I'm not interested in your legacy!"</p><p></p><p>The skull was a bit dumbfounded. How could this young man be so impetuous and short-sighted?</p><p></p><p>Had it misjudged him?</p><p></p><p>"Young man, do you know who I am? Missing out on my legacy will be the biggest regret of your life. For the sake of mere divine artifacts..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan couldn't be bothered to listen further and directly slashed down with his sword!</p><p></p><p>"Wait!" The skull hurriedly spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"Speak!" </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword stopped less than three inches above the skull.</p><p></p><p>"There are divine artifacts. My skull itself is a divine artifact. If you receive my legacy, you can obtain my divine artifact..."</p><p></p><p>Crack!</p><p></p><p>The skull was split open by a sword strike. The dancing red flames seemed to reveal a bewildered look.</p><p></p><p>How did the sword suddenly come down?</p><p></p><p>"This is...?"</p><p></p><p>Then it was greatly shocked.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Like a howling gale, the red flames were completely extinguished before they could say anything more.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan thrust his sword into the ground. The Xun Wind Sword Intent storm swept in all directions. After confirming the skull's remnant soul was not hiding, he finally sheathed his sword.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with these remnant souls?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the remnant soul on the small tree earlier, or this skull remnant soul, when they spoke, there was a bewitching power that sought to confuse one's mind.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the other geniuses who had entered the Tiankuyu Ruins this time. If they encountered such remnant souls, they would likely be easily bewitched.</p><p></p><p>"With Master here, even if they are bewitched it won't amount to anything."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued exploring.</p><p></p><p>On top of Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan suddenly looked towards the Tiankuyu Ruins with a thoughtful expression.</p><p></p><p>"These remnant souls are a bit strange. Why do they all like to target Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>The others hadn't encountered remnant souls like Xu Yan had. Among everyone, only Xu Yan had encountered them.</p><p></p><p>The remnant souls seemed to be specifically going after Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"These remnant souls don't belong to many people, but to one person, and moreover..."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath. He had some guesses in his mind.</p><p></p><p>All the remnant souls in the Tiankuyu Ruins belonged to one person. They couldn't even be called remnant souls, but rather split souls!</p><p></p><p>Some powerful expert had split their soul in the Tiankuyu Ruins. After suffering heavy damage, it had further split into multiple remnant souls, existing in a special way.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, these remnant souls were unable to leave the Tiankuyu Ruins.</p><p></p><p>Once they left the Tiankuyu Ruins, they would be erased by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"An outside invader?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan suddenly became interested. Since there were remnant souls, why not capture one to interrogate and find out the situation?</p><p></p><p>"It's targeting Xu Yan again. You really like fixating on my disciple, huh?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand to grab, and a giant palm descended from the sky, grabbing towards the remnant soul that had just appeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at the jumping bead before him, with remnant soul aura permeating it. Just as he was about to take action to destroy it, he saw his master make a move.</p><p></p><p>On top of Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan sat leisurely in his chair.</p><p></p><p>Above his head, a small Dahuang God Image appeared, with mysterious energy surging.</p><p></p><p>A light red bead floated in front of him, spinning round and round. Then a human face appeared on the bead.</p><p></p><p>The face wore a shocked expression.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" The face on the bead asked in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Speak. Why did you target my disciple?" Li Xuan asked coldly, looking at the face.</p><p></p><p>The face's expression tightened, its brows furrowing as it said in a deep voice: "Since he is your disciple, let this matter end here. How about that?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh!" Li Xuan chuckled. "Explain clearly. If you do, there may still be room for negotiation. Otherwise, all this soul power of yours won't need to exist anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Why must you do this, sir? I merely saw that your disciple was very unique, different from the martial artists of this world, so I became curious. That's all."</p><p></p><p>The face's tone became somewhat cowardly.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Li Xuan looked at him coldly. "Confess properly. Identity, background, intentions - explain it all clearly."</p><p></p><p>The face fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"I dare not offend you, sir. Let's end this here."</p><p></p><p>The face suddenly began to dissipate, disappearing in an instant.</p><p></p><p>It had chosen self-destruction rather than reveal anything, or perhaps it didn't want to provoke Li Xuan, who seemed unfathomable in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>It hid its identity as much as possible to avoid its true self being targeted.</p><p></p><p>"How decisive!" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan wasn't particularly disappointed by this.</p><p></p><p>The other party was clearly no ordinary martial artist. Since it chose self-destruction rather than offend him, it showed that his Dahuang God Image plus mysterious aura had frightened the other party.</p><p></p><p>"If you're going to self-destruct, why bother hiding the rest of your soul power?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze turned towards the Tiankuyu Ruins as he raised a hand and lightly pointed.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A gentle breeze swept through the entire Tiankuyu Ruins. At this moment, all the remnant souls were swept out and dissipated in the breeze.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..." </p><p></p><p>A voice sounded, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent. Since nothing could be learned, and there was no more value, why keep them around? Naturally, he waved his hand to destroy them all.</p><p></p><p>The Tiankuyu Ruins expedition was over.</p><p></p><p>The gains were meager, almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>As for those remnant souls, they had completely disappeared. For a very long time to come, this Tiankuyu Ruin would not have anything special about it.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion flying ship left the Tiankuyu Ruins. Fu Tianhai and the other Spirit Realm experts, along with the group of geniuses, also departed the Tiankuyu Ruins one after another.</p><p></p><p>"The God Bridge will open in two years. When the God Bridge opens, we can enter the other shore of the God Bridge," said the Great Zhou Emperor.</p><p></p><p>As for how the God Bridge opened, or how it existed, they didn't know.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew of the land on the other shore of the God Bridge, they didn't understand the circumstances there.</p><p></p><p>The existence of transcendent spirit sects was to discover spirit body geniuses and cultivate them to the Spirit Realm's limits.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>When the time limit arrives, they will be sent to the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>By establishing merit in this way, when the time comes, one can proceed to the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the Spirit Realm was also established by the forces belonging to the other side of the Divine Bridge. Now that the structure of the Spirit Realm has been broken, and with an unfathomable existence behind Fang Hao, the Transcendent Spirit Sect can only negotiate with the Eternal Alliance to reestablish the structure of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the forces on the other side will have objections after the Divine Bridge opens, this is no longer something they can decide. At that time, it will naturally be up to the stronger ones to make the decisions.</p><p></p><p>"City Lord Fu, a small celestial cave has appeared in the Black Pool of the Azure Sea. I once gained enlightenment there..." Xu Yan said, looking at Fu Tianhai.</p><p></p><p>"What?" Fu Tianhai and the others' expressions changed drastically.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the celestial cave in the Ice State had already caused such a huge calamity. Now there's another celestial cave in the Azure Sea?</p><p></p><p>"In the Black Pool of the Azure Sea?" Fu Tianhai's expression became grave. </p><p></p><p>This was a dangerous place where it was easy to lose one's way upon entering.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!" Xu Yan nodded and recounted how he discovered the celestial cave in the Black Pool, finally saying: "I placed a navigation pearl near the celestial cave, so it should be possible to find it without getting lost easily."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others frowned deeply. They had no idea what this navigation pearl was. </p><p></p><p>This must be another of Fang Hao's creations.</p><p></p><p>So they looked towards Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Leader Fang, regarding the matter of the celestial cave in the Black Pool of the Azure Sea..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao said solemnly: "This concerns the safety of the Spirit Realm. My Eternal Alliance cannot shirk its duty. I will go there shortly to set up a grand formation to seal off this small celestial cave."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, we'll trouble Alliance Leader Fang!" Fu Tianhai cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>After discussing the matter of the Azure Sea celestial cave for a while, Fu Tianhai hurriedly left to lead the powerful members of the Sea Spirit Clan to the Black Pool to prepare for sealing the celestial cave.</p><p></p><p>The Master of the Thousand Martial Palace and the others also left one after another.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao did not stay long at the Evergreen Pavilion. After reuniting for a few days and receiving some guidance from his master, he left hurriedly with Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>The structure of the Spirit Realm, and the matters of the Ice State, Cloud State, and Great Marsh State all needed to be dealt with.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao had officially taken over the Eternal Alliance and was negotiating with the Transcendent Spirit Sect regarding the structure of the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Red Cat stayed for a few days before returning to the Celestial Mausoleum State to become a Great Beast King, leading the beast clan to cooperate with the Eternal Alliance and occupy a place in the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>The storm had passed, and the Spirit Realm entered a new era. In a sense, the supreme rule of the Spirit Sect began to end.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion went to the Cloud State to treat and heal those affected by the disaster.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was organizing the martial methods of the Void-Breaking Realm while also accumulating foundation to prepare for breaking through to the Divine Power Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng and his wife Fu Yun traveled through the eighteen states of the Spirit Realm, establishing their own reputation.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng stayed behind and was in the midst of arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun clung to Meng Chong, clamoring to follow him in roaming the Spirit Realm.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Miaomiao also stayed at the Evergreen Pavilion, unwilling to return to the Great Miao Sect.</p><p></p><p>Cai Linger learned about the Azure Sea celestial cave matter. As a member of the Sea Spirit Clan, she felt somewhat anxious, but ultimately decided not to leave and chose to continue staying at the Evergreen Pavilion.</p><p></p><p>Staying by the side of a great expert.</p><p></p><p>This was an opportunity, and she didn't want to miss out on this chance!</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Pavilion became lively again, with sufficient manpower and more patients being seen every day.</p><p></p><p>The martial artist who, during the Ice State incident, had gritted his teeth and damaged his own spirit to escape and report the news, also came to the Evergreen Pavilion seeking treatment.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong broke through to the peak of the Divine Origin Realm, and Li Xuan's Great Sun Star Indestructible Body was strengthened.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also broke through to the peak of the Divine Origin Realm and understood the cultivation method of the Divine Phase Realm. Li Xuan's Alchemist Martial Way also broke through to the Divine Phase Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also rapidly increasing his strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was looking at what Wu Tiannan had given him, the legacy of Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>That blood-red pearl was quite extraordinary, concealing strands of soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to resurrect using this Netherworld Blood Pearl?" Li Xuan smiled. He understood Wu Tiannan's concerns - the person resurrected might not necessarily be Blood Spirit Child.</p><p></p><p>Instead, it would be the true self of that remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>Blood Spirit Child was quite ruthless too.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique is truly an evil technique, but I have to say, it does have its unique aspects and is indeed quite powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed after reading the Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique manual.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he discovered that although this Hundred Hells Blood Refining Technique seemed very similar to the martial arts of the Spirit Realm, it was not actually a martial art from the Spirit Realm. It was likely a technique from outside the world.</p><p></p><p>"This is getting more and more interesting."</p><p></p><p>What was the situation outside the Taicang World? Li Xuan put away the manual, thinking it might be useful as a reference for compiling martial arts.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Taicang Book and continued reading. He wanted to completely memorize the Taicang Book. Once he memorized it, it would mean he had memorized the principles and laws of the Taicang World.</p><p></p><p>Furthermore, the core changes of the entire world, the core of the entire world, would all be within his grasp.</p><p></p><p>"The other side of the Divine Bridge, another region of Taicang, where the world's spiritual energy is more active and the spiritual qi is more concentrated."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Taicang World was divided into grid-like regions. The closer to the center of the Taicang World, the more active and concentrated the world's spiritual energy and spiritual qi.</p><p></p><p>The upper limit of martial arts was higher.</p><p></p><p>However, why was the Taicang World separated in this way? And why were the regions connected by portals and bridges, unable to freely come and go? What was the reason for this? Li Xuan was quite curious about this as well.</p><p></p><p>"Once we go to the other side of the Divine Bridge, we should know the answer, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Above the Divine Human who Refines the Spirit, there is the Heavenly Venerable. There's the Law Condensing Heavenly Venerable, the True King Heavenly Venerable, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable... The Divine Phase Realm should correspond to the Law Condensing Realm, but my martial way has surpassed the realms of Taicang martial arts starting from the Divine Origin Realm."</p><p></p><p>"The strength of the Divine Phase Realm corresponds to the True Refinement Realm, on par with the True King Heavenly Venerable. That being said, my strength is still somewhat inferior to the Immortal Heavenly Venerable."</p><p></p><p>There must be Immortal Heavenly Venerables on the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even if he could fight against an ordinary Immortal Heavenly Venerable, he would not be invincible on the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>"Am I invincible below the Immortal level?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Heavenly Venerable was a huge leap, just like the Great Divine Human and the Divine Human who Refines the Spirit. It was a huge watershed.</p><p></p><p>"Merging with heaven and earth, ruling over a region of the world as the venerable, with a lifespan equal to heaven and earth... Theoretically, as long as heaven and earth do not perish, the Immortal Heavenly Venerable will not die. This is indeed very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>What is immortality? It's precisely because of this that their lifespan is nearly infinite.</p><p></p><p>They can only be killed, and will not die due to reaching the end of their lifespan.</p><p></p><p>"However, the Void-Breaking Realm is even stronger. The Immortal Heavenly Venerable merges with heaven and earth, ruling over a region of the world as the venerable, but the Void-Breaking Realm breaks open the void of heaven and earth, is not bound by the laws of heaven and earth, and can traverse the space of heaven and earth..."</p><p></p><p>"As long as one enters the Void-Breaking Realm, Immortal Heavenly Venerables are not a concern."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan felt a surge of confidence. With his understanding of the laws and principles of heaven and earth, once he entered the Void-Breaking Realm, suppressing an Immortal Heavenly Venerable with one hand would be an easy matter.</p><p></p><p>And the Void-Breaking Realm was not far off. Xu Yan was about to completely organize and thoroughly comprehend the martial methods of the Void-Breaking Realm!</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

        <h1>Chapter 354</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded, these lingering souls were not simple to have survived until now.</p><p></p><p>Fortunately, he had been cautious enough to completely exterminate the other party.</p><p></p><p>In the ruins of the Heavenly Abyss, there actually existed such lingering souls, there must have been people who had encountered them before, and even been bewitched by the lingering souls.</p><p></p><p>After carefully searching the surroundings and confirming that there were no omissions, Xu Yan continued to explore.</p><p></p><p>This Heavenly Abyss ruin was not large, but not small either.</p><p></p><p>It would take a few days to thoroughly explore it bit by bit.</p><p></p><p>"Huh?"</p><p></p><p>Suddenly, he discovered a blood-red skull buried under the loose soil, which was even more eerie.</p><p></p><p>With a wave of his hand, the skull floated up.</p><p></p><p>"I've finally been waiting for you!"</p><p></p><p>Faint red flames flickered in the eye sockets of the skull, and it let out a sigh.</p><p></p><p>"I have been in seclusion for a long time, only waiting for the fated person to pass down my inheritance..."</p><p></p><p>"Do you have any divine treasures?" Xu Yan interrupted the other party's words and asked.</p><p></p><p>"Divine treasures? Young man, don't set your sights too low. As long as you obtain my inheritance, not only divine treasures, but the most precious treasures in the heavens and earth will all be yours to choose from..."</p><p></p><p>The skull said arrogantly.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan drew his sword, the Xunfeng Sword Qi surrounding the skull, and said calmly, "Enough nonsense, and don't try to lure me. Without any divine treasures, you can just die. I'm not interested in your inheritance!"</p><p></p><p>The skull was a bit dumbfounded, how could this young man be so impatient and short-sighted?</p><p></p><p>Had it misjudged?</p><p></p><p>"Young man, do you know who I am? Missing my inheritance will be your greatest regret in life, all for some divine treasures..."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was tired of listening, directly slashing down with his sword. "Wait!"</p><p></p><p>The skull hurriedly spoke.</p><p></p><p>"Speak!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's sword stopped just inches above the skull.</p><p></p><p>"There are divine treasures, my skull is a divine treasure. If you obtain my inheritance, you can also obtain my divine treasure..."</p><p></p><p>Crack! The skull was split open by a single sword strike, and the flickering red flames seemed to reveal a bewildered expression.</p><p></p><p>How could he suddenly strike down like this?</p><p></p><p>"This is...?" It was greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Like a raging wind, the red flames were completely extinguished before it could say anything else.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stabbed his sword into the ground, and the Xunfeng Sword Qi swept through the area, confirming that the skull's soul had no more hiding places, before sheathing his sword.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on with these lingering souls?" Xu Yan pondered.</p><p></p><p>Whether it was the lingering soul on the small tree earlier or this skull's lingering soul, they had a bewitching power when speaking, trying to confuse one's mind.</p><p></p><p>He thought of the other geniuses who had entered the Heavenly Abyss ruin, if they encountered such lingering souls, they might easily be bewitched.</p><p></p><p>"With my master here, even if they are bewitched, it won't amount to anything."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continued his exploration.</p><p></p><p>On the Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan suddenly looked towards the Heavenly Abyss ruin, with a pensive expression.</p><p></p><p>"These lingering souls are a bit strange, why do they keep targeting Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>The others had not encountered lingering souls like Xu Yan, he was the only one.</p><p></p><p>The lingering souls seemed to be specifically targeting Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"These lingering souls are not for many people, but belong to one person, or rather... not even lingering souls, but soul fragments!"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan took a deep breath, he had a guess.</p><p></p><p>The lingering souls in the Heavenly Abyss ruin all belonged to one person, and they could not even be called lingering souls, but soul fragments!</p><p></p><p>A powerful expert had split their soul in the Heavenly Abyss ruin, and after suffering a heavy blow, the soul fragments were left behind in a special way.</p><p></p><p>And these soul fragments were unable to leave the Heavenly Abyss ruin.</p><p></p><p>Once they left, they would be erased by the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"An external invader?" Li Xuan suddenly became interested. Since there were soul fragments, why not capture one and interrogate it to know the situation?</p><p></p><p>"It's targeting my disciple again, so fond of keeping an eye on him, aren't you?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan raised his hand, and a giant palm descended from the sky, grabbing the soul fragment that had just appeared.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was about to strike down the flickering pearl-like soul fragment when he saw his master act.</p><p></p><p>On the Changqing Pavilion, Li Xuan was sitting leisurely in a chair. </p><p></p><p>A small Great Desolate Deity appeared above his head, and mysterious aura was surging.</p><p></p><p>A faint red pearl floated in front of him, spinning around, and then a human face appeared on the pearl.</p><p></p><p>The face was full of shock.</p><p></p><p>"Who are you?" The face on the pearl asked solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"Speak, why have you targeted my disciple," Li Xuan asked indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The face became solemn, frowning, and said in a deep voice, "Since it is your disciple, let's leave it at that, how about that?"</p><p></p><p>"Heh!" Li Xuan chuckled lightly. "Explain clearly, and maybe there's still room for negotiation, otherwise your soul force won't be allowed to exist anymore."</p><p></p><p>"Sir, I was merely curious about your disciple, as he is quite unique and different from the other martial artists in this world." The face spoke in a somewhat timid tone.</p><p></p><p>"Is that all?" Li Xuan looked at him indifferently. "Explain your identity, origin, and intentions clearly."</p><p></p><p>The face fell silent.</p><p></p><p>"I don't want to offend you, sir, so let's leave it at that."</p><p></p><p>The face suddenly began to disintegrate and vanished without a trace. It chose self-destruction rather than revealing anything, or perhaps it did not want to provoke Li Xuan, whose existence seemed unfathomable in its eyes.</p><p></p><p>"How decisive!" Li Xuan was not too regretful about this.</p><p></p><p>The other party was obviously not an ordinary martial artist, and since it chose self-destruction rather than offending him, it seemed that his Great Desolate Deity and mysterious aura had frightened it.</p><p></p><p>"Since it wants to self-destruct, why bother hiding the rest of its soul force?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze turned to the Heavenly Abyss ruin, and he lightly tapped with his hand.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! A gust of wind swept through the entire Heavenly Abyss ruin, sweeping out all the remaining soul fragments, which then disintegrated and disappeared.</p><p></p><p>"Sir..." A voice sounded, then fell silent.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's gaze was indifferent. Since he could not get any information, they had no more value, so he simply waved his hand to extinguish them.</p><p></p><p>The expedition to the Heavenly Abyss ruin was over. The harvest was meager, almost nothing.</p><p></p><p>As for those soul fragments, they had completely disappeared, and this Heavenly Abyss ruin would not have any special features for a long time to come.</p><p></p><p>The Changqing Pavilion's flying ship left the Heavenly Abyss ruin, and Fei Tianhai and other Spiritual Domain experts, as well as a group of geniuses, also departed.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Bridge will open in two years, and then we can enter the other side of the Divine Bridge," said the Great Zhou Emperor.</p><p></p><p>As for how the Divine Bridge opens and how it exists, they did not know.</p><p></p><p>Although they knew the place beyond the Divine Bridge, they did not understand the situation there.</p><p></p><p>The existence of the Transcendent Spirit Sect was to unearth Spiritual Body geniuses and cultivate them to the Spiritual Domain realm.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The time has come, and he was sent into the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>By establishing this merit, when the time comes, he can also go to the other side of the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>The layout of the Spiritual Realm was formulated by the forces that belong to the other side of the Divine Bridge. Now the layout of the Spiritual Realm has been broken, and behind Fang Hao is an unfathomable existence.</p><p></p><p>Therefore, the Transcendent Spiritual Sect can only negotiate with the Myriad Worlds Alliance to re-formulate the layout of the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>As for whether the forces on the other side of the Divine Bridge will have any opinions after the Divine Bridge is opened, this is no longer something they can handle. At that time, it will be decided by stronger powers.</p><p></p><p>"Sect Leader Fu, in the Emerald Sea's Black Pool, a small heavenly cave has appeared, and I have gained enlightenment there before..." </p><p></p><p>Xu Yan looked at Fu Tianhai and spoke.</p><p></p><p>"What?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others were greatly alarmed.</p><p></p><p>The appearance of the Ice State Heavenly Cave has already caused such a huge calamity. </p><p></p><p>There is also a heavenly cave appearing in the Emerald Sea's Black Pool?</p><p></p><p>"In the Emerald Sea's Black Pool?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai's expression became grave.</p><p></p><p>This is a dangerous place, and it is easy to lose one's way when entering it.</p><p></p><p>"That's right!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded and recounted his discovery of the Black Pool's heavenly cave. In the end, he said, "I placed a navigation pearl near the heavenly cave, so it should be easy to find and not get lost."</p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai and the others frowned, they had no idea what this navigation pearl was. </p><p></p><p>This must be another of Fang Hao's doing.</p><p></p><p>So they looked at Fang Hao.</p><p></p><p>"Alliance Master Fang, about the matter of the Emerald Sea's Black Pool heavenly cave..."</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao solemnly said, "It is related to the safety of the Spiritual Realm, the Myriad Worlds Alliance cannot shirk its responsibility. I will soon go there and set up a grand formation to seal this small heavenly cave."</p><p></p><p>"In that case, we will leave it to Alliance Master Fang!" </p><p></p><p>Fu Tianhai cupped his hands.</p><p></p><p>After discussing the matter of the Emerald Sea's heavenly cave a bit more, Fu Tianhai hurriedly left to lead the Sea Spirit Clan's experts to the Black Pool to prepare for sealing the heavenly cave.</p><p></p><p>The Hall Master of the Thousand Martial Hall and others also left one by one.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao did not stay long in the Evergreen Hall. After gathering for a few days and receiving guidance from his master, he left in a hurry with Yue Changming.</p><p></p><p>The layout of the Spiritual Realm, the matters of the Ice State, Cloud State, and Great Marsh State all need to be handled.</p><p></p><p>And Fang Hao has officially taken over the Myriad Worlds Alliance and negotiated with the Transcendent Spiritual Sect regarding the affairs of the Spiritual Realm layout.</p><p></p><p>The Scarlet Cat stayed for a few days and then returned to the Heavenly Mound State to be the Great Demon King, leading the demon clan to cooperate with the Myriad Worlds Alliance and occupy a place in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>The turbulence has passed, and the Spiritual Realm has entered a new era. In a sense, the supreme rule of the Spiritual Sect has come to an end.</p><p></p><p>The Evergreen Hall went to the Cloud State to treat the injured and heal the sick there.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was sorting out the martial arts of the Void Boundary, and was also accumulating his foundation to prepare for the breakthrough to the Divine Passage Realm.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng and his wife Fu Yun traveled through the eighteen states of the Spiritual Realm, establishing their own reputation.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng stayed behind and was in arduous cultivation.</p><p></p><p>Zi Yun kept pestering Meng Chong, clamoring to follow Meng Chong to roam the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>Du Yuying and Yun Caicai also remained in the Evergreen Hall, unwilling to return to the Tai Xuan Sect.</p><p></p><p>Cai Lingyi, upon learning of the matter of the Emerald Sea's heavenly cave, as a member of the Sea Spirit Clan, felt anxious, but in the end she still did not leave, choosing to continue staying in the Evergreen Hall.</p><p></p><p>To stay with the elders. </p><p></p><p>This is an opportunity, and she does not want to miss it! The Evergreen Hall has become lively again, with sufficient manpower, and the number of patients they treat every day has also increased.</p><p></p><p>The warrior who had recklessly sacrificed his divine soul and escaped with his life by leaking information during the Ice State's incident also came to the Evergreen Hall for treatment.</p><p></p><p>Meng Chong had broken through to the Divine Element Realm perfectly, and Li Xuan's Unextinguishable Body of the Great Sun Star had been enhanced.</p><p></p><p>Su Lingxiu also broke through to the Divine Element Realm perfectly, and she had also comprehended the cultivation method of the Divine Image Realm. Li Xuan's Pill Dao martial arts had also broken through to the Divine Image Realm.</p><p></p><p>Fang Hao was also rapidly improving his strength.</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan was looking at the remnants of the Blood Spirit Child that Wu Tiannan had given him.</p><p></p><p>That blood-red bead contained some soul power.</p><p></p><p>"Wanting to revive through this Infernal Blood Pearl?" </p><p></p><p>Li Xuan smiled. He understood Wu Tiannan's concerns, the one revived might not be the Blood Spirit Child, but the original remnant soul.</p><p></p><p>The Blood Spirit Child was also a ruthless person.</p><p></p><p>"The Hundred Prisons Refine Blood Technique, it is truly a demonic cultivation, but it has to be said that it has its unique aspects and is quite powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan finished reading the secret manual of the Hundred Prisons Refine Blood Technique, sighing deeply.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, he found that this Hundred Prisons Refine Blood Technique, while seemingly similar to the martial arts of the Spiritual Realm, was actually not from the Spiritual Realm, but likely from outside of the Tai Xuan Realm.</p><p></p><p>"It's getting more and more interesting."</p><p></p><p>Outside the Tai Xuan Realm, what kind of situation is there? Li Xuan put the secret manual away, perhaps it could provide some reference for his martial arts creation.</p><p></p><p>He took out the Tai Xuan Book and continued to read it. He wanted to completely memorize the Tai Xuan Book, and once he had memorized it, it would mean that he had mastered the Tai Xuan Realm's Dao and Laws.</p><p></p><p>Thus, he would have a grasp of the core changes of the entire heaven and earth, the essence of the entire heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>"The other side of the Divine Bridge, the other region of the Tai Xuan Realm, where the heaven and earth spiritual mechanisms are more active and the spiritual energy is more abundant."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan pondered in his heart.</p><p></p><p>The Tai Xuan Realm is divided into various regions like grids, and the closer to the center of the Tai Xuan Realm, the more active the heaven and earth spiritual mechanisms and the more abundant the spiritual energy.</p><p></p><p>The martial arts cultivation limit is also higher there.</p><p></p><p>However, why is the Tai Xuan Realm divided in this way? And each region is connected by gates and bridges, without the freedom to come and go, what is the reason behind this? Li Xuan was also very curious about this.</p><p></p><p>"After going to the other side of the Divine Bridge, I should be able to find the answer, right?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>"Refining the Divine Human, above is the Heavenly Venerable, such as the Dao Venerable, True King Venerable, Immortal Venerable... The Divine Image Realm should correspond to the Dao Venerable, but my martial arts have already surpassed the Tai Xuan Realm's boundaries starting from the Divine Element Realm.</p><p></p><p>"The Divine Image Realm's strength corresponds to the Refine True Realm, and is on par with the True King Venerable. In this way, my strength is still a bit inferior to the Immortal Venerable."</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable must exist in the region beyond the Divine Bridge.</p><p></p><p>With his current strength, even if he can contend with ordinary Immortal Venerables, when he goes to the other side of the Divine Bridge, he will not be invincible.</p><p></p><p>"Am I invincible below the Immortal Venerable?"</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan muttered to himself.</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Venerable is a huge leap, just like the Great Celestial Human and the Refine Divine Human, it is a huge watershed.</p><p></p><p>"Harmonizing with heaven and earth, commanding a realm as the Venerable, with a lifespan equal to heaven and earth... In theory, as long as heaven and earth do not perish, the Immortal Venerable will not die, which is still very powerful."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan sighed.</p><p></p><p>What is called immortality is precisely because of this, the lifespan is almost endless.</p><p></p><p>They can only be killed, and will not die when their lifespan is exhausted.</p><p></p><p>"But the Void Boundary is even stronger. The Immortal Venerable harmonizes with heaven and earth and commands a realm as the Venerable, but the Void Boundary is to break through the void of heaven and earth, not bound by the laws of heaven and earth, transcending the spatial dimensions of heaven and earth...</p><p></p><p>"As long as I enter the Void Boundary, the Immortal Venerable will not be a concern."</p><p></p><p>Li Xuan's confidence grew in his heart. With his understanding of the laws and Dao of heaven and earth, once he enters the Void Boundary, suppressing an Immortal Venerable would be as easy as a breeze.</p><p></p><p>And the Void Boundary is not far away, Xu Yan is about to completely sort out and comprehend the martial arts of the Void Boundary.</p>

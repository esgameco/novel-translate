        <h1>Chapter 229</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>The once-mighty Qingtianjiao, unwilling to simply die, wanted to transform his post-death self into a corpse demon (shiliao).</p><p></p><p>He got his wish.</p><p></p><p>But not entirely.</p><p></p><p>For although he had become a corpse demon and awakened, the corpse demon Qingtianjiao was no longer the original Qingtianjiao.</p><p></p><p>His spiritual power had long since lost its former strength.</p><p></p><p>His original consciousness had not awakened either, with only some basic instinctual awareness remaining in his spirit, such as the desire to devour miasmas and flesh.</p><p></p><p>The flesh of martial artists held great allure for him, as if they were the most delicious delicacies in the world.</p><p></p><p>Perhaps he was awakened prematurely, unable to complete his final transformation, so his spiritual essence reassembled, but his original consciousness did not return.</p><p></p><p>The blue-backed, white-bellied Qingtianjiao had fine down growing between his scales, indicating his transformation was not fully complete.</p><p></p><p>Otherwise, he should not have had such down, and even if his original consciousness could not fully revive, at least a part of it should have.</p><p></p><p>The current Qingtianjiao was a corpse demon, no longer the original Qingtianjiao.</p><p></p><p>The overwhelming spiritual power suppressed the remaining geniuses, as miasmas and foul energies constantly surged into Qingtianjiao's body.</p><p></p><p>The young disciples of the Yushen Sect fled.</p><p></p><p>The remaining geniuses strained with all their might, yet still could not break free from the spiritual pressure.</p><p></p><p>"Corpse demon, Qingtianjiao has become a corpse demon!" exclaimed one of the geniuses in horror.</p><p></p><p>Corpse demons were extremely rare demonic beings in the Spiritual Realm.</p><p></p><p>They were usually born in certain special places, and only after a long time could they transform into corpse demons.</p><p></p><p>Ordinary corpse demons were not particularly strong. In the history of martial dao in the Spiritual Realm, there had never been a corpse demon as powerful as a Refined Spirit Celestial.</p><p></p><p>Once a corpse demon was born, it would have an innate thirst for blood, attacking and devouring the blood of martial artists and spirit beasts. They would quickly be exterminated by martial artists, with little chance to grow stronger.</p><p></p><p>In the history of the Spiritual Realm, the strongest corpse demon was only at the initial stage of the Great Celestial Realm.</p><p></p><p>Qingtianjiao was probably the strongest corpse demon in history.</p><p></p><p>Even more terrifying was that Qingtianjiao's transformation into a corpse demon was not accidental - it seemed to be his own deliberate arrangement for his post-death revival.</p><p></p><p>To live another life! How did Qingtianjiao know the method of transforming into a corpse demon?</p><p></p><p>The Spiritual Realm had never seen such a technique before. The group of geniuses were deathly pale with fear.</p><p></p><p>The powerful experts behind them must have never imagined that Qingtianjiao's tomb was deliberately arranged by Qingtianjiao himself to transform into a corpse demon.</p><p></p><p>The emergence of the tomb's traces meant that the transformation into a corpse demon was about to be completed.</p><p></p><p>Qingtianjiao was about to revive, living a second life as a corpse demon.</p><p></p><p>However, due to their intrusion, they had disrupted the final transformation, so although Qingtianjiao had become a corpse demon, his original consciousness had not revived.</p><p></p><p>Qingtianjiao coiled in midair, his eyes blood-red, his thirst for blood filling his gaze as he opened his huge mouth, staring at the remaining geniuses.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood not far from Qingtianjiao, with a gentle wind swirling around him. The suppression of his spiritual power had no effect on him.</p><p></p><p>"With his spirit not complete or extremely weak, he can suppress those small Celestials, but if he faces a Great Celestial, he may not be able to suppress them.</p><p></p><p>"Now that Qingtianjiao has become a corpse demon, is he still useful?" Xu Yan fell into contemplation.</p><p></p><p>The reason he did not leave was that he had set his sights on Qingtianjiao. Meng Chong was a fleshly martial artist, and the essence of Qingtianjiao's flesh and blood could greatly help Meng Chong accumulate a fleshly foundation.</p><p></p><p>The current problem was whether Qingtianjiao, now a corpse demon, would still be useful.</p><p></p><p>"My junior brother's fleshly martial dao is more powerful than a spirit beast's physique. Even though Qingtianjiao has become a corpse demon, he might still be usable.</p><p></p><p>"Containing a powerful poison, he could also nurture the golden core apertures, and who knows, perhaps there could be some profound uses?"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this, Xu Yan decided to subdue Qingtianjiao. Even if he couldn't use him in the end, it wouldn't be a loss. Since he had encountered him, how could he let him go?</p><p></p><p>The sword was drawn. A sword descended, with mountains and rivers appearing, collapsing into a thunderous strike.</p><p></p><p>Thunderclap Sword! Qingtianjiao let out a low roar, and the huge mouth that was about to devour the geniuses suddenly spat out a black beam.</p><p></p><p>Boom! The black beam and the thunderous strike collided, the black beam shattering, but the thunderous sword was also weakened.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, Qingtianjiao's spiritual pressure had been broken by Xu Yan's sword.</p><p></p><p>The few geniuses suddenly felt reborn, hastily fleeing.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan's intervention was not to save them, but to prevent Qingtianjiao from continuing to devour the miasmas and foul energies, lest his strength increase too much and become unusable.</p><p></p><p>Qingtianjiao's blood-red eyes stared at Xu Yan, letting out a roar as a black raging flame surged, the miasmas instantly condensing into a liquid. Raising his claws, he charged towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The Life-and-Death Sword Wheel appeared, spinning left and right to strike.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved, shifting his position and appearing above Qingtianjiao's head, thrusting down with his sword. Although Qingtianjiao's original consciousness had not revived, his formidable might and powerful battle instincts remained.</p><p></p><p>His body twisting, another black beam was spat out. At the same time, the spiritual pressure constantly pressed down.</p><p></p><p>Hum! The Gentle Wind Sword Intent whipped up a gentle breeze, clashing with the spiritual pressure, locked in a stalemate.</p><p></p><p>"The spiritual power of a Refined Spirit Celestial is indeed extraordinary. With my current Gentle Wind Sword Intent, I cannot harm his spirit," Xu Yan sighed inwardly.</p><p></p><p>As expected, being able to resist the spiritual pressure was already sufficient. The Mountain and River Sword Dao unfolded, the Life-and-Death Sword Wheel shining brightly, continuously striking at Qingtianjiao, the two engaged in a fierce battle.</p><p></p><p>"Sss! So strong!" Shen Haizhou exclaimed in shock from outside the black swamp.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had casually slain his follower, and although Shen Haizhou knew Xu Yan was powerful, he never expected him to be able to contend with the corpse demon Qingtianjiao without being at a disadvantage.</p><p></p><p>"How is he able to resist Qingtianjiao's spiritual pressure?"</p><p></p><p>The spiritual pressure directly suppressed, and even below the Refined Spirit Celestial Realm, no one could resist it. Even Great Celestials who had already reached the Divine Realm were the same.</p><p></p><p>Yet Xu Yan was unaffected by Qingtianjiao's spiritual pressure?</p><p></p><p>"Could this brother be a Refined Spirit Celestial?" Shen Haizhou quickly dismissed this guess.</p><p></p><p>He did not sense any spiritual fluctuations from Xu Yan at all.</p><p></p><p>The few geniuses who had escaped with their lives were still shaken, looking at the battle raging in the sky above Black Rock Mountain, both shocked and relieved.</p><p></p><p>"Let's go, quickly return and inform the elders that Qingtianjiao has become a corpse demon."</p><p></p><p>This trip to Qingtianjiao's tomb had resulted in such a huge upheaval, and of those who came to explore it, less than ten people had survived. The rest had all died, either in the chaos of Black Rock Mountain's collapse, or in the jaws of Qingtianjiao, or from the sneak attack of the Jade Crystal Snakes.</p><p></p><p>Qingtianjiao's transformation into a corpse demon was undoubtedly a major event that would shake the martial dao world.</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the excerpt from the Chinese novel:</p><p></p><p>Before his death, the method he left behind for himself to survive, how did he come up with the technique of becoming a corpse demon? Did he research and develop it himself? Xu Yan slashed out sword after sword, but the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's strength was extremely powerful, and its scaly armor defense was not weak either. In a short period of time, he was unable to slay it!</p><p></p><p>"It won't be long before a powerful expert may arrive, I must quickly slay it!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan frowned.</p><p></p><p>However, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's combat awareness was not weak, and its strength was also extremely powerful. The difficulty in slaying it in a short period of time was not ordinary.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Azure Sky Flood Dragon let out a low roar, coiling in midair, its bloodshot eyes staring at Xu Yan. Suddenly, a blue light began to gather at the horn on its head.</p><p></p><p>Vaguely, a vast and mighty aura was transmitted.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly stiffened, slapping his forehead, "The Azure Sky Flood Dragon is a flood dragon, the Subduing Dragon Palm can subdue dragons, subduing a flood dragon would be easy!"</p><p></p><p>Thinking this way, Xu Yan immediately sheathed his sword, raising his hand to strike out a palm.</p><p></p><p>Howl! A golden giant dragon suddenly burst out, like a true dragon descending into the world, its dragon might surging, its eyes radiating a fierce aura.</p><p></p><p>"A, a true dragon?"</p><p></p><p>Only Shen Haizhou was still observing the battle, and at this moment, he was already dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>That golden giant dragon, suddenly appearing, even though it was far away, he vaguely felt the surging, supreme might.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon swooped down, attacking the Azure Sky Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body began to tremble, letting out a low roar, its body constantly retreating, the light on its horn also dimming.</p><p></p><p>Its bloodshot eyes revealed fear and submission.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragon suddenly grabbed down, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon opened its mouth, wanting to spit out a black light, but a dragon's roar sounded, those fierce and sharp eyes filled with anger.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body trembled even more violently, its gaping mouth panting, constantly retreating, not daring to launch an attack! Howl! The golden giant dragon pounced, grasping the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, the supremely yang Subduing Dragon Palm force, as well as the surging dragon might, washing over the Azure Sky Flood Dragon.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Azure Sky Flood Dragon struggled, wanting to break free from the restraint.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan revealed a delighted expression, the Subduing Dragon Palm lived up to its name, able to subdue dragons, subduing a flood dragon was naturally easy.</p><p></p><p>He struck out another palm.</p><p></p><p>A second golden giant dragon thundered out, swooping towards the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, under the suppression of the dragon might, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's struggling strength gradually weakened.</p><p></p><p>That originally weak divine soul was shaking, seeming to become unstable due to the fear.</p><p></p><p>The two golden giant dragons grasped the Azure Sky Flood Dragon, and one of the golden giant dragons was slowly merging into the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan suddenly realized that his Subduing Dragon Palm force, being supremely yang, was the nemesis of the yin and evil.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon had become a corpse demon, which was a type of yin and evil monster. Its internal miasma and impurities, the Subduing Dragon Palm force should be able to purge.</p><p></p><p>So, Xu Yan tried to have the golden giant dragon merge into the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body, and even use the Subduing Dragon Palm force to temporarily control the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>Roar! The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's consciousness seemed to sense the danger, and began to struggle frantically. Although under the suppression of the dragon might, it still burst out formidable strength, preventing the golden giant dragon from continuing to merge into its body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan struck out another palm, a third golden giant dragon rushed over, opening its dragon mouth, and with a dragon's roar, directly bit the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's head.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's struggle weakened, and one of the golden dragons was constantly merging into its body.</p><p></p><p>However, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's divine soul began to struggle, but under the suppression of the dragon might, it became weaker.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan moved, slashing out a sword.</p><p></p><p>The sword struck silently, only a gentle breeze blowing.</p><p></p><p>Whoosh! Like a candle flame being blown, it swept across the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's divine soul, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's divine soul, shaking violently like a candle flame.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out sword after sword, one after another, seven swords in a row, fully unleashing the Gentle Wind Sword Intent.</p><p></p><p>Poof! At a certain moment, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's divine soul, like a candle flame, shook and suddenly extinguished.</p><p></p><p>The Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse also stopped struggling.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan slashed out another sword, the gentle breeze sweeping across the four directions.</p><p></p><p>All the remaining divine soul fluctuations were extinguished! At this moment, the Subduing Dragon Palm force had also permeated the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body, and through the Subduing Dragon Palm force, Xu Yan sensed the situation within the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>He couldn't help but be shocked, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body contained a vast power, nearly half of which had become yin and gloomy force.</p><p></p><p>The other half, however, was the pure essence of a spirit beast.</p><p></p><p>"This is from a corpse demon, transforming back into a spirit beast? No, not quite right, it's becoming a spirit beast corpse demon, not a yin and evil corpse demon!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed inwardly, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's grand reputation was not without reason.</p><p></p><p>It had prepared so much for its own death, it's just a pity that human calculations cannot match heavenly calculations, and an unexpected event occurred, unable to complete the final step, still remaining at the level of a yin and evil corpse demon.</p><p></p><p>This was not related to the disturbance caused by the group entering the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's tomb, but rather because the spiritual object the Azure Sky Flood Dragon had buried for its own metamorphosis was insufficient.</p><p></p><p>Probably, the Azure Sky Flood Dragon itself had never expected that despite exhausting all its efforts, it still failed to complete this step of transformation.</p><p></p><p>The three Subduing Dragon Palm forces had permeated the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse, and were now purging the corpse demon qi and the impurities.</p><p></p><p>Strand after strand of black mist was expelled from the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan continuously struck out several golden giant dragons, merging them into the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's body, consuming a significant amount of true essence.</p><p></p><p>Outside the Black Cloud Swamp, Shen Haizhou was already dumbfounded.</p><p></p><p>The golden giant dragons were summoned by Xu Yan?</p><p></p><p>"The Spiritual Realm is about to produce a true dragon, this brother of mine is too powerful, I must find a way to maintain our brotherly relationship."</p><p></p><p>Shen Haizhou pondered.</p><p></p><p>How to maintain the friendship? Money! Xu Yan's true essence was consumed rapidly, until one-third was used up, the corpse demon qi in the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse was finally completely purged.</p><p></p><p>"With my vast true essence, even one-third was consumed. "</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan sighed in amazement, this corpse demon qi was truly difficult to purge.</p><p></p><p>If not for the Subduing Dragon Palm force, being supremely yang and able to counter the corpse demon qi, it would be impossible to purge it.</p><p></p><p>As the corpse demon qi was purged, the downy fur between the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's scales had also disappeared.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, it looked like a just-deceased flood dragon corpse!</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan tried to activate the Subduing Dragon Palm, and the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse actually began to move with the Subduing Dragon Palm, emanating a dragon might.</p><p></p><p>Its eyes were shining with light.</p><p></p><p>"An unexpected joy, I can actually control the flood dragon corpse with the Subduing Dragon Palm!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan was delighted.</p><p></p><p>"There are too many flood dragon corpses, the storage bag can't hold them all."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan became troubled again.</p><p></p><p>"Let's try to shrink it."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan activated the Subduing Dragon Palm, and the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse began to shrink. </p><p></p><p>Through the perception of the Subduing Dragon Palm, Xu Yan discovered that the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse had undergone some changes due to the long years of cultivation, and its previous transformation into a corpse demon.</p><p></p><p>When the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse shrank to nearly ten feet, it could no longer be further reduced.</p><p></p><p>But this was enough, a large storage bag could accommodate it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan took out a storage bag, activated his true essence, and the bag's mouth opened, storing the Azure Sky Flood Dragon's corpse inside.</p><p></p><p>(This chapter ends)</p>

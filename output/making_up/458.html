        <h1>Chapter 458</h1>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is my full English translation of the Chinese novel excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's figure disappeared instantly from where he stood, leaving only a sharp and fierce long spear, radiating a terrifying cold light, blooming on the battlefield.</p><p></p><p>To the distant observers, they only heard those top-tier Immortal Celestial Lords roar in anger, unleashing terrifying auras.</p><p></p><p>However, in this intense battle, occasionally a shrill scream would ring out, and a corpse would fall from midair.</p><p></p><p>The great battle did not last long. After the final shrill scream faded, only one figure remained standing proudly in the sky above the battlefield, holding a long spear, with an unmatched aura.</p><p></p><p>The observing Immortal Celestial Lords were now trembling all over, their faces deathly pale.</p><p></p><p>Among those who had attacked Jiang Buping were their acquaintances, some even their elders, but now all the attackers were dead.</p><p></p><p>It was like a one-sided slaughter.</p><p></p><p>Several top-tier Immortal Celestial Lords joined forces and used defensive divine artifacts, yet they were still so easily defeated.</p><p></p><p>Those True King Celestial Lords were even more shocked, cold sweat dripping from their foreheads without them even noticing. They didn't dare move, fearing they might be misunderstood and killed with a single spear thrust.</p><p></p><p>They even feared that Jiang Buping might go berserk and kill all of them observers too! One man with one spear, unmatched in killing! At this moment, they thought of two other people - Xu Yan and Meng Chong.</p><p></p><p>Those two fierce individuals could kill Immortal Celestial Lords as easily as swatting flies, and now there was another one.</p><p></p><p>The discarded son of Taikun, Jiang Buping!</p><p></p><p>How did the Divine Realm suddenly produce three such monstrous talents?</p><p></p><p>Compared to these three, those former top young talents weren't even fit to tie their shoes!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping waved his hand, and all the corpses turned to ashes and scattered.</p><p></p><p>"If you want to scheme for my so-called secret techniques, you'll have to see if you have the fate for it. I, Jiang Buping, am waiting for you!" Jiang Buping said coldly.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Tianming and Yun Yan'er, wait for me to reach the Taikun Realm. Whatever tricks you have, bring them all out!"</p><p></p><p>After saying this, Jiang Buping strode away.</p><p></p><p>This assassination attempt was not the first, and it definitely would not be the last.</p><p></p><p>As always, after Jiang Buping arrived in a realm, he would inevitably enter the Heavenly Caves, either to collect Undissolved Qi or to hone his Extreme Soul Martial Arts and gather various treasures.</p><p></p><p>The discarded son of Taikun, Jiang Buping, his fierce reputation spread far and wide.</p><p></p><p>In one Heavenly Cave, Jiang Buping, alone with his spear, slaughtered Undissolved True Spirits and collected Undissolved Qi.</p><p></p><p>In just a few days, all the powerful Undissolved True Spirits in this Heavenly Cave were killed by Jiang Buping. He single-handedly cleared the entire Heavenly Cave.</p><p></p><p>After emerging from this Heavenly Cave, Jiang Buping headed to the next one.</p><p></p><p>This was a Shaman Demon Heavenly Cave. Jiang Buping killed the Shaman Demon avatars here, looted the treasures, and then left.</p><p></p><p>Outside the realm gate, in a patch of space, chains crisscrossed and sealed off all directions. These chains were formed from the power of heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>Behind each chain stood a figure, holding the chain, their energy fused with the chain.</p><p></p><p>Besides the chains, there were layers of light forming barriers standing in all directions, with figures standing behind each barrier.</p><p></p><p>In addition, flashes of sharp light appeared intermittently, with various powerful martial energy intertwining.</p><p></p><p>This place had already become a killing field!</p><p></p><p>A total of over twenty Immortal Celestial Lords were each responsible for their own tasks, and behind the Immortal Celestial Lords were hundreds of peak True King Celestial Lord martial artists.</p><p></p><p>They had integrated their strength and energy into the heavenly and earthly laws, strengthening those chains and the barriers formed by layers of light.</p><p></p><p>At the center of this killing field stood a figure holding a long spear.</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, I'll give you one chance. Hand over the secret technique!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's gaze was cold as he raised his spear and sneered, "You think you're worthy? If you had set up a powerful killing formation, I might have retreated a bit. But with this garbage technique, you dare to try and stop me?"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping, if you're seeking death, we'll grant your wish!"</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The chains formed from heavenly and earthly laws instantly coiled in from all directions, attempting to bind Jiang Buping!</p><p></p><p>The barriers formed by layers of light shone brightly - these were to defend against Jiang Buping's soul-killing techniques!</p><p></p><p>"Hmph!" </p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping snorted coldly, his figure suddenly dissipating and merging into the power of heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>All the Immortal Celestial Lords were stunned. What was going on?</p><p></p><p>Had Jiang Buping self-destructed?</p><p></p><p>"Retreat quickly!" </p><p></p><p>Suddenly, one of the Immortal Celestial Lords holding a chain shouted with a drastically changed expression!</p><p></p><p>However, it was already too late!</p><p></p><p>The Immortal Celestial Lord next to him was killed by a spear light that thrust out from the chain! He didn't even have time to scream before his soul was completely annihilated!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, all the powerful experts turned pale with fright.</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had merged into the power of heavenly and earthly laws?</p><p></p><p>"Quickly, seal him off, kill him!" an Immortal Celestial Lord roared in shock and anger.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The chains formed from heavenly and earthly laws began to vibrate at this moment, turning into killing power.</p><p></p><p>All the Immortal Celestial Lords frantically attacked, pouring out all their strength, wanting to annihilate Jiang Buping within these chains of heavenly and earthly laws.</p><p></p><p>Although they didn't know how Jiang Buping had managed to merge into the chains of heavenly and earthly laws without being affected, this was still an opportunity - an opportunity to kill him!</p><p></p><p>Hum!</p><p></p><p>The power of heavenly and earthly laws, which had only been chains before, suddenly turned into intense killing intent.</p><p></p><p>Swish!</p><p></p><p>However, the Immortal Celestial Lord who had just been killed, his soul annihilated, suddenly attacked the Immortal Celestial Lord next to him.</p><p></p><p>"You?"</p><p></p><p>That Immortal Celestial Lord was greatly shocked, instinctively thinking the other had betrayed them.</p><p></p><p>At this moment, he saw a flash of spear light in his soul!</p><p></p><p>Puff!</p><p></p><p>His soul was completely annihilated under his own astonished gaze.</p><p></p><p>And the corpse that had attacked immediately turned to ashes and scattered.</p><p></p><p>"What's going on?"</p><p></p><p>The remaining Immortal Celestial Lords were instantly filled with doubt and fear.</p><p></p><p>Before they could figure out what was happening, the Immortal Celestial Lord who had just been killed suddenly sprang up and attacked another Immortal Celestial Lord!</p><p></p><p>Puff! Another one was killed with a single strike!</p><p></p><p>"It's Jiang Buping!"</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the remaining Immortal Celestial Lords finally realized in horror!</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had actually taken over the bodies of the killed Immortal Celestial Lords!</p><p></p><p>How did he do this?</p><p></p><p>At this moment, everyone thought of that spear thrust that had come out of the chains of heavenly and earthly laws and killed their companion! It was at that moment that Jiang Buping had already taken over the other's body!</p><p></p><p>What kind of technique was this? Could it be that Jiang Buping had no physical body?</p><p></p><p>But no matter how they looked at it, Jiang Buping didn't seem to be just a soul body. If he had no physical body and was only left with a soul, how could he still have such power? How could he cultivate to become so strong, how could he survive on the cruel battlefield?</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>The remaining Immortal Celestial Lords, with horrified expressions, once again summoned the chains of heavenly and earthly laws to seal off the Immortal Celestial Lord whose body had been taken over.</p><p></p><p>Bang! Suddenly, that Immortal Celestial Lord's body turned to ashes and scattered!</p><p></p><p>Hum! But the spear light followed the chains of heavenly and earthly laws and attacked.</p><p></p><p>Here is my translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's figure appeared once again before everyone's eyes.</p><p></p><p>"You think you can trap me? You think you can kill me?" Jiang Buping sneered coldly, thrusting out his spear and unleashing the divine techniques of Extreme Soul Martial Arts in succession.</p><p></p><p>Earlier, he had merged with the chains of natural law to assassinate the Immortal Venerable, using the opponent's body as cover to attack the other enemies. What he had employed was also one of the divine techniques of Extreme Soul Martial Arts.</p><p></p><p>The battle continued. </p><p></p><p>This was a slaughter, a brutal slaughter! In the distance from the great battle, two people were silently watching, their expressions both excited and somewhat pained.</p><p></p><p>"He's too strong. Even if we have to pay with many treasures for Jiang Buping, it's worth it!" one of them said in a deep voice.</p><p></p><p>"Then let's go with him. Hopefully he'll agree!"</p><p></p><p>"His cultivation must focus on the soul. That treasure should be able to move him."</p><p></p><p>"But that treasure, although related to the soul, cannot be melted or used. If he discovers this, how could he agree?"</p><p></p><p>"Jiang Buping's soul techniques must be incredibly powerful. Perhaps he can make use of that treasure? For a prodigy like him, as long as it's a powerful treasure, even if it's difficult to use, he won't give up and will try."</p><p></p><p>"That makes sense. Let's go with Jiang Buping then."</p><p></p><p>After finishing their discussion, the two silently watched, waiting for the great battle to end.</p><p></p><p>The battle had no suspense at all. Even though the attackers used many treasures, made meticulous preparations, and even desperately used secret techniques at the end, they could not change the outcome.</p><p></p><p>Until the last person, frightened and frantically fleeing, was killed with a spear thrust, the great battle had already ended.</p><p></p><p>All the attackers were completely annihilated, reduced to ashes! As another great battle concluded, Jiang Buping's expression remained calm, but he knew this would not be the last battle.</p><p></p><p>With this battle's end, future attackers would surely be stronger and better prepared. Only by killing until many powerful experts were shocked, until their spirits were shattered, until all who coveted were terrified, would this matter end.</p><p></p><p>This journey to the Taikun Realm was destined to be a path of slaughter.</p><p></p><p>"Extreme Soul Martial Arts is inherently a path of killing. Since that's the case, I'll temper myself through killing and grow stronger through slaughter."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's gaze was deep and calm.</p><p></p><p>He looked up in a certain direction, his figure moving in an instant, disappearing from where he stood. The next moment, he appeared before the two Immortal Venerables who had been watching.</p><p></p><p>"Hold on, young friend Jiang! We mean no harm!" The two powerful experts who had been watching were almost breaking out in cold sweat, not expecting Jiang Buping to discover them.</p><p></p><p>"Oh? No harm?" Jiang Buping raised an eyebrow.</p><p></p><p>"If you mean no harm, then leave."</p><p></p><p>These two had only been watching and indeed showed no signs of malicious intent. </p><p></p><p>Since they were not enemies, Jiang Buping was not one to kill indiscriminately.</p><p></p><p>"Young friend Jiang, we came here hoping to make a deal with you. What do you say?" One of them spoke up.</p><p></p><p>"A deal?" Jiang Buping's expression turned cold as he sneered contemptuously, "You really think I have some secret technique? Extreme Soul Martial Arts is not something people like you can cultivate."</p><p></p><p>"Young friend misunderstands. We didn't come for any so-called secret technique, but for a different deal."</p><p></p><p>"Not interested!" Jiang Buping shook his head. Since they weren't here to try to trade for some secret technique, there was nothing to discuss. If they had come to trade for secret techniques, he would have run them through with his spear!</p><p></p><p>"Wait, young friend, wait! The treasure for this deal will certainly satisfy you."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping paused and looked back, smiling, "What kind of treasure could satisfy me? Tell me, who are you two?"</p><p></p><p>"Certainly, certainly!" The two Immortal Venerables breathed sighs of relief.</p><p></p><p>The one who had been speaking said, "To be frank with you, we are elders of the Myriad Treasures Alliance. I am Hong Yi, and this is Hong Er."</p><p></p><p>Elders of the Myriad Treasures Alliance? Isn't that the force opposing Second Senior Brother?</p><p></p><p>"So you're elders of the Myriad Treasures Alliance. In that case, tell me, what kind of deal do you want to make? What treasure are you offering?"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping had some guesses in mind.</p><p></p><p>"This time, our Myriad Treasures Alliance is willing to offer a prized soul treasure from our collection, asking young friend Jiang to take action once."</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>"A soul treasure? Ordinary soul treasures don't interest me."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping became increasingly certain of his guesses.</p><p></p><p>"I naturally know this. But this soul treasure is extremely special. Even with our soul power, we cannot refine it. However, just by meditating near this soul treasure for a long time, one can enhance their soul power.</p><p></p><p>"This soul treasure was obtained from hunting an otherworldly true spirit in the Heavenly Abyss long ago. It's said to be the soul crystal of an otherworldly true spirit, yet it doesn't contain any indestructible qi..."</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi began to introduce this soul treasure.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Jiang Buping was immediately intrigued. Immortal Venerables couldn't use it, but he was an Extreme Soul Martial Artist. He could even use indestructible qi for cultivation, let alone a soul treasure.</p><p></p><p>And from what Hong Yi said, this soul treasure was quite unique, with properties similar to a special metal. If it could be refined into an Extreme Soul Divine Weapon, it should be able to enhance its power.</p><p></p><p>"...What do you think, young friend? Of course, besides this soul treasure, our Myriad Treasures Alliance will also pay an additional batch of treasures. If you have any other conditions, you can bring them up as well."</p><p></p><p>Hong Yi asked nervously.</p><p></p><p>"The conditions are not bad, and the soul treasure does tempt me. But who do you want me to deal with?" Jiang Buping pondered for a moment before asking.</p><p></p><p>Hearing this, Hong Yi was overjoyed and said, "Our Myriad Treasures Alliance wants to ask young friend to take action once against the Celestial God Meng Chong!"</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping's expression remained unchanged, confirming his guess. The Myriad Treasures Alliance had delayed their revenge, clearly wary of Second Senior Brother's strength. Now, after seeing his power, they had made this decision.</p><p></p><p>However, the Myriad Treasures Alliance didn't know that Meng Chong was his Second Senior Brother, and they were fellow disciples.</p><p></p><p>"Celestial God Meng Chong is very powerful. He's a formidable opponent. Let me think about it."</p><p></p><p>Jiang Buping didn't refuse immediately.</p><p></p><p>He took out a communication talisman and contacted his Second Senior Brother.</p><p></p><p>"Second Senior Brother, the Myriad Treasures Alliance has come to me, asking me to deal with you. They're willing to trade a soul treasure..."</p><p></p><p>"That's great, Fifth Junior Brother! Agree to it. We'll deal with the soul treasure once you have it."</p><p></p><p>"But Second Senior Brother, if I agree and then don't follow through, isn't that a bit..."</p><p></p><p>"It's a small matter. We can just have a sparring match when the time comes. You can tell them you'll take action but can't guarantee victory. When someone offers a treasure, why not take it? After we spar, I'll use that as an excuse to extort more from the Myriad Treasures Alliance. It's a win-win!"</p><p></p><p>Looking at the content on the communication talisman, Jiang Buping imagined Second Senior Brother's appearance. It was hard to imagine that Second Senior Brother, who looked like a brute, could be so quick-witted.</p><p></p><p>He put away the communication talisman and looked at Hong Yi and Hong Er, who were anxiously waiting. He said solemnly, "I can take action, but I can't guarantee victory. After all, you in the Myriad Treasures Alliance know the Celestial God's reputation. I can only say I'll do my best.</p><p></p><p>"Of course, the Myriad Treasures Alliance must give me the soul treasure first. Perhaps it can increase my strength a bit!"</p><p></p><p>(End of chapter)</p>

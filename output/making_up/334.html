        <div class="content">
            <p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>"Haha, I am Xie Lingfeng, and the time for my rise has come!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng, who was refining his sword intent, heard the manager's words and burst out laughing immediately.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu has actually come to find me!"</p><p></p><p>He leapt into the air and rushed towards the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng was stunned, Xu Yan has come? In that case, he wouldn't need to go to the Eighteen States?</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan? Could it be the Xu Yan from the Eighteen States?"</p><p></p><p>Fu Yun looked incredulous, then glared at Xie Tianheng and asked, "Are you and your son acquainted with Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>Xie Tianheng nodded and said, "Lingfeng's sword dao was passed down by Xu Yan, and the sword dao I cultivate is also from the same lineage; Lingfeng cultivates the martial dao of Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stood outside the Yuntian City Lord's Mansion and sighed, this Xie Tianheng indeed has some abilities, yet he is a kept man, and he doesn't know how he managed to marry Xie Lingfeng's mother.</p><p></p><p>The peerless spiritual sect Yuntian Bihai City's city lord's daughter actually married this inner domain martial artist, it is truly unbelievable.</p><p></p><p>Not to mention Fu Yun's past suitors, when Xu Yan came to Yuntian City and inquired about the whereabouts of the Bihai Sword King, he was told that he was in the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>The person's tone was full of disdain, although the Sword King was the number one sword dao martial artist in Bihai, he was a kept man, a real man would despise him, but Xu Yan could see that the other's eyes were full of envy.</p><p></p><p>Arriving at the Yuntian City Lord's Mansion, Xu Yan looked at the majestic mansion that was like a large city, and couldn't help but sigh, it is indeed the domain of the peerless spiritual sect.</p><p></p><p>Stating his purpose directly, Xu Yan then waited.</p><p></p><p>Soon, a figure flew over, it was the long-lost Xie Lingfeng.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's eyes were filled with tears, he could finally continue his cultivation, finally able to rise up again and subdue his former subordinates.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, long time no see!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan had a smile on his face.</p><p></p><p>"It's been years, I really miss it."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng sighed nostalgically.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, this is not the place to reminisce, let's go inside and catch up!"</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded.</p><p></p><p>Just as he was about to step forward and follow Xie Lingfeng into the city lord's mansion, a cold mocking voice suddenly came: "Well, well, if it isn't the son of the Sword King, the former sword dao prodigy Xie Lingfeng, so you dare to go out today?"</p><p></p><p>The other person emphasized the word "former".</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's expression immediately turned unsightly, and Xu Yan didn't even bother to turn his head, casually slapping backwards with his hand.</p><p></p><p>"I hate it the most when flies are buzzing in my ear."</p><p></p><p>Slap! The mocker was sent flying, crashing heavily to the ground, with half his face swollen.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile, as if he had just swatted a fly.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng was stunned for a moment, then revealed a smile, this was Xu Yan's style.</p><p></p><p>"Please!"</p><p></p><p>Leading Xu Yan into the city lord's mansion, he had a helpless expression on his face and said, "I'm sorry for letting you see that, that person has a decent background in Yuntian City, he once lost to me, and now his strength is stronger than mine, so he's become arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"No matter, Brother Xie will soon be able to crush him."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled.</p><p></p><p>As the city lord's grandson, Xie Lingfeng was actually still being mocked and ridiculed, it shows how fallen the prodigy Xie Lingfeng has become.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of Yuntian City are that elders generally don't interfere in the affairs of the younger generation, and the city lord's mansion is the same, especially among the major powers of Yuntian City, as long as it doesn't escalate to a life-and-death situation, the elders won't intervene."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng gave a bitter smile as he explained.</p><p></p><p>In order to avoid being beaten by his former subordinates, he had not left the city lord's mansion for a long time.</p><p></p><p>As the son of the Sword King and the city lord's grandson, he had a decent background, but also bore some pressure, being defeated meant losing the face of the city lord's mansion, and the strong forces of the city lord's mansion would not come out to seek justice for him.</p><p></p><p>"Xie Lingfeng, as the city lord's grandson, you actually tolerate someone openly attacking me, you are too arrogant! I challenge you, if you have the guts, come out and fight!"</p><p></p><p>"Hand over the culprit, in front of the city lord's mansion, openly attacking a prodigy, what crime is that? I beg the city lord's mansion to apprehend the perpetrator!"</p><p></p><p>Angry roars came from outside the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>The commotion was extremely loud.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan stopped in his tracks.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xu, don't bother with him, my mother will handle this matter."</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng said helplessly.</p><p></p><p>"A trivial matter, I'll take care of it myself, no need to trouble anyone!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said, turning around and walking back.</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng's mouth twitched, hurriedly following, he had a headache expression, looking around for his father and mother, why didn't they come to the rescue? With Xu Yan's temperament, he would only make the situation worse.</p><p></p><p>"General, there is someone committing violence at the city lord's mansion gate, openly defying Yuntian Bihai City, please uphold justice!"</p><p></p><p>"Yes, please uphold justice, General!"</p><p></p><p>Outside the city lord's mansion, a crowd had gathered.</p><p></p><p>They were mostly Xie Lingfeng's former subordinates and those with grievances against Xie Tianheng, seizing the opportunity to put pressure.</p><p></p><p>"You're looking for me?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan walked out of the city lord's mansion.</p><p></p><p>Outside the city lord's mansion, the crowd gathered, bustling and lively, most were there to watch the excitement.</p><p></p><p>The prodigy who was struck, now covering one swollen cheek with his hand, pointed at Xu Yan and shouted, "It's him, he committed violence right at the city lord's mansion gate, please, General, uphold justice!"</p><p></p><p>Slap! Before he could finish, he was slapped on the other cheek, his head almost twisted, completely dazed.</p><p></p><p>The rest were also stunned. Where did this violent person come from, actually daring to strike someone in front of the General!</p><p></p><p>"You, you're outrageous!"</p><p></p><p>The prodigy covered his face, feeling like his head had swollen up.</p><p></p><p>"Anyone else who's not satisfied? Step forward!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan coldly surveyed the clamoring crowd.</p><p></p><p>The area outside the city lord's mansion fell silent! So arrogant!</p><p></p><p>When has Yuntian City ever seen such an arrogant person, daring to make such bold statements at the city lord's mansion gate?</p><p></p><p>"General, as the leader responsible for maintaining order in the city lord's mansion, this person is so arrogant, won't you apprehend him? Where is the dignity of Yuntian City?"</p><p></p><p>The elder of the prodigy who was beaten, furious, spoke up.</p><p></p><p>The city lord's mansion General also had a helpless expression, why was this young man so arrogant? Not only did he strike someone, but he also spoke so boldly.</p><p></p><p>If he hadn't seen him with Xie Lingfeng, he would have already subdued and killed him on the spot.</p><p></p><p>But now, he could only step forward, as for how to punish him, he would leave it to the city lord to decide.</p><p></p><p>After all, this matter was somewhat related to his grandson.</p><p></p><p>"The rules of Yuntian City state that no one is allowed to fight, use violence, or harm others in front of the city lord's mansion. You have violated the rules of Yuntian City, come with me."</p><p></p><p>The General stepped forward, speaking righteously.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan glanced at him disdainfully and said, "Rules are just constraints for the weak, they have no effect on the strong. What kind of ridiculous rules are these, they don't apply to me!"</p><p></p><p>The crowd was stunned again.</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were dumbfounded, the General had stepped in, yet the other party still dared to be so arrogant?</p><p></p><p>Could it be that he was relying on his relationship with Xie Lingfeng? But that was the city lord's mansion General, the powerful figure who openly maintained the order of Yuntian City, and he actually dared to defy him?</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng also felt a bit uneasy, he secretly transmitted a message to Xu Yan, "Brother Xu, can you give me a glimpse of your strength? Can you handle it?"</p><p></p><p>Here is the full English translation of the Chinese excerpt:</p><p></p><p>Although he knew Xu Yan had the strength to do this, he still felt a bit uneasy in his heart.</p><p></p><p>"It's just a small matter, my strength is still good, I can easily beat your grandfather to the ground."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan transmitted back.</p><p></p><p>"That's good, that's good!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng let out a sigh of relief.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch chuckled, "Young man, rules are rules, how can you not follow them just because you are strong?"</p><p></p><p>"Rules are made by the strong to maintain order. Whether to follow them or not depends on the mood of the strong. Surely even your City Lord would follow these rules?"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan calmly said.</p><p></p><p>"Of course! Our City Lord has always been the one leading by example in following the rules!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch said solemnly.</p><p></p><p>Even if the City Lord could disregard the rules, he couldn't openly admit it.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan disdainfully said, "That's your City Lord, who hasn't encountered any provocation. If he did, and still insisted on following these rules, there can only be one reason."</p><p></p><p>"Oh, what reason?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch raised his brows, asking curiously.</p><p></p><p>"The reason is simple - your City Lord is too weak, that's why he can only weakly abide by the rules!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said indifferently.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch's scalp went numb, this young man's arrogance was beyond measure, he didn't even regard the City Lord. Didn't he know that the current City Lord was the strongest among the recent generations of City Lords?</p><p></p><p>The onlookers were dumbfounded, where did this young man come from? </p><p></p><p>To be so arrogant in front of the City Lord's manor, not even respecting the City Lord?</p><p></p><p>"You are outrageous! The City Lord's might is not something you can offend!"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch roared, his aura erupting, the powerful presence of a cultivator who had refined the laws of heaven and earth was evident.</p><p></p><p>He had originally wanted to stall for time, waiting for Xie Lingfeng's mother, the City Lord's beloved daughter Fu Yun, to come to the rescue. But instead, this young man had the audacity to offend the City Lord.</p><p></p><p>Now he had no choice but to take action.</p><p></p><p>"You are too weak, I advise you not to try to fight."</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan shook his head.</p><p></p><p>"The Grand Patriarch is weak?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch's face flushed with anger, raising his hand, he gathered a strand of the laws of heaven and earth into a giant hand that grabbed towards Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>"Young man, state your name, and let's see..."</p><p></p><p>Before the Grand Patriarch could finish, Xu Yan raised his hand and a sword beam suddenly shot out, slicing through the giant hand.</p><p></p><p>Immediately, Xu Yan took a step forward, his figure instantly appearing in front of the Grand Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Trouble!</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch's expression changed drastically, how could this youth's strength be so powerful? Looking at his age, he was only in his twenties! Letting out a roar, he struck out with both fists, his aura surging, three profound spiritual auras surrounding him as the laws of heaven and earth converged into a powerful attack.</p><p></p><p>But Xu Yan remained calm, his palm reaching out, like a mountain and river covering everything, in an instant a mountain and river appeared, completely enveloping the Grand Patriarch's attack, then directly covering the Grand Patriarch.</p><p></p><p>Boom!</p><p></p><p>At this moment, the Grand Patriarch was shocked to find that he could no longer condense the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>It was as if there was a barrier blocking him! Unless he broke through this barrier, he could not gather the laws of heaven and earth!</p><p></p><p>What kind of cultivation method was this? Before he could devise a countermeasure, a hand had already reached out and grabbed his collar, lifting him up.</p><p></p><p>"I told you, you are too weak."</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch's face flushed red, his entire strength completely constrained, without any ability to resist.</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan nodded in satisfaction, his guess was correct. Directly using the sword intent of the mountain and river to form a mountain river barrier, he could greatly weaken the strength of the Spiritual Realm cultivators by blocking their ability to condense the laws of heaven and earth.</p><p></p><p>Even if it could only block for an instant, that instant was enough to decide victory or defeat, life or death.</p><p></p><p>Of course, this was also because Xu Yan's mountain river sword dao had already become extremely powerful and refined, allowing him to do this. It was also because the Grand Patriarch had underestimated him and did not expect the laws of heaven and earth to be blocked.</p><p></p><p>From the Grand Patriarch's attack to being captured by Xu Yan, it happened in the blink of an eye.</p><p></p><p>By the time the onlookers regained their senses, they were all shocked.</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch had actually been captured? And seemingly without any ability to resist!</p><p></p><p>Who was this young man, and why did he have such powerful strength? Even the genius who was covering his swollen cheek was dumbfounded, the pain no longer bothering him, because even the Grand Patriarch was powerless, what was he in comparison? Surviving was already him being spared.</p><p></p><p>"Sir, who are you?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch asked with a black face.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Deity Xu Yan!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan smiled calmly.</p><p></p><p>Holding the Grand Patriarch and Xie Lingfeng, he entered the City Lord's manor, casually releasing them.</p><p></p><p>"Brother Xie, let's go!"</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan said with a smile.</p><p></p><p>"Okay!"</p><p></p><p>Xie Lingfeng nodded.</p><p></p><p>In his heart, he marveled, Xu Yan was truly remarkable, whether in the inner realm or now in the Spiritual Realm, his strength was unparalleled and unstoppable.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Deity Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>The Grand Patriarch was stunned, then his scalp went numb as he thought of a certain person.</p><p></p><p>The one who had once blocked the gate of the Thousand Sword Hall to issue a challenge, and even openly seized the Thousand Sword Hall's divine artifact, the Cold Absolute Blade - the peerless genius.</p><p></p><p>He had actually come to the Cloud Sky City? And directly beat someone up in the City Lord's manor!</p><p></p><p>This was very much in line with the other's style of behavior. Back then, he had dared to block the Thousand Sword Hall's gate to issue a challenge, and now after a few years, his strength had become even more terrifying. Beating someone up in the City Lord's manor was nothing.</p><p></p><p>Outside the City Lord's manor, the onlookers were all stunned.</p><p></p><p>"Sword Deity Xu Yan? If the Sword King hears this name, won't he be furious?"</p><p></p><p>Someone muttered.</p><p></p><p>"You don't understand, Sword Deity Xu Yan is the peerless genius of the Eighteen States. Back then, he blocked the Thousand Sword Hall's gate to issue a challenge, and right in front of the Thousand Sword Hall's experts, he seized their divine artifact!"</p><p></p><p>"I see, no wonder he's so arrogant, it's actually Xu Yan."</p><p></p><p>"In fact, I had already guessed it. Looking at the Spiritual Realm, apart from Xu Yan, I can't think of anyone else who would be so arrogant."</p><p></p><p>"Xu Yan has actually come to the Cloud Sky City, and seems to have a deep friendship with the reclusive genius Xie Lingfeng. This is going to be interesting."</p><p></p><p>"Do you think the City Lord will try to suppress Xu Yan?"</p><p></p><p>"No, the City Lord won't do that. If he succeeds in suppressing Xu Yan, he'll be ridiculed for bullying the weak. If he fails, he'll lose face. He won't take that risk."</p><p></p><p>"You dare to question the City Lord's strength!"</p><p></p><p>...</p><p></p><p>Xu Yan, who claimed to be the supreme sword dao under heaven, who had blocked the Thousand Sword Hall's gate to issue a challenge, and seized their divine artifact right in front of their experts without regard for the rules, had come to the Cloud Sky Cyan Sea City!</p><p></p><p>The news instantly swept across the four corners, spreading throughout the Cloud Sky Cyan Sea City.</p><p></p><p>Gradually, there were even rumors that Xu Yan had come to suppress the Cyan Sea geniuses, to tell the Spiritual Realm that the geniuses were beneath him! Upon hearing the news, the Cyan Sea geniuses were in an uproar.</p><p></p><p>However, Xu Yan's strength in capturing the Grand Patriarch made many Cyan Sea geniuses deflated, they really couldn't beat him. But there were still some geniuses who were unwilling to accept it, wanting to challenge Xu Yan.</p><p></p><p>I couldn't hold out, so there's only one update today. (This chapter ends)</p>
